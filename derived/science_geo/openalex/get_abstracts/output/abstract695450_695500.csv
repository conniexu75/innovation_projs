SPR1NT ( NCT03505099 ), a Phase III, multicenter, single-arm trial, investigated the efficacy and safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec for presymptomatic children with biallelic SMN1 mutations treated within six postnatal weeks. Of 15 children with three SMN2 copies treated before symptom onset, all stood independently before 24 months (P < 0.0001; 14 within normal developmental window), and 14 walked independently (P < 0.0001; 11 within normal developmental window). All survived without permanent ventilation at 14 months; ten (67%) maintained body weight (≥3rd WHO percentile) without feeding support through 24 months; and none required nutritional or respiratory support. No serious adverse events were considered treatment-related by the investigator. Onasemnogene abeparvovec was effective and well-tolerated for presymptomatic infants at risk of SMA type 2, underscoring the urgency of early identification and intervention."

Here, we report final results for 14 children with two copies of SMN2 , expected to develop spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1. Efficacy was compared with a matched Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research natural-history cohort ( n = 23). All 14 enrolled infants sat independently for ≥30 seconds at any visit ≤18 months (Bayley-III item #26; P &lt; 0.001; 11 within the normal developmental window). All survived without permanent ventilation at 14 months as per protocol; 13 maintained body weight (≥3rd WHO percentile) through 18 months. No child used nutritional or respiratory support. No serious adverse events were considered related to treatment by the investigator. Onasemnogene abeparvovec was effective and well-tolerated for children expected to develop SMA type 1, highlighting the urgency for universal newborn screening."

Failure of PTA expression causes multiorgan autoimmunity. By assaying chromatin accessibility in individual mTECs, we uncovered signatures of lineage-defining transcription factors (TFs) for skin, lung, liver, and intestinal cells-including Grhl, FoxA, FoxJ1, Hnf4, Sox8, and SpiB-in distinct mTEC subtypes. Transcriptomic and histologic analyses showed that these subtypes, which we collectively term mimetic cells, expressed PTAs in a biologically logical fashion, mirroring extra-thymic cell types while maintaining mTEC identity. Lineage-defining TFs bound to mimetic-cell open chromatin regions and were required for mimetic cell accumulation, whereas the tolerogenic factor Aire was partially and variably required. Expression of a model antigen in mimetic cells sufficed to induce cognate T cell tolerance. Thus, mTECs co-opt lineage-defining TFs to drive mimetic cell accumulation, PTA expression, and self-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W4283069865,"cAMP and antimicrobial susceptibility in mycobacteriaAntimicrobial tolerance, the ability to survive exposure to antimicrobials via transient nonspecific means, promotes the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The study of the molecular mechanisms that result in antimicrobial tolerance is therefore essential for the understanding of AMR. In gram-negative bacteria, the second messenger molecule 3′’,5′’-cAMP has been previously shown to be involved in AMR. In mycobacteria, however, the role of cAMP in antimicrobial tolerance has been difficult to probe due to its particular complexity. In order to address this difficulty, here, through unbiased biochemical approaches consisting in the fractionation of clear protein lysate from a mycobacterial strain deleted for the known cAMP phosphodiesterase (Rv0805c) combined with mass spectrometry techniques, we identified a novel cyclic nucleotide-degrading phosphodiesterase enzyme (Rv1339) and developed a system to significantly decrease intracellular cAMP levels through plasmid expression of Rv1339 using the constitutive expression system, pVV16. In Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, we demonstrate that recombinant expression of Rv1339 reduced cAMP levels threefold and resulted in altered gene expression, impaired bioenergetics, and a disruption in peptidoglycan biosynthesis leading to decreased tolerance to antimicrobials that target cell wall synthesis such as ethambutol, D-cycloserine, and vancomycin. This work increases our understanding of the role of cAMP in mycobacterial antimicrobial tolerance, and our observations suggest that nucleotide signaling may represent a new target for the development of antimicrobial therapies. cAMP and antimicrobial susceptibility in mycobacteriaAntimicrobial tolerance, the ability to survive exposure to antimicrobials via transient nonspecific means, promotes the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Along with climate change and viral pandemics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the greatest threats to human health. AMR is preceded by antimicrobial tolerance (1Brauner A.

Moreover, Kary et al. reported that S. typhimurium strains with altered levels of cAMP or lacking Crp, a cAMP-activated global transcriptional regulator, exhibit reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones as a result of decreased permeability and increased efflux (10Kary S.C.

This lack of knowledge is partially due to the complexity of the mycobacterial cAMP signaling system, as well as to the lack of effective tools to manipulate it (11Johnson R.M. McDonough K.A.

New messages from old messengers: cAMP and mycobacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 543-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli has only one enzyme that generates cAMP, the adenylate cyclase Cya, and a single enzyme that hydrolyzes cAMP, the phosphodiesterase (PDE) CpdA(16). In contrast, the genome of the M. tuberculosis type strain H37Rv encodes 16 proteins predicted to have adenylate cyclase activity. Compared to E. coli Cya, which comprises one regulatory and one catalytic domain, mycobacterial adenylate cyclases can contain different regulatory domains, transmembrane regions, and even other enzymatic domains (15Shenoy A.R.

As for cAMP degradation, only one mycobacterial PDE, encoded by rv0805, has been reported. However, rv0805 is a gene only found in M. tuberculosis and very closely related species (17Matange N.

C.3' : 5'-Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1978; 107: 177-181Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an additional PDE that is likely more ubiquitous in the mycobacterial genus. This expectation is supported by the fact that Rv0805 is more active toward 2′,3′-cAMP, which arises from RNA degradation, than toward the bona fide second messenger 3′,5′-cAMP (22, 24). The high number of cAMP-producing enzymes and the poor activity of the known PDE complicate the manipulation of the mycobacterial cAMP signaling and have crippled the investigation of its contribution to AMR and/or antimicrobial tolerance.To tackle this challenge, we searched for a molecular tool that would allow us to efficiently decrease intracellular cAMP levels. The currently available exogenous strategies for altering cAMP levels, including the use of an adenylate cyclase activator (forskolin) and analogs such as dibutyryl-cAMP, only result in modest changes in intracellular cAMP levels (23Kaur H. Khuller G.K. Role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in phospholipid synthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 607.Lipids. 1995; 30: 345-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Choudhary E. Bishai W. Agarwal N. Expression of a subset of heat stress induced genes of mycobacterium tuberculosis is regulated by 3',5'-cyclic AMP.PLoS One. 2014; 9e89759Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, expression of the known PDE (Rv0805) in the laboratory strain M. smegmatis mc2155 leads to only a ∼0.2-fold decrease in cAMP levels (18Matange N. Podobnik M. Visweswariah S.S. The non-catalytic ""cap domain"" of a mycobacterial metallophosphoesterase regulates its expression and localization in the cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 22470-22481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Instead, we focused on finding the “missing” conserved PDE using a combination of classical biochemical approaches and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. With this strategy, we identified Rv1339, an uncharacterized cyclic nucleotide PDE that is ubiquitous in mycobacteria. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Rv1339 is a member of a poorly characterized group of PDE enzymes with a metallo-β-lactamase fold that is present in several bacterial phyla. This group is distinct from, but evolutionarily related to, the typical class-II PDEs, a small group of PDEs mainly found in unicellular eukaryotes (25Richter W. 3',5' cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases class III: members, structure, and catalytic mechanism.Proteins. 2002; 46: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Plasmid expression of Rv1339 in M. smegmatis mc2155 led to a threefold decrease in intracellular cAMP levels. By examining the bacterial transcriptome, metabolome, and bioenergetics, we observed that Rv1339 activity resulted in changes in gene expression, altered bioenergetics, and disrupted peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis, leading to a decrease in tolerance specific to antimicrobials that target cell wall assembly. These findings raise the possibility that cAMP signaling can be a promising new target for the development of compounds that inhibit antimicrobial tolerance in mycobacteria.Results and discussionRv1339 is a cyclic nucleotide-specific, atypical class-II PDETo identify novel sources of cyclic nucleotide PDE activity in mycobacteria, we used an unbiased biochemical approach involving the sequential fractionation of M. bovis BCG Δrv0805 lysate coupled to a TLC-based cAMP PDE activity assay (22H., L. C.3' : 5'-Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1978; 107: 177-181Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 26Ganapathy U. Marrero J. Calhoun S. Eoh H. de Carvalho L.P. Rhee K. et al.Two enzymes with redundant fructose bisphosphatase activity sustain gluconeogenesis and virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The enrichment of cAMP PDE activity was achieved through two chromatography steps that separated proteins first according to their charge and then based on their molecular weight (Fig. S1). After the first purification step, the active fractions were identified and pooled before the second step. Subsequently, trypsin digestion and proteomic analysis were used to identify the proteins present in the second set of active fractions. Out of eight proteins that were uniquely present in the active fractions, three were uncharacterized proteins: Rv0250, Rv2568, and Rv1339. Saturating transposon mutagenesis has shown that rv0250, rv2568, and rv1339 are all nonessential for growth in vitro (27DeJesus M.A. Gerrick E.R. Xu W. Park S.W. Long J.E. Boutte C.C. et al.Comprehensive essentiality analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome via saturating transposon mutagenesis.MBio. 2017; 8e02133-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, rv1339 is necessary for persistence in the mouse model (28Bellerose M.M. Proulx M.K. Smith C.M. Baker R.E. Ioerger T.R. Sassetti C.M. Distinct bacterial pathways influence the efficacy of antibiotics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.mSystems. 2020; 5e00396-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rv1339 was annotated to have hydrolase activity and we found orthologs of the rv1339 in most of the mycobacterial genomes we analyzed. We therefore decided to focus on the characterization of Rv1339.Literature mining and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Rv1339, YfhI from Bacillus subtilis (29Na H.W. Namgung B. Song W.S. Yoon S.I. Structural and biochemical analyses of the metallo-beta-lactamase fold protein YhfI from Bacillus subtilis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 519: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and CpdA from Corynebacterium glutamicum (30Schulte J. Baumgart M. Bott M. Identification of the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA as novel key player in cAMP-dependent regulation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 103: 534-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) are representatives of a previously unrecognized class of PDEs defined by the signature metal-binding motif [T/S]HXHXDH, where X tends to be a hydrophobic, small or very small residue. This motif is reminiscent of the bona fide class-II PDE motif HXHLDH(27), and indeed, the two families are evolutionarily related—belonging to the metallohydrolase/oxidoreductase superfamily (SSF56281). We propose to name this novel group atypical class-II PDEs. Interestingly, atypical class-II PDEs are closely related and might have evolved from the ribonuclease-Z family of proteins involved in the maturation of tRNA (Fig. 1A).To generate a catalytically inactive form of Rv1339, we built a 3D structure homology model of Rv1339 to inform our site-directed mutagenesis efforts (Fig. 1B) (31Liu H. Naismith J.H. An efficient one-step site-directed deletion, insertion, single and multiple-site plasmid mutagenesis protocol.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Based on this model, we chose to mutate to an alanine the aspartate residue at position 180 (D180A), as this residue appears to be involved in the binding of both divalent metal ions in the metal-binding site (Fig. 1C). An aspartate residue at this position has been described in the literature as being required for the activity of other metallo-β-lactamase proteins (32Meini M.R. Llarrull L.I. Vila A.J. Overcoming differences: the catalytic mechanism of metallo-beta-lactamases.FEBS Lett. 2015; 589: 3419-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a replicative plasmid under the control of the moderate constitutive promoter hsp60, the different constructs generated in this study were successfully expressed in M. smegmatis mc2155 (Fig. 1D).To study the substrate specificity of Rv1339, we attempted to clone, express, and purify the enzyme. Unfortunately, despite the use of several different expression systems, our attempts to generate enough homogeneous purified enzyme were unsuccessful. We therefore resorted to measure nucleotide hydrolysis using cell-free extracts of the pVV16 (empty vector) control, Rv1339-expressing and Rv1339 D180A-expressing M. smegmatis mc2155 strains (Fig. 1D). Their relative activity in hydrolyzing the chosen nucleotides was measured by LC-MS after 30 min of incubation of each one of the nucleotides at a final concentration of 10 μM with 30 μg of cell-free extract. Values were compared to those of an aliquot taken at 0 min. Based on the literature (21Shenoy A.R. Sreenath N. Podobnik M. Kovacevic M. Visweswariah S.S.

As seen in Figure 1E, after 30 min of incubation, the levels of 2′,3′-cAMP and 3′,5′-cAMP were barely detectable in the Rv1339-expressing strain, while these levels in the control strain transformed with the empty vector were decreased only by 40%, a decrease we attributed to the activity of endogenous PDEs. Importantly, the cAMP hydrolyzing activity of the Rv1339 D180A-expressing strain was comparable to that of the empty vector control, indicative that Rv1339 D180A is indeed catalytically inactive. A similar result was obtained for 3′,5′-cGMP and 2′,3′-cCMP. No catalytic activity was observed toward ATP, ADP, AMP, UMP, c-di-AMP, or c-di-GMP.Our data show that Rv1339 is a cyclic nucleotide PDE with broad specificity, as has been reported for other cyclic nucleotide PDEs (21Shenoy A.R.

The strain expressing Rv1339, but not the strain expressing Rv1339 D180A or the empty vector control, displayed a minor growth decrease of approximately 30% when cultured in 7H9 medium supplemented with glucose and glycerol carbon sources (Fig. 2A and Table S1). These results suggest that Rv1339 constitutive expression negatively affects bacterial physiology.Figure 2Expression of Rv1339 in M. smegmatis mc2155 compromises growth, depletes cAMP, and redirects bioenergetics toward ATP synthesis.

Increased AEC and NADH/NAD+ ratios in the Rv1339-expressing strain indicate a shift toward synthesis of ATP.

Larrouy-Maumus G. NaCl triggers the CRP-dependent increase of cAMP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2019; 116: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In agreement with the in vitro results with cell-free extracts (Fig. 1E), the expression of Rv1339 led to a 3.2-fold decrease in the intracellular cAMP levels, but no decrease in the intracellular c-di-AMP levels was observed (Fig. 2B). We also measured the incorporation of 13C through [U-13C6]-glucose and [U-13C3]-glycerol stable isotope tracing and found a twofold increase in turnover of cAMP at 0.5 doubling time (Fig. S2A), suggesting that the Rv1339-expressing strain exhibits higher cAMP turnover than the empty vector control strain. These experiments show that when expressed in M. smegmatis mc2155, Rv1339 possesses cAMP PDE activity in vivo.As cAMP is synthesized from ATP by the action of adenylate cyclases, we hypothesized that altered cAMP levels caused by the expression of Rv1339 would compromise M. smegmatis bioenergetics and alter the AXP (ATP, ADP, and AMP) pool. Therefore, a multipronged approach was used to investigate the effects of decreased intracellular cAMP levels on bacterial bioenergetics. Seahorse XFP analysis was used to determine the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (44Cumming B.M. Rahman M.A. Lamprecht D.A. Rohde K.H. Saini V.

SPI-2 gene products also protect Salmonella against the antimicrobial activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesized by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). However, a potential relationship between inflammatory ROS and the activation of transcription of SPI-2 genes by intracellular Salmonella is unclear. Here, we show that ROS engendered in the innate host response stimulate SPI-2 gene transcription. We found that the expression of SPI-2 genes in Salmonella-sustaining oxidative stress conditions involves DksA, a protein otherwise known to regulate the stringent response of bacteria to nutritional stress. We also demonstrate that the J and zinc-2-oxidoreductase domains of DnaJ as well as the ATPase activity of the DnaK chaperone facilitate loading of DksA onto RNA polymerase complexed with SPI-2 promoters. Furthermore, the DksA-driven transcription of SPI-2 genes in Salmonella experiencing oxidative stress is contingent on upstream OmpR, PhoP, and SsrB signaling events that participate in the removal of nucleoid proteins while simultaneously recruiting RNA polymerase to SPI-2 promoter regions. Taken together, our results suggest the activation of SPI-2 gene transcription in Salmonella subjected to ROS produced by the respiratory burst of macrophages protects this intracellular pathogen against NOX2-mediated killing. We propose that Salmonella have co-opted inflammatory ROS to induce SPI-2-mediated protective responses against NOX2 host defenses.

The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium causes countless cases of gastroenteritis around the world annually. Nontyphoidal serovars such as Typhimurium are also responsible for disseminated life-threatening systemic infections in people suffering from HIV or malarial comorbidities (1Gordon M.A. Banda H.T.

The pathogenicity of nontyphoidal salmonellae is greatly reliant on the vacuolar remodeling attributes of the type III secretion system encoded within the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2) gene cluster. Induction of SPI-2 genes primes the transition of this enteropathogen from an extracellular location in the gastrointestinal lumen to the intracellular niche of host cells (6Perez-Morales D.

SPI-2 transcription is induced in response to elevated proton concentrations and diminished Mg2+ levels, both of which are signatures of phagosomes and Salmonella-containing vacuoles (11Rathman M.

Host resistance factor SLC11A1 restricts Salmonella growth through magnesium deprivation.Science. 2019; 366: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Expression of the 40 kb gene cluster encoding the ssrAB regulon, secretion apparatus, translocon, chaperones, and effectors, as well as substrate proteins encoded outside the SPI-2 pathogenicity island, imposes a considerable metabolic toll on Salmonella. Thus, Salmonella must tightly regulate transcription of this pathogenicity island. The combined actions of nucleoid proteins and transcriptional activators result in the timely expression of SPI-2 genes by Salmonella. Gene silencing, which is mediated through binding of homologous H-NS, YgdT, and Haa nucleoid proteins along extensive areas of noncoding and coding regions of the ssrA regulatory locus, is vital for the contextual expression of SPI-2 genes (13Fass E. Groisman E.A. Control of Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 gene expression.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Coombes B.K. Wickham M.E. Lowden M.J.

On the other hand, PhoP–PhoQ, OmpR–EnvZ, and PhoB–PhoR two-component systems responding to acidic pH, osmolarity, or shortages in Mg2+ or inorganic phosphorous activate SPI-2 gene transcription (15Jiang L.

The SsrB response regulator activates transcription by counteracting H-NS silencing, while simultaneously recruiting RNA polymerase to SPI-2 genes (22Walthers D. Li Y. Liu Y. Anand G. Yan J.

In addition to the hierarchical control emanating from interactions of traditional transcription factors to regulatory SPI-2 DNA regions, the SPI-2 locus is also operated at the level of transcription initiation. The combined actions of the nucleotide alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and the α-helical protein DksA on the kinetics of DNA–RNA polymerase open complexes favor SPI-2 gene transcription (23Tapscott T.

Historically, DksA and ppGpp have been known for their participation in the stringent response, an adaptation to nutritional stress that is typified by the activation of amino acid biosynthetic genes and the repression of loci encoding translational machinery (26Gourse R.L.

Thus, placing SPI-2 transcription under the control of ppGpp and DksA may assist with the adaptation of Salmonella to transient nutritional scarcities within host cells. In addition to responding to nutritional shortages, the stringent response is emerging as a key regulator of antioxidant defense in diverse bacterial pathogens (27Henard C.A. Bourret T.J. Song M.

The resulting disulfide bonds unfold the globular domain, triggering interactions of DksA with the DnaJ cochaperone (33Kim J.S. Liu L. Fitzsimmons L.F. Wang Y.

Our investigations demonstrate that the DnaJ chaperone enables the ROS-dependent formation of DksA–RNA polymerase–SPI-2-gene ternary complexes and thus fosters the expression of SPI-2 regulatory and effector genes in intracellular Salmonella exposed to NOX2 oxidative products. We examined whether Salmonella modulate SPI-2 gene transcription after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an ROS synthesized by host phagocytes in response to this facultative intracellular pathogen (42Vazquez-Torres A. Jones-Carson J. Mastroeni P. Ischiropoulos H. Fang F.C. Antimicrobial actions of the NADPH phagocyte oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase in experimental salmonellosis. I. Effects on microbial killing by activated peritoneal macrophages in vitro.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Salmonella activated expression of the SPI-2 sifA::lacZY reporter construct in response to increasing concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 1A). Under the experimental conditions tested, H2O2 did not affect Salmonella growth (Fig. S1A). The concentration of molecular oxygen (O2) in phagosomes has been estimated at 11 μM (43James P.E. Grinberg O.Y. Michaels G. Swartz H.M. Intraphagosomal oxygen in stimulated macrophages.J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 163: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of the enzymatic activity of both host NOX2 and Salmonella terminal cytochromes, it is possible that the cytoplasm of intracellular Salmonella is exposed to products of NOX2 under hypoxic or anaerobic conditions. Moreover, a sizable fraction of DksA is oxidized in Salmonella cultures grown aerobically in a shaker incubator (33Kim J.S. Liu L. Fitzsimmons L.F. Wang Y. Crawford M.A. Mastrogiovanni M. et al.DksA-DnaJ redox interactions provide a signal for the activation of bacterial RNA polymerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E11780-E11789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Taking into account the lines of reasoning, to examine in more detail whether exogenous H2O2 can induce DksA-dependent activation of SPI-2 gene transcription, we developed an anaerobic culture system. Anaerobic Salmonella failed to grow on N9 medium in the absence of an added terminal electron acceptor (Fig. S1B), likely because the growth of Enterobacteriaceae on casamino acids, the sole carbon source in the N9 minimum medium used in our experiments, relies on the electron transport chain (44Jones-Carson J. Yahashiri A. Kim J.S. Liu L. Fitzsimmons L.F. Weiss D.S. et al.Nitric oxide disrupts bacterial cytokinesis by poisoning purine metabolism.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaaz0260Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the addition of the terminal electron acceptor NO3− supported growth of anaerobic Salmonella in N9 medium (Fig. S1C). Therefore, the N9 medium used in all subsequent anaerobic experiments contained NO3−. Compared with aerobic cultures (Figs. S1, D and E), the downshift of anaerobic Salmonella to 8 μM MgCl2 N9 medium, pH 5.8, stimulated modest levels of transcription of both ssrB and sifA SPI-2 genes (Fig. 1, B and C). The expression of ssrB and sifA was stimulated upon treatment of anaerobic cultures grown in 8 μM MgCl2 N9 medium with increasing concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 1, B and C). The concentrations of H2O2 used in our assays are in keeping with the 1 to 17 μM H2O2 that are estimated to be synthesized in phagosomes (45Burton N.A. Schurmann N. Casse O. Steeb A.K. Claudi B.

Oxidative stress.EcoSal Plus. 2009; 3https://doi.org/10.1128/ecosalplus.5.4.4Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with the transcriptional findings, H2O2 treatment of Salmonella in SPI-2-inducing N9 medium in an anaerobic chamber also resulted in the accumulation of SsrB protein (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that exogenous H2O2 triggers expression of SPI-2 genes. H2O2 did not trigger either ssrB or sifA transcription in Salmonella grown anaerobically in 10 mM Mg2+ N9 medium, pH 8.0 (Figs. 2A and S2A). In contrast, H2O2 activated significant SPI-2 transcription in anaerobic Salmonella grown under 8 μM Mg2+-inducing conditions (Figs. 2A and S2A). These findings suggest that H2O2 potentiates the transcription of SPI-2 genes induced in response to the downshift in the concentration of Mg2+. Next, we determined the molecular mechanism underlying the H2O2-induced transcription of SPI-2 genes. Because DksA is a critical determinant in the expression of SPI-2 genes (23Tapscott T. Kim J.S.

Dactylorhiza hatagirea (D.Don) Soo is an important yet highly threatened medicinal orchid from the Himalayan region. Poor regenerative power and growing demand have resulted in the steep decline of its natural habitats populations. The present study aims to identify the habitat suitability of D. hatagirea in the Western Himalaya using the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). The community climate system model (CCSM ver. 4) based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) was used to determine suitable future areas. Sixteen least correlated (< 0.8) bioclimatic, topographical and geomorphic variables were used to construct the species climatic niche. The dominant contributing variables were elevation (34.85%) followed by precipitation of the coldest quarter (23.04%), soil type (8.77%), land use land cover (8.26%), mean annual temperature (5.51%), and temperature seasonality (5.11%). Compared to the present distribution, habitat suitability under future projection, i.e., RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (2050 and 2070), was found to shift to higher elevation towards the northwest direction, while lower altitudes will invariably be less suitable. Further, as compared to the current distribution, the climatic niche space of the species is expected to expand in between11.41-22.13% in the near future. High habitats suitability areas are mainly concentrated in the forest range like Dharchula and Munsyari range, Pindar valley, Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, West of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, and Uttarkashi forest division. The present study delineated the fundamental niche baseline map of D. hatagirea in the Western Himalayas and highlighted regions/areas where conservation and management strategies should be intensified in the next 50 years. In addition, as the species is commercially exploited illegally, the information gathered is essential for conservationists and planners who protect the species at the regional levels."
https://openalex.org/W4283030265,"Background While many factors are associated with stepping activity after stroke, there is significant variability across studies. One potential reason to explain this variability is that there are certain characteristics that are necessary to achieve greater stepping activity that differ from others that may need to be targeted to improve stepping activity. Objective Using two step thresholds (2500 steps/day, corresponding to home vs. community ambulation and 5500 steps/day, corresponding to achieving physical activity guidelines through walking), we applied 3 different algorithms to determine which predictors are most important to achieve these thresholds. Methods We analyzed data from 268 participants with stroke that included 25 demographic, performance-based and self-report variables. Step 1 of our analysis involved dimensionality reduction using lasso regularization. Step 2 applied drop column feature importance to compute the mean importance of each variable. We then assessed which predictors were important to all 3 mathematically unique algorithms. Results The number of relevant predictors was reduced from 25 to 7 for home vs. community and from 25 to 16 for aerobic thresholds. Drop column feature importance revealed that 6 Minute Walk Test and speed modulation were the only variables found to be important to all 3 algorithms ( primary characteristics) for each respective threshold. Other variables related to readiness to change activity behavior and physical health, among others, were found to be important to one or two algorithms ( ancillary characteristics) . Conclusions Addressing physical capacity is necessary but not sufficient to achieve important step thresholds, as ancillary characteristics , such as readiness to change activity behavior and physical health may also need to be targeted. This delineation may explain heterogeneity across studies examining predictors of stepping activity in stroke."
https://openalex.org/W4283033120,"Heart valve disease is a growing problem worldwide. Though very common in older adults, the mechanisms behind the development of the disease aren't well understood, and at present the only therapeutic option is valve replacement. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) may hold the answer. These cells can undergo pathological differentiation into contractile myofibroblasts or osteoblasts, leading to thickening and calcification of the valve tissue. Our study aimed to characterise the effect of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) on the differentiation potential of VICs. We isolated VICs from diseased human valves and treated these cells with FGF-2 and TGF-β to elucidate effect of these growth factors on several myofibroblastic outcomes, in particular immunocytochemistry and gene expression. We used TGF-β as a positive control for myofibroblastic differentiation. We found that FGF-2 promotes a 'quiescent-type' morphology and inhibits the formation of α-smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblasts. FGF-2 reduced the calcification potential of VICs, with a marked reduction in the number of calcific nodules. FGF-2 interrupted the 'canonical' TGF-β signalling pathway, reducing the nuclear translocation of the SMAD2/3 complex. The panel of genes assayed revealed that FGF-2 promoted a quiescent-type pattern of gene expression, with significant downregulations in typical myofibroblast markers α smooth muscle actin, extracellular matrix proteins, and scleraxis. We did not see evidence of osteoblast differentiation: neither matrix-type calcification nor changes in osteoblast associated gene expression were observed. Our findings show that FGF-2 can reverse the myofibroblastic phenotype of VICs isolated from diseased valves and inhibit the calcification potential of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W4283069918,"Consumption of fructose-containing beverages such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is increasing, raising concerns about the negative effects of excessive fructose intake. A recent report indicated that excess HFCS intake impairs hippocampal function. In this study, we focused on neurotrophic factors (NFs) in the hippocampus from the viewpoint of epigenetics to clarify the adverse effects of fructose. We analyzed the effects of HFCS intake on hippocampal function in three age categories: childhood and adolescence (postnatal day (PD) 21–60), young adulthood (PD60-100), and late adulthood (PD100-140). For the experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three age categories, the control group was received distilled water and the HFCS group was received 20% HFCS solution for 40 days in each period. We analyzed mRNA and protein levels for qPCR and western blotting, respectively, of a hippocampal NF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). HFCS consumption reduced hippocampal Bdnf mRNA and protein expressions in childhood and adolescence. Moreover, pyrosequencing assays revealed increased DNA methylation at the Bdnf promoter in childhood and adolescence. This Bdnf levels reduction may be due to hypermethylation of the promoter regions. It should be noted that this phenomenon was observed only in childhood and adolescence fructose consumption. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of the hippocampus to fructose may vary with age. This study provides insight into the adverse effects of excessive HFCS consumption on the hippocampus in children."
https://openalex.org/W4283073942,"N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A) is the most abundant mRNA modification affecting diverse biological processes. However, the functions and precise mechanisms of m6 A signaling in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neurogenesis-related depression remain largely enigmatic. We found that depletion of Mettl3 or Mettl14 in neural stem cells (NSCs) dramatically reduced m6 A abundance, proliferation, and neuronal genesis, coupled with enhanced glial differentiation. Conversely, overexpressing Mettl3 promoted proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Mechanistically, the m6 A modification of Lrp2 mRNA by Mettl3 enhanced its stability and translation efficiency relying on the reader protein Ythdc2, which in turn promoted neurogenesis. Importantly, mice lacking Mettl3 manifested reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, which could contribute to spatial memory decline, and depression-like behaviors. We found that these defective behaviors were notably reversed by Lrp2 overexpression. Moreover, Mettl3 overexpression in the hippocampus of depressive mice rescues behavioral defects. Our findings uncover the biological role of m6 A modification in Lrp2-mediated neurogenesis via m6 A-binding protein Ythdc2, and propose a rationale that targeting Mettl3-Ythdc2-Lrp2 axis regulation of neurogenesis might serve as a promising antidepressant strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4282831939,"Copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are redox-active metals that serve as cofactors for many essential cellular enzymes. Disruption in the intracellular homeostasis of these metals results in debilitating and frequently fatal human disorders, such as Menkes disease and Friedreich's ataxia. Recently, we reported that an investigational anticancer drug, elesclomol (ES), can deliver Cu to critical mitochondrial cuproenzymes and has the potential to be repurposed for the treatment of Cu deficiency disorders. Here, we sought to determine the specificity of ES and the ES-Cu complex in delivering Cu to cuproenzymes in different intracellular compartments. Using a combination of yeast genetics, subcellular fractionation, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry-based metal measurements, we showed that ES and ES-Cu treatment results in an increase in cellular and mitochondrial Fe content, along with the expected increase in Cu. Using yeast mutants of Cu and Fe transporters, we demonstrate that ES-based elevation in cellular Fe levels is independent of the major cellular Cu importer but is dependent on the Fe importer Ftr1 and its partner Fet3, a multicopper oxidase. As Fet3 is metalated in the Golgi lumen, we sought to uncover the mechanism by which Fet3 receives Cu from ES. Using yeast knockouts of genes involved in Cu delivery to Fet3, we determined that ES can bypass Atx1, a metallochaperone involved in Cu delivery to the Golgi membrane Cu pump, Ccc2, but not Ccc2 itself. Taken together, our study provides a mechanism by which ES distributes Cu in cells and impacts cellular and mitochondrial Fe homeostasis."

This makes synthesizing enzymes and components involved in c-di-AMP signal transduction intriguing as potential targets for drug development. The c-di-AMP receptor protein DarB of Bacillus subtilis binds the Rel protein and triggers the Rel-dependent stringent response to stress conditions; however, the structural basis for this trigger is unclear. Here, we report crystal structures of DarB in the ligand-free state and of DarB complexed with c-di-AMP, 3′3′-cGAMP, and AMP. We show that DarB forms a homodimer with a parallel, head-to-head assembly of the monomers. We also confirm the DarB dimer binds two cyclic dinucleotide molecules or two AMP molecules; only one adenine of bound c-di-AMP is specifically recognized by DarB, while the second protrudes out of the donut-shaped protein. This enables DarB to bind also 3′3′-cGAMP, as only the adenine fits in the active site. In absence of c-di-AMP, DarB binds to Rel and stimulates (p)ppGpp synthesis, whereas the presence of c-di-AMP abolishes this interaction. Furthermore, the DarB crystal structures reveal no conformational changes upon c-di-AMP binding, leading us to conclude the regulatory function of DarB on Rel must be controlled directly by the bound c-di-AMP. We thus derived a structural model of the DarB–Rel complex via in silico docking, which was validated with mass spectrometric analysis of the chemically crosslinked DarB–Rel complex and mutagenesis studies.

Accordingly, the essential diadenylate cyclase CdaA has become a promising target for the development of new antibiotics. Since the essentiality of c-di-AMP depends on its signaling function, it is reasonable that the c-di-AMP–binding proteins are also interesting candidates as drug targets. All CBS domains share the same topology (β1−α1−β2−β3−α2), but they often display only low sequence conservation within protein families or even within one protein.

The β-strands β2 and β3 are flanked by two α-helices (α1 and α2). Usually, CBS domains occur as pairs or quads and each pair is forming a tandem repeat domain, also denoted as Bateman module (2Baykov A.A. Tuominen H.K. Lahti R. The CBS domain: A protein module with an emerging prominent role in regulation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Ereno-Orbea J. Oyenarte I. Martinez-Cruz L.A. CBS domains: ligand binding sites and conformational variability.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 540: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This fold is often stabilized by the region positioned N-terminally to the conserved CBS motif containing a third α-helix (α0), which clamps the two CBS domains in a tandem repeat. There are three different types of homodimers formed by CBS domains, classified as parallel (head-to-head assembly), antiparallel (head-to-tail assembly), and V-shaped (3Ereno-Orbea J. Oyenarte I. Martinez-Cruz L.A. CBS domains: ligand binding sites and conformational variability.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 540: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The structural and/or functional benefits that favor a significantly greater abundance of parallel CBS assemblies in nature (95%) as compared to the antiparallel modules are not well understood (3Ereno-Orbea J. Oyenarte I. Martinez-Cruz L.A. CBS domains: ligand binding sites and conformational variability.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 540: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The parallel and antiparallel dimers exhibit a disk-like shape and contain four CBS domains related by an internal D2 pseudosymmetry, the so-called CBS module. The tandem repeat of two CBS domains contains two canonical adenosine-binding sites; hence, a dimeric protein with four CBS domains could bind up to four adenosines. Recently, the CBS domain protein DarB/CbpB (previously denoted as YkuL) was identified as c-di-AMP–binding protein in Bacillus subtilis and L. monocytogenes, respectively (18Gundlach J. Krüger L. Herzberg C. Turdiev A. Poehlein A. Tascon I. et al.Sustained sensing in potassium homeostasis: cyclic di-AMP controls potassium uptake by KimA at the levels of expression and activity.J. Biol.

Woodward J.J. et al.ppGpp and c-di-AMP homeostasis is controlled by CbpB in Listeria monocytogenes.mBio. 2020; 11e01625-20Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DarB consists of 147 aa forming a CBS tandem repeat and comprises two CBS domains but no other domains. DarB binds to the GTP pyrophosphokinase Rel and thereby stimulates (p)ppGpp synthesis in a ribosome-independent manner. This interaction as well as DarB-stimulated (p)ppGpp synthesis is suppressed in the presence of c-di-AMP (26Krüger L. Herzberg C. Wicke D. Bahre H. Heidemann J.L. Dickmanns A. et al.A meet-up of two second messengers: the c-di-AMP receptor DarB controls (p)ppGpp synthesis in Bacillus subtilis.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). (p)ppGpp formation is part of the stringent response of bacterial cells under amino acid starvation or other stress conditions (27Cashel M. Gallant J. Two compounds implicated in the function of the RC gene of Escherichia coli.Nature. 1969; 221: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 28Dalebroux Z.D. Swanson M.S. ppGpp: magic beyond RNA polymerase.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, apo-DarB also binds to the pyruvate carboxylase to stimulate the replenishment of the citric acid cycle (29Krüger L. Herzberg C. Wicke D. Scholz P. Schmitt K. Turdiev A. et al.Sustained control of pyruvate carboxylase by the essential second messenger cyclic di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis.Mbio. 2022; 13e0360221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that DarB specifically binds c-di-AMP with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range and AMP with much lower affinity. DarB also binds 3′3′-cGAMP in vitro; however, as cGAMP does not exist in B. subtilis, this interaction might have no physiological relevance but might reveal interesting possibilities for drug development. In order to understand the specificity and affinity for different ligands, we determined four crystal structures of DarB, in its apo from and its ligand bound form either with c-di-AMP, 3′3′-cGAMP, or AMP, respectively. The four CBS domains of the homodimeric DarB bind two molecules of c-di-AMP; however, only one adenine of each c-di-AMP is specifically recognized by DarB, while the second adenine protrudes out of the donut-like shaped homodimer. This protruding adenine most likely prevents the DarB–Rel interaction, since no conformational changes occur in DarB upon c-di-AMP binding, which could cause the loss of protein–protein interaction. Furthermore, we suggest a 3D model of the Rel–DarB complex, which is based on computational docking experiments validated by mass-spectrometric analysis of crosslinked complexes and by binding studies with mutated DarB. The CBS domain containing protein DarB from B. subtilis was recently identified as a c-di-AMP–binding protein (18Gundlach J. Krüger L. Herzberg C. Turdiev A. Poehlein A. Tascon I. et al.Sustained sensing in potassium homeostasis: cyclic di-AMP controls potassium uptake by KimA at the levels of expression and activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 9605-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since CBS domains are known to bind a plethora of adenine-containing nucleotides, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) measurements with different mononucleotides and dinucleotides were performed in order to determine the nucleotide affinity and specificity of DarB (Fig. 1). The results confirmed the tight binding of c-di-AMP with a KD in the nanomolar range (27.0 nM ± 1.98 nM). No binding was detected for 2′3′-cGAMP, c-di-GMP, ATP, SAM, NAD+, and CoA (Fig. S1). Interestingly, 3′3′-cGAMP binds to DarB with a KD in the low micromolar range (1.17 μM ± 0.97 nM) and also an even weaker interaction with AMP was observed (KD of 91.1 μM ± 14.2 μM) (all ligands with 1:1 M stoichiometry). The direct comparison of the binding constants of 3′3′-cGAMP and c-di-AMP reveals that DarB binds the cyclic homodinucleotide with an approximately 40-fold higher affinity than the cyclic heterodinucleotide. However, since 3′3′-cGAMP is absent in B. subtilis, its binding to DarB has most likely no physiological relevance but raises the question of how this could be achieved. Hence, we decided to structurally characterize AMP and 3′3′-cGAMP DarB complexes and investigate if these weak interactions resemble c-di-AMP binding. DarB crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with two DarB molecules occupying the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of the ligand-free DarB (DarB-apo) was determined at 1.84 Å resolution (Table 1) and superposes well with the deposited but unpublished structure of DarB/YkuL (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 1YAV) and CbpB (PDB ID: 6XNU), as indicated by the r.m.s.d. of 0.53 Å and 1.23 Å between all Cα atoms, respectively (30Chin K.-H.

Open table in a new tab The DarB monomer occurs as tandem repeat of two CBS domains (CBS1 and CBS2), both possessing the canonical βαββα fold and an N-terminal region that contains a short α-helix and in case of CBS1 also a short β-strand (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal region preceding the CBS1 spans over the two CBS domains and clamps them together, as the N terminus of the polypeptide chain is positioned close to the C terminus of the CBS2. The N-terminal short β-strand (β0) of CBS1 packs against β-strand β6 of CBS2 and extends the β-sheet of CBS2 as the fourth strand, thereby stabilizing the arrangement of the two CBS domains. The core of the protein is formed by the β-sheets of CBS1 and CBS2. These two β-sheets are oriented parallel to each other and are flanked on each side by the α-helices. Similarly, to the N-terminal region, the linker connecting CBS1 and CBS2 also contains an α-helix (α0-1) followed by the canonical CBS fold of CBS2 (β4-α4-β5-β6-α5). The two molecules occupying the asymmetric unit form a donut-shaped homodimer related by a twofold noncrystallographic symmetry. The dimer interface buries 1402.8 Å2 of the accessible surface area (17.5%) and is stabilized by seven hydrogen bonds formed between residues comprising α-helices 1 and 1′ as well as α-helices 4 and 4’. According to the CBS protein classification, DarB forms a dimer in a parallel head-to-head assembly (Fig. 2B). The donut-shaped DarB homodimer has a predominantly negatively charged outer surface, while the surface of its central pore is positively charged (Fig. 2C). DarB was also crystallized in the presence of a few adenine-containing nucleotides that were identified by our ITC measurements (see previous text). Firstly, DarB was cocrystallized with c-di-AMP. The obtained crystals belong to the same space group as the ligand-free DarB crystals but differ slightly in unit cell dimensions. The structure of the c-di-AMP–DarB complex was determined at 1.70 Å resolution (Table 1) and superposes well with the apo structure (r.m.s.d. of 0.52 for all 274 Cα atoms), as well as with the published structure of the c-diAMP–CbpB complex (PDB ID: 6XNV) from L. monocytogenes, as indicated by the r.m.s.d. of 1.21 Å for 121 common Cα atoms (1.34 Å for 241 Cα atoms) (25Peterson B.N. Young M.K.M. Luo S. Wang J. Whiteley A.T. Woodward J.J. et al.ppGpp and c-di-AMP homeostasis is controlled by CbpB in Listeria monocytogenes.mBio. 2020; 11e01625-20Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the structure 6XNV represents a different crystal form; hence, the observed identical homodimeric oligomerization state of DarB and CbpB is not a result of crystal packing. Both structures share 52.7% of sequence identity and the same binding mode of c-di-AMP in a well-conserved binding site (Fig. S10) (25Peterson B.N. Young M.K.M. Luo S. Wang J. Whiteley A.T. Woodward J.J. et al.ppGpp and c-di-AMP homeostasis is controlled by CbpB in Listeria monocytogenes.mBio. 2020; 11e01625-20Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two DarB molecules in the asymmetric unit form the donut-shaped dimer like the apo DarB. The difference electron density map clearly revealed the presence of two c-di-AMP molecules bound inside the donut-shaped DarB dimer (Fig. S2). The c-di-AMP molecules are bound in a compact conformation with the adenine bases in an almost coplanar orientation, which has been denoted as U-type and was previously also shown for CbpB (Fig. S10) (9He J. Yin W. Galperin M.Y. Chou S.H. Cyclic di-AMP, a second messenger of primary importance: tertiary structures and binding mechanisms.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: 2807-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-binding site is formed by the loop region connecting α1 and β2 as well as β-strand 2 of CBS1, α-helix 4 and β-strands 5 and 6 of CBS2, and α-helix 4 of the CBS2 of the other monomer (B) (Fig. 3A). Residues Lys23, Ala25, Tyr45, Thr46, Ala47, and Arg132 of monomer A and Arg131′ of monomer B are involved in c-di-AMP binding (Fig. 3, B and C). The N6 of the adenine-1 (Ade1) forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl O atom of Lys23 and N1 to the backbone N atom of Ala25. Furthermore, Tyr45 positioned in the loop α1-β2 stacks with the adenine in an almost coplanar orientation. Surprisingly, the second adenine (Ade2) does not show any direct interactions with the protein. It protrudes from the protein ring and is surrounded by several water molecules, of which two are mediating contacts between adenine-2 and the protein. The 2′-OH of the ribose attached to Ade1 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl O atom of Ala47. The 2′-OH and the 3′-O of the second ribose (adenosine-2) form hydrogen bonds to side chain of Arg131′ of the other monomer. The phosphate of adenosine-1 forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain N of Arg132, while the phosphate of adenosine-2 forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chain OH and the main chain amide of Thr46. The structure of the DarB–c-di-AMP complex superposes well with the ligand-free DarB structure. Hence, binding of c-di-AMP does not induce any major conformational changes in DarB, although some minor structural changes occur in the central pore of the protein dimer. In the ligand-free state, the central pore of the dimer is constricted in comparison to the c-di-AMP–bound state. This structural change is due to a movement of the loop connecting α1 and β2, which leads to a repositioning of Thr46. Upon c-di-AMP binding, this loop becomes less flexible as Thr46 forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate of the ligand and is therefore fixed in its position. Another difference between apo and ligand-bound state concerns the side chain of Tyr45, which is disordered in the ligand-free state. When c-di-AMP is bound Tyr45 is caught in one conformation by the π–π stacking interaction with the adenine base. Since the ITC experiments also showed a weak binding of AMP to DarB, crystallization trials of DarB in presence of AMP were performed. The obtained crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.64 Å and belonged to the same space group as observed for the DarB–c-di-AMP and apo-DarB structures. The difference electron density maps (2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc) demonstrate two AMP molecules bound in the position corresponding to the two adenosine-1 moieties in the c-di-AMP complex structure (Fig. S3). Hence, the protein–AMP contacts are the same as for the corresponding Ade-1 of c-di-AMP (Fig. 4). The comparison of the two nucleotide-binding sites in the DarB–AMP complex unveiled that in one of the monomers the side chain of Arg132 binds the phosphate of AMP, while in the other monomer Arg132 is rotated outward of the binding pocket and forms a salt bridge with the Asp9 of a symmetry-related protein molecule leading to the loss of the contact with the AMP phosphate. The observed flexibility of Arg132 side chain could explain the higher KD of AMP in comparison to 3′3′-cGAMP and c-di-AMP and indicate a huge impact of the cyclic phosphate moiety on binding affinity. As the ITC experiments revealed that the heterodinucleotide 3′3′-cGAMP is also bound by DarB, but not the related 2′3′-cGAMP, this complex was crystallized as well. The DarB crystals obtained in presence of 3′3′-cGAMP belong also to the space group P212121 and contain two protein monomers in the asymmetric unit as described for DarB in complex with c-di-AMP. The crystal structure was determined at 1.50 Å resolution, and the difference electron densi"

To demonstrate that the risk of re-identification is acceptably low, re-identification risk metrics are used. There is a dearth of good risk estimators modeling the attack scenario where an adversary selects a record from the microdata sample and attempts to match it with individuals in the population.Develop an accurate risk estimator for the sample-to-population attack.A type of estimator based on creating a synthetic variant of a population dataset was developed to estimate the re-identification risk for an adversary performing a sample-to-population attack. The accuracy of the estimator was evaluated through a simulation on four different datasets in terms of estimation error. Two estimators were considered, a Gaussian copula and a d-vine copula. They were compared against three other estimators proposed in the literature.Taking the average of the two copula estimates consistently had a median error below 0.05 across all sampling fractions and true risk values. This was significantly more accurate than existing methods. A sensitivity analysis of the estimator accuracy based on variation in input parameter accuracy provides further application guidance. The estimator was then used to assess re-identification risk and de-identify a large Ontario COVID-19 behavioral survey dataset.The average of two copula estimators consistently provides the most accurate re-identification risk estimate and can serve as a good basis for managing privacy risks when data are de-identified and shared."

Whether and how such abstracted representations may be used to assign credit for inferred, but unobserved, relationships in structured environments are unknown. We develop a hierarchical reversal-learning task and Bayesian learning model to assess the computational and neural mechanisms underlying how humans infer specific choice-outcome associations via structured knowledge. We find that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) efficiently represents hierarchically related choice-outcome associations governed by the same latent cause, using a generalized code to assign credit for both experienced and inferred outcomes. Furthermore, the mPFC and lateral orbitofrontal cortex track the current “position” within a latent association space that generalizes over stimuli. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of both tracking the current position in an abstracted task space and efficient, generalizable representations in the prefrontal cortex for supporting flexible learning and inference in structured environments."

https://openalex.org/W4282843754,"Proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ/REGγ) is a member of the 11S family of proteasomal regulators that is constitutively expressed in the nucleus and implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers and systemic lupus erythematosus. Despite years of investigation, how PA28γ functions to stimulate proteasomal protein degradation remains unclear. Alternative hypotheses have been proposed for the molecular mechanism of PA28γ, including the following: (1) substrate selection, (2) allosteric upregulation of the trypsin-like (T-L) site, (3) allosteric inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) and caspase-like (C-L) sites, (4) conversion of the CT-L or C-L sites to new T-L sites, and (5) gate opening alone or in combination with a previous hypothesis. Here, by mechanistically decoupling gating effects from active site effects, we unambiguously demonstrate that WT PA28γ allosterically activates the T-L site. We show PA28γ binding increases the Kcat/Km by 13-fold for T-L peptide substrates while having little-to-no effect on hydrolysis kinetics for CT-L or C-L substrates. Furthermore, mutagenesis and domain swaps of PA28γ reveal that it does not select for T-L peptide substrates through either the substrate entry pore or the distal intrinsically disordered region. We also show that a previously reported point mutation can functionally switch PA28γ from a T-L activating to a gate-opening activator in a mutually exclusive fashion. Finally, using cryogenic electron microscopy, we visualized the PA28γ-proteasome complex at 4.3 Å and confirmed its expected quaternary structure. The results of this study provide unambiguous evidence that PA28γ can function by binding the 20S proteasome to allosterically activate the T-L proteolytic site."
https://openalex.org/W4283019549,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that causes health concerns worldwide. Patients with diabetes exhibit multisystemic symptoms, including loss of bone quality over time. The progressive deterioration of bone promotes failure to withstand damage and increases the risk of fractures. Much of the molecular and metabolic mechanism(s) in diabetic bone remains unclear. In vitro studies suggest that hyperglycemia inhibits mineralization, affecting bone formation and function. In this study, inhibition of osteoblast differentiation was induced using hyperglycemia to assess whether high glucose promotes mitochondrial impairment along with altered bone matrix formation. It was hypothesized that bone energy metabolism would be altered in these cells as calcium deposition, a key phase for bone function, is suppressed. Early passages of osteoblast like MC3T3-E1 cells were differentiated under normal and high glucose conditions. To investigate osteoblast differentiation, we quantified calcium accumulation by alizarin red staining and analyzed immunoblots of key proteins. To assess mitochondrial function, we quantified mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), detected expression and function of key proteins from the Tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle, measured mitochondrial respiration, and fuel oxidation of alternative nutrients. Results confirmed previous work showing that mineralization was inhibited and AKT expression was reduced in high glucose-treated bone cells. Unexpectedly, high glucose-treated osteoblast cells utilize both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to maintain energy demands with partial help of fatty acid for reliance of baseline bioenergetics. These metabolic shifts suggest that hyperglycemia maintain bone metabolic needs in an early differentiated state concurrent to the inhibition in bone matrix formation."
https://openalex.org/W4283024133,"Background The persistence and impacts of violence against women motivated Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5.2 to end such violence. Global psychometric assessment of cross-country, cross-time invariance of items measuring intimate partner violence (IPV) is needed to confirm their utility for comparing and monitoring national trends. Methods Analyses of seven physical-IPV items included 377,500 ever-partnered women across 20 countries (44 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)). Analyses of five controlling-behaviors items included 371,846 women across 19 countries (42 DHS). We performed multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) to assess within-country, cross-time invariance of each item set. Pooled analyses tested cross-country, cross-time invariance using DHSs that showed configural invariance in country-level multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFAs). Alignment optimization tested approximate invariance of each item set in the pooled sample of all datasets, and in the subset of countries showing metric invariance over at least two repeated cross-sectional surveys in country-level MGCFAs. Results In country-level MGCFAs, physical-IPV items and controlling-behaviors items functioned equivalently in repeated survey administrations in 12 and 11 countries, respectively. In MGCFA testing cross-country, cross-time invariance in pooled samples, neither item set was strictly equivalent; however, the physical-IPV items were approximately invariant. Controlling-behaviors items did not show approximate cross-country and cross-time invariance in the full sample or the sub-sample showing country-level metric invariance. Conclusion Physical-IPV items approached approximate invariance across 20 countries and were approximately invariant in 11 countries with repeated cross-sectional surveys. Controlling-behaviors items were cross-time invariant within 11 countries but did not show cross-country, cross-time approximate invariance. Currently, the physical-IPV item set is more robust for monitoring progress toward SDG5.2.1, to end IPV against women."
https://openalex.org/W4283073182,"Aims The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with Fontan-associated liver disease (i.e., FALD-HCC) has increased over time. However, the risk factors for HCC development remain unclear. Here, we compared the levels of non-invasive markers to the survival rate of FALD-HCC patients. Methods From 2003 to 2021, 154 patients (66 men, 42.9%) developed liver disease after undergoing Fontan procedures. HCC was diagnosed in 15 (9.7%) (8 men, 53.3%) at a median age of 34 years (range, 21–45 years). We compared FALD-HCC and non-HCC cases; we generated marker level cutoffs using receiver operating characteristic curves. We sought to identify risk factors for HCC and mortality. Results The incidence of HCC was 4.9% in FALD patients within 20 years after the Fontan procedure. Compared with non-HCC patients, FALD-HCC patients exhibited higher incidences of polysplenia and esophageal varices. At the time of HCC development, the hyaluronic acid (HA) level (p = 0.04) and the fibrosis-4 index (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in FALD-HCC patients than in non-HCC patients; the total bilirubin (T-BIL) level (p = 0.07) and the model for end-stage liver disease score [excluding the international normalized ratio (MELD-XI)] (p = 0.06) tended to be higher in FALD-HCC patients. Within approximately 20 years of the Fontan procedure, 10 patients died (survival rate, 96.9%). Kaplan–Meier curve analysis indicated that patients with T-BIL levels ≥ 2.2 mg/dL, HA levels ≥ 55.5 ng/mL, and MELD-XI scores ≥ 18.7 were at high risk of HCC, a generally poor prognosis, and both polysplenia and esophageal varices. Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the complication of polysplenia [Hazard ratio (HR): 10.915] and a higher MELD-XI score (HR: 1.148, both p &lt; 0.01) were independent risk factors for FALD-HCC. Conclusions The complication of polysplenia and a MELD-XI score may predict HCC development and mortality in FALD patients."

The transmissibility of amyloid-like aggregates is dependent on the stoichiometry of chaperones such as heat shock proteins (Hsps), including disaggregases. To provide the mechanistic underpinnings of the formation and persistence of prefibrillar amyloid seeds, we investigated the role of substoichiometric Hsp104 on the in vitro amyloid aggregation of the prion domain (NM-domain) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35. At low substoichiometric concentrations, we show Hsp104 exhibits a dual role: it considerably accelerates the formation of prefibrillar species by shortening the lag phase but also prolongs their persistence by introducing unusual kinetic halts and delaying their conversion into mature amyloid fibers. Additionally, Hsp104-modulated amyloid species displayed a better seeding capability compared to NM-only amyloids. Using biochemical and biophysical tools coupled with site-specific dynamic readouts, we characterized the distinct structural and dynamical signatures of these amyloids. We reveal that Hsp104-remodeled amyloidogenic species are compositionally diverse in prefibrillar aggregates and are packed in a more ordered fashion compared to NM-only amyloids. Finally, we show these Hsp104-remodeled, conformationally distinct NM aggregates display an enhanced autocatalytic self-templating ability that might be crucial for phenotypic outcomes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that substoichiometric Hsp104 promotes compositional diversity and conformational modulations during amyloid formation, yielding effective prefibrillar seeds that are capable of driving prion-like Sup35 propagation. Our findings underscore the key functional and pathological roles of substoichiometric chaperones in prion-like propagation."
https://openalex.org/W4282835052,"Tumor protein D54 (TPD54) is an abundant cytosolic protein that belongs to the TPD52 family, a family of four proteins (TPD52, 53, 54, and 55) that are overexpressed in several cancer cells. Even though the functions of these proteins remain elusive, recent investigations indicate that TPD54 binds to very small cytosolic vesicles with a diameter of ca. 30 nm, half the size of classical (e.g., COPI and COPII) transport vesicles. Here, we investigated the mechanism of intracellular nanovesicle capture by TPD54. Bioinformatical analysis suggests that TPD54 contains a small coiled-coil followed by four amphipathic helices (AH1-4), which could fold upon binding to lipid membranes. Limited proteolysis, CD spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence, and cysteine mutagenesis coupled to covalent binding of a membrane-sensitive probe showed that binding of TPD54 to small liposomes is accompanied by large structural changes in the amphipathic helix region. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that AH2 and AH3 have a predominant role in TPD54 binding to membranes both in cells and using model liposomes. We found that AH3 has the physicochemical features of an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which, in other proteins, enables membrane binding in a curvature-dependent manner. Accordingly, we observed that binding of TPD54 to liposomes is very sensitive to membrane curvature and lipid unsaturation. We conclude that TPD54 recognizes nanovesicles through a combination of ALPS-dependent and ALPS-independent mechanisms.

In cells, transport vesicles are produced from membrane-bound organelles by vesicular coat complexes, which self-assemble at the organelle surface into spherical shells to promote the budding of coated vesicles (1Bonifacino J.S.

Membrane budding.Cell. 2010; 143: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The best characterized protein coats are COPII, COPI, AP1-clathrin, and AP2-clathrin, which promote vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus (GA), trans-Golgi network (TGN), and plasma membrane, respectively. These different coats and the corresponding classes of vesicles have been abundantly studied over the last decades, notably as regards to the mechanisms of coat assembly, coat structure, vesicular content in cargoes, and associated diseases (3Dell'Angelica E.C.

Investigations by electron microscopy both in situ and from reconstituted systems indicate that these vesicles have a well-defined diameter, which is in the range of 80 nm (5Barlowe C.

Although protein coats can adapt their size to form bigger vesicles for the packaging of large cargoes (7McCaughey J. Stephens D.J.

Cell Biol. 2019; 59: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the converse has not been observed and transport vesicles smaller than 50 nm have rarely been reported. One exception are vesicles involved at early stages of autophagy, with a diameter in the range of 30 to 60 nm as estimated from morphological and hydrodynamic measurements (9Yamamoto H. Kakuta S. Watanabe T.M. Kitamura A. Sekito T. Kondo-Kakuta C. et al.Atg9 vesicles are an important membrane source during early steps of autophagosome formation.J.

Ultrastructural analysis of autophagosome organization using mammalian autophagy-deficient cells.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 4089-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a new class of transport vesicles has been recently identified through cellular investigations of tumor protein D54 (TPD54) (11Larocque G. La-Borde P.J. Clarke N.I. Carter N.J. Royle S.J. Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 219e201812044Google Scholar). TPD54 is a small (206 aa, 22.2 kDa) protein that belongs to a family of four proteins: TPD52, TPD53 (or TPD52L1), TPD54 (or TPD52L2), and TPD55 (or TPD52L3) (12Boutros R. Fanayan S. Shehata M. Byrne J.A. The tumor protein D52 family: many pieces, many puzzles.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These proteins are ubiquitously expressed in cells except TPD55, which is specific to the testis. Light microscopy imaging indicates that TPD54 associates with various membrane-bound compartments, mostly GA and endosomal structures (11Larocque G. La-Borde P.J. Clarke N.I. Carter N.J. Royle S.J. Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 219e201812044Google Scholar). In addition, a large fraction of TPD54 is found in the cytosol but this localization is deceptive. Fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP) experiments suggests that the cytosolic fraction of TPD54 corresponds to very small structures (≈32 nm), which could be resolved by super resolution microscopy (11Larocque G. La-Borde P.J. Clarke N.I. Carter N.J. Royle S.J. Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 219e201812044Google Scholar). When TPD54 is redirected to the mitochondria by a knocksideway-based approach, it causes the accumulation of numerous small-sized vesicles (diameter ≈ 30 nm) at the mitochondria surface. Several lines of evidence suggest that these vesicles are involved in membrane traffic. First, deletion of TPD54 causes a severe Golgi dispersal phenotype as well as a delay in the secretion of a model cargo (E-cadherin). Second, TPD54 vesicles contain many Rab proteins, which are small G proteins involved in vesicular traffic, as well as Q-SNARE proteins, which promote vesicle fusion (11Larocque G. La-Borde P.J. Clarke N.I. Carter N.J. Royle S.J. Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 219e201812044Google Scholar). Here, we show that TPD54 recognizes highly curved membranes through the folding of adjacent amphipathic helices (AHs) including an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif. ALPS are amphipathic sequences of 18 to 40 aa motifs that are characterized by the abundance of small polar residues (Gly, Ser, and Thr), by the rarity of charged residues and by the presence of regularly spaced bulky hydrophobic residues (13Giménez-Andrés M.

Yeast Nup84-Nup133 complex structure details flexibility and reveals conservation of the membrane anchoring ALPS motif.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We show that TPD54 shows a sharp preference for highly curved and unsaturated lipid membranes in vitro and, as such, resembles previously characterized ALPS-containing proteins. In cells, mutating the ALPS motif of TPD54 abolished its association with disparate membranes. However, differences in localization between TPD54 and the golgin GMAP-210, which also captures small transport vesicles through an ALPS motif, suggest the involvement of additional interactions for the selection of specific small transport vesicles. In line with this hypothesis, binding of TPD54 to small liposomes is accompanied by a large structural change that applies not only to the ALPS motif but also to the full region downstream of the coiled-coil region. Figure 1 shows the domain organization of human TPD54 (206 aa) as deduced from several bioinformatic tools and previous experiments (11Larocque G. La-Borde P.J. Clarke N.I. Carter N.J. Royle S.J. Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 219e201812044Google Scholar). Algorithms for the presence of intrinsically disordered regions suggest that the protein is roughly divided in four parts with different propensity to be folded (Fig. 1A). The first and last quarters of the protein (≈1–40 and 180–206) are predicted to be unstructured. The second quarter (≈40–100) shows a high probability to be folded. The third quarter (≈100–180) is ill-defined, being at the border between order and disorder. TPD54 also contains a predicted coiled-coil region, which spans from residue 38 to 82 (Fig. 1B) and which has been shown to contribute to homotypic and heterotypic associations between TPD protein members (39Sathasivam P. Bailey A.M. Crossley M. Byrne J.A. The role of the coiled-coil motif in interactions mediated by TPD52.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The recently published machine learning method AlphaFold (40Tunyasuvunakool K. Adler J. Wu Z. Green T. Zielinski M. Žídek A. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction for the human proteome.Nature. 2021; 596: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) overall agrees with this architecture, predicting with high confidence (>0.9) an α-helix between aa E43 and R79 corresponding to the coiled-coil, whereas other regions are predicted as either random coils (M1-T42; V178-F206) or α-helical (T85-V102; S104-Q122; D124-R159; A162-K177) but with low or medium confidence (Fig. 1C). We previously used the bioinformatic tool HELIQUEST (https://heliquest.ipmc.cnrs.fr/) (41Gautier R. Douguet D. Antonny B. Drin G. HELIQUEST: a web server to screen sequences with specific alpha-helical properties.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2101-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) to detect the presence of ALPS motifs in the full human and yeast proteomes and identified TPD54 as one of the ≈ 200 human proteins containing an ALPS motif (15Drin G. Casella J.-F. Gautier R. Boehmer T. Schwartz T.U. Antonny B. A general amphipathic alpha-helical motif for sensing membrane curvature.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The ALPS motif of TPD54 spans S141-M158. By rescanning the full TPD54 sequence with HELIQUEST, we observed that three other regions, two upstream and one downstream of the ALPS motif, also display an amphipathic helical sequence (Fig. 1D). They are referred to as AH1 (L83-V100), AH2 (Q101-V120), and AH4 (T163-G180), with AH3 corresponding to the ALPS motif. They all contain Gly residues, which should make them malleable for switching from a random coil to an α-helix in the presence of a proper membrane template. AH1, AH2, and AH4 are rich in both positively and negatively charged residues in contrast to ALPS motifs, which have a maximum of four charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) residues (15Drin G. Casella J.-F. Gautier R. Boehmer T. Schwartz T.U. Antonny B. A general amphipathic alpha-helical motif for sensing membrane curvature.Nat. Struct. Mol.

ArfGAP1 responds to membrane curvature through the folding of a lipid packing sensor motif.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Of note, AH1-AH2 as well as AH3-AH4 are not in register, which means that if they were forming a single continuous α-helix, their respective hydrophobic faces would point toward opposite directions. Overall, the predicted domain organization of TPD54 with both a coiled-coil region and amphipathic motifs bears resemblance to the N-terminal region of the golgin GMAP-210, a very long coiled-coil protein. GMAP-210 acts as a tethering string, capturing small transport vesicles through its N-ter ALPS motif (16Magdeleine M. Gautier R. Gounon P. Barelli H. Vanni S. Antonny B.

Membrane trafficking. The specificity of vesicle traffic to the Golgi is encoded in the golgin coiled-coil proteins.Science. 2014; 346: 1256898Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We purified recombinant human TPD54 from a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion form by a three-step protocol: (i) glutathione-bead binding step; (ii) thrombin cleavage of the linker between GST and TPD54; (iii) size-exclusion chromatography. To determine if TPD54 can directly interact with lipid membranes, we incubated full-length TPD54 with liposomes and recovered the liposome-bound fraction by flotation after centrifugation on sucrose cushions. Figure 2A shows the result of an experiment with three preparations of liposomes: phosphatidylcholine (PC)(18:1/18:1) (dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) obtained extrusion through 200 nm polycarbonate filters; PC(18:1/18:1) obtained by sonication; and PC(4ME 16:0/4ME 16:0) (diphytanoyl-PC) obtained extrusion through 200 nm polycarbonate filters. Diphytanoyl-lipids, which are not present in eukaryotic cells, form lipid membranes that are very permissive to the binding of AHs owing to the branched nature of their acyl chains, which favors hydrophobic insertions (43Garten M. Prévost C. Cadart C. Gautier R. Bousset L. Melki R. et al.Methyl-branched lipids promote the membrane adsorption of α-synuclein by enhancing shallow lipid-packing defects.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015; 17: 15589-15597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TPD54 bound weakly to 200 nm PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes but strongly to sonicated PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes and to 200 nm PC(4ME 16:0/4ME 16:0) liposomes. Thus, TPD54 is able to interact directly with simple membranes (i.e., PC) and binding is very sensitive to both membrane curvature and lipid acyl chain composition. To determine if structural changes accompany the binding of TPD54 to membranes, we conducted limited proteolysis experiments. For this aim, we incubated TPD54 with trypsin or subtilisin and analyzed the resulting fragments over time by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (MS). Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds downstream of accessible Lys or Arg residues, whereas subtilisin cleaves accessible peptide bonds with poor sequence specificity. We noticed that TPD54 showed anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight (MW) close to 30 kDa, much higher than the calculated MW (22,368.32 Da), which included the N-terminal sequence “GS” arising from the linker between TPD54 and GST after cleavage with thrombin (Fig. 2B). This anomalous migration was systematic for all fragments analyzed and might be related to weaker SDS binding due to some intrinsic features of the TPD54 sequence (44Rath A. Glibowicka M. Nadeau V.G. Chen G. Deber C.M. Detergent binding explains anomalous SDS-PAGE migration of membrane proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). By MS, we observed that purified TPD54 had a mass of 22,367.245 Da, which corresponds to approximately a -1 Da shift versus the calculated mass (22,368.32 Da) (Tables S1 and S2). In the absence of liposomes, trypsin and subtilisin rapidly digested TPD54, leading to the apparition of a single protease-resistant band with an apparent size below the lowest MW marker (14 kDa; Fig. 2B). MS identified this band as aa 34 to 86 and aa 35 to 95 in the case of subtilisin and trypsin digestion, respectively (Tables S1 and S2). In agreement with the bioinformatic analysis (Fig. 1), this result suggests that only a small part of TPD54, which corresponds to the predicted coiled-coil region, is intrinsically folded, whereas the remaining regions display no stable structure. Incubation of TPD54 with sonicated liposomes caused an important protection of TPD54 from protease degradation. For both subtilisin and trypsin, a fragment with an apparent MW ≈ 24 kDa rapidly accumulated at t = 2 to 5 min before subsequent digestion into smaller fragments of apparent MW of 23 to 19 kDa (Fig. 2B). Analysis by MS suggested that the first 33 or 34 aa, which are upstream of the predicted coiled-coil, were rapidly degraded. In contrast, the region downstream of the coiled-coil region appeared essentially intact at early time points (t = 2–5 min) and became slowly digested into smaller fragments. In the case of subtilisin, MS analysis suggested gradual digestion of the C terminus according to the series aa 206 > 200 > 193 > 177 > 175, that is, up to the fourth predicted AH) (Fig. 2B). Digestion with trypsin occurred via less intermediates but also led to the apparition of a fragment (35–175), which was observed only in the presence of sonicated liposomes and which encompassed both the coiled-coil region and the four predicted AHs. As observed for full-length TPD54, most fragments showed a ≈−1 Da shift in mass as compared to the calculated mass (Tables S1 and S2). Altogether, the results of the limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the recognition of small vesicles by TPD54 leads to major changes in the protein structure and/or accessibility to solvent, which applies to the full region downstream of the predicted coiled-coil region. Given the fact that the region that becomes protected from proteolysis in the presence of small liposomes contains the four predicted AHs (AH1-AH4), we performed CD experiments to determine if changes in the secondary structure accompanies TPD54 adsorption to small liposomes. In solution, the CD spectrum of TPD54 featured two minima at 208 and 222 nm, which are characteristic of α-helical structures. Upon addition of sonicated PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes, these two negative peaks further increased, suggesting additional folding of α-helical regions (Fig. 3A). Fitting the CD spectra using the web tool CAPITO (https://data.nmr.uni-jena.de/capito/index.php) (45Wiedemann C. Bellstedt P. Görlach M. CAPITO--a web server-based analysis and plotting tool for circular dichroism data.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) suggests that the content in α-helix increased from 30% in solution to 60% in the presence of sonicated PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes. Considering that the coiled-coil region of TPD54 is 45 aa whereas each predicted AH (AH1 to AH4) is about 18 aa in length, this twofold increase in helicity suggests the folding of the equivalent of two to three of these helices. The TPD54 region downstream of the predicted coiled-coil contains two tryptophan residues (W97 and W116), whereas no other tryptophan is present in the TPD54 sequence (Fig. 1D). Because tryptophan fluorescence is very sensitive to environmental changes and because this region becomes fully protected from protease degradation in the presence of sonicated PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes, we compared the intrinsic fluorescence of TPD54 in the absence and in the presence of such liposomes. As shown in Figure 3B, binding of TPD54 to sonicated PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes promoted a large tryptophan fluorescence increase, which was accompanied by a blue shift. This observation further strengthens the hypothesis that binding of TPD54 to curved membranes leads to a large reorganization of the protein structure, including the region encompassing the two tryptophan groups. According to HELIQUEST (41Gautier R. Douguet D. Antonny B. Drin G. HELIQUEST: a web server to screen sequences with specific alpha-helical properties.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2101-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), W97 and W116 belong to the hydrophobic faces of the putative AHs, AH1 and AH2, respectively (Fig. 1D). To determine whether tryptophan W97 and/or W116 become close to the membrane interfacial region upon TPD54 binding to small liposomes, we conducted FRET experiments. We used PC(18:1/18:1) liposomes doped with 5 mol% of the fluorescent lipid diphenylhexatriene PC (DPH-PC). The excitation spectrum of DPH-PC overlaps with the emission spectrum of tryptophan, thereby leading to a FRET signal when tryptophan groups partition in lipid membranes (46Antonny B."

One of the hallmarks of the stringent response is the production of a set of modified nucleotides, known as alarmones, which affect a multitude of cellular pathways in diverse ways. Production and degradation of these molecules depend on the activity of enzymes from the RelA/SpoT homologous family, which come in both bifunctional (containing domains to both synthesize and hydrolyze alarmones) and monofunctional (consisting of only synthetase or hydrolase domain) variants, of which the structure, activity, and regulation of the bifunctional RelA/SpoT homologs have been studied most intensely. Despite playing an important role in guanosine nucleotide homeostasis in particular, mechanisms of regulation of the small alarmone hydrolases (SAHs) are still rather unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of SAH enzymes from Corynebacterium glutamicum (RelHCg) and Leptospira levettii (RelHLl) and show that while being highly similar, structural differences in substrate access and dimer conformations might be important for regulating their activity. We propose that a varied dimer form is a general property of the SAH family, based on current structural information as well as prediction models for this class of enzymes. Finally, subtle structural variations between monofunctional and bifunctional enzymes point to how these different classes of enzymes are regulated.

The signal molecules mainly responsible for triggering the stringent response are guanosine 3′-diphosphate 5′-triphosphate (pppGpp) and guanosine 3′,5′-bis(diphosphate) (ppGpp) (15Cashel M.

Collectively, these molecules are referred to as alarmones or (pp)pGpp. Alarmones are synthesized by transfer of the β and γ phosphates of ATP to the 3′-hydroxyl group of GTP, GDP, or GMP by the synthetase domain of enzymes belonging to the RelA-SpoT homologous (RSH) superfamily (13Potrykus K.

Subsequent removal of these signal molecules, which is critical for cellular (pp)pGpp homeostasis, is achieved in a pyrophosphohydrolase reaction in which the δ and ε phosphate groups are released in the form of pyrophosphate and the original nucleotide is regenerated (23Hogg T.

Curiously, the first SAH structures determined were of the metazoan ortholog Mesh1 from human and Drosophila melanogaster (Mesh1Hs and Mesh1Dm, respectively), which were shown to possess (p)ppGpp hydrolase activity both in vitro and in vivo (43Sun D.

The discovery of a metazoan alarmone hydrolase was initially surprising, as no role for alarmones had been identified in higher organisms at the time. Later, Mesh1 was shown to function as a NADPH phosphatase required in development and ferroptosis-mediated cell death caused by metabolic starvation (44Ding C.-K.C. Rose J. Sun T. Wu J. Chen P.-H.

In this article, we present crystal structures of two unique SAH enzymes from Corynebacterium glutamicum (RelHCg) and Leptospira levettii (RelHLl) and show that both enzymes are catalytically active as dimers. Using this information and through comparison with the bifunctional RSHs, we reveal conserved structural features unique to the monofunctional SAHs. We observe that dimerization is a general feature of bacterial SAHs but that the exact mode of dimer conformation varies, which might influence regulation or stability, or both, in diverse bacterial species. Furthermore, we show that RelHCg is subject to product-dependent inhibition by GTP/GDP. RelHLl is less active than RelHCg and does not seem significantly affected by its products, potentially instead relying on active site accessibility for regulation. Our results suggest that regulatory mechanisms differ between bacterial species and may be controlled by the type of dimer formed. We therefore propose that SAHs evolved to form homodimers with diverse dimerization interfaces and regulation mechanisms, likely linked to the maintenance of GTP/GDP homeostasis in some bacteria. To better understand SAH function and regulation, we decided to determine the crystal structure of the most well-characterized member of the SAH family, C. glutamicum, RelHCg (cg1485/cgl1313, 188 amino acids, UniProt ID: Q8NQV9) (50Ruwe M.

The structure was determined using seleno-methionine (Se-Met)–derivatized protein by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method at 2.3 Å in the primitive hexagonal space group, P63. This model was then transferred to a higher resolution 1.8 Å native dataset that was used to build the final model. The final structure has Rwork = 17.6% and Rfree = 20.5% (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). The asymmetric unit contains two nearly identical molecules of RelHCg (Fig. 1A) of which one (chain A) was fully traced to the C-terminus (A188), including the linker and the first two residues of the histidine affinity tag to H192. The second molecule (chain B) could be traced to L185, except for a loop region (145–148) connecting helix α8 and α9. The structure reveals a core fold of ten α-helices with a cavity open to solvent where the active site of the HD domain is located (Fig. 1A) (24Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

All conserved residues typically involved in the hydrolase activity (R24, H34, H58, D59, E62, D63, D122, K123, and N126) are located inside this cavity (Fig. 1, A and B) of which R24 and N126 (motifs HD1 and HD6) are expected to coordinate the guanine base of the substrate alarmone.

https://openalex.org/W4282972712,"Class I WW domains are present in many proteins of various functions and mediate protein interactions by binding to short linear PPxY motifs. Tandem WW domains often bind peptides with multiple PPxY motifs, but the interplay of WW-peptide interactions is not always intuitive. The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) harbors two WW domains: an unstable WW1 capable of PPxY binding and stable WW2 that cannot bind PPxY. The WW2 domain has been suggested to act as a WW1 domain chaperone, but the underlying mechanism of its chaperone activity remains to be revealed. Here, we combined NMR, isothermal calorimetry, and structural modeling to elucidate the roles of both WW domains in WWOX binding to its PPxY-containing substrate ErbB4. Using NMR, we identified an interaction surface between these two domains that supports a WWOX conformation compatible with peptide substrate binding. Isothermal calorimetry and NMR measurements also indicated that while binding affinity to a single PPxY motif is marginally increased in the presence of WW2, affinity to a dual-motif peptide increases 10-fold. Furthermore, we found WW2 can directly bind double-motif peptides using its canonical binding site. Finally, differential binding of peptides in mutagenesis experiments was consistent with a parallel N- to C-terminal PPxY tandem motif orientation in binding to the WW1-WW2 tandem domain, validating structural models of the interaction. Taken together, our results reveal the complex nature of tandem WW-domain organization and substrate binding, highlighting the contribution of WWOX WW2 to both protein stability and target binding."
https://openalex.org/W4282980342,"Depletion of exogenous inositol in yeast results in rising levels of phosphatidic acid (PA) and is correlated with increased expression of genes containing the inositol-dependent upstream activating sequence promoter element (UASINO). INO1, encoding myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase, is the most highly regulated of the inositol-dependent upstream activating sequence-containing genes, but its mechanism of regulation is not clear. In the current study, we determined the relative timing and kinetics of appearance of individual molecular species of PA following removal of exogenous inositol in actively growing wild type, pah1Δ, and ole1ts strains. We report that the pah1Δ strain, lacking the PA phosphatase, exhibits a delay of about 60 min in comparison to wildtype before initiating derepression of INO1 expression. The ole1ts mutant on the other hand, defective in fatty acid desaturation, when grown at a semirestrictive temperature, exhibited reduced synthesis of PA species 34:1 and elevated synthesis of PA species 32:1. Importantly, we found these changes in the fatty acid composition in the PA pool of the ole1ts strain were associated with reduced expression of INO1, indicating that synthesis of PA 34:1 is involved in optimal expression of INO1 in the absence of inositol. Using deuterium-labeled glycerol in short-duration labeling assays, we found that changes associated with PA species 34:1 were uniquely correlated with increased expression of INO1 in all three strains. These data indicate that the signal for activation of INO1 transcription is not necessarily the overall level of PA but rather levels of a specific species of newly synthesized PA 34:1."

Using a population-level database from the entire province of British Columbia, Canada, we conducted a matched cohort study of all patients with incident GPA with up to ten age-, sex-, and entry time-matched individuals randomly selected from the general population. We compared incidence rates of VTE, PE, and DVT between the two groups, and calculated hazard ratios (HR), adjusting for relevant confounders. Among 549 individuals with incident GPA (57.6% female, mean age 55.4 years), the incidence rates for VTE, PE, and DVT were 7.22, 2.73, and 6.32 per 1,000 person-years, respectively; the corresponding rates were 1.36, 0.74, and 0.81 per 1,000 person-years among the 5,490 non-GPA individuals. Compared with the non-GPA cohort, the fully adjusted HRs among GPA patients were 2.90 (95% CI, 1.10-7.64), 4.70 (95% CI, 1.74-12.69), and 1.66 (95% CI, 0.52-5.27) for VTE, PE, and DVT, respectively. The risks of VTE, PE, and DVT were highest during the first year after GPA diagnosis with HR (95% CI) of 11.04 (1.37-88.72), 26.94 (4.56-159.24), and 2.68 (0.23-31.21), respectively. GPA patients are at significantly increased risk of PE, but not DVT. Monitoring for these complications is particularly warranted in this patient population, especially early after diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4283013767,"Network density is an important attribute that affects the efficiency of innovation networks. However, the understanding of how network density affects the innovation efficiency of innovation networks is still unclear and even controversial. This paper uses a multiagent simulation method to study this problem. First, an innovation simulation model is established to describe the generation process of innovations in the context of network innovation, and a classical random network model is used to generate a test set of structures with different network densities. Then, the innovation model is run on the test set of networks to obtain the innovation efficiency of the structures with different network densities. The result shows that for explorative innovation, high network density is more conducive to improving innovation efficiency, and for exploitative innovation, low network density is more conducive to improving innovation efficiency. However, when network density is small enough to destroy network connectivity, it will lead to a large risk of innovation failure. Finally, the reasons for the results are further analyzed, and the theoretical and practical significance of the conclusions are discussed."

Most participants described the ongoing abandonment of infibulation and uptake of sunna circumcision in terms of civilization, modernization and transition toward a more correct Islam; however, their perceptions of the anatomical extents and religious and cultural meanings of sunna circumcision appeared blurred and contradictory. We suggest that these blurred and contradictory perceptions of sunna circumcision enable the study’s participants to maneuver in a context of opposing and changing social norms regarding FGC."
https://openalex.org/W4283072161,"Background Hypertension is a disease that imposes risks of diseases on multi-system. Failure to control hypertension leads patients to end up with unavoidable complications, including death. Noncompliance to treatment is the main factor to develop such devastating complications whereas knowledge of patients about their disease is a key factor for better compliance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the level of knowledge about hypertension and associated factors among hypertensive patients in public health facilities of Gondar city. Methods Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2019 in Gondar town. A systematic sampling technique was applied to select a total of 389 patients. A structured interview questionnaire was used to gather the data. The data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed at P &lt; 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval to identify statistically significant variables. Results A total of 385 respondents participated giving a response rate of 98.9%. The majority (55.3%) of the patients had a low level of, 17.9% had a moderate level of knowledge whereas 26.8% had a high level of knowledge about hypertension. Those working in government organizations had 5.5 times higher odds of having a high level of knowledge than other groups (AOR = 5.5; 95%CI = 1.21, 25). Patients who received longer than four years of treatment showed twice larger odds of knowledge than those with below two years of treatment (AOR = 2; 95%CI = 1.29, 3.22) Moreover, patients residing proximate to the hospital increases the odds of having a higher level of knowledge by 1.64 times versus patients living far away from the hospital (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.07–2.63). Conclusions This finding revealed that knowledge about hypertension and risk factors among patients with hypertension was low. Employment in governmental organizations, longer duration of treatment, and residential proximity to hospitals/ health centers were statistically significant predictors of the participants’ knowledge about hypertension. Therefore, it is important to give health education to patients working in non-governmental organizations and self-employed individuals about diseases and risk factors. In addition, emphasis should be given to patients receiving less than two years of treatment and coming from remote areas to improve their knowledge of the disease."

However, the effect of RNA modifications such as pseudouridinylation on its ability to survive in these two different host environments is unclear. Here, two genome-wide approaches were applied for mapping pseudouridinylation sites (Ψs) on small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), 7SL RNA, vault RNA, and tRNAs from T. brucei. We show using HydraPsiSeq and RiboMeth-seq that the Ψ on C/D snoRNA guiding 2′-O-methylation increased the efficiency of the guided modification on its target, rRNA. We found differential levels of Ψs on these noncoding RNAs in the two life stages (insect host and mammalian host) of the parasite. Furthermore, tRNA isoform abundance and Ψ modifications were characterized in these two life stages demonstrating stage-specific regulation. We conclude that the differential Ψ modifications identified here may contribute to modulating the function of noncoding RNAs involved in rRNA processing, rRNA modification, protein synthesis, and protein translocation during cycling of the parasite between its two hosts.

Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness. The parasite cycles between two hosts, which require major adaptation to changes in temperature and nutrient milieu, among other conditions. In the tsetse fly, the stage known as procyclic form (PCF) propagates in the midgut and undergoes transformation to a metacyclic stage; these parasites are transferred to the mammalian host upon feeding by the infected fly.

Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). mtap silencing eliminated Ψs on snRNAs though not on rRNA, but silencing of cbf5, the PUS associated with snoRNAs, affected both rRNA and snRNA Ψ modification, suggesting that many trypanosome H/ACAs guide modifications on both rRNA and snRNA (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Ψ modifications on snRNAs strengthen RNA–RNA and RNA–protein interactions at elevated temperatures (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Over 250 Ψs were also mapped on T. brucei mRNAs by Ψ-seq, and several of those were shown to be guided by PUS enzymes. Interestingly, Ψ modification on mRNA 3′UTRs inhibit association of mRNA-binding proteins with their target mRNA (24Rajan K.S. Adler K. Madmoni H. Peleg-Chen D. Cohen-Chalamish S.

Microbiol. 2021; 116: 808-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Several trypanosome noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have unique properties compared to other eukaryotes. As an example, Trypanosomes possess a homolog of 7SL RNA, but in contrast to all eukaryotes, the signal recognition particle is composed of two RNA molecules: the 7SL RNA and a tRNA-like molecule, sRNA-76 (25Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Identification of a tRNA-like molecule that copurifies with the 7SL RNA of Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4551-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The tRNA-like molecule interacts by base pairing with the Alu-like domain at the 5′ end of the 7SL RNA (27Liu L. Ben-Shlomo H. Xu Y.-X. Stern M.Z. Goncharov I. Zhang Y. et al.The trypanosomatid signal recognition particle consists of two RNA molecules, a 7SL RNA homologue and a novel tRNA-like molecule.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18271-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, vault RNA (vtRNA) was recently shown to exist in trypanosomes and to possess unique functions. Downregulating vtRNA levels impaired trans-splicing and mRNA production, suggesting its role in mRNA metabolism (28Kolev N.G. Rajan K.S. Tycowski K.T. Toh J.Y. Shi H. Lei Y. et al.The vault RNA of Trypanosoma brucei plays a role in the production of trans-spliced mRNA.J. Biol.

Very little is known regarding the Ψ modification of ncRNAs other than that of the abundant snRNAs (29Morais P. Adachi H. Yu Y.-T. Spliceosomal snRNA epitranscriptomics.Front. Genet. 2021; 12652129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was previously suggested based on primer extension mapping that in mammals, vault RNA carries 4 Nm sites and 7SL RNA contains five Ψs (30Kishore S. Gruber A.R. Jedlinski D.J. Syed A.P. Jorjani H. Zavolan M. Insights into snoRNA biogenesis and processing from PAR-CLIP of snoRNA core proteins and small RNA sequencing.Genome Biol. 2013; 14: R45Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized both small RNA Ψ-seq (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and HydraPsiSeq (31Marchand V. Pichot F. Neybecker P. Ayadi L. Bourguignon-Igel V. Wacheul L. et al.HydraPsiSeq: a method for systematic and quantitative mapping of pseudouridines in RNA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to map Ψs on SL RNA, 7SL RNA, vtRNA, C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs, and tRNAs. Differential levels of Ψ modification were observed between the BSF and PCF stages. The presence of Ψ on C/D snoRNA affected its ability to guide Nm modification, since in cbf5 silenced cells, the Nm guided by C/D snoRNA was significantly reduced. tRNA levels and Ψ modification were also shown to differ between the BSF and PCF parasites. This study highlights the potential role of Ψ modifications on ncRNAs for gene regulation at different developmental stages. Previously we used more than 14 independent biological replicates of small RNA Ψ-seq libraries to detect Ψs mostly on snRNAs involved in splicing (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here, we used the same libraries to identify Ψs on additional classes of abundant ncRNAs. To validate the detected Ψs by reverse transcription (RT)-independent mapping as well as to quantify the stoichiometry of these novel Ψs, we sought to establish a modified protocol adjusted for small RNAs using HydraPsiSeq (31Marchand V. Pichot F. Neybecker P. Ayadi L. Bourguignon-Igel V. Wacheul L. et al.HydraPsiSeq: a method for systematic and quantitative mapping of pseudouridines in RNA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ψ-seq relies on the ability of reverse transcriptase to terminate 1 nt before the actual Ψ residue when encountering the “bulky” N-Cyclohexyl-N′-(β-[N-methylmorpholino]ethyl)carbodiimide p-toluenesulfonate (CMC) modified Ψ site (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 24Rajan K.S. Adler K. Madmoni H. Peleg-Chen D. Cohen-Chalamish S.

Microbiol. 2021; 116: 808-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). HydraPsiSeq is based on random cleavage of only unmodified uridine nucleotides in RNA by utilizing the combination of hydrazine and aniline treatment and sequencing of fragmented RNA containing intact Ψ-modified residues (31Marchand V. Pichot F. Neybecker P. Ayadi L. Bourguignon-Igel V. Wacheul L. et al.HydraPsiSeq: a method for systematic and quantitative mapping of pseudouridines in RNA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To enrich for small ncRNAs, whole-cell extracts were prepared from both PCF and BSF T. brucei parasites, depleted of ribosomes by ultracentrifugation, and the resulting postribosomal supernatant (PRS) was utilized to extract fractions enriched in small ncRNA (Fig. 1A) (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 32Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Rengaraj P. Galili B. Aryal S. et al.Developmentally regulated novel non-coding anti-sense regulators of mRNA translation in trypanosoma b rucei.iScience. 2020; 23101780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To map Ψ residues, the RNA prepared from PRS was subjected to hydrazine-aniline treatment, and the fragmented RNAs were subjected to deep sequencing, obtaining more than 40 million reads for each library. Small RNA HydraPsiSeq libraries were prepared from the two life stages of the parasite. In these libraries, rRNA was reduced significantly to less than 14% to 30% of the total preparation, compared to 80%-90% in total RNA (Fig. 1B). To enable quality assessment of PCF and BSF small RNA HydraPsiSeq libraries, the fragmentation profile of the Ψ on SL RNA was determined. SL RNA has a single Ψ28 guided by SLA1 RNA (17Liang X.-H. Xu Y.-X. Michaeli S. The spliced leader-associated RNA is a trypanosome-specific sn(o) RNA that has the potential to guide pseudouridine formation on the SL RNA.RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The data (Fig. 1Ci) suggested that all uridine residues along the SL RNA were fragmented (as measured by the NormUcount score (31Marchand V. Pichot F. Neybecker P. Ayadi L. Bourguignon-Igel V. Wacheul L. et al.HydraPsiSeq: a method for systematic and quantitative mapping of pseudouridines in RNA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) except for Ψ28, confirming that Ψ residues are resistant to cleavage. To determine the fraction of pseudouridylation on each uridine residue, the PsiScore was calculated, which takes into consideration the total number of reads and the 5’/3′ end coverage in each uridine nucleotide (31Marchand V. Pichot F. Neybecker P. Ayadi L. Bourguignon-Igel V. Wacheul L. et al.HydraPsiSeq: a method for systematic and quantitative mapping of pseudouridines in RNA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Next, we quantified the stoichiometry of Ψ28 on SL RNA derived from both life stages. Our results (Fig. 1Cii) indicated that Ψ28 is fully modified in both life stages of the parasite. To examine the ability of the method to detect variations in Ψ level, we also mapped Ψ on RNA derived from cells silenced for mtap and cbf5. MTAP is a protein that was shown to bind to SLA1 (18Hury A. Goldshmidt H. Tkacz I.D. Michaeli S. Trypanosome spliced-leader-associated RNA (SLA1) localization and implications for spliced-leader RNA biogenesis.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as to H/ACA snoRNA guiding on both rRNA and snRNA (18Hury A. Goldshmidt H. Tkacz I.D. Michaeli S. Trypanosome spliced-leader-associated RNA (SLA1) localization and implications for spliced-leader RNA biogenesis.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas CBF5 is the PUS associated with all H/ACA snoRNA (33Barth S. Hury A. Liang X.-H. Michaeli S.

Our results (Fig. 1Cii) verified the dependance of Ψ28 on these two proteins, as previously described (18Hury A. Goldshmidt H. Tkacz I.D. Michaeli S.

Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the Ψs on vtRNA (28Kolev N.G. Rajan K.S. Tycowski K.T. Toh J.Y. Shi H. Lei Y. et al.The vault RNA of Trypanosoma brucei plays a role in the production of trans-spliced mRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15559-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A single site was located at position Ψ100 by both small RNA Ψ-seq (Fig. 1Di) and HydraPsiSeq (Fig. 1Dii-iii), and the Ψ was plotted on a scheme showing the experimentally verified secondary structure of vtRNA (Fig. 1Div). This position is modified to a similar degree on both life stages (Fig. 1Dii) and is guided by dual functioning snoRNA, as based on small RNA Ψ-seq (Fig. S1) and HydraPsiSeq (Fig. 1Diii), the stoichiometry of Ψ100 is reduced upon cbf5 and mtap silencing. Using small RNA Ψ-seq with stringent criteria (log2 (Ψ-fc) of >3 and Ψ-ratio of > 0.01) and based on 14 libraries, 11 putative Ψ sites were detected on 7SL RNA (Fig. 2Ai) with nine sites verified by HydraPsiSeq (Table 1 and Fig. 2Aii). Note that our HydraPsiSeq analysis could not detect Ψ on uridine residues carrying both Ψ and 2′-O-methylation sites in T. brucei rRNA, for an unknown reason. Next, we investigated the localization of these Ψs on the secondary structure depicting the conserved domains of the T. brucei 7SL RNA (Fig. 2Aiii) (26Lustig Y. Goldshmidt H. Uliel S. Michaeli S. The trypanosoma brucei signal recognition particle lacks the Alu-domain-binding proteins: purification and functional analysis of its binding proteins by RNAi.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4551-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Note that only six Ψs are depicted in Figure 2Aiii and the remaining three verified Ψ sites are located at the 5′ end domain with unknown structure (26Lustig Y. Goldshmidt H. Uliel S. Michaeli S. The trypanosoma brucei signal recognition particle lacks the Alu-domain-binding proteins: purification and functional analysis of its binding proteins by RNAi.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4551-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and thus were not presented. Three of the depicted Ψs sites (Ψ103, 160, and 186) were located within G-U base pairing regions, and one (Ψ61) was detected close to a G-U base pair. Two Ψ sites (Ψ160 and 186) were found in the domain interacting with the signal peptide-binding protein, SRP54. The sites at the 5′ end domain are of interest as they are likely to be involved in the interaction with the tRNA-like molecule present in the T. brucei SRP complex (25Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18271-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Next, we verified the authenticity of these sites by determining their level following cbf5 and mtap silencing, which we showed to reduce the level of Ψ on snRNAs (Fig. 2Aii) (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Indeed, using the HydraPsiSeq data (described in Fig. 1), we observed reduction in the level of 7 Ψs under the silencing of both cbf5 and mtap, suggesting that these modifications are most likely guided by dual functioning snoRNAs, in analogy to the snoRNA guiding on snRNAs (23Rajan K.S. Doniger T. Cohen-Chalamish S. Chen D. Semo O. Aryal S. et al.Pseudouridines on Trypanosoma brucei spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and their implication for RNA and protein interactions.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: 7633-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Interestingly, Ψ160 located in the SRP54-binding domain seems to be hypermodified in BSF, and Ψ186 was detected only in PCF (Table 1). To identify the snoRNAs guiding these Ψ positions on 7SL RNA, we used psoralen UV-induced crosslinking RNA libraries composed of chimeric RNA molecules ligated between the small RNA and its targets (Fig. S2, Tables S2 and S1) (23Rajan K.S.

https://openalex.org/W4282919886,"The plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) extrudes calcium from the cytosol to the extracellular space to terminate calcium-dependent signaling. Although the distribution of PMCA is crucial for its function, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the localization of PMCA isoforms are not well understood. PLEKHA7 is implicated by genetic studies in hypertension and the regulation of calcium handling. PLEKHA7 recruits the small adapter protein PDZD11 to adherens junctions, and together they control the trafficking and localization of plasma membrane associated proteins, including the Menkes copper ATPase. Since PDZD11 binds to the C-terminal domain of b-isoforms of PMCA, PDZD11 and its interactor PLEKHA7 could control the localization and activity of PMCA. Here, we test this hypothesis using cultured cell model systems. We show using immunofluorescence microscopy and a surface biotinylation assay that KO of either PLEKHA7 or PDZD11 in mouse kidney collecting duct epithelial cells results in increased accumulation of endogenous PMCA at lateral cell-cell contacts and PDZ-dependent ectopic apical localization of exogenous PMCA4x/b isoform. In HeLa cells, coexpression of PDZD11 reduces membrane accumulation of overexpressed PMCA4x/b, and analysis of cytosolic calcium transients shows that PDZD11 counteracts calcium extrusion activity of overexpressed PMCA4x/b, but not PMCA4x/a, which lacks the PDZ-binding motif. Moreover, KO of PDZD11 in either endothelial (bEnd.3) or epithelial (mouse kidney collecting duct) cells increases the rate of calcium extrusion. Collectively, these results suggest that the PLEKHA7-PDZD11 complex modulates calcium homeostasis by regulating the localization of PMCA."
https://openalex.org/W4282962685,"Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is an understudied poor prognosis subtype of ovarian cancer lacking in effective targeted therapies. Efforts to define molecular drivers of OCCC malignancy may lead to new therapeutic targets and approaches. Among potential targets are secreted proteases, enzymes which in many cancers serve as key drivers of malignant progression. Here, we found that inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases suppressed malignant phenotypes of OCCC cell lines. To identify the proteases responsible for malignancy in OCCC, we employed activity-based protein profiling to directly analyze enzyme activity. We developed an activity-based probe featuring an arginine diphenylphosphonate warhead to detect active serine proteases of trypsin-like specificity and a biotin handle to facilitate affinity purification of labeled proteases. Using this probe, we identified active trypsin-like serine proteases within the complex proteomes secreted by OCCC cell lines, including two proteases in common, tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Further interrogation of these proteases showed that both were involved in cancer cell invasion and proliferation of OCCC cells and were also detected in in vivo models of OCCC. We conclude the detection of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator as catalytically active proteases and significant drivers of the malignant phenotype may point to these enzymes as targets for new therapeutic strategies in OCCC. Our activity-based probe and profiling methodology will also serve as a valuable tool for detection of active trypsin-like serine proteases in models of other cancers and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4283012198,"Xinjiang is the largest arid and saline agricultural region in China. The common irrigation methods in this area are traditional flood irrigation and drip irrigation. In this study, we investigated the effects of these two irrigation methods on the fungal diversity, community structures, and functions in alfalfa rhizosphere soil as well as the associated environmental factors in northern Tianshan Mountain (Xinjiang, China). Soil enzyme activities (urease and neutral phosphatase) were significantly higher in the drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil than in the flood-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil, whereas the fungal alpha diversity in the drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil was significantly lower than that in the flood-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil. Six dominant fungal phyla were identified (&gt;0.1%), with Ascomycota being the most abundant in all soils, followed by Basidiomycota (5.47%), Mortierellomycota (1.07%), Glomeromycota (0.55%), Rozellomycota (0.27%), and Chytridiomycota (0.14%). Ascomycota and Glomeromycota species were significantly less abundant in drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil than in flood-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil. A LEFSe analysis identified Cladosporiaceae (20.8%) species as the most abundant marker fungi in drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil. Of the 13 fungal functional groups identified on the basis of the functional annotation using the FUNGuild database, Ectomycorrhizal (22.29%) was the primary functional group. Compared with flood irrigation, drip irrigation significantly decreased the relative abundance of Ectomycorrhizal and Arbuscular_Mycorrhizal, while increasing the relative abundance of Plant_Pathogen, although not significantly (P = 0.19). Available potassium was revealed to be the main environmental factor influencing soil enzyme activities, fungal alpha diversity, fungal community structures, and fungal functions in response to the different irrigation methods. In conclusion, drip irrigation may be more appropriate than flood irrigation in the Tianshan dryland agricultural area for enhancing soil enzyme activities, but it may also increase the abundance of plant pathogenic fungi in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W4283069571,"Animal source foods contain quality nutrients, immunity, and behavioral outcome and are important for growth, and development. However, evidence on the level of animal source food consumption frequency and associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia, particularly rural residents are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the consumption frequency of animal source food and to identify associated factors among pregnant women in the Haramaya district.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 448 pregnant women. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews by trained research assistants, using a validated frequency questionnaire. Consumption of animal food sources was assessed by counting the frequency of each food from animal sources that pregnant women ate over a seven-day reference period. The highest tertile for animal source food consumption was considered as the high frequency of animal source food consumption; whereas the two lower tertiles were taken as the low frequency of animal source food consumption. A binary logistic regression model was used to investigate the association of the independent variables with the animal source food consumption. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was reported to show an association using a p-value <0.05.The high frequency of animal source food consumption among the study participants was 24.78% (95% CI = 21%-29%). High animal source food consumption was more likely higher among respondents who were literate (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.048-3.095), and those who owned milk cows (ARO = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.003-2.863). However, respondent who reported chewing khat (AOR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.313-0.805) (AOR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.349-0.903), were less likely experienced animal source food consumption.We found low animal source food consumption among pregnant women in this predominantly rural setting. Women's educational level and milk cow ownership were positively associated with animal source food consumption. Additionally, a lower frequency of animal source food consumption was observed among women who reported chewing khat. Therefore, nutrition policy programs and interventions aimed at encouraging maternal nutritional guidance and counseling are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4283072793,"A cross-sectional coprological and pathological study was conducted in five districts of South Wollo and Oromia Administrative Zones, Amhara regional state, Ethiopia from November 2020 to June 2021 to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of Bovine Schistosomiasis and to characterize pathological lesions induced by the adult worm of Schistosoma bovis . For coprological examination, a total of 768 fecal samples were collected both from the field (384) and the abattoirs (384). An abattoir survey was carried out on 384 cattle to evaluate the performance of the sedimentation method. The risk factors were identified using multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression analyses. The diagnostic efficacy of the sedimentation technique was determined by calculating sensitivity and specificity considering postmortem examination as a reference test. The overall prevalence of bovine shistosomiasis using coprological examination was found to be 16.7% (95% CI = 14.10–19.49). The prevalence of shistosomiasis based on post-mortem examination was found to be 17.19% (95% CI = 13.55–21.34). Local cattle breed (OR = 2.44, 95%CI = 1.34–4.43), poor body condition (OR = 4.09, 95% CI = 2.45–6.83) and adult (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.21–3.28) cattle are more likely to acquire shistosomiasis than crossbreed, good body condition, and young cattle. The sensitivity and specificity of sedimentation techniques, keeping postmortem examination as a reference test were 74.24% (95%CI = 61.99–84.22) and 98.11% (95%CI = 95.94–99.30), respectively. The major gross lesions were observed in the liver and intestinal tracts. In conclusion, adult local cattle with medium and poor body conditions should be prioritized for deworming and future surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4282839976,"Upregulation of Notch3 expression has been reported in many cancers and is considered a marker for poor prognosis. Hypoxia is a driving factor of the Notch3 signaling pathway; however, the induction mechanism and role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the Notch3 response are still unclear. In this study, we found that HIF-1α and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) regulate Notch3 induction under hypoxia via a noncanonical mechanism. In the analyzed cancer cell lines, Notch3 expression was increased during hypoxia at both the mRNA and protein levels. HIF-1α knockdown and Notch3 promoter reporter analyses indicated that the induction of Notch3 by hypoxia requires HIF-1α and also another molecule that binds the Notch3 promoter’s guanine-rich region, which lacks the canonical hypoxia response element. Therefore, using mass spectrometry analysis to identify the binding proteins of the Notch3 promoter, we found that PARP-1 specifically binds to the Notch3 promoter. Interestingly, analyses of the Notch3 promoter reporter and knockdown of PARP-1 revealed that PARP-1 plays an important role in Notch3 regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PARP inhibitors, including an inhibitor specific for PARP-1, attenuated the induction of Notch3 by hypoxia. These results uncover a novel mechanism in which HIF-1α associates with PARP-1 on the Notch3 promoter in a hypoxia response element–independent manner, thereby inducing Notch3 expression during hypoxia. Further studies on this mechanism could facilitate a better understanding of the broader functions of HIF-1α, the roles of Notch3 in cancer formation, and the insights into novel therapeutic strategies.

Notch is a transmembrane cell surface receptor that plays crucial roles in a variety of cellular processes and is related to various diseases (1Siebel C. Lendahl U.

Notch signaling: Simplicity in design, versatility in function.Development. 2011; 138: 3593-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In mammals, four Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and five ligands are components of the Notch signaling pathway. The binding of the ligand to the Notch receptor induces cleavage of the receptor, and subsequently, γ-secretase additionally cleaves the truncated receptor and leads to the release of the Notch intracellular domain. Finally, Notch intracellular domain translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with the transcriptional regulator RBPJ (also called CSL or CBF1) to induce target gene expression. All Notch receptors share a similar structure, but Notch3 and Notch4 have a shorter intracellular domain than Notch1 and Notch2 and lack the transactivation domain (3Aburjania Z. Jang S. Whitt J.

A large number of studies have shown numerous physiological roles of Notch1 and Notch2, but little is known about Notch3 and Notch4. Recent reports have shown that high expression of Notch3 is correlated with poor prognosis in various types of cancers. Notch3 activation is highly involved in apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy (5Xiong J. Zhang X. Chen X. Wei Y. Lu D.G.

Hypoxia is a microenvironmental feature of many solid cancers, which arises from an imbalance between cellular O2 consumption and supply. Hypoxia is recognized as a key factor linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation therapies (16Harris A.L.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a well-established transcriptional activator that mediates responses to hypoxia-related physiological changes. HIF-1α forms a dimer with HIF-1β, and the heterodimer translocates to the nucleus to activate the expression of target genes by binding to a conserved motif (A/GCGTG) in the gene promoter called the hypoxia response element (HRE). This HRE-dependent activation manner by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is recognized as a canonical mechanism. Induction of target genes by HIF has been linked to several biological pathways and allows cancer cells to adapt to hypoxia, resulting in the acquisition of malignant phenotypes and resistance to therapies (19Semenza G.L.

To date, reports on HIF target genes are increasing every year (22Simon M.C. The hypoxia response pathways - hats off.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375: 1687-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast to the canonical mechanism of transcriptional activation by HIF, HRE-independent activation mechanisms have rarely been reported (23Gustafsson M.V. Zheng X. Pereira T. Gradin K. Jin S.

Cell Res. 2017; 358: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerases (PARPs) are a family of enzymes that can modify proteins by ADP-ribosylation (26Barkauskaite E.

Cell. 2015; 58: 935-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The best-studied member, PARP-1, has been shown to be a key regulator of DNA damage and genomic maintenance (27Abbotts R. Wilson 3rd., D.M. Coordination of DNA single strand break repair.Free Radic.

Res. 2019; 780: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Currently, PARP inhibitors have been increasingly approved for clinical use, mainly for cancers with DNA-repair deficiencies (29O'Connor M.J. Targeting the DNA damage response in cancer.Mol.

Interestingly, PARP-1 regulates gene transcription through several mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, chromatin regulation, histone modification, and transcription factor binding (31Schiewer M.J.

Ohta T. et al.Loss of Parp-1 affects gene expression profile in a genome-wide manner in ES cells and liver cells.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The interaction of PARP-1 with NF-κB or E2F-1 increases the expression of the target gene CXCL1 or MYC, respectively (36Nirodi C. NagDas S. Gygi S.P. Olson G. Aebersold R. Richmond A.

PARP-1 also interacts with HIF-1α, and the complexes can activate HIF-1α target gene expression (38Elser M. Borsig L. Hassa P.O. Erener S. Messner S.

Interestingly, the loss of Parp-1 affects Notch3 expression, although the precise mechanism remains unclear (35Ogino H. Nozaki T. Gunji A. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Ohta T. et al.Loss of Parp-1 affects gene expression profile in a genome-wide manner in ES cells and liver cells.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In our study, we have focused on analyzing the molecular mechanisms of Notch3 regulation under hypoxia and demonstrated that HIF-1α and PARP-1 cooperatively increased Notch3 expression under hypoxic conditions. The association of HIF-1α and PARP-1 with a non-HRE sequence in the Notch3 promoter is indispensable for this regulation, which is distinct from the canonical HIF-1α transcriptional activation mechanism. These findings should contribute to further elucidation of this newly discovered unique molecular function of HIF-1α and the role of Notch3 in cancer. We first examined Notch3 expression during hypoxia in HeLa and SK-N-BE(2)c cell lines. These cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 4 or 24 h, and total RNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Significant induction of Notch3 mRNA was observed when we cultured the cells at 1% hypoxia for 24 h in accordance with well-known hypoxia-induced genes, such as PGK1 and CA9 (Fig. 1A). Then, we examined the protein levels of Notch3 in HeLa, SK-N-BE(2)c, and SK-N-FI cells by immunoblotting. Expression of full-length Notch3 was upregulated in HeLa and SK-N-BE(2)c cells, under hypoxia (Fig. 1B). Expression of the Notch3 intracellular domain (N3ICD), which is functionally more relevant, was elevated in all cell lines. Next, we examined the effects of HIF-1α on hypoxia-induced Notch3 using siRNA against HIF1A. One of two siHIF1As or a nonspecific siRNA (siNS) was transiently transfected into SK-N-BE(2)c cells, and the cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. Thereafter, we performed RT-qPCR analysis using total RNA from the cultured cells. Both siHIF1As significantly decreased HIF1A expression in normoxia and hypoxia, and in the siHIF1A-transfected cells, induction of Notch3 by hypoxia was attenuated as compared to siNS. In particular, siHIF1A-2 strongly inhibited Notch3 induction by hypoxia. The induction of PGK1 and CA9 by hypoxia was also attenuated in siHIF1A-transfected cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the levels of N3ICD and full-length Notch3 under hypoxia were decreased by siHIF1A treatment (Fig. 1D). Consistent with mRNA analysis, siHIF1As, especially siHIF1A-2, showed significant inhibition of Notch3 protein expression under hypoxia. These data strongly indicate that HIF-1α plays a role in the induction of Notch3 by hypoxia. To clarify the mechanism of the induction of Notch3 by hypoxia, we subcloned the 5′ region of the human Notch3 (from −188 to +77) into a luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL4.10 vector, and performed reporter analysis. The reporters were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h prior to luciferase reporter analysis. As a result, pGL4.10-Notch3 pro −188 bp had a much higher promoter activity than the empty plasmid vector pGL4.10 under normoxia. As expected, Notch3 promoter activity was upregulated under hypoxia, suggesting that the promoter region contained a hypoxic response region (Fig. 2A). To determine the region responsible for this induction, we constructed shorter Notch3 promoter reporters (Notch3 promoter −57 to +77 or −10 to +77) and performed a luciferase assay. The results indicated that the hypoxia response region resides in the Notch3 promoter from −57 to −10 bp (Fig. 2A). To elucidate the effects of HIF-1α on Notch3 promoter activity, we performed cotransfection analysis using the Notch3 promoter reporters and HIF-1α expression plasmid (2–826). As a result, HIF-1α enhanced the reporter activities of Notch3 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Since the promoter region is highly guanine-rich and has no canonical HRE sequence, the HIF-1α domain required for Notch3 promoter activation was next examined. For this purpose, we constructed a set of HIF-1α deletion mutants (Fig. 2B upper panel) and performed cotransfection assays. These results indicate that HIF-1α transactivating domains (HIF-1α 530–826) alone can increase Notch3 promoter activity, and the N-terminal DNA binding domain is dispensable for this activity. To further analyze the binding of HIF-1α to the Notch3 promoter, we performed a pull-down analysis using biotinylated Notch3 promoter oligonucleotide and streptavidin-sepharose. HeLa cells were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. The biotinylated oligos were incubated with nuclear extracts before incubation with streptavidin-sepharose. The bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting. HIF-1α was strongly detected in the biotinylated Notch3 promoter oligo mixed with nuclear extracts from cells cultured under hypoxia, but not under normoxia (Fig. 3A above image, lane 6). We next added nonbiotinylated Notch3 promoter oligos or nonbiotinylated control oligos together with the biotinylated oligos and the nuclear extracts in a competition assay. As expected, HIF-1α levels were evidently attenuated by adding the nonbiotinylated Notch3 promoter oligo compared to lane 6 (Fig. 3A above image, lane 7). On the other hand, the addition of the nonbiotinylated control oligo (Fig. 3A above image, lane 8) slightly decreased the HIF-1α level. This suggests that HIF-1α can bind to the Notch3 promoter region with no apparent HRE and likely activates Nocth3. Thus, our results raised the hypothesis that HIF-1α binds to the Notch3 promoter sequence in cooperation with other proteins. To identify proteins that bind to the Notch3 promoter, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins bound to the Notch3 promoter oligo were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Remarkable bands were observed near 110 kDa in lanes 3 to 6 (Fig. 3B). The band in lane 5, which was challenged with the nonbiotinylated Notch3 promoter oligo, was significantly weaker than that in the other lanes. The resolved gel was stained with CBB G-250, and the excised bands were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. S1). The 110 kDa band was unequivocally identified as PARP-1 (Table S3). To clarify PARP-1 binding to the Notch3 promoter, we verified it with an antibody against PARP-1 using the samples used to detect HIF-1α. PARP-1 was observed in both normoxia and hypoxia samples (Fig. 3A lower image, lanes 5 and 6), and the level was preferentially decreased by adding the nonbiotinylated Notch3 promoter oligo compared to lane 6 (Fig. 3A lower image, lane 7). Although little is known about the relationship between PARP-1 and Notch3, the physical interaction between PARP-1 and HIF-1α has been reported (38Elser M. Borsig L. Hassa P.O. Erener S. Messner S. Valovka T. et al.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 promotes tumor cell survival by coactivating hypoxia-inducible factor-1-dependent gene expression.Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Marti J.M. Garcia-Diaz A. Delgado-Bellido D. O'Valle F. Gonzalez-Flores A. Carlevaris O. et al.Selective modulation by PARP-1 of HIF-1alpha-recruitment to chromatin during hypoxia is required for tumor adaptation to hypoxic conditions.Redox Biol. 2021; 41101885Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Hulse M. Caruso L.B. Madzo J. Tan Y. Johnson S. Tempera I. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 is necessary for coactivating hypoxia-inducible factor-1-dependent gene expression by Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1.PLoS Pathol. 2018; 14e1007394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To validate this interaction in our experimental system, we performed a pull-down assay using extracts from HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged HIF-1α (F-HIF-1α). F-HIF-1α was induced by a prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor CoCl2 (Fig. S2A), meaning that the band (F-HIF-1α) is subject to the hypoxia-induced degradation control. By the pull-down via F-HIF-1α, endogenous PARP-1 was significantly detected (Fig. S2B), suggesting that HIF-1α interacts with PARP-1 even without the target DNA sequence. Since HIF-1α was pulled down with PARP-1 by the Notch3 promoter oligo (Fig. 3), we presumed that HIF-1α binding to the Notch3 promoter was dependent on PARP-1. To test this, a pull-down assay with purified PARP-1 and HIF-1α (Fig. S2C) by the combination was conducted. PARP-1 was successfully precipitated by the oligo, and remarkably, both the full-length HIF-1α and the C-terminal region (530–826) of HIF-1α (HIF-1α C) were efficiently coprecipitated with PARP-1 (Fig. S2D). This clearly indicates that the C-terminal region of HIF-1α interacts with the Notch3 promoter sequence via PARP-1. We analyzed the functional effects of PARP-1 on Notch3 expression using a luciferase reporter assay. We constructed a series of the following PARP-1 expression plasmids: full-length PARP-1 (2–1014), N-terminal PARP-1 (2–533), or C-terminal PARP-1 (531–1014) (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The Notch3 promoter reporter and the PARP-1 expression plasmid were cotransfected into HeLa cells and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Luciferase reporter assay showed that the full length of PARP-1 increased the Notch3 promoter from −57 to +77 bp reporter activity compared to the control (p3XFLAG), whereas no remarkable changes were seen in the Notch3 promoter −10 to +77 bp reporter. The results suggested that PARP-1 acted on the Notch3 promoter −57 to −10 region, and thus this region was used for binding analysis. Furthermore, induction of Notch3 reporter activity by the N-terminal or C-terminal part of PARP-1 was significantly lower than by the full length of PARP-1 (Fig. 4A, lower panel). These data indicate that PARP-1 plays a crucial role in the induction of Notch3, and both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of PARP-1 are required for the induction. We performed PARP-1 knockdown analysis using RNAi. SK-N-BE(2)c cells were transiently transfected with one of two siRNAs targeting RARP-1 (siPARP-1s) or siNS, cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h, and analyzed by RT-qPCR. No remarkable changes in PARP-1 expression under hypoxia compared to normoxia were observed. However, the expression of PARP-1 was significantly decreased by siPARP-1s (Fig. 4B), whereas no remarkable effect was observed on HIF1A (Fig. S3A). The attenuation of Notch3 induction under hypoxia by PARP-1 knockdown was statistically significant (Fig. 4B). Little or no remarkable difference was observed in the expression of the representative HIF targets PGK1 and CA9 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that PARP-1 does not directly act on HRE-containing promoters. We next analyzed the effects of siPARP-1s on the expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HES1. Mostly, siPARP-1s significantly downregulated HEY1 and HES1 preferentially under hypoxia (Fig. S3A). We also performed immunoblotting, and the protein levels of PARP-1 were significantly reduced by siPARP-1s. Similar to changes in the mRNA levels, Notch3 but not HIF-1α at the protein level was remarkably decreased in PARP-1 knockdown cells (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. S3B). These data indicated that PARP-1 plays a key role in the regulation of Notch3 expression. Next, we analyzed the effects of PARP inhibitors. We used BYK204165 (BYK), a selective inhibitor of PARP-1, and PJ-34, a PARP inhibitor (41Luo X. Ryu K.W. Kim D.S. Nandu T. Medina C.J. Gupte R. et al.PARP-1 controls the adipogenic transcriptional Program by PARylating C/EBPbeta and modulating its transcriptional activity.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 260-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SK-N-BE(2)c cells were treated with DMSO, BYK, or PJ-34, cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h, and analyzed by RT-qPCR. Expression of Notch3, but not PARP-1, under hypoxia, was attenuated by both inhibitors. BYK had a much stronger inhibitory effect on Notch3 expression under hypoxia than on PJ-34 (Fig. 5A). We also analyzed these inhibitors’ effects on the expression of PGK1 and CA9. The hypoxic induction of PGK1 and CA9 was significantly decreased by BYK, albeit milder than that of Notch3 (Fig. 5A). PJ-34 appeared to be less potent than BYK on Notch3 at both mRNA and protein levels in our experimental setting (Fig. 5A) and in others (41Luo X. Ryu K.W. Kim D.S. Nandu T. Medina C.J. Gupte R. et al.PARP-1 controls the adipogenic transcriptional Program by PARylating C/EBPbeta and modulating its transcriptional activity.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 260-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we used BYK to test the effect on HEY1 and HES1 expression under hypoxia. Compared to the effect on Notch3 expression (Fig. 5A), BYK effects on HEY1 and HES1 were weak or null (Fig. S4). This is possibly because these genes are not efficient targets of Notch3 in this cell line or longer BYK treatment is required for efficient suppression of the downstream targets, in addition to the unexpected nonspecific enhancement of the basal levels in normoxia. These data indicated that the hypoxic induction of Notch3 was highly dependent on PARP-1 and that more supporting data might be required to reveal the regulation of the Notch3 downstream genes (HEY1 and HES1) under hypoxia. At the protein level, PARP inhibitors reduced N3ICD under hypoxia without affecting PARP-1 levels per se. Interestingly, PARP inhibitors did not affect the protein levels of PARP-1 but clearly decreased HIF-1α under hypoxia (Fig. 5B), which is consistent with the previous observation with PJ-34, olaparib, or PARP-1 inhibitor (DPQ) (39Marti J.M.

Somewhat conflictingly, HIF-1α protein levels were not suppressed by siPARP-1s (Fig. S3B). More efficient suppression or a longer duration time than 24 h could be required to exert effects of siPARP-1s, which is an issue in future"
https://openalex.org/W4282976336,"Acidification of phagosomes is essential for the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Targeting machinery that regulates pH within the phagosomes is a prominent strategy employed by various pathogens that have emerged as major threats to public health. Nascent phagosomes acquire the machinery for pH regulation through a graded maturation process involving fusion with endolysosomes. Meticulous coordination between proton pumping and leakage mechanisms is crucial for maintaining optimal pH within the phagosome. However, relative to mechanisms involved in acidifying the phagosome lumen, little is known about proton leakage pathways in this organelle. Sodium proton transporter NHE9 is a known proton leakage pathway located on the endosomes. As phagosomes acquire proteins through fusions with endosomes during maturation, NHE9 seemed a promising candidate for regulating proton fluxes on the phagosome. Here, using genetic and biophysical approaches, we show NHE9 is an important proton leakage pathway associated with the maturing phagosome. NHE9 is highly expressed in immune cells, specifically macrophages; however, NHE9 expression is strongly downregulated upon bacterial infection. We show that compensatory ectopic NHE9 expression hinders the directed motion of phagosomes along microtubules and promotes early detachment from the microtubule tracks. As a result, these phagosomes have shorter run lengths and are not successful in reaching the lysosome. In accordance with this observation, we demonstrate that NHE9 expression levels negatively correlate with bacterial survival. Together, our findings show that NHE9 regulates lumenal pH to affect phagosome maturation, and consequently, microbicidal activity in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W4282984327,"Astrocytes play a critical role in brain function, but their contribution during ethanol (EtOH) consumption remains largely understudied. In light of recent findings on the heterogeneity of astrocyte physiology and gene expression, an approach with the ability to identify subtypes and capture this heterogeneity is necessary. Here, we combined measurements of calcium signaling and gene expression to define EtOH-induced astrocyte subtypes. In the absence of a demonstrated EtOH receptor, EtOH is believed to have effects on the function of many receptors and downstream biological cascades that underlie calcium responsiveness. This mechanism of EtOH-induced calcium signaling is unknown and this study provides the first step in understanding the characteristics of cells displaying these observed responses. To characterize underlying astrocyte subtypes, we assessed the correlation between calcium signaling and astrocyte gene expression signature in response to EtOH. We found that various EtOH doses increased intracellular calcium levels in a subset of astrocytes, distinguishing three cellular response types and one nonresponsive subtype as categorized by response waveform properties. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of astrocytes from the different response types identified type-enriched discriminatory gene expression signatures. Combining single-cell calcium responses and gene expression analysis identified specific astrocyte subgroups among astrocyte populations defined by their response to EtOH. This result provides a basis for identifying the relationship between astrocyte susceptibility to EtOH and corresponding measurable markers of calcium signaling and gene expression, which will be useful to investigate potential subgroup-specific influences of astrocytes on the physiology and pathology of EtOH exposure in the brain."

Although inference methods for a single gamma mean have been well studied, research on the common mean of several gamma populations are sparse. This paper addresses the problem of confidence interval estimation of the common mean of several gamma populations using the concept of generalized inference and the method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER). Simulation studies demonstrate that several proposed approaches can provide confidence intervals with satisfying coverage probabilities even at small sample sizes. The proposed methods are illustrated using two examples."

https://openalex.org/W4283017105,"Today, 50% of people with cardiac disease do not participate in rehabilitation. The HeRTA-study aims to develop and test a sustainable rehabilitation model supporting vulnerable patients in participating in rehabilitation and long-term physical activity.A feasibility study with a non-blinded pilot randomized trial was developed in collaboration with partners and cardiac patients to test a multi-component rehabilitation intervention across hospital, municipality, and civil society. The study runs from January 2020 to December 2024. Eligibility criteria for participants: a) diagnosed with either ischemic heart disease, persistent atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or have had cardiac valve surgery, b) residents in Hvidovre Hospitals uptake area, c) cognitively functional, d) physically able to participate in rehabilitation. Patient recruitment will be located at Hvidovre Hospital, Capital Region of Denmark, data collection at Hvidovre Hospital, Rehabilitation Center Albertslund, the Danish Heart Association, and in two municipalities (Hvidovre and Brøndby). Patients in the control group have access to usual care at the hospital: rehabilitation-needs-assessment, patient education, and physical training. After or instead of hospital rehabilitation, the patient can be referred to municipal rehabilitation with patient education, and a total of 12 weeks of physical training across sectors. Patients in the intervention group will in addition to usual care, have access to an information book about cardiac disease, patient supporters from the Danish Heart Association, Information materials to inform employers about the employees' rehabilitation participation, a rehabilitation goal setting plan, a support café for relatives, and follow-up phone calls from physiotherapists 1 and 3 months after rehabilitation to support physical activities. Patients with vulnerabilities will additionally receive patient education conducted in small groups, pro-active counselling by a cardiac nurse, psychologist, or social worker, paid transportation to rehabilitation, and paid membership in a sports association. Patients are computer block-randomized so patients with vulnerability are distributed evenly in the two study arms by stratifying on a) a cut-off score of ≥ 5 in the Tilburg Frailty Indicator questionnaire and/or b) need of language translator support. A power calculation, based on an estimated 20% difference in participation proportion between groups, 80% power, a type 1 error of 5% (two-tailed), results in 91 participants in each study arm. The primary outcome: rehabilitation participation (attending ≥ two activities: patient education, smoking cessation, dietary counseling, and physical training) and reaching at least 50% attendance. Secondary outcomes: health-related quality of life, coping strategies, level of physical activities, and sustainability regarding participation in active communities after rehabilitation. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05104658).Differences between changes in outcomes between groups will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Sensitivity analysis and analysis of the effect of the combined activities will be made. A process evaluation will clarify the implementation of the model, the partnership, and patients' experiences.Cross-sectoral collaborations between hospitals, municipalities, and organizations in civil society may lead to sustainable and affordable long-term physical activities for persons with chronic illness. The results can lead to improve cross-sectoral collaborations in other locations and patient groups."
https://openalex.org/W4283023572,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence beef meat exports in Tanzania, with a particular focus on the years 1985 to 2020, in enhancing the development of beef meat export-oriented policy in Tanzania, thereby enhancing beef exports in Tanzania. A time-series panel dataset was analyzed using both descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression analyses models. As per the descriptive analyses, beef meat exports reached the highest pick of 4,300 tons per year in 1990, whereas from 1991 to date, beef meat exportation in Tanzania has been in declining trends despite an increase in beef meat output and trade openness from 162,500 to 486,736 tons and 7.6 to 98.7%, respectively. Nevertheless, while the prospect of Tanzanian beef meat exports appears bright and promising, the industry will continue to encounter trade barriers and must stay competitive to produce enough volume and quality beef meat to meet the needs of its existing and expanding markets. This is because, Tanzanian beef meat competes for market share with beef meat from other countries in the global markets, where customers pay a premium for lines of beef meat that meet quality standards while discarding those that do not. This indicates that the quantity of beef meat produced has no relevance to its world market share, but its quality standards do. Furthermore, the econometric results revealed that the coefficients of the terms of trade, Tanzania GDP per capita, global beef meat consumption, trade openness, and beef meat outputs were found to be significantly positive (P < 0.05) influencing beef meat exports in Tanzania, whereas the trading partners' GDP per capita and exchange rate were not. The findings have varying implications as to what factors need to be addressed to further improve beef meat exports. From the farmer's perspective, better access to adequate funds as a result of increased income benefit from export will assist in improving beef cattle productivity and quality to compete effectively in the global markets. From the government's perspective, because trade openness promotes economic growth through export benefits, the Tanzania government and policymakers need to establish balanced policies to strengthen bilateral trade relationships to generate more opportunities in global markets."
https://openalex.org/W4283024028,"Biomarker directed selection of targeted anti-neoplastic agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies form an important aspect of cancer treatment. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of the tumor tissue is the method of choice to evaluate the presence of these biomarkers. However, a significant barrier to biomarker testing on tissue is the availability of an adequate amount of tissue and need for repetitive sampling due to tumor evolution. Also, tumor tissue testing is not immune to inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We describe the analytical and clinical validation of a Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) assay to accurately assess the presence of PD-L1 22C3 and PD-L1 28.8, ER, PR and HER2, from patients with solid tumors to guide the choice of suitable targeted therapies. Analytically, the test has high sensitivity, specificity, linearity and precision. Based on a blinded case control study, the clinical sensitivity and specificity for PD-L1 (22C3 and 28.8) was determined to be 90% and 100% respectively. The clinical sensitivity and specificity was 83% and 89% for ER; 80% and 94% for PR; 63% and 89% for HER2 (by ICC); and 100% and 92% for HER2 (by FISH), respectively. The performance characteristics of the test support its suitability and adaptability for routine clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W4283073953,"While corticosteroids have been hypothesized to exert protective benefits in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, data remain mixed. This study sought to investigate the outcomes of methylprednisone administration in an Italian cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Patients with confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively enrolled from a tertiary university hospital in Milan, Italy from March 1st to April 30th, 2020 and divided into two groups by administration of corticosteroids. Methylprednisolone was administered to patients not responding to pharmacological therapy and ventilatory support at 0.5-1mg/kg/day for 4 to 7 days. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for baseline differences between the steroid and non-steroid cohorts via inverse probability of treatment weight. Primary outcomes included acute respiratory failure (ARF), shock, and 30-day mortality among surviving patients.Among 311 patients enrolled, 71 patients received steroids and 240 did not receive steroids. The mean age was 63.1 years, 35.4% were female, and hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic pulmonary disease were present in 3.5%, 1.3%, 14.8% and 12.2% respectively. Crude analysis revealed no statistically significant reduction in the incidence of 30-day mortality (36,6% vs 21,7%; OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.18-3.70; p = 0.011), shock (2.8% vs 4.6%; OR, 0.60; 95% CI = 0.13-2.79; p = 0.514) or ARF (12.7% vs 15%; OR, 0.82; 95% CI = 0.38-1.80; p = 0.625) between the steroid and non-steroid groups. After IPTW analysis, the steroid-group had lower incidence of shock (0.9% vs 4.1%; OR, 0.21; 95% CI,0.06-0.77; p = 0.010), ARF (6.6% vs 16.0%; OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.64; p<0.001) and 30-day mortality (20.3% vs 22.8%; OR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.59-1.26 p = 0.436); even though, for the latter no statistical significance was reached. Steroid use was also associated with increased length of hospital stay both in crude and IPTW analyses. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or chronic lung diseases were more likely to be steroid responsive. No significant survival benefit was seen after steroid treatment.Physicians should avoid routine methylprednisolone use in SARS-CoV-2 patients, since it does not reduce 30-day mortality. However, they must consider its use for severe patients with cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities in order to reduce the incidence of either shock or acute respiratory failure."
https://openalex.org/W4283077115,"Nintedanib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor widely used to treat progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases because it slows the reduction in forced vital capacity. However, the prognosis for patients treated with nintedanib remains poor. To improve nintedanib treatment, we examined the effects of nintedanib on gene expression in the lungs of induced-rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease model mice, which develop rheumatoid arthritis and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified 27 upregulated and 130 downregulated genes in the lungs of these mice after treatment with nintedanib. The differentially expressed genes included mucin 5B and heat shock protein 70 family genes, which are related to interstitial lung diseases, as well as genes associated with extracellular components, particularly the myocardial architecture, suggesting unanticipated effects of nintedanib. Of the genes upregulated in the nintedanib-treated lung, expression of regulatory factor X2, which is suspected to be involved in cilia movement, and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2, which is involved in the pathology of pulmonary hypertension, was detected by immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization in peripheral airway epithelium and alveolar cells. Thus, the present findings indicate a set of genes whose expression alteration potentially underlies the effects of nintedanib on pulmonary fibrosis. It is expected that these findings will contribute to the development of improved nintedanib strategies for the treatment of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4282982667,"The generation of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) targeting two different antigens opens a new level of specificity and, compared to mAbs, improved clinical efficacy in cancer therapy. Currently, the different strategies for development of bsAbs primarily focus on IgG isotypes. Nevertheless, in comparison to IgG isotypes, IgE has been shown to offer superior tumor control in preclinical models. Therefore, in order to combine the promising potential of IgE molecules with increased target selectivity of bsAbs, we developed dual tumor-associated antigen-targeting bispecific human IgE antibodies. As proof of principle, we used two different pairing approaches - knobs-into-holes and leucine zipper-mediated pairing. Our data show that both strategies were highly efficient in driving bispecific IgE formation, with no undesired pairings observed. Bispecific IgE antibodies also showed a dose-dependent binding to their target antigens, and cell bridging experiments demonstrated simultaneous binding of two different antigens. As antibodies mediate a major part of their effector functions through interaction with Fc receptors (FcRs) expressed on immune cells, we confirmed FcεR binding by inducing in vitro mast cell degranulation and demonstrating in vitro and in vivo monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against target antigen-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the IgE bsAb construct was significantly more efficient in mediating antibody-dependent cell toxicity than its IgG1 counterpart. In conclusion, we describe the successful development of first bispecific IgE antibodies with superior antibody-dependent cell toxicity-mediated cell killing in comparison to IgG bispecific antibodies. These findings highlight the relevance of IgE-based bispecific antibodies for clinical application."

This is especially the case in the Global South, where their needs are poorly understood. This study presents findings on demographics, sources of information, sexual (risk) behaviors, and substance use in Kenyan queer womxn and trans men.An online survey among 335 Kenyan queer womxn and trans men was used to collect data on sexual health, risk behavior, health information sources, and substance use. The participants needed to have had at least one self-identified female sexual partner.The sample presented young, highly-educated queer womxn and trans men. A high incidence of childhood sexual trauma found was found. Risk behaviors included sexual activities with partners of multiple genders, violence, and low use of barrier methods. One in three participants had been treated for an STD in the previous year. The incidences of smoking and drinking were high, and a quarter of participants indicated having taken drugs at least once a month or more. The internet was either the first or second most important source of sexual health information for 44.1% of the participants, followed by schools (30.9%).Our findings indicate that queer womxn and trans men are at risk of negative sexual health outcomes due to a lack of appropriate information, risk behavior, substance use, and low uptake of sexual health services. Kenya's Penal Code still criminalizes consensual same-sex activities and may play a role in perpetuating barriers that prohibit them from making healthier choices. Developing tailored programming and policies require local, national, and global stakeholders to engage with the inclusion of queer womxn and trans men's sexual health needs within strategic planning and healthcare delivery."

https://openalex.org/W4283024548,"Background Accurate timing of BNT162b2 boosters to prevent breakthrough infections of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires reliable estimates of immune status. We hypothesized that spike IgG levels at 3 months after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine might predict subsequent spike IgG levels. Methods and results Spike IgG levels were tested at 3, 6, and 8 months after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in 251 Japanese health care workers (median age: 39 years, female: 187). The median level of spike IgG was 2,882 AU/mL at 3 months. This decreased to 875 AU/mL at 6 months and 579 AU/mL at 8 months. There were good correlations of log-transformed spike IgG levels between 3 and 6 months (r = 0.86) and between 3 and 8 months (r = 0.82). The correlation further improved after excluding three subjects who had possible COVID-19 infections (r = 0.91, r = 0.86). Log-transformed spike IgG levels at 6 or 8 months yields the following equation: log spike IgG at 6 (8) months = 0.92 (0.86) X log spike IgG at 3 months– 0.23 (0.18). Predicted spike IgG at 6 months of ≥ 300 or &lt; 300 AU/mL had 98% sensitivity, 47% specificity, and 94% accuracy for discriminating subjects whose actual spike IgG titers at 6 months were above or below 300 AU/mL. Corresponding values of predicted spike IgG at 8 months were 97%, 70%, and 93%, respectively. Conclusions We conclude that predictive formulae using spike IgG levels at 3 months after two-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 reliably estimate subsequent spike IgG levels up to 8 months and provide useful information in terms of vaccination booster timing."
https://openalex.org/W4283033615,"Objective The objective of this scoping review is to investigate what is known about the psychosocial functioning of adolescents with ADHD. All basic life environments (family, school and peer group) will be considered. Introduction Adolescence is especially critical for people with ADHD–natural maturation may be accompanied by changing symptoms of ADHD. A number of childhood difficulties transform during adolescence and contribute to problems in various areas that comprise psychosocial functioning. The available studies focus on selected domains of psychosocial functioning of adolescents with ADHD, however, to the authors’ best knowledge, there is no comprehensive description of this issue. The lack of such a description is the main rationale for conducting this scoping review. Inclusion criteria Pointing to the PCC elements (population, concept, context), the scoping review will include primary studies on the concept of psychosocial functioning (including functioning in the family, school and peer group). In the included studies, the term ""psychosocial functioning"" (or related) had to be used explicitly. The population will be adolescents (10 to 19 years old) with a formal diagnosis of ADHD (DSM classification) or Hyperkinetic Syndrome (ICD-9) or Hyperkinetic Disorders (ICD-10). There will be no restrictions on the research context. Methods The methodology of scoping reviews will be applied in accordance with the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). The following databases: Academic Search Ultimate, ERIC, MEDLINE, ProQuest Central, PsycInfo, Scopus, and databases under the Web of Science will be searched for primary studies in peer-reviewed journals, written in English and published since 1987. The analyses will be based mainly on frequency counts of the components of psychosocial functioning and population characteristics. The results will be presented in tabular form and supplemented with a descriptive summary. The protocol has been registered on the Open Science Framework: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MS82H [registration DOI]."
