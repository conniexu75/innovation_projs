https://openalex.org/W2056908956,"The aim of this study was to determine the brain regions involved in anticipation of a primary taste reward and to compare these regions to those responding to the receipt of a taste reward. Using fMRI, we scanned human subjects who were presented with visual cues that signaled subsequent reinforcement with a pleasant sweet taste (1 M glucose), a moderately unpleasant salt taste (0.2 M saline), or a neutral taste. Expectation of a pleasant taste produced activation in dopaminergic midbrain, posterior dorsal amygdala, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Apart from OFC, these regions were not activated by reward receipt. The findings indicate that when rewards are predictable, brain regions recruited during expectation are, in part, dissociable from areas responding to reward receipt."
https://openalex.org/W2010217187,"Frontal contributions to cognitive decline in aging were explored using functional MRI. Frontal regions active in younger adults during self-initiated (intentional) memory encoding were under-recruited in older adults. Older adults showed less activity in anterior-ventral regions associated with controlled use of semantic information. Under-recruitment was reversed by requiring semantic elaboration suggesting it stemmed from difficulty in spontaneous recruitment of available frontal resources. In addition, older adults recruited multiple frontal regions in a nonselective manner for both verbal and nonverbal materials. Lack of selectivity was not reversed during semantically directed encoding even when under-recruitment was diminished. These findings suggest two separate forms of age-associated change in frontal cortex: under-recruitment and nonselective recruitment. The former is reversible and potentially amenable to cognitive training; the latter may reflect a less malleable change associated with cognitive decline in advanced aging."
https://openalex.org/W2021814062,We investigate the signaling mechanisms that induce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon elongation by asking whether surviving neurons extend axons by default. We show that bcl-2 overexpression is sufficient to keep purified RGCs alive in the absence of any glial or trophic support. The bcl-2-expressing RGCs do not extend axons or dendrites unless signaled to do so by single peptide trophic factors. Axon growth stimulated by peptide trophic factors is remarkably slow but is profoundly potentiated by physiological levels of electrical activity spontaneously generated within embryonic explants or mimicked on a multielectrode silicon chip. These findings demonstrate that these surviving neurons do not constitutively extend axons and provide insight into the signals that may be necessary to promote CNS regeneration.
https://openalex.org/W2121042833,"Most Down's syndrome (DS) patients develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Astrocyte and neuronal cultures derived from fetal DS brain show alterations in the processing of amyloid beta precursor protein (AbetaPP), including increased levels of AbetaPP and C99, reduced levels of secreted AbetaPP (AbetaPPs) and C83, and intracellular accumulation of insoluble Abeta42. This pattern of AbetaPP processing is recapitulated in normal astrocytes by inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism, consistent with impaired mitochondrial function in DS astrocytes. Intracellular Abeta42 and reduced AbetaPPs are also detected in DS and AD brains. The survival of DS neurons is markedly increased by recombinant or astrocyte-produced AbetaPPs, suggesting that AbetaPPs may be a neuronal survival factor. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction in DS may lead to intracellular deposition of Abeta42, reduced levels of AbetaPPs, and a chronic state of increased neuronal vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2158281895,"We have shown that carbon monoxide (CO) generated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects endothelial cells (EC) from tumor necrosis α (TNF-α)-mediated apoptosis. This effect relies on the activation of p38 MAPK. We now demonstrate that HO-1/CO requires the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB to exert this anti-apoptotic effect. Our data suggest that EC have basal levels of NF-κB activity that sustain the expression of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes required to support the anti-apoptotic effect of HO-1/CO. Over-expression of the inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) suppresses the anti-apoptotic action of HO-1/CO. Reconstitution of NF-κB activity, by co-expression of IκBα with different members of the NF-κB family, i.e. p65/RelA or p65/RelA plus c-Rel, restores the anti-apoptotic effect of HO-1/CO. Expression of the NF-κB family members p65/RelA or p65/RelA with p50 or c-Rel up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes A1, A20, c-IAP2, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Inhibition of NF-κB activity by over-expression of IκBα suppresses the expression of some of these anti-apoptotic genes, i.e. c-IAP2. Under inhibition of NF-κB, co-expression of some of these anti-apoptotic genes, i.e. c-IAP2 and A1, restores the anti-apoptotic action of HO-1/CO, whereas expression of A20 or MnSOD cannot. The ability of c-IAP2 and/or A1 to restore the anti-apoptotic action of HO-1/CO is abolished when p38 MAPK activation is blocked by over-expression of a p38 MAPK dominant negative mutant. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HO-1/CO cooperates with NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes, i.e. c-IAP2 and A1, to protect EC from TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. This effect is dependent on the ability of HO-1/CO to activate the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway.

These molecules form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC; reviewed in Refs. 1Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Curr. Opin.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 1304-1315PubMed Google Scholar). These anti-apoptotic genes prevail over the pro-apoptotic signals thus preventing TNF-α-mediated EC apoptosis. Expression of these anti-apoptotic genes is dependent on the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (12Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhauslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Anrather J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4572-4582PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activity prevents the expression of these anti-apoptotic genes and thus sensitizes most cell types (13Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Anrather J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4572-4582PubMed Google Scholar), to undergo TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. The NF-κB family of transcription factors consists of several homo- or heterodimeric complexes of the Rel family, i.e. p50/NF-κB1, p65/RelA, c-Rel (Rel), p52/NF-κB2, and RelB (reviewed in Refs. 16Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar and 17Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). In quiescent EC, NF-κB is thought to be retained in the cytoplasm by a series of inhibitory proteins referred to as inhibitor of κB (IκB) (reviewed in Ref. 16Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Binding of NF-κB to IκB molecules masks the nuclear localization signal in the NF-κB dimers, thereby preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcription activity (18Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Signaling via TNFR-1 triggers the release of NF-κB dimers from IκB molecules via site-specific phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteolytic IκB degradation through the 26 S proteasome pathway (19Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 20Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Once released from IκB molecules, NF-κB dimers translocate into the nucleus to bind specific decameric recognition motifs in the promoter region of NF-κB-dependent genes such as the anti-apoptotic genes A1 (21Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), A20 (22Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18022-18028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Other anti-apoptotic genes are expressed by EC independently of NF-κB. These include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (reviewed in Refs. 25Choi A.M. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar and 26Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar), a stress-responsive gene encoding a 32-kDa enzyme that degrades heme into biliverdin, iron, and the gas carbon monoxide (27Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Although present only at basal levels in quiescent EC, HO-1 expression is rapidly up-regulated under oxidative stress conditions (reviewed in Refs. 25Choi A.M. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar and 26Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that HO-1 protects EC from undergoing apoptosis (28Soares M.P. Lin Y. Anrather J. Csizmadia E. Takigami K. Sato K. Grey S.T. Colvin R.B. Choi A.M. Poss K.D. Bach F.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The three end products of HO-1 enzymatic activity can potentially act as antioxidants and thus can exert anti-apoptotic effects (29Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2873) Google Scholar). However, CO seems to act in a dominant manner to mediate the anti-apoptotic effect of HO-1 (31Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M.K. Soares M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). This effect requires the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway (31Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M.K. Soares M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Given that signaling transduction pathways leading to NF-κB activation are critical in modulating EC apoptosis, we questioned whether HO-1-derived CO cooperates with one or more NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes to prevent apoptosis. We found that HO-1 requires NF-κB activity and the expression of A1 or c-IAP2 to exert its anti-apoptotic effect in EC. The murine 2F-2B EC line (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA), primary bovine aortic EC (BAEC), porcine aortic EC (PAEC), and human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were isolated and cultured as described previously (12Soares M.P.

Briefly, the number of random fields counted was determined to have a minimum of 200 viable transfected cells/control well (without apoptosis-inducing treatment). The number of viable cells was assessed by evaluating β-galactosidase-expressing cells that retained normal morphology under the apoptosis-inducing treatment,i.e. TNF-α or serum deprivation and control treatment (12Soares M.P.

The recombinant IκBα adenovirus expressing the porcine IκBα gene (ECI-6) has been described elsewhere (41Wrighton C.J. Hofer W.R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. De Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). All recombinant adenoviruses were produced in 293 cells (ATCC), extracted, and purified through two cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugations, and their titer was determined by limiting dilution in 293 cells as described before (41Wrighton C.J. Hofer W.R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. De Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Confluent BAEC were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 200 plaque-forming units/cell as described elsewhere (31Brouard S. Otterbein L.E. Anrather J. Tobiasch E. Bach F.H. Choi A.M.K. Soares M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared and subjected to electrophoresis as described elsewhere (12Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhauslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Anrather J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4572-4582PubMed Google Scholar). HO-1 was detected using a rabbit antihuman HO-1 polyclonal antibody (StressGen, Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, CA). p65/RelA, p50, and c-Rel were detected using rabbit anti-mouse p50, c-Rel, and RelA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). c-Myc-tagged p65/RelA was detected using an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10 clone, ATCC). HA-tagged A1, A20, and IκBα were detected using a mouse or rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). c-IAP2-Flag was detected using a anti-Flag M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Human MnSOD was detected using a rabbit anti-human MnSOD antibody (Stressgen). β-Tubulin was detected using anti-human β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Pierce). Peroxidase enzymatic activity was visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored in the form of photoradiographs (BiomaxTMMS, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Water soluble Actinomycin-D (Act.D, Sigma) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the culture medium, 24 h after EC transfection. The concentration of Act.D required to sensitize EC to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis was 10 μg/ml for 2F-2B EC and 0.1 μg/ml for BAEC. Human recombinant TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and added to the culture medium (10 ng/ml, 50 units/ml) 24 h after EC transfection. When used in combination with Act.D, EC were exposed to TNF-α for a period of 8 h. When used in the absence of Act.D, EC (i.e. overexpressing IκBα) were exposed to TNF-α for a period of 16 h. Serum deprivation was carried out by exposing EC to 1% fetal calf serum during 30 h. Briefly, CO at a concentration of 1% (10,000 ppm) in compressed air was mixed with balanced air (21% O2) in a stainless steel mixing cylinder before entering the exposure chamber. CO concentrations were controlled by varying the flow rates of CO in a mixing cylinder before delivering it to the chamber. Because the flow rate is primarily determined by the O2 flow, only the CO flow was changed to deliver the final concentration to the exposure chamber. A CO analyzer (Interscan Corp., Chatsworth, CA) was used to measure CO levels in the chamber. Cells were exposed to CO for 1 h before stimulation with TNF-α or serum deprivation and continuously thereafter. Cellular extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Light protocol (Applied Biosystems, Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Luciferase activity was assayed by adding 10 μl of cellular extract to 90 μl of a solution containing 24 mm glycl-glycine (pH 7.8), 2 mmATP (pH 7.5), and 10 mm MgSO4. Samples were read on the Microlumat LB 96P luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) using an injection mix consisting of 24 mmglycl-glycine and 0.1 mm luciferin (Sigma). Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase as follows: luciferase activity/β-galactosidase activity × 1000. Normalized luciferase activity is shown in arbitrary units. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere (12Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhauslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Anrather J. J.

All buffers were supplemented with 0.1 mm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Equal amounts of nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated (30 min at room temperature) with 100,000 cpm of double-stranded, [γ-32P]ATP-radiolabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Promega), and the resulting DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer at pH 8.5. The mass of the probes was ∼20 fmol. Supershift assays were carried out in the same manner, but nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of anti-human p65/RelA N-terminal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional hour before electrophoresis. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the RNA PCR Kit (TaKaRa, PanVera, Madison, WI). A total of 2 μl of cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction mix containing 10 mm dNTPs, 50 pg of 5′-prime and 3′-prime oligonucleotides, 2.5 units of LA-Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) and MgCl2, specific to each primer pair used.

PCR reactions were performed after a 4-min denaturation at 94 °C a repeating the cycle 94 °C, 55 °C, and 72 °C each for 1 min for the number of cycles specific for each primer pair in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200 (MJ Research, Las Vegas, NV). PCR products (10–20 μl) were analyzed in an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel. 2F-2B EC were cultured on gelatinized glass slides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), fixed in 75% acetone, and stained with anti-paxillin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-N-terminal p65/RelA antibody (2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC 372), or anti-p65/RelA nuclear localization domain sequence-specific antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primary antibodies were detected using biotinylated secondary antibodies and biotinylated-horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin reaction (Pierce). Nonspecific purified Ig isotype was used as negative controls. BAEC were cultured on gelatinized glass slides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and stained with an anti-N-terminal p65/RelA antibody (2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC 372). Primary antibody was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (F-9262, Pierce). Fluorescent labeling was detected (λex = 488 nm; λem = 518 nm) using a multiphoton confocal microscope (BioRad, MRC 1024) equipped with LaserSharp, version 3.2 software (BioRad). Inhibition of transcription by Act.D sensitized control EC transfected with pcDNA3 to undergo TNF-α-mediated apoptosis (60–70% apoptosis) (Fig. 1 A). Over-expression of HO-1 or Bcl-2-protected EC from apoptosis (5–10% apoptosis) (Fig. 1 A) (12Soares M.P. Muniappan A. Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Wrighton C.J. Steinhauslin F. Ferran C. Winkler H.

In a search for novel non-TZD ligands for PPARγ, T0070907 was identified as a potent and selective PPARγ antagonist.

At least two PPARγ isoforms exist, γ1 and γ2, resulting from transcription from two different promoters upstream of the PPAR gene (3Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R.

PPARγ1 is expressed broadly in many tissues, whereas PPARγ2 is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue. Both “gain of function” and “loss of function” studies strongly support a critical role for PPARγ in adipocyte gene expression and differentiation (5Lowell B.B.

Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Binding of ligands to PPARγ causes conformational changes in the receptor, in particular to α-helix 12 (H12), which is located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein and forms part of the transcriptional activation function (AF-2). When agonists bind to PPARγ, H12 along with H3, H4, and H5 form a charge clamp and a hydrophobic pocket that allows the recruitment of coactivator protein complexes that are essential for transcriptional activation of PPARγ target genes (6Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Although PPARγ, in isolation, is capable of binding to transcriptional corepressor proteins NCoR and SMRT in the absence of ligand, PPARγ does not interact with these corepressors in the context of the RXR heterodimer nor does the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer repress transcription of PPARγ target genes, unlike heterodimers of RXR with thyroid hormone receptor or retinoic acid receptor (7Zamir I. Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Two explanations for the difference in PPARγ/corepressor interaction on and off DNA have been offered. The orientation of PPARγ and RXR on a PPRE could simply inhibit the binding of corepressor (8DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.H. Ricote M. Ingrey S. Horlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PPARγ may be unable to stabilize a conformation of RXR that is permissive for corepressor interaction; unlike TR and retinoic acid receptor, PPARγ is unable to interact with H12 from RXR (9Zhang J., Hu, X. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because other NHR antagonists stabilize the interaction of corepressors with their cognate receptors, PPARγ antagonists or inverse agonists would be useful tools to study PPARγ/corepressor interaction. One way to test these hypotheses is to study the effects of a PPARγ antagonist or inverse agonist on corepressor binding. This avenue has not yet been explored. Both natural and synthetic ligands have been reported for PPARγ (reviewed in Ref. 10Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring compounds that have been reported to bind PPARγ include a number of fatty acids and eicosanoid derivatives such as 9- or 13-hydroxyoctadienoic acid and prostaglandin derivative 15-deoxy-Δ13,14-prostaglandin J2. The most widely used synthetic agonists of PPARγ are members of a class of antidiabetic agents known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), including rosiglitazone, troglitazone, and pioglitazone. More recently, a series of tyrosine-based PPARγ agonists exemplified by GI262570 have been shown to be among the highest affinity PPARγ ligands described thus far. Synthetic partial agonists identified include GW0072 (11Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E. Lenhard J.M. Hull-Ryde E.A. Mohr C.P. Blanchard S.G. Parks D.J.

However, relatively little is known about how these compounds affect PPARγ/RXR heterodimer function. Here, we describe a novel, potent, and selective PPARγ ligand, T0070907. By using a variety of biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that T0070907 is a PPARγ antagonist. Our studies suggest that T0070907 modulates the interaction of PPARγ with cofactor proteins by affecting the conformation of helix 12 of the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD). Finally, our studies reveal a functional asymmetry between the effects of PPARγ and RXR ligands on the activity of the permissive PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer. All PPARγ and RXRα proteins produced by in vitro translation and used in gel mobility shift assay were expressed from pET28b-based plasmids (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing inserts cloned into NcoI and NotI sites. For PPARγ, the following constructs were made: hPPARγ1, full-length human PPARγ1; hPPARγ1 ΔH12 (amino acids 1–461 of hPPARγ1); hRXRα, full-length human RXRα; hRXRα ΔH12 (amino acids 1–443 of hRXRα). The construct used to produce human NCoR (hNCoR) protein from the baculovirus expression system was made by inserting hNCoR DNA encoding amino acids 1948–2440 into the BamHI and NotI sites of the pFASTBAC HTa vector (Invitrogen). GST-PPARγ LBD was constructed by inserting hPPARγ1 DNA encoding amino acids 175–471 into the BamHI site of pGEX-2TK vector (sequence at the junction is 5′-GGATCCCATATG-hPPARγ1 amino acid 175). After incubation with 10 μmT0070907 for 4 h at room temperature in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, GST-PPARγ (12 μg) was purified on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The excised gel fragment containing PPARγ was digested with trypsin at 37 °C for 12 h without reduction and alkylation in 100 mmammonium bicarbonate using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Analysis of covalent binding of T0070907 to PPARγ was performed with a Voyager-DETM MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and an EsquireTMNano-electrospray Tandem Mass Spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Billerica, MA). The MALDI matrix was prepared by mixing α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (40 mg/ml in acetone), nitrocellulose (20 mg/ml in acetone), and 2-propanol at a ratio of 2:1:1 (v/v/v). An aliquot (0.5 μl) of the sample/matrix was spotted and mixed on a MALDI sample plate. After drying completely, samples were washed with 3 μl of 5% formic acid and then with Milli-Q water (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The MALDI-TOF was operated in reflectron mode with delay extraction. The mass spectrometer was calibrated externally using des-Arg-bradykinin (m/z 904.4681), angiotensin I (m/z 1296.6853), and Glu-fibrinopeptide B (m/z 1570.6774) (17Papac D.I. Wong A. Jones A.J. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The in-gel tryptic digest was desalted and concentrated prior to analysis by nano-ESI-MS/MS. The in-gel digests were extracted twice with 10 μl of a 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacidic acid solution. All extracts were pooled and dried to 5 μl with a SpeedVac. An additional 15 μl of a 0.1% acidic acid solution was added, and a 10-μl sample was loaded into a ZiptipTM (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with C18 resin for desalting. After washing the column with 1% trifluoroacidic acid (in H2O), 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% acidic acid was used to elute the sample into a nanospray needle. On the basis of the MALDI-TOF mass analysis results, the tandem mass spectrometric sequencing was only acquired on selected precursor ions (18Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). HTRF assays were performed as described previously (19Zhou G. Cummings R., Li, Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Reaction conditions were as follows: a 100-μl reaction volume contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 800 ng/ml anti-GST-(Eu)K antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 ng/μl GST-PPARγ, 1.5 μg/ml streptavidin conjugated with allophycocyanin (Streptavidin-APC, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 200 nm biotin-peptide, and 5 μl compound of interest in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as indicated in the figure legends. GST-PPARγ/anti-GST-(Eu)K (20 μl) and biotin-peptide/streptavidin (20 μl) were incubated separately for 1 h at room temperature before being combined with the remaining components, and the complete mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates (black polypropylene, Whatman), and fluorescence was measured on an LJL Analyst (LJL BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were expressed as the ratio of the emission intensities at 665 and 620 nm multiplied by a factor of 1000. Purified GST-PPARγ fusion protein (15 μg) was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% slurry in GST binding buffer,Amersham Biosciences) in GST binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) for 90 min at room temperature. After washing 5 times (5 min each wash) with 1 ml of binding buffer, the bead-bound GST-PPARγ protein was incubated with 7.5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated hNCoR protein (TNT T7 Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Translation System, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and the indicated ligand concentration in a final volume of 300 μl at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with binding buffer as indicated above, the bound protein was eluted with 20 μl of 2× SDS buffer at 95 °C, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. To determine the binding affinity of T0070907 to the PPARs, scintillation proximity assay (SPA) was performed as described (12Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Adams A. Berger J. Griffin P. Klatt T. Zhang B.

After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, 10 μl of polylysine-coated SPA beads (at 20 mg/ml in SPA buffer) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h before reading in Packard Topcount. [3H]Rosiglitazone was used for PPARγ, and [3H]GW2433 (21Brown P.J. Smith-Oliver T.A. Charifson P.S. Tomkinson N.C. Fivush A.M. Sternbach D.D. Wade L.E. Orband-Miller L. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G.

The sequence of the DNA probe used in the GMSAs was derived from the PPRE of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene (5′-AGCTGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCAGCT-3′).In vitro translated PPARγ (0.5 μl) and RXRα (0.5 μl) were incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), labeled probe (typically 40,000 cpm per reaction), various ligands, and with or without baculovirus-expressed NCoR (5 μg) (final volume, 20 μl) for 30 min at room temperature. Reaction mixtures were loaded on a 5% (38:2)polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 1× TGE (50 mmTris, pH 8.5, 40 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA) and separated in 1× TGE by electrophoresis at 4 °C. Gels were dried prior to autoradiography. Luciferase reporter assays were carried out following transient transfection of HEK293 cells using GenePORTER2 reagent (GTS Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured and induced to differentiate as described (24Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 3T3-L1 cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and induced to differentiate with 0.25 μmdexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 1 μg/ml insulin. Medium was replaced 2 days post-induction (and every 2–3 days thereafter) with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin. In a search for novel non-TZD ligands for PPARγ, T0070907 was identified to bind PPARγ with high affinity, capable of displacing [3H]rosiglitazone with an apparent Ki of 1 nm as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, T0070907 shows high selectivity among PPAR subtypes with a >800-fold preference for PPARγ over PPARα and PPARδ. In competition with the PPARα and PPARδ co-ligand [3H]GW2433 (21Brown P.J. Smith-Oliver T.A. Charifson P.S. Tomkinson N.C. Fivush A.M. Sternbach D.D. Wade L.E. Orband-Miller L. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 909-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), T0070907 has an apparent Ki of 0.85 μm to PPARα and 1.8 μm to PPARδ (Fig. 1B). The effect of T0070907 on the transcriptional activity of PPARγ in a cell-based reporter gene assay was examined. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct that contained the PPARγ LBD fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain, together with a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the Gal4 upstream activating sequence (Gal4-UAS). As shown in Fig. 2A, rosiglitazone activated transcription up to 20-fold, whereas T0070907 has no effect (or perhaps even a slight inhibitory effect) on basal transcription. In addition, T0070907 is a potent inhibitor (IC50 value in the nm range) of PPARγ transactivation in the presence of rosiglitazone (Fig. 2A). This inhibition is not due to cytotoxicity as the concentration required to kill 50% of cells is greater than 10 μm (data not shown). The specificity of T0070907 was also examined in cell-based reporter gene assays. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a GAL4-UAS reporter and expression constructs encoding the LBDs of PPARα, PPARδ, the farnesoid X receptor, the liver X receptor α, the liver X receptor β, or pregnane X receptor fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain. As shown in Fig. 2A, T0070907 at 1 μm has no effect on the transcriptional activity of any other receptor besides PPARγ. These results demonstrate that T0070907 is a PPARγ-specific antagonist. We next investigated whether T0070907 could block the induction of adipogenesis by various treatments of the adipogenic cell line 3T3-L1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the standard treatment of dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin promoted lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. In contrast, lipid accumulation in these cells was completely inhibited when cells were treated with both 1 μm T0070907 and the differentiation mixture. Similar inhibitory effects of T0070907 were observed when adipogenesis was induced by treatment with the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (data not shown). To understand the mechanism by which T0070907 antagonizes PPARγ function, its binding properties were first examined. That rosiglitazone was unable to displace T0070907 prebound to PPARγ suggested that the binding of T0070907 was irreversible (data not shown). To verify the covalent nature of the interaction between T0070907 and PPARγ, and to identify the site of covalent attachment, we performed proteolytic mapping studies via mass spectrometry. The covalent binding of T0070907 (mass of 277.7 Da) to PPARγ would result in a mass change of the modified tryptic peptide(s) by 241.1 Da. By comparing the tryptic digests of PPARγ with and without T0070907 treatment, a candidate peptide containing the T0070907 attachment site (amino acids 272–279, IFQGCQFR, m/z998.49 Da) was identified based on its mass shift to m/z 1239.56 (data not shown). The precise binding site on this peptide was determined with ESI-tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A). The calculated dominant y- and b-ion fragments of this peptide are shown at the top of Fig. 3A, with the ions observed in the mass spectrum underlined. The mass difference between the y3- and y4-ions (m/z344.1) identified Cys313 as the site of modification by T0070907. In addition, several double-charged y-ions and small internal fragment ions obtained also confirmed this conclusion. To confirm the importance of Cys313 in T0070907 binding to PPARγ, a mutant PPARγ was constructed in which Cys313was converted to a serine residue, and the corresponding recombinant GST-PPARγ LBD (C313S) fusion protein was expressed and purified. [3H]T0070907 was first incubated with either wild (wt) type PPARγ or the C313S mutant as described, and the reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3B, [3H]T0070907 was only able to modify the wild type protein (upper panel, autoradiograph), although equal amounts of wild type and C313S mutant PPARγ were added to each reaction (lower panel, Coomassie staining). Thus, Cys313 is necessary for the binding of T0070907 to PPARγ. The specificity of the covalent modification was examined in a whole-cell extract (WCE) made from HEK293 cells. Purified GST-PPARγ LBD fusion protein (Fig. 3C) was mixed with the WCE and 2 μm [3H]T0070907 and then separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. As shown in Fig. 3C, the exogenously added PPARγ was preferentially modified by [3H]T0070907 (upper panel, autoradiograph), despite the presence of many other proteins in the WCE (lower panel, Coomassie staining). By using the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) technology, we developed an assay to study the effects of PPARγ ligands on the interaction of PPARγ with fragments of coactivator or corepressor proteins. Reporter peptides of ∼20 amino acids in length were synthesized from sequences derived from various coactivator and corepressor proteins (Table I) (25Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 26Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The effects of various ligands on PPARγ binding to this collection of peptides are shown in Fig. 4A. The patterns that emerged from this peptide profiling have allowed us to distinguish between different functional classes of PPARγ ligands. First, known PPARγ agonists such as rosiglitazone, troglitazone, and the GSK compound GI262570 (27Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar) showed very similar peptide profiles. Rosiglitazone and troglitazone, which both belong to the TZD chemical class, were more similar to each other than to tyrosine-based GI262570. GI262570 recruited additional peptides (peptides 11, 19, 23, and 27), suggesting perhaps that PPARγ adopted a slightly different conformation when bound to GI262570, compared with the conformation assumed by the receptor when bound to the TZD compounds. In contrast, the novel PPARγ ligand T0070907 shows a unique peptide profile (Fig. 4A), exclusively promoting recruitment of peptides derived from corepressor proteins NCoR and SMART (peptides 2 and 3, respectively). Furthermore, compared with the Me2SO control, T0070907 seems to suppress the basal interactions between PPARγ and coactivator-derived peptides.Table IList of amino acid sequences and sources of peptides used in the HTRF peptide profiling assayThe L XXLL motif is in bold. Peptides are tagged on the N termini with biotin. Open table in a new tab The L XXLL motif is in bold. Peptides are tagged on the N termini with biotin. In order to confirm these results, more extensive titration and competition experiments were carried out with two peptides derived from a representative coactivator and a representative corepressor (peptides 1 and 2). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, rosiglitazone promoted the dose-dependent recruitment of peptide derived from coactivator DRIP205 to PPARγ, while suppressing the interaction between PPARγ and a peptide derived from corepressor NCoR. In contrast, T0070907 suppressed the interaction between PPARγ and the coactivator-derived peptide in the absence of ligand, while promoting the recruitment of the NCoR-derived peptide to PPARγ. T0070907 also effectively antagonized the effects of rosiglitazone in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm independently these observations by using an alternative nonfluorescence-based format, the effects of T0070907 on PPARγ/NCoR interactions were examined using a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 4D, rosiglitazone suppresses the interaction between the GST-PPARγLBD and NCoR in a dose-dependent fashion, with an IC50 consistent with its binding affinity to PPARγ. On the other hand, T0070907 promoted a dramatic increase in NCoR binding to GST-PPARγ consistent with the results observed in the HTRF assay. By having shown that T0070907 strongly promotes recruitment of NCoR to the PPARγ LBD in both HTRF and pull-down assays, we next used a GMSA to examine whether this cou"

It has been demonstrated recently and very unexpectedly that mutations in a gene coding for an ABC transporter protein, ABCC6 (MRP6), are responsible for the development of PXE, which is traditionally thought of as a connective tissue disease (1.Le Saux O.

The human ABCC subfamily consists of 12 members, and most of these are identified as active membrane transporters of various organic anions (for recent reviews, see Refs.5.Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 6.Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Natl.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, ABCC7 (CFTR), is a chloride channel that may also regulate other channel proteins (9.Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C.

Inherited diseases have already been also shown to be caused by the loss of function of active ABC transporters, e.g. missense mutations in the ABCC2 gene cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Dubin-Johnson syndrome) (13.Kartenbeck J. Leuschner U. Mayer R. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J.R. Bakker C.T.M. Otter M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Borst P.

Although a spectrum of mutations within the ABCC6 gene is clearly responsible for PXE, the functional relationship between alteredABCC6 gene expression and the PXE phenotype is still unknown. Recent studies reveal that human and rat ABCC6 are abundantly expressed in both liver and kidney (15.Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Belinsky M.G. Kruh G.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1342-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), two organs not thought to be involved in the development of PXE. It is not known, therefore, whether the pathomechanism for PXE involves aberrant ABCC6 activity directly within the affected elastic tissues, as would be expected for a heritable connective tissue disorder, or whether PXE is more likely to be a metabolic disease (18.Uitto J. Pulkkinen L. Ringpfeil F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) involving abnormal hepatic and/or renal function of ABCC6. If the major function of ABCC6 is primary active transport, a critical step to understanding the pathomechanism of PXE would be the identification of a physiological metabolite(s) transported by ABCC6. To date, however, there have been no data reported in this regard. One study on the rat ortholog of ABCC6 reported that an anionic cyclic pentapeptide was a relatively poor transported substrate for the rat Mrp6/Abcc6 (17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we describe the first studies of the transport activity of human ABCC6. We have established that this protein actively transports at least two anionic glutathione conjugates, and this transport is abolished by three missense mutations in ABCC6 that are known to cause PXE. These new findings establish that aberrant transport is a primary determinant in the PXE phenotype and should contribute significantly to a detailed elucidation of how such functionally null alleles of ABCC6 contribute toward abnormal elastic fiber assembly in patients with PXE.

[3H]NEM-GS was prepared from [3H]NEM (51.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by mixing the radioactive reagent in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) with freshly dissolved reduced glutathione in a 1:1.1 molar ratio. 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

A human kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA library, which was prepared from pooled RNA from 8 donors (7405-1, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to amplify full-length MRP6/ABCC6 cDNAs. Because the initial amplification reaction generated multiple products, the expected 4.5-kilobase DNA fragment was gel-isolated and reamplified. The amplified cDNA was cloned into a pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene), and the DNA sequence of six clones was determined by sequencing both strands using gene-specific primers. The sequences of all 6 clones unequivocally predict an Arg in position 64 of the amino acid sequence, whereas in one of the published sequences a Trp was found in this position (15.Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of exon 2 in 50 normal individuals also detected only the 64R allele (19.Germain D.P. Remones V. Perdu J.

These variants were not found in a panel of 200 alleles of unaffected control individuals (20.Le Saux O. Beck K. Sachsinger C. Silvestri C. Treiber C. Göring H.H. Johnson E.W. de Paepe A. Pope F.M.

The V1298F were present on 2 alleles of the 101 unrelated patients with PXE, whereas the G1321S was present on 1 allele (20.Le Saux O. Beck K. Sachsinger C. Silvestri C. Treiber C. Göring H.H.

Full-length cDNA was inserted into a baculovirus transfer vector (pAcUW21, Invitrogen), and the sequence of segment generated by PCR was checked by DNA sequencing. Sf9 cells were cultured and infected with the recombinant baculoviruses as described (22.Müller M. Bakos É. Welker E. Váradi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse B.S. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1877-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Virus-infected Sf9 cells were harvested, cell membranes were isolated, and membrane protein concentrations were determined as described previously (23.Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Sf9 total membrane preparations contained both plasma membrane and intracellular membrane material. A polyclonal antibody named HB6 was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 233–257 of the human ABCC6 sequence (Sigma). The location of this peptide segment within the human ABCC6 protein is shown on Fig. 1 A. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (23.Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-antibody interaction was detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The quantitative measure of expression level was determined by densitometry of the immunoblots. Isolated membranes were incubated with 5 μm 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP under non-hydrolytic conditions (at 0 °C) for binding or at 37 °C for nucleotide trapping. In the binding studies the membranes were irradiated with UV light in the presence of the labeled nucleotide, whereas in the case of nucleotide occlusion/trapping measurements, the membranes were first washed in the presence of 10 mm ATP and then UV-irradiated. Thereafter the membrane proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. 32P-Labeling was quantitated using phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). The identity of the 32P-azido nucleotide-labeled bands was confirmed by immunostaining of the same blot using the anti-ABCC6 polyclonal antibody (see above). ATPase activity was measured by colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate liberation, as previously described (23.Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Bakos É. Evers R. Sinkó E. Borst P. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport measurements were performed using a rapid filtration method as we have previously described (28.Bakos É. Evers R. Sinkó E. Borst P. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 29.Bakos É. Evers R. Szakács G. Tusnády E.G. Welker E.

ATP-dependent tracer uptake was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity on the filter obtained in the absence of MgATP (or the presence of 4 mm MgAMP) from those obtained in the presence of 4 mm MgATP. The figures represent the mean values of at least three independent experiments. Transport values were corrected for nonspecific transport observed in the control, β-galactosidase-expressing membranes. The relative amount of uptake-competent inside-out vesicles in different membrane preparations was determined from the rate of endogenous ATP-dependent45Ca2+ uptake (see Refs. 28.Bakos É. Evers R.

The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters of transport have been calculated by linear regression using a software (Origin 5.0; Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). To establish an experimental system to study the functional properties of both normal and mutant forms of the human ABCC6 transporter, we have amplified a normal variant of the human ABCC6 cDNA and expressed the protein in Sf9 insect cells. This approach was chosen because several mammalian ABC transporters have already been successfully expressed in insect cells. In general, these expression systems have yielded high protein levels in a functionally active state (23.Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol.

Recently the expression of the functional form of the rat Mrp6/Abcc6 in Sf9 cells has also been demonstrated (17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Transcription of the ABCC6 gene occurs predominantly in the liver and the kidney (15.Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Belinsky M.G. Kruh G.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1342-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); therefore, we used an amplification strategy to obtain the full-length cDNA from a human kidney cDNA library. Using this cDNA with a verified sequence, we have generated recombinant baculoviruses containing the wild type human ABCC6 cDNA as well as that of three ABCC6 mutant variants (V1298F, G1302R, and G1321S). These amino acid replacements are targeted to the C-proximal ABC domain (see Fig. 1 A) and have recently been identified as ABCC6 mutants that will result in PXE (20.Le Saux O. Beck K. Sachsinger C. Silvestri C. Treiber C. Göring H.H. Johnson E.W. de Paepe A. Pope F.M. Pasquali-Ronchetti I. Bercovitch L. Terry S. Boyd C.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 749-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus supernatants, and virus clones producing the highest level of ABCC6 protein expression were selected. By using these viruses a new protein band could be detected on the Coomassie-stained PAGE of membrane preparations from recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells. This protein band corresponded to the expected molecular mass of ABCC6 of about 150 kDa (not shown). To specifically detect the expression of human ABCC6 protein and its mutant variants, a polyclonal antibody, termed HB6, was generated against a specific ABCC6 peptide segment (see Fig. 1 A). As documented in Fig. 1 B, immunostaining by HB6 antibody occurred exclusively with the 150-kDa band in the ABCC6-expressing Sf9 cell membranes. Moreover, as shown by immunostaining in Fig. 1 B, all three mutant forms of human ABCC6 (V1298F, G1302R, and G1321S) were expressed in about the same amount as the wild type protein (94, 78, and 88% of the wild type, respectively, as measured by densitometry) and all with the correct molecular mass. The antibody HB6 did not recognize human ABCC1/MRP1, ABCC2/MRP2, ABCC3/MRP3, ABCC5/MRP5, or ABCB1/MDR1; HB6 also did not recognize the rat Mrp6 protein (all expressed in Sf9 insect cells). An antibody generated against the rat Mrp6 protein (kindly provided by Dr. Bruno Stieger, see Ref. 17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was, however, found to react with the human ABCC6 protein, expressed in Sf9 cells (data not shown). All native, functional ABC transporters show specific MgATP binding. To analyze such MgATP binding by the human ABCC6 protein expressed in Sf9 cells, we used a radioactively labeled photoreactive ATP analog, 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP. MgATP binding to ABCC6 was studied at 0 °C under non-hydrolytic conditions, and a covalent interaction between 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP and the proteins was induced by UV light. We found that human ABCC6 was specifically labeled by 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1 C). This labeling required the presence of Mg2+ and could be inhibited with excess (1 mm) of MgATP (Fig. 1 C). To detect the effect of mutations on ATP binding we have determined the ATP binding capacity of the wild type and the mutant ABCC6 proteins in the presence of various 8-N3ATP concentrations (2, 5, and 10 μm). No difference between the radioactivity incorporated into the wild type or into any of the mutants could be detected at the concentrations applied (ATP binding in the presence of 5 μm 8-N3ATP is shown on Fig. 1 C). In the following experiments we examined the ATPase and transport properties of the wild type ABCC6 protein in isolated Sf9 cell membrane vesicles. Because several previously studied ABCC/MRP homologs were shown to actively transport and/or interact with anionic compounds, especially glutathione and glucuronide conjugates, we initially examined the effects of several such compounds on membrane ATPase activity in Sf9 membrane vesicle preparations. It was found earlier that these compounds stimulated the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ABCC1 or ABCC2 (28.Bakos É. Evers R. Sinkó E. Borst P. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 32.Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, we found no measurable vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity of human ABCC6 either in the absence or the presence of any of the compounds examined, which included GSH and NEM-GS (up to 10 mm), indomethacin (up to 600 μm), probenecid (up to 2.5 mm), and benzbromarone (up to 100 μm). If the relative turnover rate of a transporter is low, ATPase measurements carried out in a native membrane background may not be sensitive enough to detect the function of an active transporter. Therefore, next we have studied the ATP-dependent uptake of labeled compounds in ABCC6-expressing membrane vesicles. Earlier, both ABCC1/MRP1 and ABCC2/MRP2 were shown to transport NEM GS, the product of a covalent interaction betweenN-ethylmaleimide and glutathione (28.Bakos É. Evers R. Sinkó E. Borst P. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 29.Bakos É. Evers R. Szakács G. Tusnády E.G. Welker E. Szabó K. de Haas M. van Deemter L. Borst P. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32167-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, the human ABCC6/MRP6 can also transport this compound in a MgATP-dependent manner. We found that the uptake of [3H]NEM-GS was linear up to 4 min at 37 °C and significantly greater in membrane vesicles expressing ABCC6 than in the control, β-galactosidase-expressing membranes. Linear time course of uptake was recorded up to 4 min at 2 different concentrations of [3H]NEM-GS, at 4 μm (Fig. 2 A) and at 100 μm (not shown). The NEM-GS uptake by human ABCC6 was completely inhibited by 1 mm orthovanadate. Uptake of NEM-GS was also eliminated after shrinking the vesicles by the addition of 1 m sucrose to the medium, indicating that the measured uptake is due to vesicular transport (Fig. 2 A). We then studied the concentration dependence of the NEM- GS uptake in ABCC6-containing membrane vesicles (Fig. 2 B). Because the ABCC6-specific NEM-GS uptake was measurable and still linear at 4 min of incubation (in the presence of 4 mm MgATP at 37 °C), we used these conditions for the transport studies. The apparentK m value of the NEM-GS transport was found to be 282 ± 54 μm, and the maximum rate of NEM-GS transport by the human ABCC6 was 106 ± 8 pmol/mg of membrane protein/min. Because both ABCC1 and ABCC2 actively transport LTC4, we also examined the uptake of this radiolabeled compound in the membrane vesicles containing ABCC6. We found that LTC4 was transported by ABCC6; the time course of LTC4 uptake is shown on Fig. 2 C. Then we investigated the concentration dependence of the transport of LTC4 by ABCC6 (Fig. 2 D). The ABCC6-specific LTC4 uptake was measured after the shortest technically feasible incubation time (30 s) in the presence of 4 mm MgATP at 37 °C. We estimated aK m value of 600 nm and aV max value of 50 pmol/mg of membrane protein/min of the LTC4 transport, performed by human ABCC6. The rat Mrp6/Abcc6 protein has been shown to transport an anionic cyclic pentapeptide endothelin receptor inhibitor, BQ-123 (17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have also determined the transport activity of this compound both for the rat and the human ABCC6 proteins (20-min incubation in the presence of 4 mm MgATP and 40 nm BQ-123 at 37 °C). An ATP-dependent uptake of the labeled peptide by both transporters was detected, but the rat ABCC6 protein showed about two times higher transport rate than the human ABCC6 under the above experimental conditions. The maximum transport rate for BQ-123 by human ABCC6 was estimated to be 6.5 pmol/mg of membrane protein/min. Because of the low transport rate the actual K m value could not be determined, and the above estimation is based on theK m value of the rat protein (17 μm, see Ref. 17.Madon J. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Meier P.J. Stieger B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have also examined the transport of 17-β-estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide, a preferred substrate of ABCC3, by human ABCC6 and found a very low, although measurable ATP-dependent uptake of this compound as well. Based on these experiments, we have concluded that, at least under the experimental conditions we applied, NEM-GS and LTC4 were the best measurable substrates for ABCC6 transport studies. We next examined the effects of various anionic compounds on the NEM-GS transport by ABCC6. We found that indomethacin, probenecid, and benzbromarone had an inhibitory effect. Fig. 3 shows these effects in the case of ABCC6 and compares these results to the inhibitory effects of these same compounds on the transport activities of ABCC1 and ABCC2. We found that benzbromarone (30 μm) inhibited almost completely all three transporters. However, 1 mm probenecid, which is quite effective in inhibiting both ABCC1 and ABCC2 (92 and 78% inhibition, respectively), only slightly inhibited the NEM-GS transport by ABCC6 (30% inhibition). Indomethacin had an opposite effect; 100 μm indomethacin inhibited the ABCC6-mediated transport of NEM-GS by 79% but inhibited NEM-GS transport by ABCC1 and ABCC2 only by 23 and 4%, respectively. These experiments clearly indicated an active, specific organic anio"

Further investigations indicated that p53-dependent expression of p21 blocked apoptosis of wt HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm, but not 250 nm CPT. Interestingly, blocking of the apoptotic pathway, by Z-VAD-FMK, in p21−/− HCT116 cells following treatment with 20 nm CPT did not permit the cells to develop properties of senescence.

The “p53 → p21 pathway” is activated in cells after DNA damage. Activation of this pathway temporarily arrests cells at the G1 and G2 checkpoints of the cell cycle, and terminates DNA replication and cell division (1.Bartek J. Lukas J.

These events provide the cells with enough time to repair damaged DNA and prevent accumulation of deleterious mutations in the genome that would otherwise be subsequently transferred to daughter cells (4.Lane D.P.

DNA damage is sensed by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein, which is a member of the phosphoinositol-3 lipid kinase family (6.Jeggo P.A. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R.

The development of many types of human cancers (>50%) is associated with the loss of p53 or mutations in p53 (5.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship between p53 status and the sensitivity of cancer cells to a variety of drugs, especially DNA damaging agents, has been extensively investigated (12.Lowe S.W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13.Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, a relationship was established between p53 and drug sensitivity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transformed by ras and E1Aoncogenes, showing that p53+/+ MEFs were more sensitive than p53−/− MEFs to the apoptotic effect of γ-irradiation or DNA damaging drugs (15.Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). In contrast, p21 was not required for apoptosis of the MEFs after DNA damage (9.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that apoptosis of cancer cells after DNA damage was p53-dependent, but p21-independent, and that cancer cells containing a mutated p53 gene should be resistant to chemotherapies that utilize DNA damaging agents (12.Lowe S.W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, this view was re-investigated when, by utilizing clonogenicity assays rather than short-term apoptosis assays, researchers were led to the conclusion that the p53 status was unrelated to the long-term survival of transformed MEFs after DNA damage (14.Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Also, studies of the RKO human colon cancer cell line and its derivative cell lines with altered p53 status led to the conclusion that the long-term survival of the cells after DNA damage was independent of p53 (16.Slichenmyer W.J. Nelson W.G. Slebos R.J. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4164-4168PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the apoptotic effect of DNA damaging agents on the HCT116 human colon cancer cells was shown to be blocked by p21, which was expressed by a p53-dependent mechanism (17.Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 18.Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Once again, subsequent results obtained from a clonogenicity assay led to the conclusion that the long-term survival of HCT116 cells after DNA damage was independent of either p53 or p21 (14.Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies collectively indicate that the requirement for p53 in the process of apoptosis depends on whether the cells are of rodent or human origin. In addition, contradictory conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between p53 and drug sensitivity because of variability in the experimental conditions applied to investigate the effect of DNA damaging agents (14.Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated why short-term survival, unlike long-term survival, of some cells after DNA damage is affected by p53 and/or p21. Furthermore, it should be noted that the loss of clonogenicity of cells does not necessarily result from loss of cell viability. In this context, it was demonstrated that normal human fibroblasts entered a state of senescence after DNA damage (19.Robles S.J. Adami G.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that loss of clonogenicity of cancer cells after DNA damage can result from an irreversible arrest of the cell cycle rather than loss of viability. Pertinent to this is the demonstration that p53 and p21 play important roles in senescence development of normal human cells (20.Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 21.Wynford-Thomas D. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22.Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 23.Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem.

Accordingly, it is plausible that p53 and p21 are required for senescence development of human cancer cells after DNA damage. To address this issue, we investigated both long- and short-term effects of CPT-induced and Top1-mediated DNA damage on wild-type HCT116 (wt HCT116) and isogenic p53−/− p21+/+ (p53−/−) and p53+/+ p21−/− (p21−/−) HCT116 cells (17.Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 18.Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that under treatment with a high concentration (250 nm) of CPT, wt HCT116, p53−/− HCT116, and p21−/− HCT116 cells underwent apoptosis indicating that apoptosis was independent of the cellular status of p53 and p21 status under this treatment. In contrast, treatment of p53−/− HCT116 and p21−/− HCT116 cells with 20 nm CPT resulted in them becoming apoptotic whereas wt HCT116 cells did not lose their viability but lost their clonogenicity. These results indicated that p53 and p21 were required to block apoptosis of HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm CPT. The loss of clonogenicity of wt HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm CPT was not due to the loss of long-term viability, but was rather the result of senescence development. Our results imply that the expression of p21 by a p53-dependent mechanism is required to fully develop senescent properties after DNA damage. Fetal bovine serum, X-gal, antibodies to BrdUrd (clone BU-33), Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies, and camptothecin (CPT) were obtained from Sigma. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, was obtained from BIOMOL Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Antibodies to p53 (FL-393; sc-6243), p21 (C19, sc-397), cyclin A (C19, sc-596), cyclin B1 (GNS1, sc-245), and Cdk2 (M2, sc-163) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Cdk1 (68516E), Rb (G3, 245), Top1 (556597), and Top2 (T90920) were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); and the antibody (9284) to phosphoserine 15 of p53 was obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The human autoimmune antibody to Top1 (614–451-5810) used for immunocytochemistry studies was obtained from TopoGEN, Inc. (Columbus, OH). The HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines (wt, p53−/−, and p21−/−) were generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). The cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Apoptotic fractions in cultures of control and drug-treated cells were identified by flow cytometry analysis of cells stained with propidium iodide (25.Pantazis P. Early J.A. Mendoza J.T. DeJesus A.R. Giovanella B.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 771-776PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of whole cell extracts containing 50 μg of protein were used for Western blot analysis as described (26.Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Han Z. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Kouttab N. Kidd V.J. Hendrickson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38748-38754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To detect senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-galactosidase) activity, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, washed three times in PBS (pH 6.0), and then incubated for 20 h in X-gal/PBS solution (pH 6.0) as described (28.Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was determined by measuring BrdUrd incorporation into DNA as described (29.Wei W. Hemmer R.M. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6748-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with BrdUrd (24 h for normal cells, and 72 h for CPT-treated cells), fixed for 20 min in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature, and the cell membranes were permeabilized with acetone and methanol (1:1). The cells were then incubated for 30 min in 2 m HCl followed by a 30-min incubation in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.5), washed three times in PBS, incubated for 60 min in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and followed by a 45-min incubation in PBS containing 2 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdUrd. The cells were then washed three times in PBS (10 min per wash), incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) against mouse IgG for 30 min, and washed three times in PBS (20 min per wash). BrdUrd-labeled nuclei were observed and photographed under a fluorescent microscope. The protocols for immunofluorescent detection of various cellular proteins have been described (30.Mohamood A.S. Gyles P. Balan K.V. Hollis V.W. Eckberg W.R. Asseffa A. Han Z. Wyche J.H. Anderson W.A. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1997; 29: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 300 cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well cell culture plate, and then incubated in 5 ml of medium for 2 weeks or longer. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed for 5 min in 5 ml of methanol. The methanol was removed, the wells were rinsed with water, the cell colonies stained for 10 min in 2 ml of 4% (w/v) methylene blue solution in PBS, washed once again with water, and then counted. To induce Top1-mediated DNA damage, wt HCT116, p21−/− HCT116 and p53−/− HCT116 cell lines were treated with CPT (31.Liu L.F. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Mao Y. Sun M. Sim S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 922: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed either to low (i.e. 20 nm) or high (i.e. 250 nm) concentrations of CPT, and the effects on cell proliferation and survival were monitored. Treatment of all three HCT116 cell lines with either concentration of CPT for 24 h was sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Treatment with 250 nm CPT resulted in apoptosis of all three cell lines (Fig. 1 A), whereas treatment with 20 nm CPT resulted in significant apoptosis only of p53−/− HCT116 and p21−/− HCT116 cell lines (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the response of HCT116 cells to the apoptotic effect of low and high concentrations of CPT was differentially affected by the p53 and p21 status. Western blot analysis of proteins from the wt HCT116 cells, treated with 20 nm CPT, demonstrated accumulation and phosphorylation of Ser15 in p53, i.e. activation of p53, and expression of p21 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, a very delayed expression of a small amount of p21 was detected in the CPT-treated p53−/− HCT116 cells (Fig. 1 B), indicating that most p21 expression in HCT116 cells after CPT treatment required a p53-dependent mechanism. Also, an accumulation and phosphorylation of Ser15 in p53, i.e. activation of p53, was observed in p21−/− HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm CPT (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results suggested that p53-dependent expression of p21 was required to block the apoptotic effect of 20 nm CPT on HCT116 cells. Since the effect of long-term treatment of cancer cells with low doses of CPT appears to be beneficial clinically (32.Gerrits C.J. de Jonge M.J. Schellens J.H. Stoter G. Verweij J. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33.O'Leary J. Muggia F.M. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1500-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the HCT116 cell lines were treated with 20 nm CPT in subsequent experiments. Treatment of wt HCT116 cells with CPT for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h inhibited, in a time-dependent fashion, expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdk1, E2F1, and activated, as shown by dephosphorylation, by the Rb protein (Fig. 2 A). Of interest, an initial decrease in Top1 expression was observed at 24 h of CPT treatment, but no further decrease was detected thereafter (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, Top2 expression was dramatically down-regulated after 48 h of CPT treatment, and virtually no expression was detected at 72 and 96 h of treatment (Fig. 2 A). The CPT-induced suppression of the expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdk1, E2F1, and Top2 was irreversible, because it remained unaltered for a prolonged period of time after CPT was removed from the culture medium as assessed by immunofluorescence studies of the cells (Fig. 2 B). Although the expression level of Cdk2 was not significantly altered during CPT treatment (Fig. 2 A), it was reduced to an undetectable level in the senescent cells after the treatment was terminated (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it appeared that down-regulation of Cdk2 was a very late event. After a 96-h treatment of wt HCT116 cells with CPT, the size of the cells had dramatically increased, the nuclei were enlarged and prominent, and the nucleolar content was highly heterochromatic (Fig. 3 A). Also, the CPT-treated cells stained positive, at pH 6.0 for SA-β-gal activity in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 A). SA-β-gal has been identified as a specific marker for senescent cells (29.Wei W. Hemmer R.M.

Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). This suggested that the CPT-treated wt HCT116 cells had acquired properties of senescence. To confirm this, wt HCT116 cells were treated with CPT for 72 h, and then cultured in CPT-free medium for 6 days. Subsequently, control and CPT-treated cells were assayed for their ability to synthesize DNA (i.e. to incorporate BrdUrd into DNA), proliferate, and form colonies. The results showed that there was practically no BrdUrd incorporation into the DNA of the CPT-treated cells (Fig. 3 B), and concurrently these cells had completely lost their clonogenicity (Fig. 3 C). The changes described above (Figs.2 and 3) are characteristic of senescent cells (20.Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp.

The results described above demonstrated that the presence of p21 in CPT-treated wt HCT116 cells enabled them to escape apoptosis and enter senescence, thus maintaining their viability. Therefore, the question raised by this observation was whether p21 selectively blocked the apoptotic pathway activated by DNA damage or whether it impaired the process of apoptosis in general. To investigate this, the CPT-treated wt HCT116 cells were also treated with 1 μm staurosporine to induce apoptosis by a pathway that is not associated with DNA damage (26.Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Ishizaki Y. Voyvodic J.T. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The cells were sensitive to the apoptotic effect of staurosporine at all time points tested (Fig. 4). These results indicated that the CPT-treated wt HCT116 cells were selectively defective, in the presence of p21, in the apoptotic pathway activated by DNA damage signals. The findings described above raised the issue of how p21 affects senescence of CPT-treated wt HCT116 cells. Is p21 required to simply block apoptosis and thus provide the cells time to develop into senescence? Or, is p21 required for blocking both apoptosis and inducing senescence? To investigate whether the CPT-treated p21−/− HCT116 cells were able to enter senescence while the apoptotic pathway was blocked, the cells were treated for 48 h, and 96 h with CPT in presence of 100 μm Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor that blocks apoptosis of cells subjected to various apoptotic conditions. The presence of Z-VAD-FMK blocked apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). At the end of the treatment, the cells stained positive for the presence of SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that they had become senescent. However, the expression and nuclear localization of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdk2, E2F1, and Top2 remained essentially unaltered (Figs. 5 C and 6). Furthermore, these cells rapidly underwent apoptosis upon withdrawal of CPT and Z-VAD-FMK from the medium (Fig. 5 D). Collectively, these results indicated that blocking apoptosis alone in the CPT-treated p21−/− HCT116 cells was insufficient to allow them to develop full senescent properties. Therefore, p21 appeared to be required not only to block apoptosis but also induce senescence of HCT116 cells after CPT treatment.Figure 6Nuclear localization of proteins in CPT-treated p21−/− HCT116 cells.p21−/− HCT116 cells were treated with 20 nmCPT in the presence of 100 μm Z-VAD-FMK for 96 h, and then fixed, and subjected to immunofluorescence detection of the proteins indicated. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment of wt HCT116 cells with 250 nm CPT induced the stable accumulation of p53, transient phosphorylation of Ser15 on p53, and the up-regulation of p21 expression (Fig. 7). This treatment did not significantly alter the expression level of Cdk1 and Cdk2, but induced down-regulation of the expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Rb, and Top2, and degradation of Top1 (Fig. 7). However, the E2F1 expression level was increased in the cells following drug treatment (Fig. 7). Nevertheless, the elevated presence of p21 suggested that it might be possible for wt HCT116 cells to develop along the senescent pathway following treatment with 250 nm CPT if the apoptotic pathway could be blocked. However, although the apoptotic effect of 250 nm CPT on the wt HCT116 cells was blocked by the presence of 100 μm Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 8 A), the cells did not develop any senescent properties, including the expression of SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, the cells rapidly underwent apoptosis after withdrawal of both Z-VAD-FMK and CPT from the medium (Fig. 8 B). Thus, even in the presence of elevated p21 levels, wt HCT116 cells were unable to escape apoptosis induced by a high concentration of CPT and enter senescence.Figure 8The apoptotic fate of wt HCT116 cells treated with 250 nm CPT. A, wt HCT116 cells were left untreated or treated for 72 h with 250 nm CPT in the absence or presence of 100 μm Z-VAD-FMK and then examined for induction of apoptosis and expression of SA-β-gal. B, alternatively, the cells were incubated in Z-VAD-FMK/CPT-free medium and subsequently apoptosis was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrated that Top1-mediated DNA damage induced by 20 nm CPT resulted in the apoptotic death of p53−/− and the p21−/− HCT116 cells, both of which were deficient in p21 expression (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, wt HCT116 cells that expressed robust levels of p21 became senescent, and remained viable for a prolonged period of time (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the CPT-treated wt HCT116 cells that remained viable were still sensitive to the apoptotic effect of staurosporine (Fig. 4). Staurosporine is an inhibitor of many protein kinases and triggers apoptotic signals in the absence of DNA damage (26.Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Ishizaki Y. Voyvodic J.T. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 44.Weil M.

Therefore, our results indicated that the ability of p21 to block apoptosis was selectively associated with the apoptotic pathway activated by a nuclear DNA damage signal (DDS) in CPT-treated cells (Fig. 9). Although p21 expression was also induced in wt HCT116 cells treated with 250 nm CPT (Fig. 7), it failed to prevent the cells from undergoing apoptosis (Figs. 1 A, 3, and 8). Since it has been shown that the extent of CPT-induced DNA damage in cells is proportional to the concentration of CPT used (45.Kaufmann W.K. Boyer J.C. Estabrooks L.L. Wilson S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the amount of DNA damage in HCT116 cells caused by 250 nm CPT was more extensive than that caused by 20 nm CPT. Thus, when HCT116 cells (wt, p53−/−, and p21−/−) were exposed to only 20 nm CPT a limited amount of DNA damage should have been produced, resulting in the production of a low strength DDS which was nonetheless sufficient to induce apoptosis. In wt HCT116 cells, however, this low dose of CPT resulted in the p53-dependent induction of p21 (Fig. 1). As a consequence of p21 induction, the commitment to apoptosis was blocked and senescence was instead induced (Fig. 9). When wt HCT116 cells were treated with 250 nm CPT, extensive DNA damage presumably occurred in the cells, which, in turn, resulted in the production of a high strength DDS. Although the high strength DDS induced expression of p21 in wt HCT116 cells by a p53-dependent mechanism, the presence of elevated p21 failed to override the apoptotic effect of the signal (Fig. 9). This observation also suggests that the mechanism mediating the apoptotic effect of 250 nm CPT (or high strength DDS) on wt HCT116 cells was in this instance not regulated by p21 but by another, unidentified, factor(s) that was defective in the cells. The fact that blocking"

A putative endocytic function of amphiphysin was supported by dominant-negative interference studies. We have now generated amphiphysin 1 knockout mice and found that lack of amphiphysin 1 causes a parallel dramatic reduction of amphiphysin 2 selectively in brain. Cell-free assembly of endocytic protein scaffolds is defective in mutant brain extracts. Knockout mice exhibit defects in synaptic vesicle recycling that are unmasked by stimulation and suggest impairments at multiple stages of the cycle. These defects correlate with increased mortality due to rare irreversible seizures and with major learning deficits, suggesting a critical role of amphiphysin for higher brain functions."

Moreover, crosstalk between the Rho GTPases appears to affect dendritic arbor development in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1983399409,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3, GIRK) provide an important mechanism for neurotransmitter regulation of membrane excitability. GIRK channels are tetramers containing various combinations of Kir3 subunits (Kir3.1–Kir3.4). We find that different combinations of Kir3 subunits exhibit a surprisingly complex spectrum of trafficking phenotypes. Kir3.2 and Kir3.4, but not Kir3.1, contain ER export signals that are important for plasma membrane expression of Kir3.1/Kir3.2 and Kir3.1/Kir3.4 heterotetramers, the GIRK channels found in the brain and the heart, respectively. Additional motifs in Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 control the trafficking between endosome and plasma membrane. In contrast, the Kir3.3 subunit potently inhibits plasma membrane expression by diverting the heterotetrameric channels to lysosomes. Such rich trafficking behaviors provide a mechanism for dynamic regulation of GIRK channel density in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2011994162,"Initiation of translation from most cellular mRNAs occurs via scanning; the 40 S ribosomal subunit binds to the m7G-cap and then moves along the mRNA until an initiation codon is encountered. Some cellular mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry sequences (IRESs) within their 5′-untranslated regions, which allow initiation independently of the 5′-cap. This study investigated the ability of cellular stress to regulate the activity of IRESs in cellular mRNAs. Three stresses were studied that cause the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2α, by activating specific kinases: (i) amino acid starvation, which activates GCN2; (ii) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which activates PKR-like ER kinase, PERK kinase; and (iii) double-stranded RNA, which activates double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) by mimicking viral infection. Amino acid starvation and ER stress caused transient phosphorylation of eIF2α during the first hour of treatment, whereas double-stranded RNA caused a sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α after 2 h. The effects of these treatments on IRES-mediated initiation were investigated using bicistronic mRNA expression vectors. No effect was seen for the IRESs from the mRNAs for the chaperone BiP and the protein kinase Pim-1. In contrast, translation mediated by the IRESs from the cationic amino acid transporter, cat-1, and of the cricket paralysis virus intergenic region, were stimulated 3- to 10-fold by all three treatments. eIF2α phosphorylation was required for the response because inactivation of phosphorylation prevented the stimulation. It is concluded that cellular stress can stimulate translation from some cellular IRESs via a mechanism that requires the phosphorylation of eIF2α.

The vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs is translated via the scanning mechanism (1Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves the recognition of the 5′-end of the mRNA and its m7G-cap structure by the translation initiator factor eIF4F, which is composed of eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E. This is followed by binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit/eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex and scanning downstream to the initiation codon (1Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Following GTP hydrolysis, the 60 S ribosomal subunit joins the complex to form the 80 S ribosome (3Hershey J. Merrick W. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that translation of some mRNAs is initiated by cap-independent mechanisms (1Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 4Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar).

This mode of initiation has mainly been described for viral RNAs, which are translated in infected cells when cap-dependent translation is inhibited (6Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Some cellular mRNAs also contain IRESs in their 5′-UTRs (7Martinez-Salas E. Ramos R. Lafuente E. Lopez de Quinto S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been shown that translation of some of these IRESs is regulated by the cell cycle (8Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), developmental stage (9Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J.

Many important features of how IRESs in cellular mRNAs mediate translation initiation are poorly understood. It is not known how many different types of IRESs are found in cellular mRNAs. In addition, the mechanisms by which IRESs are regulated and the number of different control mechanisms are poorly understood. untranslated region intergenic region internal ribosome entry site intercistronic spacer open reading frame chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cationic amino acid transporter-1 cricket paralysis virus double-stranded RNA double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR-like ER kinase endoplasmic reticulum luciferase firefly LUC renilla LUC poly(I)·poly(C) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium We have recently shown that the mRNA for the Arg/Lys transporter, cat-1, contains an IRES sequence (12Fernandez J.

This IRES is located in the 5′-UTR, which also contains a 48-residue open reading frame (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Translation initiation from this IRES is increased during amino acid starvation when global and cap-dependent protein synthesis is decreased (15Kimball S. Jefferson L. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 561-580Google Scholar), allowing cat-1 protein expression when amino acids are limiting (12Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of translation initiation factors plays a key role in this regulation (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). During amino acid starvation, phosphorylation of eIF2α increases, which decreases its activity, causing reduced levels of ternary complexes (16Pain V.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, eIF4F activity is decreased due to dephosphorylation of eIF4E and the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP-1 (16Pain V.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that phosphorylation of eIF2α by the kinase GCN2, whose activity is stimulated by uncharged tRNAs, is required for enhanced cat-1 IRES activity during amino acid deprivation (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this report, we expand these studies of the regulation of IRES activity by eIF2α phosphorylation. It is shown that two other types of cellular stress that increase eIF2α phosphorylation also stimulate translation mediated by the cat-1 IRES. Agents that cause the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trigger the unfolded protein response by activating the eIF2α kinase, PERK, in the ER membrane (17Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). We show that thapsigargin, which mobilizes sequestered Ca2+ from the ER, and tunicamycin, which disrupts protein glycosylation, increase cat-1 IRES-mediated translation by the activation of PERK. We also show that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which mimics viral infection (18Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), stimulates translation mediated by the cat-1 IRES by activating the eIF2α kinase, PKR. These results demonstrate that this IRES can be regulated by a variety of cellular stresses that stimulate eIF2α phosphorylation. We also tested whether other cellular IRESs can be regulated by these cellular stresses. The IRESs from the BiP and Pim-1 mRNAs were studied. BiP is a chaperone protein that assists in protein folding within the ER (19Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5795-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Transcription of the BiP gene is induced as part of the unfolded protein response (20Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The BiP mRNA is translated under these conditions via an IRES element found within its 5′-UTR (21Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Pim-1 is a serine-threonine kinase that functions with c-Myc in cellular transformation (22Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This mRNA is translated in poliovirus-infected cells via an IRES element within its 5′-UTR (23Wilson J.E. Powell M.J. Hoover S.E. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We show here that the activity of these IRESs is maintained but not increased by the cellular stresses that increase eIF2α phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that IRESs from cellular mRNAs are a diverse group because they are not all regulated by the same mechanism. The following bicistronic mRNA expression vectors have been described previously: pSVCAT/cat1-5′-UTRf/LUC, which encodes an mRNA containing CAT as the 5′-cistron and LUC as the 3′-cistron (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The intercistronic spacer (ICS) is the 270-bp 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). pSVCAT/BiP/LUC encodes an mRNA with the 5′-UTR of the BiP mRNA as the ICS (21Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Three bicistronic plasmids encoding renilla luciferase (RLUC) as the 5′-cistron and firefly luciferase (FLUC) as the 3′-cistron were used (23Wilson J.E. Powell M.J. Hoover S.E. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The IGR construct (SV40/T7ΔEMCV/Fluc-IGR/CrPVORF2) contains 207 bp from the intergenic region (IGR) of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) in the ICS (23Wilson J.E. Powell M.J. Hoover S.E. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24Wilson J.E. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Cell. 2000; 102: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The IGRmut construct contains the CrPV IGR with the CC residues corresponding to bases 6214 and 6215 of the CrPV sequence mutated to GG (23Wilson J.E. Powell M.J. Hoover S.E. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24Wilson J.E. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Cell. 2000; 102: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The Pim-1 construct contains the 5′-UTR of the human Pim-1 mRNA in the ICS in place of the CrPV sequence. Expression vectors for PERK, PERK-mut, GCN2, GCN2-mut, and eIF2α S-A, were kindly provided by D. Ron (New York University School of Medicine). The cDNAs in all vectors were inserted at the XbaI/Hin dIII site of pCDNA3. In these vectors, transcription is directed by the cytomegalovirus promoter (25Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Plasmid DNAs were transfected into C6 rat glioma cells (5 × 105/35-mm dish) using the calcium phosphate technique (26Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cotransfections were performed with equimolar amounts of plasmid DNAs. Cells were cultured for 48 h in growth medium followed by incubation under test conditions for the indicated times. Control cells were incubated in DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (26Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were starved for amino acids by incubating in Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with dialyzed FBS (26Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No difference in the regulation of the cat-1 gene by amino acid starvation was observed when Krebs-Ringer buffer containing all amino acids was used in place of DMEM/F12 medium (26Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were also incubated with 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin, 400 nm thapsigargin, or 100 μg/ml poly(I)·poly(C) (poly(IC)) for the appropriate times. To address the role of PKR kinase, wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (PKR+/+) or fibroblasts with the kinase inactivated by homologous recombination (PKR−/−) were used (27Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for LUC (Tropix Luciferase Assay Kit) and CAT activities as described previously (28Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Gronostajski R.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8813-8822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The activities were normalized to the protein content of the cell extracts, which was measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay. Cells transfected with dual luciferase plasmids were lysed, and RLUC and FLUC were measured using the Promega Dual Luciferase Analysis Kit. The expression of eIF2α and eIF4E was analyzed by Western blotting. The expression of phospho-eIF2α and phospho-eIF4E was analyzed using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of these proteins, all as described previously (13Fernandez J.M. Bode B. Koromilas A. Diehl J.A. Krukovets I. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 7: 7Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that translation from the cat-1 IRES is stimulated by amino acid starvation via a mechanism that requires phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 kinase (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is known that several other cellular stresses induce phosphorylation of eIF2α, including ER stress and the presence of dsRNA (18Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which occurs during viral infection. Consequently, we investigated whether these stresses also stimulate translation from the cat-1 IRES. Studying IRESs in the 5′-UTR of cellular mRNAs is difficult. It is believed that these mRNAs are translated by both cap-dependent and independent mechanisms under normal conditions. IRES-mediated translation may be activated under stress conditions when cap-dependent translation decreases (1Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to know how translation is initiated in vivo because cap-dependent and independent initiation cannot be readily distinguished. To study IRES-mediated translation exclusively, we used the bicistronic expression vector, CAT/cat1-5′-UTRf/LUC, employed in our previous studies (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mRNA synthesized from this vector contains open reading frames for the CAT and LUC enzymes (Fig. 1 A). The first cistron encodes CAT, which is translated by a cap-dependent mechanism. The second cistron encodes LUC, which is translated only if initiation occurs in the intercistronic spacer, which contains the entire 270-bp 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA. To test the effect of ER stress on translation from the cat-1 IRES, C6 glioma cells transiently transfected with CAT/cat1-5′-UTRf/LUC were treated with tunicamycin or thapsigargin (Fig. 1 B). Tunicamycin interferes with protein folding in the ER by blocking the glycosylation of Asn residues of newly made proteins (25Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin induces ER stress by depleting ER Ca2+ stores (29Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin and thapsigargin decreased CAT activity after 1.5 h, consistent with the inhibition of cap-dependent translation by these agents. In contrast, both treatments caused slow increases in LUC activity. Increases were only seen after 3 h of treatment, and activity then increased throughout the 12-h course of the experiment. Changes in both CAT and LUC activities are reflected in the LUC/CAT ratio, which increased by 3 h of treatment and was 16 times the control level by 12 h (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrate that translation from the cat-1 IRES is increased by treatments that induce ER stress. Moreover, the long lag and slow increase in translation are similar to the kinetics of increased translation during amino acid starvation (12Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test the effects of dsRNA, C6 cells transiently transfected with the CAT/cat1-5′-UTRf/LUC vector were treated with poly(IC). This treatment had effects similar to tunicamycin and thapsigargin (Fig. 1 B). LUC activity increased, but only after a lag. There was also a decrease in CAT activity. These changes are reflected in an increase in the LUC/CAT ratio. An increase was first seen after 6 h of treatment, and the highest activity was observed after 12 h, although dsRNA caused a smaller increase (7-fold) than the other treatments. These results indicate that dsRNA increases translation mediated by the cat-1 IRES with a long lag period and a persistent increase in activity. We have shown previously that amino acid starvation increases translation from the cat-1 IRES via a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2α, by GCN2 kinase. GCN2, which is active when uncharged tRNAs are present, is one of at least four kinases known to phosphorylate eIF2α, regulating the activity of this factor in response to distinct upstream signals (27Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). eIF2α is also phosphorylated by PERK kinase, which is stimulated during ER stress, and by PKR kinase, which is activated by dsRNA (18Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of ER stress and dsRNA on translation from the cat-1 IRES are mediated by PERK and PKR, the effects of overexpressing dominant-negative kinase mutants were studied (25Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of PERK, the effects of amino acid starvation and thapsigargin were studied in C6 cells cotransfected with CAT/cat1-5′-UTRf/LUC and an expression plasmid encoding either wild-type or dominant-negative PERK (Fig. 2 A). The stimulation of cat-1 IRES-mediated translation by amino acid starvation or thapsigargin was not affected by overexpression of wild-type PERK (Fig. 2 A). The 15-fold increase in LUC/CAT ratio is similar to that observed in cells with no PERK overexpression (Fig. 1 B and Ref. 13Fernandez J.M. Bode B. Koromilas A. Diehl J.A. Krukovets I. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 7: 7Google Scholar). Expression of the dominant-negative PERK mutant caused a decrease in LUC expression mediated by the cat-1 IRES, suggesting that basal PERK activity regulates IRES activity (Fig. 2 A, compare control values). Amino acid starvation of these cells increased translation mediated by the IRES. In fact, the LUC/CAT ratio increased by 15-fold as compared with untreated cells expressing mutant PERK, the same increase seen in cells overexpressing wild-type PERK (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, thapsigargin treatment only caused a 4-fold increase in the LUC/CAT ratio in cells expressing mutant PERK. This experiment demonstrates that PERK is required for the control of IRES activity by ER stress but not by amino acid starvation. To further support this finding, the effect of a dominant-negative mutant of GCN2 on the response of the cat-1 IRES to ER stress was studied. We have shown previously that overexpression of this mutant in C6 cells blocks the increase in cat-1 IRES activity by amino acid starvation (14Fernandez J. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, thapsigargin caused a large increase in LUC expression in C6 cells overexpressing mutant GCN2 (Fig. 2 B). These data support the idea that ER stress stimulates cat-1 IRES-mediated translation via PERK, whereas amino acid starvation stimulates translation via GCN2. A similar experiment was performed to examine the importance of PKR kinase. These experiments took advantage of a well characterized mouse embryo fibroblast cell line in which PKR has been inactivated by homologous recombination (27Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells (PKR+/+), all three cellular stresses caused increased translation from the cat-1 IRES (Fig. 2 C). The only difference between the results from these cells and C6 cells was the level of stimulation by dsRNA. In PKR+/+ cells, all three stresses increased the LUC/CAT ratio by the same extent, whereas the increase caused by dsRNA in C6 cells was only half that caused by the other two stresses. In PKR−/− cells, translation from the cat-1 IRES was induced by both amino acid starvation and thapsigargin, consistent with the idea that PKR kinase does not mediate the effects of these cellular stresses (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, stimulation of IRES-mediated translation by dsRNA was abolished in these mutant cells. Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that translation mediated by the cat-1 IRES is regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation. Moreover, they support the idea that this regulation involves several independent signaling pathways: GCN2 kinase mediates the effects of amino acid starvation, PERK mediates the effects of ER stress, and PKR mediates the effects of dsRNA. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of eIF2α by specific kinases is important in the regulation of the cat-1 IRES in response to cellular stress. To support this conclusion, we examined the effect of these cellular stresses on the phosphorylation of eIF2α. This was accomplished by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for either total eIF2α or the phosphorylated form of this protein. Both amino acid starvation and thapsigargin treatment caused a rapid transient increase in phosphorylated eIF2α levels (Fig. 3,A and B). The amount was increased within 30–60 min of treatment, was maximal at 1 h, and returned to base-line levels by 2–6 h. The amount of total eIF2α protein did not significantly change during these treatments, indicating that there was a transient increase in the extent of eIF2α phosphorylation. poly(IC) treatment also caused induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). However, in this case, there was a sustained induction, which began after 2 h of treatment and was still evident after 24 h. Significantly, for both ER stress and dsRNA, the increases in eIF2α phosphorylation and translation mediated by the cat-1 IRES follow different time courses (Fig. 1). For ER stress, the increase in IRES-mediated translation did not occur until eIF2α phosphorylation had increased and then returned to base-line levels. These kinetics are similar to those observed previously for amino acid starvation (12Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For dsRNA, IRES-mediated translation also increased several hours after the increase in phosphorylation of eIF2α. It has been suggested that IRES-mediated translation may increase when the translation initiation factor eIF4F, which is important in cap-dependent translation initiation, is inactivated (30Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The activity of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, an important constituent of eIF4F, is regulated by phosphorylation (30Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev.

We show here that inhibition of FLA1 expression by RNA interference in procyclic trypanosomes causes flagellar detachment and prevents cytokinesis. Despite being unable to divide, these cells undergo mitosis and develop a multinucleated phenotype. The Trypanosoma cruzi FLA1 homolog, GP72, is unable to complement either the flagellar detachment or cytokinesis defects in procyclic T. brucei that have been depleted of FLA1 by RNA interference. Instead, GP72 itself caused flagellar detachment when expressed in T. brucei. In contrast to T. brucei cells depleted of FLA1, procyclic T. brucei expressing GP72 continued to divide despite having detached flagella, demonstrating that flagellar attachment is not absolutely necessary for cytokinesis. We have also identified a FLA1-related gene (FLA2) whose sequence is similar but not identical to FLA1. Inhibition of FLA1 and FLA2 expression in bloodstream T. brucei caused flagellar detachment and blocked cytokinesis but did not inhibit mitosis. These experiments demonstrate that the FLA proteins are essential and suggest that in procyclic T. brucei, the FLA1 protein has separable functions in flagellar attachment and cytokinesis.

Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular protozoan parasite that relies on a single flagellum for motility. This critical structure emerges from the flagellar pocket, a specialized secretory organelle near the posterior end of the cell, and extends along the cell body to the anterior tip. The flagellum contains an axoneme with the classical 9 + 2 bundle of microtubules and a paraflagellar rod (PFR) 1The abbreviations used are: PFRparaflagellar rodpBSpBluescriptII SK− plasmidDICdifferential interference contrastdsRNAdouble-stranded RNAFAZflagellar attachment zoneFCSfetal calf serumFLA1 and FLA2T. brucei flagellum adhesion glycoproteins 1 and 2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinGP72T. cruzi flagellum adhesion glycoprotein of 72 kDaRNAiRNA interferenceTUBα-tubulinDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleEMelectroporation medium 1The abbreviations used are: PFRparaflagellar rodpBSpBluescriptII SK− plasmidDICdifferential interference contrastdsRNAdouble-stranded RNAFAZflagellar attachment zoneFCSfetal calf serumFLA1 and FLA2T. brucei flagellum adhesion glycoproteins 1 and 2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinGP72T. cruzi flagellum adhesion glycoprotein of 72 kDaRNAiRNA interferenceTUBα-tubulinDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleEMelectroporation medium that is comprised primarily of two proteins, PFR-A and PFR-C (1Bastin P.

The PFR lies adjacent to the axoneme in the flagellum and is slightly shorter; it extends from the point where the flagellum exits the flagellar pocket to the tip. The PFR is required for motility; inhibition of PFR-A expression by RNA interference (RNAi) ablates the PFR and paralyzes procyclic trypanosomes (3Bastin P. Sherwin T. Gull K.

Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Ser. Biol. Sci. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The FAZ is made up of an electron-dense cytoplasmic filament and a specialized set of four microtubules that are associated with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (for a recent review of the T. brucei cytoskeleton, see Ref. 6Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The filament is invariably located in a unique gap between two microtubules in the subpelicular cortex with the four microtubules always found immediately to the left when viewed from the posterior end. Cross-links extend from the filament across the cell and flagellum membranes and into the PFR. During cell division, the flagellum and FAZ must be duplicated and segregated to the daughter cells. Synthesis of the new flagellum begins with duplication of the basal bodies at ∼0.41 cell cycle units (5Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Ser. Biol. Sci. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,7Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new axoneme grows out from the basal body and emerges from the flagellar pocket. Axoneme emergence is followed by construction of the new PFR beginning at about 0.52 cell cycle units (5Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Ser. Biol. Sci. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 7Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of the new FAZ begins before the construction of the new PFR; however, the PFR is then synthesized at a greater rate, and the formation of the new FAZ lags behind that of the new flagellum (8Kohl L. Sherwin T. Gull K. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1999; 46: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Following mitosis and kinetoplast replication, a cleavage furrow that begins at the anterior tip and follows a helical path to the posterior end of the cell separates the daughter cells (5Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Ser. Biol. Sci. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In order for each cell to receive a flagellum and a FAZ, cleavage must occur between the old and the new FAZ. Given its invariant location and its unique link between the flagellum, basal bodies, and kinetoplast, the FAZ has been proposed to “mark the position and direction of the cleavage furrow” (9Robinson D.R. Sherwin T. Ploubidou A. Byard E.H. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although the identities of most components of the FAZ are unknown, at least one known T. brucei protein, flagellum adhesion glycoprotein 1 (FLA1), plays a critical role in flagellar attachment. FLA1 is a homolog of Trypanosoma cruzi GP72, an immunodominant protein localized to the junction between the T. cruzi flagella and the cell body (10Ferguson M.A.J. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Cooper R. Inverso J.A. Espinosa M. Nogueira N. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Haynes P.A. Russell D.G. Cross G.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2979-2988PubMed Google Scholar). During the T. cruzi life cycle, GP72 is expressed primarily in the epimastigote (insect) stage and to a lesser extent in the metacyclic trypomastigote stage (11Cooper R. Inverso J.A. Espinosa M. Nogueira N. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Deletion of both copies of GP72 from the diploid T. cruzi genome yielded viable parasites with flagella that were detached from the cell body (13Cooper R. de Jesus A.R. Cross G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The GP72 null mutants were immobile but divided at a normal rate in cell culture (13Cooper R. de Jesus A.R. Cross G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the loss of GP72 dramatically reduced survival in the insect host (14Ribeiro de Jesus A. Cooper R. Espinosa M. Gomes J.E. Garcia E.S. Paul S. Cross G.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar). FLA1 was identified in T. brucei as part of an expressed sequence tag sequencing project and is expressed in both the insect (procyclic) and mammalian (bloodstream) stages (15el-Sayed N.M. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,16Nozaki T. Haynes P.A. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 546-amino acid FLA1 protein is 44% identical and 63% similar to GP72 but lacks a threonine-proline rich region found in the middle of the 581-amino acid GP72. FLA1 and GP72 have no significant homology to any other protein in the GenBankTM data base. Both FLA1 and GP72 have amino-terminal signal sequences that direct the proteins to the secretory pathway, a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors the proteins in the cell membrane, and a predicted 16-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (16Nozaki T. Haynes P.A. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar to GP72, FLA1 is localized mainly to the region between the cell body and the flagella (16Nozaki T. Haynes P.A. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to GP72, however, attempts to delete both copies of FLA1 from the T. brucei genome were unsuccessful (16Nozaki T. Haynes P.A. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that FLA1 is essential in T. brucei. We have used RNAi to transiently interfere with FLA1 expression in procyclic trypanosomes and have demonstrated that FLA1 is required for flagellum attachment to the cell body (17LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These initial studies suggested that cells in which FLA1 expression was inhibited were unable to divide. To more fully evaluate the effect of the loss of FLA1, we have established permanently transfected procyclic and bloodstream cell lines that express FLA1 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) upon induction with tetracycline. As expected, the loss of FLA1 was accompanied by flagellar detachment from the cell body. Cells expressing FLA1 dsRNA were unable to divide but continued to proceed through mitosis. Surprisingly, the expression of T. cruzi GP72 in procyclic T. brucei cells did not rescue either the flagellum detachment or the cytokinesis defect but instead itself caused flagellum detachment. Procyclic T. brucei expressing T. cruzi GP72 had detached flagella but were able to divide, suggesting that FLA1, but not necessarily flagellum attachment, is required for cytokinesis. We also identified an additional FLA1-like gene, called FLA2, whose sequence is similar enough to FLA1 to be inhibited by RNAi directed against FLA1. Plasmid p2T7TiA/GFP was generated from plasmid pLEW82 (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) as follows. A SacII/HindIII fragment from pLEW82 was blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and inserted into SalI-digested, blunt-ended pLEW82 (plasmid A). The T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences from pLEW82 were subcloned into the PstI site of pBluescriptII SK− (pBS). The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRV and SmaI, and the fragment containing the T7 terminators was ligated into the blunted SacII site from plasmid A (plasmid B). The GFP gene from pHD:HX-GFP (19Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was excised with Hin dIII and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pBS, giving pBS/GFP-H/B. The GFP gene and the multiple cloning sequence from pBS/GFP-H/B were excised with KpnI and SacI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into SmaI-digested plasmid B (plasmid C). To fuse the T. brucei rRNA promoter to the BLE selectable marker gene, a KpnI/SmaI fragment containing the rRNA promoter from pHD496 and a SmaI/NcoI fragment from pLEW82 containing the actin 5′ untranslated region and the 5′ end of BLE was inserted into KpnI/NcoI-digested pBS/GFP-H/B via triple ligation (plasmid D). The 3′ end of BLE and the 3′ untranslated region were excised from pLEW82 with NcoI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of plasmid D to regenerate a complete BLE gene (plasmid E). The rRNA promoter-BLE construct from plasmid E was liberated with PstI and KpnI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into the blunt-ended NheI site from plasmid C (plasmid F). To eliminate the NotI site introduced with GFP, plasmid F was partially digested with NotI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligated, yielding p2T7TiA/GFP. To create p2T7TiB/GFP, the rDNA spacer region and T7 terminators from an isolate of plasmid B with the T7 terminators in the correct orientation was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-ATCCGCGGCTAGATCTCTATCAC-3′ and 5′-CAGGAATTCGAGCTCATATAGTTG-3′ and then cloned into pCR 2.1 using the Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) (plasmid G). A NotI/SacII fragment from plasmid G was ligated into the corresponding sites of p2T7TiA/GFP, yielding p2T7TiB/GFP. Plasmids p2T7TiA/TUB and p2T7TiB/TUB were generated by digesting pBS/TUB (17LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with Hin dIII and BamHI and ligating a 486-bp fragment from the 5′ end of the α-tubulin gene into the Hin dIII and BamHI sites of p2T7TiA/GFP and p2T7TiB/GFP. A 1000-bp fragment from the 5′ end of FLA1 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATCCACTCCATCACCTTCTT-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATGTTTCCCAACGGTAGATCCGT-3′ (underlines indicate added XbaI sites), digested with XbaI, and ligated into XbaI-digested p2T7TiA/GFP and p2T7TiB/GFP to give p2T7TiA/FLA1 and p2T7Ti B/FLA1. Plasmid pSk1-GFP was generated from plasmid pXS2:pac (20Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which encodes the puromycin resistance gene (PAC). The GFP coding region from pBS/GFP-H/B was excised with Hin dIII and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pXS2:pac (plasmid H). A KpnI/NotI fragment of plasmid H containing in order the EP promoter, the GFP coding region flanked by the EP intergenic region, PAC, and the TUB intergenic region was excised and ligated into the KpnI and NotI sites of plasmid pSk1 (pBluescript II SK− in which the T7 and T3 promoters have been excised), producing plasmid pSk1-GFP. To create plasmid pSk1-GP72, the 1745-bp coding region of the T. cruzi gene GP72 (GenBankTM accession number M65021) (13Cooper R. de Jesus A.R. Cross G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from the T. cruzi Y strain genome using primers 5′-GACGTGATGTTTTCAAAAAGGACG-3′ and 5′-AATCTACATGGGTGGAACAAGAAT-3′ and then cloned into pCR 2.1 using the Topo TA cloning kit (plasmid I) (Invitrogen). After verifying by DNA sequence determination that the GP72 gene contained no mutations, a Hin dIII/EcoRI fragment from plasmid I was ligated into the corresponding sites of pXS2:pac (plasmid J). The KpnI/NotI fragment isolated from plasmid J was ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pSk1, yielding pSk1-GP72. Procyclic T. brucei29-13 cells (T7RNAP NEO TETR HYG) and the bloodstream T. brucei single marker cell line (T7RNAP TETR NEO) were gifts from G. A. M. Cross (Rockefeller University) (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The T. brucei 29-13 cells were maintained in Cunningham's SM (semi-defined maintenance) media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and were transfected with NotI-linearized plasmids (5–10 μg) essentially as described (19Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Log phase cells (5 × 106ml−1) were collected by centrifugation, washed with EM (a 3:1 mixture of cytomix (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mmCaCl2, 10 mmKiHPO 4−, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6) and phosphoste-sucrose buffer (277 mm sucrose, 1 mmMgCl2, 7 mmKiHPO 4−, pH 7.4)), and suspended in EM at a concentration of 2.5 × 107 ml−1. 0.45 ml of cells were mixed with 0.1 ml of linearized DNA in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette and subjected to two pulses from a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator set at 1500 V and 25 microfarads. After electroporation, cells (0.2–0.3 ml) were transferred to 4 ml of fresh SM + 10% FCS and allowed to recover overnight. Stable transformants were selected in 15 μg ml−1 G418, 50 μg ml−1 hygromycin, 2.5 μg ml−1 phleomycin and, if necessary, 1.0 μg ml−1 puromycin. After drug-resistant pooled lines were established, clonal lines were obtained by limiting dilution. The bloodstream T. brucei single marker line was grown in HMI-9 medium (21Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Doyle J.J. Cross G.A. Parasitology. 1980; 80: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected essentially as described for procyclic 29-13 cells. Logarithmic phase single marker cells (∼1.0 × 106 ml−1) were collected by centrifugation, washed with EM, and resuspended in EM at a concentration of 2 × 107 ml−1. 0.45 ml of cells were mixed with 5–10 μg of linerized DNA in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette and subjected to a single pulse from a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator set at 1500 V and 25 microfarads. Cells were transferred to 12 ml of HMI-9 + 10% FCS and distributed among wells in a 24-well tissue culture plate. After recovering overnight, an equal volume of HMI-9 + 10% FCS plus 5 μg ml−1 G418 and 5 μg ml−1 phleomycin was added to the wells. Drug-resistant cells typically grew out within 7 days. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images of living procyclic cells and paraformaldehyde-fixed bloodstream cells were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective and LSM image browser software. To visualize nuclei, procyclic and bloodstream cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained with 1 μg ml−1 DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). DIC and fluorescent images of the same field were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a ×100 oil immersion objective. Images were captured with an RT Spot Camera and Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Group). All images were adjusted for brightness and contrast and cropped in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Photosystems Inc., San Jose CA). We have shown previously that two opposing bacteriophage T7 promoters can be used to generate RNAi in procyclic T. brucei expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (17LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Using this system, we demonstrated that FLA1 is required for flagellar attachment in procyclic T. brucei. These experiments also suggested that cells with detached flagella are unable to divide, but we were unable to test this hypothesis because the original version of the two-T7 promoter plasmid (p2T7) is not maintained episomally. Thus, to extend the length of time that RNAi can be maintained and to regulate the expression of RNAi, we developed an integratable version of the two-T7 promoter vector (p2T7Ti) that utilizes two tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters to generate sense and antisense RNA from the DNA sequences placed between them (Fig. 1). Two versions of p2T7Ti are shown in Fig. 1 that differ only in the orientation of the second (rightmost) set of T7 transcription terminators (Fig. 1, the symbols ΩΩ) that flank the T7 promoters. The T7 transcription terminators were included to prevent T7 RNA polymerase transcription from continuing through adjacent regions and possibly expressing antisense RNA. Due to a cloning error that was detected only after these experiments were nearly complete, p2T7TiA/GFP contains the second (rightmost) set of T7 transcription terminators in the wrong orientation. As a result, in the presence of tetracycline, T7 RNA polymerase is predicted to transcribe through the chromosomally integrated vector sequence and into the adjacent 18S rRNA genes on the sense strand. This continued T7 RNA polymerase transcription does not appear to have negative effects. Cells with an integrated copy of the parental plasmid p2T7TiA/GFP grew at the same rate in the absence or presence of tetracycline (not shown). The phenotypes generated using p2T7TiA to express various dsRNAs (for example, TUB , BIP (22LaCount D.J. Donelson J.E. Protist. 2001; 152: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and FLA1 dsRNAs) correspond to previously reported phenotypes and are identical to those generated by p2T7TiB, in which both sets of transcription terminators are in the desired orientation (Fig. 1). In addition, plasmids pLEW100 (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) and pZJM (23Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) have constitutively active T7 promoters driving the expression of BLE that are oriented in the same direction and that lack T7 transcription terminators. For these reasons, and because the experiments described in this report were substantially complete before the error was detected, the following data are derived from p2T7TiA. However, all indications are that when p2T7TiA and p2T7TiB are integrated into the rDNA locus and induced by tetracycline addition to express dsRNA of the inserted sequence, they generate equivalent dsRNAi phenotypes. To test the effectiveness of the p2T7Ti vectors, 500 bp from the 5′ end of the α-tubulin gene (TUB) were inserted between the two T7 promoters, and stable procyclic cell lines were established. Tetracycline was added to the culture media to induce dsRNA expression, and the cells were monitored for the appearance of the rounded FAT cell phenotype characteristic of inhibition of TUB expression (24Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. . 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 25Moreira-Leite F.F. Sherwin T. Gull K. Science. 2001; 294: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). FAT cells appeared in 2T7TiA/TUB cultures within 6 h after adding tetracycline and reached a maximum by 18 h (Fig. 2). FAT cells were only rarely observed in control 2T7TiA/GFP cultures, indicating that the effect is due to inhibiting TUB expression. The percentage of FAT cells after adding tetracycline was much higher in cell lines cloned by serial dilution than in the uncloned mixed cell lines. Whereas uncloned mixed cell lines never had greater than 50% FAT cells after adding tetracycline, clonal lines were routinely obtained in which >95% of the cells become FAT after adding tetracycline. However, the high percentage of cells that displayed the FAT phenotype came at a price; lines with the highest percentage of FAT cells after tetracycline addition also showed evidence of leaky dsRNA expression. In uninduced cultures of these cell lines, 1–5% of the cells were FAT, and the cell lines grew more slowly than the 2T7TiA/GFP controls. Because inhibition of TUB expression is highly toxic, reversion to tetracycline-resistant phenotypes was observed. After 3 months of continuous passage in the presence of G418, hygromycin, and phleomycin, about half of the cells in the 2T7TiA/TUB line no longer responded to tetracycline addition. Furthermore, the tetracycline resistance was acquired much more rapidly when the cells were maintained in the absence of drug selection. The basis for resistance to tetracycline induction has not been analyzed further. For best results, 2T7Ti cell lines whose target genes are very toxic should be thawed and/or recloned every few months. Having established that p2T7Tiefficiently generates RNAi in T. brucei in an inducible manner, we cloned 1000 bp from the 5′ end of FLA1 into p2T7TiA and obtained stable clonal lines. Procyclic cells with p2T7TiA/FLA1 integrated into the genome had normal morphologies in the absence of tetracycline but displayed detached flagella when grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 3A). To verify that FLA1 expression was being inhibited, we analyzed FLA1 RNA levels in 2T7TiA/GFP and 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells on northern blots (Fig. 3B). As expected, the ∼3-kb FLA1 RNA disappeared in procyclic 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells exposed to tetracycline. The loss of FLA1 RNA was accompanied by the appearance of a FLA1 RNA-related smear extending downward from ∼1.5 kb. In contrast, neither FLA1 levels in 2T7TiA/GFP cells nor TUB levels in 2T7TiA/GFP or 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells were altered by tetracycline. Thus, as suggested previously by transient transfections (17LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), FLA1 is required for flagellar attachment in procyclic T. brucei. The inability to delete both allelic copies of FLA1 from the diploid T. brucei genome (16Nozaki T. Haynes P.A. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and our previous results with transient inhibition of FLA1 expression (17LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggested that FLA1 is essential in T. brucei. To test this hypothesis, we measured the growth rate of cultured procyclic 2T7TiA/GFP and 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells in the presence and absence of tetracycline (Fig. 4A). Procyclic 2T7TiA/FLA1 cell lines grew dramatically slower when tetracycline was included in the growth media as compared with 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells in the absence of tetracycline and with 2T7TiA/GFP cells grown in either the presence or absence of tetracycline. Procyclic 2T7TiA/FLA1 cultures doubled in cell density approximately twice after tetracycline was added to the culture media and then reached a growth arrest. In contrast, 2T7TiA/GFP cell lines grew at nearly identical rates in the absence or presence of tetracycline and at slightly greater rates than 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells in the absence of tetracycline. These results demonstrate that FLA1 is essential for growth in T. brucei, in contrast to T. cruzi, where it has been shown that null mutants of the FLA1 homolog, GP72, can be obtained (13Cooper R. de Jesus A.R. Cross G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). While performing the growth curves shown in Fig. 4A, it became apparent that tetracycline-induced procyclic 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells lose the normal trypanosome morphology, acquire a rounded phenotype reminiscent of FAT cells, and eventually die. A similar phenomenon was also observed with bloodstream 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells induced with tetracycline (see below). To determine whether cells with detached flagella die at a particular stage in the cell cycle, we assessed the number of nuclei and kinetoplasts in 2T7TiA/FLA1 cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline. During cell division in T. brucei, the kinetoplast replicates and segregates prior to nuclear segregation and thus can be used as a marker for progression through the cell cycle (5Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Ser. Biol. Sci. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Procyclic 2T7TiA/FLA1 and 2T7TiA/GFP cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI to visualize nuclear and kinetoplast DNA (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W2050014475,"The Aft1 transcription factor regulates the iron regulon in response to iron availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aft1 activates a battery of genes required for iron uptake under iron-starved conditions, whereas Aft1 function is inactivated under iron-replete conditions. Previously, we have shown that iron-regulated DNA binding by Aft1 is responsible for the controlled expression of target genes. Here we show that this iron-regulated DNA binding by Aft1 is not due to the change in the total expression level of Aft1 or alteration of DNA binding activity. Rather, nuclear localization of Aft1 responds to iron status, leading to iron-regulated expression of the target genes. We identified the nuclear export signal (NES)-like sequence in the AFT1 open reading frame. Mutation of the NES-like sequence causes nuclear retention of Aft1 and the constitutive activation of Aft1 function independent of the iron status of the cells. These results suggest that the nuclear export of Aft1 is critical for ensuring iron-responsive transcriptional activation of the Aft1 regulon and that the nuclear import/export systems are involved in iron sensing by Aft1 in S. cerevisiae."

A TDR sequence adjacent to the β-catenin binding motif in the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain functions as a site for PKCδ phosphorylation. We show that phosphorylation of MUC1 by PKCδ increases binding of MUC1 and β-catenin in vitro and in vivo. The functional significance of the MUC1-PKCδ interaction is further supported by the demonstration that mutation of the PKCδ phosphorylation site abrogates MUC1-mediated decreases in binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin. We also show that the stimulatory effects of MUC1 on anchorage-independent growth are abrogated by mutation of the PKCδ phosphorylation site.

The MUC1 protein consists of an N-terminal ectodomain with variable numbers of 20 amino acid tandem repeats that are extensively modified by O- glycosylation (17Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J.

The C-terminal subunit includes a transmembrane domain and a 72-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (CD). β-Catenin, a component of the adherens junction of mammalian epithelial cells, binds directly to the MUC1/CD at a serine-rich motif that is similar to β-catenin-binding sites on E-cadherin and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor (19Yamamoto M.

MUC1 competes with E-cadherin, but not APC, for binding to β-catenin (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The interaction between MUC1 and β-catenin is down-regulated by phosphorylation of the MUC1/CD by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell.

The recent findings that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 regulates the interaction of MUC1 with c-Src and β-catenin has suggested that aberrant overexpression of MUC1 in human carcinoma cells could contribute to the transformed phenotype by dysregulation of EGFR signaling (22Schroeder J.

A T41DR motif in the MUC1/CD has been identified as a PKCδ phosphorylation site. The results show that PKCδ regulates binding of MUC1 to β-catenin and that the T41A mutant abrogates the effects of MUC1 on anchorage-independent cell growth. Human ZR-75–1 breast carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine.

To establish stable lines, HCT116 cells transfected with pIRESpuro2, pIRESpuro2-MUC1, or pIRESpuro2-MUC1(T41A) were selected in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). Two independent transfections were performed for each vector. Single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution and expanded for analysis. The His-MUC1/CD(T41A) mutant was generated on pET28(+)-MUC1/CD (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell.

Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), or normal mouse IgG. The immune complexes were prepared as described (21Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6061-6064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoblots were probed with anti-MUC1, anti-PKCδ, anti-β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), or anti-E-cadherin. Reactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-MUC1/CD bound to glutathione beads were incubated with 0.3 μg of purified recombinant, kinase-active PKCδ (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI). The adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ. His-tagged wild-type MUC1/CD and MUC1/CD(T41A) were incubated with 0.3 μg of recombinant PKCδ (PanVera) for 1 h at 4 °C. Anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1/CD (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and anti-PKCδ. In other experiments, purified His-tagged wild-type and mutant MUC1/CD proteins were incubated with 0.3 μg of PKCδ (PanVera) in the absence and presence of 200 μm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. GST-β-catenin bound to glutathione beads was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-MUC1/CD (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Purified His-tagged, wild-type and mutant MUC1/CD proteins were incubated with 0.3 μg of recombinant PKCδ (PanVera) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μmdithiothreitol). The reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Cells (4 × 104) were suspended in 1.5 ml of 0.33% Noble agar (DIFCO, Detroit, MI) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cell suspension was layered over 3.5 ml of 0.5% agar/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 60-mm dishes. One ml of fresh culture medium was added at 2 weeks. Colonies composed of >10 cells were counted at 3 weeks. To determine whether MUC1 associates with PKCδ, lysates from human ZR-75–1 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MUC1 and, as a control, IgG. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-PKCδ demonstrated the detection of MUC1-PKCδ complexes (Fig. 1A, left). In the reciprocal experiment, immunoblot analysis of anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates with anti-MUC1 confirmed that MUC1 associates with PKCδ (Fig. 1A, right). By contrast, there was no detectable interaction between MUC1 and PKCβII, PKCη or PKCμ (Fig. 1B). To extend these findings, 293 cells, which are negative for MUC1 (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), were transfected to express MUC1 or MUC1+PKCδ. Immunoblot analysis of anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates with anti-PKCδ demonstrated binding of MUC1 with endogenous PKCδ (Fig. 1C). Moreover, coexpression of MUC1 and PKCδ resulted in increased formation of MUC1-PKCδ complexes (Fig. 1C). To assess whether binding is direct, purified GST or a GST fusion protein containing the MUC1/CD (GST-MUC1/CD) was incubated with recombinant PKCδ. Adsorbates to glutathione beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ. The finding that PKCδ binds to GST-MUC1/CD and not to GST alone supported a direct interaction (Fig. 1D). To determine whether MUC1/CD is a substrate for PKCδ, we incubated purified His-MUC1/CD with recombinant PKCδ and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD (Fig. 2A). A ST41DRS site in MUC1/CD conforms to the preferred (S/T)X(K/R) motif for PKCδ phosphorylation. To determine whether ST41DRS is phosphorylated by PKCδ, we mutated this site in MUC1/CD to SA41DRS (Fig. 2B). PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD(T41A) was attenuated compared with that obtained with wild-type MUC1/CD (Fig. 2C, left). By contrast, phosphorylation of MUC1 by PKCδ was unaffected by Ser → Ala mutations of either or both of the flanking serines (Fig. 2C, left). The results also demonstrate that autophosphorylation of PKCδ is decreased in the presence of MUC1/CD(T41A) (Fig. 2C,left). To determine whether the T41A mutation affects binding of PKCδ, wild-type MUC1/CD and MUC1/CD(T41A) were incubated with recombinant PKCδ. Immunoblot analysis of anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates with anti-MUC1/CD demonstrated that PKCδ binds equally to wild-type MUC1/CD and MUC1/CD(T41A) (Fig. 2C, right). Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of the MUC1/CD Ser44 site by GSK3β decreases the interaction between MUC1/CD and β-catenin (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD, we incubated MUC1/CD with PKCδ in the presence and absence of ATP. After phosphorylation of MUC1/CD, GST or GST-β-catenin was added for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins precipitated with glutathione beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1/CD. As shown previously, MUC1/CD binds to GST-β-catenin and not GST (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Preincubation of MUC1/CD with PKCδ and ATP was associated a higher level of MUC1/CD binding to GST-β-catenin than that obtained in the absence of PKCδ or ATP (Fig. 2D). By contrast, preincubation of MUC1/CD(T41A) with PKCδ and ATP had no detectable effect on binding of MUC1/CD(T41A) to β-catenin (Fig. 2D). The finding that, in the absence of PKCδ phosphorylation, less β-catenin binds to MUC1/CD(T41A) as compared with that for wild-type MUC1/CD may reflect conformational effects of the T41A mutation on the β-catenin-binding site (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that PKCδ phosphorylates MUC1/CD on Thr41 and thereby increases binding of MUC1/CD and β-catenin. To determine whether PKCδ regulates the interaction between MUC1 and β-catenin in vivo, transfection studies were performed in the MUC1-negative 293 cells. After transfection of vectors expressing MUC1 and PKCδ or the kinase-inactive PKCδ(K-R) mutant, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MUC1. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-β-catenin demonstrated that PKCδ increases the interaction between MUC1 and β-catenin as compared with that in cells transfected with PKCδ(K-R) (Fig. 3A). In concert with these results and involvement of Thr41, PKCδ had little if any effect on binding of β-catenin to the MUC1(T41A) mutant (Fig. 3A). To extend the analysis, we transfected MUC1-negative HCT116 cells to stably express the empty vector, wild-type MUC1, or MUC1(T41A) (Fig. 3B, left). Anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates from HCT116/V, HCT116/MUC1, and HCT116/MUC1(T41A) cells were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin. The results demonstrate that MUC1, but not MUC1(T41A), binds to β-catenin (Fig. 3B, right). When these cells were transfected to express GFP-PKCδ, immunoblot analysis of anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates with anti-β-catenin demonstrated that PKCδ induces binding of β-catenin to wild-type MUC1 and not the MUC1(T41A) mutant (Fig. 3B, right). Binding of MUC1 to endogenous PKCδ and ectopically expressed GFP-PKCδ was also decreased with the MUC1(T41A) mutant as compared with that with wild-type MUC1 (Fig. 3B, right). Previous work has demonstrated that MUC1 and E-cadherin compete for binding to β-catenin (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the MUC1(T41A) mutant affects binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin, anti-E-cadherin immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin. In concert with previous findings (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell.

By contrast, expression of MUC1(T41A) had less of an effect on the interaction of E-cadherin and β-catenin compared with that in HCT116/MUC1 cells (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of GFP-PKCδ was associated with decreases in binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin in HCT116/V cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, while GFP-PKCδ had little additional effect on the interaction of E-cadherin and β-catenin in HCT116/MUC1 cells, expression of both GFP-PKCδ and the MUC1(T41A) mutant resulted in an increase in E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes (Fig. 3C). These findings demonstrate that PKCδ regulates the interaction between MUC1 and β-catenin in cells and thereby binding of E-cadherin with β-catenin. To assess the functional significance of the interaction between MUC1 and PKCδ, HCT116/V, HCT116/MUC1, and HCT116/MUC1(T41A) cell lines were analyzed for anchorage-dependent and -independent growth. Expression of wild-type MUC1 or the MUC1(T41A) mutant had no apparent effect on growth in tissue culture compared with that for HCT116/V cells (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with clones selected from separate transfections (Fig. 4A). In soft agar, the wild-type MUC1 transfectants formed colonies that were substantially larger than those obtained with HCT116/V cells (Fig. 4B). By contrast, expression of MUC1(T41A) was associated with the formation of colonies that were similar to those found with HCT116/V cells (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with the independently selected clones (Fig. 4B). The number of colonies obtained for HCT116/MUC1 cells was also higher than those found for HCT116/V and HCT116/MUC1(T41A) cells (Fig. 4C). These findings demonstrate that expression of wild-type MUC1 contributes to anchorage-independent growth and that mutation of the PKCδ phosphorylation site abrogates this effect. PKCδ has been implicated in the response of cells to activation of the EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and insulin-like growth factor I receptors (3Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A.

Functional involvement of PKCδ at the cell membrane has also been shown through regulation of phospholipid scramblase activity during both cell activation and apoptosis (25Frasch S. Henson P.

The present studies demonstrate that PKCδ interacts with the transmembrane MUC1 protein. The results show that PKCδ phosphorylates the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain at Thr41 (Fig. 4D). Previous work has shown that GSK3β phosphorylates Ser44 in the TDRSPYE domain of MUC1/CD (Fig. 4D) (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, the Tyr46site is phosphorylated by EGFR (23Li Y. Ren J., Yu, W.-H., Li, G. Kuwahara H., Li, Y. Carraway K.L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35239-35242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and c-Src (21Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6061-6064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). Phosphorylation of Ser44 by GSK3β decreases β-catenin binding, while phosphorylation of Tyr46 increases the interaction of MUC1 and β-catenin. The present results demonstrate that PKCδ also regulates the formation of MUC1-β-catenin complexes. In vitro binding of PKCδ was similar with wild-type MUC1/CD and the MUC1/CD(T41A) mutant. By contrast, binding of PKCδ to MUC1(T41A) in vivo was decreased compared with that found for wild-type MUC1. These findings suggest that, in the presence of other binding proteins, such as c-Src and GSK3β, the T41A mutation disrupts the interaction between MUC1 and PKCδ. Other work has shown that c-Src disrupts binding of MUC1 and GSK3β (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, given the proximity of the MUC1 sites for interactions with c-Src, GSK3β, and PKCδ (Fig. 4D), modification of Thr41, Ser44, and/or Tyr46 by phosphorylation or mutation may affect the integration of MUC1 signaling with diverse pathways. The available evidence indicates that MUC1 and E-cadherin compete for binding to the same pool of β-catenin (20Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). E-cadherin functions in homotypic recognition and the regulation of cell mobility (26Takeichi M. Annu. Rev.

The interaction between E-cadherin and β-catenin is essential for cell adhesion by connecting E-cadherin to α-catenin and thereby the cytoskeleton (27Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M.

Nature. 1998; 392: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that MUC1 affects E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (34Kondo K. Kohno N. Yokoyama A. Hiwada K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2014-2019PubMed Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that PKCδ increases the interaction between MUC1 and β-catenin in vitro and in cells. Moreover, mutation of the MUC1 Thr41 phosphorylation site abrogates the effects of PKCδ on formation of MUC1-β-catenin complexes. The in vitro binding studies indicate that the T41A mutation may also affect the MUC1/CD-β-catenin interaction, perhaps by causing changes in the tertiary structure of the β-catenin-binding site. Nonetheless, while MUC1 decreased binding of E-cadherin and β-catenin in cells, expression of the MUC1(T41A) mutant in part reversed this effect. Whereas enforced expression of PKCδ in HCT116/MUC1(T41A) cells was also associated with increased formation of E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes, these experimental conditions could result in interactions not found with endogenous PKCδ. The findings thus support a signaling pathway in which the interaction between MUC1 and PKCδ increases binding of MUC1 and β-catenin, while decreasing the formation of E-cadherin-β-catenin complexes. MUC1 is normally expressed at the apical borders of secretory epithelial cells (16Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In carcinoma cells, polarization of MUC1 is lost with high levels of expression over the entire cell surface (16Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 35Hilkens J. Buijs F. Hilgers J. Hageman P. Calafat J. Sonnenberg A. van der Valk M. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 34: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The apical border of the normal glandular epithelium is devoid of cell-cell interactions at the surface lining secretory ducts. Overexpression of MUC1 by carcinoma cells, however, could confer an anti-adhesive function to the entire cell surface by disrupting E-cadherin-mediated homotypic recognition. To address the function of MUC1 on cell growth, MUC1-negative HCT116 cells were stably transfected to express wild-type MUC1 or the MUC1(T41A) mutant. Expression of MUC1 or MUC1(T41A) had no significant effect on adherent growth in tissue culture. By contrast, wild-type MUC1 conferred a substantial increase in anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. These effects could not be attributed to the heavily glycosylated ectodomain because anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 cells expressing similar levels of MUC1(T41A) was comparable with that found with control HCT116/V cells. Rather, the distinct patterns of anchorage-independent growth for HCT116 cells expressing wild-type MUC1 or MUC1(T41A) support direct involvement of the PKCδ phosphorylation site. These findings and the demonstration that PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 regulates binding of MUC1 and β-catenin are in concert with a model in which PKCδ subverts E-cadherin function by titrating binding of β-catenin to MUC1. Conversely, in a simplified model, mutation of MUC1 at Thr41 restores binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin and decreases anchorage-independent growth. In addition to interactions with E-cadherin and MUC1 at the cell membrane, β-catenin binds directly to the APC gene product in the cytosol (36Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O.

https://openalex.org/W1976182199,"The retinogeniculate synapse conveys visual information from the retina to thalamic relay neurons. Here, we examine the mechanisms of short-term plasticity that can influence transmission at this connection in mouse brain slices. Our studies show that synaptic strength is modified by physiological activity patterns due to marked depression at high frequencies. Postsynaptic mechanisms of plasticity make prominent contributions to this synaptic depression. During trains of retinal input stimulation, receptor desensitization attenuates the AMPA EPSC while the NMDA EPSC saturates. This differential plasticity may help explain the distinct roles of these receptors in shaping the relay neuron response to visual stimulation with the AMPA component being important for transient responses, while sustained high frequency responses rely more on the NMDA component."
https://openalex.org/W2019816797,"Animals sense and adapt to variable environments by regulating appropriate sensory signal transduction pathways. Here, we show that calcineurin plays a key role in regulating the gain of sensory neuron responsiveness across multiple modalities. C. elegans animals bearing a loss-of-function mutation in TAX-6, a calcineurin A subunit, exhibit pleiotropic abnormalities, including many aberrant sensory behaviors. The tax-6 mutant defect in thermosensation is consistent with hyperactivation of the AFD thermosensory neurons. Conversely, constitutive activation of TAX-6 causes a behavioral phenotype consistent with inactivation of AFD neurons. In olfactory neurons, the impaired olfactory response of tax-6 mutants to an AWC-sensed odorant is caused by hyperadaptation, which is suppressible by a mutation causing defective olfactory adaptation. Taken together, our results suggest that stimulus-evoked calcium entry activates calcineurin, which in turn negatively regulates multiple aspects of sensory signaling."

Synaptic depression is accompanied by decreases in both AMPAR and NMDAR function. The mechanisms of synaptic depression, and the potential to undergo activity-dependent plastic changes in efficacy, differ depending on whether a synapse is active, recently silent, or potentiated. These results suggest that silent and active synapses represent distinct synaptic ""states,"" and that once unsilenced, synapses express plasticity in a graded manner. The state in which a synapse resides, and the states recently visited, determine its potential and mechanism for undergoing subsequent plastic changes."

We have previously shown that kamebakaurin and other three kaurane diterpenes selectively inhibit activation of transcription factor NF-κB, a central mediator of apoptosis and immune responses. We here demonstrate that kamebakaurin is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation by directly targeting DNA-binding activity of p50. Kamebakaurin prevented the activation of NF-κB by different stimuli in various cell types. Kamebakaurin did not prevent either stimuli-induced degradation of IκB-α or nuclear translocation of NF-κB, however, it significantly interfered DNA binding activity of activated NF-κB in cell and in vitro and preferentially prevented p50-mediated DNA-binding activity of NF-κB rather than that of RelA as measured using in vitro translated p50 and RelA proteins. Moreover, a p50 mutant with a Cys-62 → Ser mutation was not inhibited with kamebakaurin, indicating that the effect of kamebakaurin was probably due to its interaction with cysteine 62 in p50. The covalent modification of p50 by kamebakaurin was further demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis that showed an increase in the molecular mass of kamebakaurin-treated p50, and this modification was not reverted by addition of dithiothreitol. These results suggested that kamebakaurin exhibited its inhibitory activity by a direct covalent modification of cysteine 62 in the p50. Also, treatment of cells with kamebakaurin prevented the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced expression of antiapoptotic NF-κB target genes encoding c-IAP1 (hiap-2) and c-IAP2 (hiap-1), members of the inhibitor of apoptosis family, and Bfl-1/A1, a prosurvival Bcl-2 homologue, and augmented the TNF-α-induced caspase 8 activity, thereby resulting in sensitizing MCF-7 cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In most cell types, the pleiotropic-inducible form of NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA (previously termed p65) (2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). RelA contains a C-terminal transactivation domain in addition to the N-terminal Rel homology domain, thus serving as a critical transactivation subunit of NF-κB (3Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J.

IκB-α specifically binds to and masks the nuclear localization signals of RelA and p50, thereby preventing the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB heterodimer (6Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K.

Following IκB-α degradation, the NF-κB heterodimer is rapidly translocated to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of target genes.NF-κB regulates the transcription of various inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, -2, -6, and -8 and TNF-α, as well as genes encoding cyclooxygenase II, inducible nitric oxide synthase, immunoreceptors, cell adhesion molecules, hematopoietic growth factors, and growth factor receptors (12Baeuerle P.A.

In addition to regulating the expression of genes important for immune and inflammatory responses, NF-κB also controls the transcription of genes that confer resistance to death-inducing signals. Candidate target genes include those encoding the caspase inhibitors c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and X-IAP, the TNF receptor-associated factors TRAF1 and TRAF2, the zinc finger protein A20, the immediate-early response gene IEX-1L, and the prosurvival Bcl-2 homologue Bfl-1/A1 (13Wang C.Y.

Sun H.-D. Minami Y. Marunaka T. Takeda S. Yamada Y. Togo T. Planta Medica. 1988; 54: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The genus Isodon (also called Rabdosia) is a rich source of diterpenes, especially the highly oxidized kaurane diterpenes. Previously, we have shown that four diterpenes, including kamebakaurin (KA) inhibit the LPS-induced NO and prostaglandin E2 production in RAW264.7 cells (19Hwang B.Y. Lee J.-H. Koo T.H. Kim H.S. Hong Y.S. Ro J.S. Lee K.S. Lee J.J. Planta Medica. 2001; 67: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We here show that KA inhibits NF-κB by directly targeting DNA-binding activity of p50, possibly through a covalent modification of cysteine 62 within the DNA-binding domain, without affecting the induced degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Also, KA not only prevented the TNF-α-induced expression of antiapoptotic NF-κB target such as c-IAP1 and Bfl-1/A1 genes but also augmented TNF-α-induced caspase-8 activity, resulting in sensitizing MCF-7 cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. This study shows that KA is a potential candidate for modulation of NF-κB-dependent pathological conditions.DISCUSSIONWhole plants of I. japonicus (Labiatae) have been used in traditional oriental medicine as a remedy for gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases and a rich source of kaurane diterpenes (17Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Chinese Drugs of Plant Origin: Chemistry, Pharmacology, and Use in Traditional and Modern Medicine. Springer- Verlag, Berlin1992: 817-847Crossref Google Scholar, 18Fujita T. Takeda Y. Sun H.-D. Minami Y. Marunaka T. Takeda S. Yamada Y. Togo T. Planta Medica. 1988; 54: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite various pharmacological activities, its molecular mechanism has not been sufficiently explained. In previous study, we isolated KA and three other kaurane diterpenes (Fig. 1) from the plant as inhibitors of production of inflammatory mediators and NF-κB activation induced by LPS (19Hwang B.Y. Lee J.-H. Koo T.H. Kim H.S. Hong Y.S. Ro J.S. Lee K.S. Lee J.J. Planta Medica. 2001; 67: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), indicating that these activities of those compounds could explain, in part, its diverse pharmacological activities such as anticancer and anti-inflammation. However, it remained to be elucidated how the most abundant, a kaurane diterpene KA inhibits NF-κB activation. Here we showed that KA inhibited NF-κB by directly targeting on the DNA-binding activity of p50 subunit. KA prevents neither induced degradation of IκB-α nor nuclear translocation of NF-κB following stimulation but inhibits NF-κB activation by various stimuli (Figs. 3 and 4). Also, a basal level of DNA-binding activity of NF-κB is significantly inhibited. These observations led us to formulate a hypothesis that KA may directly modify DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. To test this hypothesis, KA was incubated with activated NF-κB in vitro (Fig. 5A) and in cells (Fig. 5C). KA significantly inhibited DNA-binding activity of activated NF-κB without inhibiting that of AP-1 (Fig. 5B). Concentrations to inhibit DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in vitro were comparable to those in which KA inhibits NF-κB activation by various inducers in cells. We also proposed that KA directly targets the p50 molecule based on the finding that it selectively inhibited DNA binding activity of the p50 homodimer not the RelA homodimer (Fig. 6, A, C, and D). The p50 subunit lacks a transactivation domain but serves as a regulatory subunit modulating the DNA binding affinity of RelA, which is a critical transactivation subunit of NF-κB (3Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). p50 possesses a critical cysteine residue in its DNA-binding domain. This cysteine (Cys-62 in human p50) has been proposed to be the target for inhibition of DNA-binding activity of NF-κB by NO, either through S-nitrosylation (24Mathews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) or NO-induced S-glutathionylation (21Klatt P. Pineda-Molina E. Pérez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, this cysteine can be S-nitrosylated in vitro and in vivo to mediate the effect of redox changes on NF-κB activity (26Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).NF-κB is also inhibited by a modification of the cysteine 62 in the p50 molecule with N-ethylmaleimide or other reagents such as cyclopentenone prostaglandin (27Toledano M.B. Ghosh D. Trinh F. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kumar S. Rabson A.B. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3094-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Müller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35530-35536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, a potential role of p50 as a target for the inhibitory action of KA on the NF-κB pathway could be hypothesized. We showed that the inhibitory effect of KA on DNA-binding activity of active p50 was completely suppressed by the addition of more than 5 mm DTT (Fig. 6B, lane 4 and 5 of upper panel), and this suppression was a dose-dependent fashion. However, post-treatment of DTT did not suppress the inhibitory effect of KA on DNA-binding activity of active p50 (Fig. 6B, lower panel). We also found that KA reacted with the sulfhydryl group of cysteine easily to give a thioadduct but not with lysine or serine (31Fujita E. Nagao Y. Kaneko K. Nakazawa S. Kuroda H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1976; 24: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2J.-H. Lee, T. H. Koo, B. Y. Hwang, and J. J. Lee, unpublished result. Indeed, a p50 mutant with a C62S mutation was not inhibited by KA, indicating that the effect of KA was probably due to its interaction with cysteine 62 in p50. The covalent modification of p50 by KA was further demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis that showed an increase by mass unit 330 (calculated mass of KA, 350) in the molecular mass of KA-treated p50. Furthermore, the covalent modification was not reverted with the post-treatment of DTT (Fig 6B, lower panel), indicating that the inhibition by DTT on the co-treatment with KA is due to entrapping of KA by forming a thioadduct with excess DTT. Therefore, it is highly probable that KA would covalently modify cysteine 62 in the p50 molecule through a Michael-type reaction, although we did not map precisely the cysteine modified by KA. Recently, cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15d-PGJ2 has been demonstrated to inhibit DNA binding of NF-κB by direct modification of cysteine 62 of p50 (30Cernuda-Morollon E. Pineda-Molina E. Canada F.J. Perez-Sala D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35530-35536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Sesquiterpene lactones such as parthenolide and helenarin have also exerted their potent anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting activation of NF-κB (32Hehner S.P. Heinrich M. Bork P.M. Vogt M. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Schulze-Osthoff K. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1288-1297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 33Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Molecular target of parthenolide has been demonstrated to be the cysteine 179 of IκB kinase β (34Kwok B.H.B. Koh B. Ndubuisi M.I. Elofsson M. Crews C.M. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 759-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), but another report has proposed that parthenolide would modify the cysteine 38 of RelA (35Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The same authors have proposed that helenalin would bind to cysteines 38 and 120 of RelA based on the EMSA and computer modeling of the RelA homodimer (33Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 35Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). What would make anti-inflammatory compounds such as helenarin, parthenolide, 15d-PGJ2, and KA selective in the modification of cysteine residue in the different target molecules such as IκB kinase β, p50, or RelA? This difference may arise not only from chemical environment of target sulfhydryl group in the protein but also from structural environment of Michael acceptor in the NF-κB inhibitors (35Rüngeler P. Castro V. Mora G. Gören N. Vichnewski W. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. Schmidt T.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2343-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Helenarin and parthenolide contain a lactone ring conjugated with an exomethylene group, which can react with a biological nucleophile, especially the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residue by Michael type reaction. 15d-PGJ2 contains two possible reactive Michael acceptors, namely a cyclopentenone ring and a doubly conjugated exomethylene functional group to the carbonyl group of the pentenone ring. This would be a possible explanation for the formation of a bimolecular adduct by 15-dPGJ2 with two different cysteines in p50 (30Cernuda-Morollon E. Pineda-Molina E. Canada F.J. Perez-Sala D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35530-35536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). KA also contains an exomethylene group conjugated with a carbonyl group of cyclopentenone in a bicyclic ring system, which, however, possesses a quite different structural feature from parthenolide and helenarin, which have a fused α-methylene-γ-lactone ring. These differences among NF-κB inhibitors could be attributed to their selective specificity toward target cysteines in IκB kinase β, RelA, or p50. Another group of kaurane diterpene compounds such as foliol and ent-kaur-19-oic acid, in which a fused five-membered ring contains only the exomethylene group without a conjugated carbonyl group, has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation by interfering with NF-κB-inducing kinase activity (36Castrillo A. de las Heras B. Hortelano S. Rodrı́guez B. Villar A. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15854-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Several studies have demonstrated an essential role for NF-κB in preventing apoptosis induced by TNF-α and chemotherapy agents. In these studies, cells were made sensitive to TNF-α- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB activity (23Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 37Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 38Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). It is now clear that several downstream effectors of NF-κB activation have been known to suppress TNF-α- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These include TRAF-1, TRAF-2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and Bfl-1/A1. KA clearly suppressed the induced expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and Bfl-1/A1 by TNF-α without affecting Bax and Bcl-2, whose expression is not under control of NF-κB (Fig. 8). Interestingly, KA completely inhibited even basal level expression of cIAP-1. Further studies are needed to show how KA regulates the expression of c-IAP1 in MCF-7 cells. We were also able to demonstrate that KA sensitizes cytotoxic potential of TNF-α as assessed by MTT and that this effect is likely associated with caspase-8 activity (Fig. 9). It has been demonstrated that the induction of c-IAP1 and c-IAP-2 by NF-κB suppressed caspase-8 activation, resulting in cell survival (13Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our results that KA blocked the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and thereby suppressed TNF-α-induced expression of both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 and, in turn, enhanced TNF-α-induced caspase-8 activity. These results demonstrate that tumor cells are sensitized to TNF-α- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB.The relevance of most of NF-κB target genes makes this transcription factor an interesting therapeutic target for the identification of inhibitors. One group of NF-κB inhibitors exerts its inhibitory effects by antioxidative properties (39Mihm S. Ennen J. Pessara U. Kurth R. Dröge W. AIDS. 1991; 5: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 40Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). These inhibitors include N-acetyl-l-cysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, or curcumin. Another group of inhibitors interferes with the induced degradation of IκB family members by affecting the 26S proteasome or inhibiting IκB kinase complex (42Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 43Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Another group of inhibitors exerts their effects only in the cell nucleus by impairing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB already bound to DNA. Examples are PG490 (triptolide), and, at least in some cell type, glucocorticoids (25Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 44Lee K.Y. Chang W. Qiu D. Kao P.N. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13451-13455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, a group of inhibitors interferes with the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB by directly targeting the NF-κB subunits. This is the case of helenalin, which is a specific inhibitor of DNA-binding activity of RelA subunit (33Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). KA could be added to this group as a specific inhibitor of DNA-binding activity of NF-κB by directly targeting p50. Importantly, KA can inactivate the activated NF-κB complex. This property is crucial for the treatment of various diseases such as inflammation, where previously activated NF-κB is sustaining the pathological processes of diseases and needs to be inactivated. Taken together, we have shown that KA inhibits the NF-κB signal cascade by directly targeting DNA binding of the p50 subunit in the activated NF-κB and the induced expression of NF-κB target genes. Based on our results, KA could serve as an interesting lead compound for the development of new, potent anti-inflammatory or anticancer agents. Furthermore, this study extends our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of traditional medicinal plants, which abundantly contain kaurane diterpenes.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In most cell types, the pleiotropic-inducible form of NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA (previously termed p65) (2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). RelA contains a C-terminal transactivation domain in addition to the N-terminal Rel homology domain, thus serving as a critical transactivation subunit of NF-κB (3Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). p50 lacks a transactivation domain and is believed to serve as a regulatory subunit modulating the DNA binding affinity of RelA (3Ballard D.W.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The p50·RelA NF-κB heterodimer is normally sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment by physical association with inhibitory proteins, including IκB-α and related proteins (5Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). IκB-α specifically binds to and masks the nuclear localization signals of RelA and p50, thereby preventing the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB heterodimer (6Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Müller J.M. Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The latent cytoplasmic NF-κB RelA·p50 complex can be post-translationally activated by a variety of cellular stimuli, which trigger site-specific phosphorylation of IκB-α by a multisubunit IκB kinase (7Mercurio F.

Despite the beneficial effects of ACEI therapy proven in many millions of patients world-wide, the modes of action of ACEIs have not been fully characterized (5.Yusuf S. Sleight P. Dagenais G.

The inhibition of ACE or kininase II blocks angiotensin II release or bradykinin (BK) inactivation (9.Yang H.Y.T. Erdös E.G. Levin Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

ACEIs also potentiate the effects of BK and its ACE-resistant analogs on their B2 receptor by inducing an enzyme/receptor protein-protein interaction (12.Minshall R.D. Tan F. Nakamura F. Rabito S.F.

Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, few cell types express the B1 receptor, but various pathologic conditions such as ischemia, atheromatous disease, or exposure to inflammatory cytokines rapidly induce expression (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar, 16.McLean P.G. Perretti M. Ahluwalia A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 194-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The elimination of the B2 receptor gene in knockout mice also up-regulated the B1 receptor (17.Duka I. Kintsurashvili E. Gavras I. Johns C. Bresnahan M. Gavras H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ligands of the two receptors differ, as plasma carboxypeptidase N or tissue carboxypeptidase M cleave the C-terminal Arg of the B2 receptor agonists kallidin (Lys-BK) and BK to generate B1 agonists des-Arg-kinins (18.Erdös E.G. Skidgel R.A. Farmer S.G. The Kinin System. Academic Press, London1997: 111-141Crossref Google Scholar). Of the products, des-Arg10-kallidin (des-Arg10-Lys1-bradykinin) is about three orders of magnitude more potent than des-Arg9-BK on the B1 receptor (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). The contributions of the kinin B2 receptor to the effects of ACEIs have been established (10.Linz W. Wiemer G. Gohlke P. Unger T.

Metab. 1999; 10: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a possible but not previously explored role for the B1 receptor could be deduced from the fact that many patients treated with ACEIs suffer from conditions that lead to B1-receptor induction (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). Although ACEIs do not directly affect the BK B2 receptor, they augment its function when ACE is also expressed on the cell surface (12.Minshall R.D. Tan F. Nakamura F. Rabito S.F. Becker R.P.

Here we report that ACEIs in nanomolar concentrations directly activate the BK B1 receptor in cells without an intermediate peptide ligand and in the absence of ACE. We also characterized the site and the mode of action of ACEIs on the human B1 receptor, resulting in the generation of nitric oxide (NO). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown as described (14.Marcic B. Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Minshall R.D. Tan F. J. Biol.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and COS-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic solution diluted 1:100. Bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial (BPAE) cells were cultured following manufacturer's instructions (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The medium of human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) (19.Phagoo S.B. Poole S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (ATCC) was supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells were stably transfected with cDNA of the human B1 receptor inserted into pcDNA3 (donated by Dr. F. Leeb-Lundberg of the University of Texas, San Antonio) using SuperFect essentially as described for the human B2 receptor (14.Marcic B. Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Minshall R.D. Tan F. J.

HEK 293 or COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the wild type or H195A mutant human B1 receptor using SuperFect or LipofectAMINE 2000 as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA and Invitrogen). Experiments were done 24 h after transfection. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the wild type cDNA of the human B1receptor, as above, and the plasma membrane fraction was obtained with a slight modification of the technique in Ref. 20.Fathy D.B. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar. Binding assays were performed at room temperature with [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin in the presence and absence of enalaprilat concentrations ranging from 0.1 nm to 10 μm (modified from Ref. 20.Fathy D.B. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar). (Ethylenedinitrilo)tetraacetic acid dicalcium salt (Ca-EDTA) was added to the cells for 30 min at 1 mm concentration to bind Zn2+, then cells were washed with zinc-free medium. The undecapeptide (LLPHEAWHFAR) was synthesized by the Protein Sciences Facility (University of Illinois, Champaign) and tested as an inhibitor (10 or 100 μm) after 20 min of preequilibration. [Ca2+]iwas measured using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe fura-2 AM in a PTI Deltascan (Princeton, NJ) or Attofluor RatioVision (Islandia, NY) instrument (14.Marcic B. Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A.

Fura-2 fluorescence was detected at 510 nm following excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and the ratio of intensities at 340 and 380 nm were recorded in 10–100 cells simultaneously (12.Minshall R.D. Tan F.

The H195A mutation of the human B1 receptor was done by the PCR method using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The human wild type B1 pcDNA3 was used as the template with the two mutagenic primers shown in the following sequences: B1HA1, 5′-CTGCTCCTCCCCGCTGAGGCCTGGCACTTT and B1HA2, 5′-GTGCCAGGCCTCAGCGGGGAGGAGCAGGAT. The sequence of the construct was confirmed by automatic sequencing at the DNA core facility of the University of Illinois, Chicago. NO was measured using either a porphyrinic microsensor (21.Brovkovych V.V. Kalinowski L. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Malinski T. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22.Vergnani L. Hatrik S. Ricci F. Passaro A. Manzoli N. Zuliani G. Brovkovych V. Fellin R. Malinski T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) or with a fluorescence assay (23.Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) in BPAE cells. The microsensor consists of carbon fibers which are electroplated with a highly conductive polymeric porphyrin to facilitate the electron transfer on or from NO to the sensor. Cells were preincubated for a few minutes at 37 °C until a stable baseline was established. Ligands were added, and the responses (currentversus time) were recorded continuously. Current generated on porphyrinic electrode was proportional to the NO released and was quantitated with a known standard NO solution. For the fluorescence assay we used diamino fluorescein diacetate. Cellular fluorescence was measured at 515 nm following excitation at 490 nm (23.Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance test. To investigate whether ACEIs can activate the BK B1 receptor, we tested them on IMR-90 fibroblasts that constitutively express both the B1 and B2receptors. As a prototype of an active ACEI we used enalaprilat and measured the increase in [Ca2+]ifrom cells (Fig. 1). The receptors were activated with either BK for the B2 receptor or des-Arg10-kallidin as a ligand of the B1receptor. BK (10 nm) and des-Arg10-kallidin (10 nm) raised [Ca2+]i in distinctly different patterns (Fig. 1, A and B). B1 receptor activation led to a very prolonged, sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas BK stimulated a more transient response. Enalaprilat (1 nm) in the absence of a peptide agonist significantly enhanced the [Ca2+]i level (Fig. 1 C). Enalaprilat mediated a response which clearly differed temporally from the one caused by BK, but was very similar to that produced by des-Arg10-kallidin. These experiments indicated that enalaprilat in nanomolar concentrations directly activated the B1 receptor within seconds in the absence of added kinins. Using B1 and B2 receptor antagonists, des-Arg10-Leu9-kallidin for B1 and HOE 140 for B2 (Fig. 1, D and E), we confirmed this conclusion because the response to enalaprilat was completely inhibited by the B1 antagonist, whereas HOE 140 had no effect. The data with IMR-90 cells strongly suggested that the B1 receptor was mediating the direct effect of enalaprilat. However, because IMR-90 cells have low but detectable ACE activity, we had to exclude the possibility that ACE is required for the activation of the B1 receptor, similar to the B2 receptor (12.Minshall R.D. Tan F. Nakamura F. Rabito S.F. Becker R.P. Marcic B. Erdös E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, CHO cells, having no ACE (12.Minshall R.D. Tan F. Nakamura F. Rabito S.F. Becker R.P. Marcic B. Erdös E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), were transfected to express human B1 receptors (CHO/B1). Adding enalaprilat (10 nm) caused immediately, within seconds, a typical B1 receptor agonist response as indicated by the prolonged shape of the elevated [Ca2+]i curve (Fig. 2, A and B). As control, we also tested transfected CHO cells expressing ACE only (CHO/ACE) or the B2 receptor (CHO/B2) with negative results; thus, enalaprilat, in the absence of the B1 receptor, was inactive in these cells (Fig. 2,C–E). Enalaprilat also elevated [Ca2+]i in BPAE cells, which constitutively express both the B1 and the B2receptor (24.Smith J.A.M. Webb C. Holford J. Burgess G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 525-534PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). We determined whether the enalaprilat-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i levels would stimulate NO production. We monitored the release of NO from cultured BPAE cells using either a fluorescence assay or an electrochemical method with a porphyrinic microsensor (see “Materials and Methods”). Enalaprilat (10 nm) did indeed stimulate NO release, and this response was more prolonged than the transient one that followed B2receptor activation (Fig. 3 A). Its pattern resembled the prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1 C) and mimicked the response of the cells to the B1 agonist des-Arg10-kallidin (Fig. 3 A). The dose-response curve showed that enalaprilat in logm concentrations linearly enhanced the release of NO from 10 nm to 10 μm (Fig. 3 B). We repeated these experiments with another technique to measure NO release based on fluorescence detection and obtained similar results (not shown). Enalaprilat stimulated NO production by BPAE cells via the B1 receptor. This conclusion is based on findings that enalaprilat and des-Arg10-kallidin released NO similarly (242 nm ± 5 S.E. per well and 288 ± 7 nmNO), and the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg10-Leu9-kallidin (100 nm) reduced both effects (101 ± 26 and 81 ± 4 nm) for enalaprilat and des-Arg10-kallidin (Fig. 3 C;p < 0.01, n = 4–5). To establish where ACEIs activate the B1 receptor, we compared the amino acid sequence of ACE with the BK B1 and B2 receptors (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. MacNeil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol.

Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Although there is little overall homology, the human B1 receptor contains in its second extracellular loop (residues 195–199) an HEAWH sequence (Fig. 4 A), and this is similar to the one in the active centers of the two domains of ACE (HEMGH) (26.Soubrier F. Alhenc-Gelas F. Hubert C. Allegrini J. John M. Tregear G. Corvol P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar,28.Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Robertson J.I.S. Nicholls M.G. The Renin-Angiotensin System.1. Gower Medical Publishers, London1993: 10.1-10.10Google Scholar) and matches the HEXXH zinc-binding consensus sequence (29.Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) in other members of the zinc metalloproteases. This motif is absent from the B2 receptor. The ACEIs combine with the active centers of ACE via the Zn2+ cofactor with their SH or COO− group, and mutation of the HEXXH motif eliminates inhibitor binding (30.Wei L. Clauser E. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, this region in B1receptor was very likely the site for activation by inhibitors. To investigate the importance of that lead, we constructed a point mutation (H195A) at the putative Zn-binding site (HEAWHA→AEAWH). The [H195A]B1 receptor mutant was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. In HEK/[H195A]B1 cells, des-Arg10-kallidin activated the receptor, whereas enalaprilat was inactive (Fig. 4 B). In HEK 293 control cells transfected to express the wild type (WT) B1 receptor, 10 nm des-Arg10-kallidin or enalaprilat elevated the [Ca2+]i level in a typical B1receptor pattern. Transfecting COS-7 cells with [WT]B1 or [H195A]B1 gave similar results (not shown; n = 3). Mock transfected or untransfected cells (both HEK 293 and COS-7) in the absence of the B1 receptor did not respond to either des-Arg10-kallidin or enalaprilat (not shown). Consequently, the HEAWH sequence in the second extracellular loop is essential for the direct activation of the B1 receptor by enalaprilat but not for des-Arg10-kallidin, which acts on other epitopes in the third extracellular loop (20.Fathy D.B. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 171-179PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Fathy D.B. Mathis S.A. Leeb T. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12210-12218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To explore the role of Zn2+ on receptor response, we preincubated BPAE cells for 30 min with 1 mm Ca-EDTA. This heavy metal sequestering agent blocked the effect of 10 nmenalaprilat completely (n = 4), whereas 10 nm des-Arg10-kallidin (n = 5) raised the level of [Ca2+]iuninhibitedly. Enalapril (the inactive prodrug of enalaprilat), which has an esterified carboxyl group that does not bind Zn2+, did not activate the B1 receptor in IMR-90 cells at 1 μm, (n = 3) or 10 nmconcentration. We concluded that for activation by a peptide ligand zinc is not needed, but it is essential for activation by enalaprilat. To further confirm the importance of our finding obtained with the [H195A]B1 mutant, we used the synthetic undecapeptide (LLPHEAWHFAR) corresponding to residues 192–202 of the B1receptor, the putative site of activation by ACEIs. The presence of 10 or 100 μm of this peptide blocked the effect of the ACEI completely, whereas des-Arg10-kallidin was not affected (Fig. 5; n = 3). As control, the same concentration of another peptide (AIKLGTGRRFTTC) of similar size but unrelated sequence affected neither enalaprilat nor des-Arg10-kallidin responses in the BPAE cells (n = 3, not shown). Our experiments strongly suggested that ACEIs and des-Arg10-kallidin bind at different sites of the B1 receptor. We investigated this further in competition binding assays. Membrane preparations, obtained from homogenized HEK 293 cells and transiently transfected with the wild type B1receptor, were exposed to 1 nm[3H]-des-Arg10-kallidin in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of enalaprilat. Enalaprilat competed with des-Arg10-kallidin binding and replaced the labeled ligand at the B1 receptor but only at a relatively high (>1 μm) concentration (Fig. 6). This is in contrast with the ability of nanomolar enalaprilat to release NO or raise [Ca2+]i but is in agreement with the conclusion that des-Arg10-kallidin and enalaprilat activate the B1 receptor at different sites. We also tested other ACEIs to determine whether the direct B1 receptor activation is specific to enalaprilat or is rather a group-related effect. Like enalaprilat, captopril (10 nm, n = 4 and 1 μm, n = 2) and ramiprilat (1 nm, 10 nm and 1 μm,n = 3) elevated [Ca2+]i levels by activating the B1 receptor in BPAE cells. On the other hand, another active but structurally different ACEI, lisinopril (10 nm,n = 5; 1 μm, n = 3), did not activate the B1 receptor in these cells (data not shown). We also tested d-penicillamine (α-amino-β-methyl-β-mercaptobutyric acid), which is structurally related to captopril. d-penicillamine was inactive on the B1 receptor in BPAE cells (10 nm,n = 3; 1 μm, n = 3; 100 μm, n = 2). Also, bradykinin-potentiating pentapeptide (BPP5a), an ACEI (32.Stewart M.J. Ferreira S.H. Greene L.J. Biochem.

Because ACE has a dual action, it activates angiotensin I and inactivates BK by cleaving C-terminal dipeptides (9.Yang H.Y.T. Erdös E.G. Levin Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Besides preventing kinin inactivation by ACE (10.Linz W. Wiemer G. Gohlke P. Unger T. Schölkens B.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 25-49PubMed Google Scholar), these inhibitors indirectly potentiate B2 because they induce an ACE/B2 receptor cross-talk (12.Minshall R.D. Tan F. Nakamura F. Rabito S.F. Becker R.P.

Des-Arg10-kallidin is the endogenous ligand that potently activates the second kinin receptor, B1, at a low concentration (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol.

We showed above that ACEIs in nanomolar concentrations directly activate the human or bovine B1 receptor in cultured cells in the absence of ACE or peptide ligands at a different extracellular domain than the peptide. ACEIs were inactive on cells that did not express the BK B1 receptor. ACEIs release NO (34.Zahler S. Kupatt C. Becker B.F. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 44: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35.Wittstein I.S. Kass D.A. Pak P.H. Maughan W.L. Fetics B. Hare J.M. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 38: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which contributes to their beneficial therapeutic effects. The mechanism of NO release by ACEIs is usually attributed to blocking BK inactivation and thereby potentiating the effect of BK on B2 receptors, which stimulate endothelial NO synthesis (10.Linz W. Wiemer G. Gohlke P. Unger T. Schölkens B.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 25-49PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the B1 receptors by peptide ligand also releases NO (16.McLean P.G. Perretti M. Ahluwalia A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 194-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Enalaprilat in nanomolar concentrations did indeed stimulate NO production from pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and the prolonged release pattern was similar to that caused by des-Arg10-kallidin but not by BK (Fig. 3). The effect of enalaprilat was suppressed by des-Arg10-Leu9-kallidin, a B1receptor antagonist, and NO production increased linearly with the logm concentration of the inhibitor. We found the sequence in the B1 receptor where enalaprilat activated directly after comparing the amino acid sequences of human ACE and BK B2 and B1 receptors. The second extracellular loop of the human B1 receptor contains the HEAWH (195–199) sequence (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Menke J.G. Borkowski J.A. Bierilo K.K. MacNeil T. Derrick A.W. Schneck K.A. Ransom R.W. Strader C.D. Linemeyer D.L. Hess J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21583-21586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This HEXXH motif represents a Zn2+-binding sequence of the two active centers in the N- and C-domains of ACE and in other members of the zincin family of zinc-metalloenzymes (29.Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), but it is absent in the B2 receptor (27.Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young J.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The mutation of this Zn2+-binding domain to remove an essential His residue abolished the effect of enalaprilat but not that of des-Arg10-kallidin. In agreement with this finding, enalapril, the inactive prodrug with an esterified carboxyl group that does not bind zinc, did not activate the B1 receptor. This was further supported by experiments where Ca-EDTA or a synthetic undecapeptide (LLPHEAWHFAR) that corresponds to sequence 192–202 of B1 and incorporates the suggested site of activation blocked the effect of enalaprilat. Therefore, the HEAWH sequence in the second extracellular loop of the B1 receptor is essential for the direct effect of enalaprilat on the B1 receptor. The absence of a similar sequence in the B2 receptor explains the lack of direct action of ACEIs on it (11.Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Minshall R.D. Tan F. Nakamura F. Rabito S.F. Becker R.P. Marcic B. Erdös E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13.Erdös E.G. Deddish P.A. Marcic B.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The B1 receptor may belong to a group of receptors that is modulated by zinc ions (36.Schetz J.A. Chu A. Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide inhibitor of ACE, BPP5a, is essentially a slow substrate (9.Yang H.Y.T. Erdös E.G. Levin Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1971; 177: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar) and did not activate the B1 receptor. This is not surprising, as it is not expected of the B1 receptor to hydrolyze ACE substrates. Of the ACEIs tested for a direct effect on the B1 receptor, only lisinopril did not activate it. This consequently shows that ACE inhibition alone is not a sufficient attribute for a molecule to bind to the B1 receptor. However, for this class of clinically used ACEIs, the ability to inhibit ACE seems to be necessary for B1 receptor binding. The inactive prodrug enalapril, which only differs in structure from enalaprilat by an esterified carboxyl group, is inactive on the B1 receptor. ACEIs are highly active (nanomolar concentration) agonists of B1 receptors, also indicating that many of the features necessary to inhibit ACE potently are required of agonists that bind at the HEAWH receptor site. It is unlikely that a common structural element, unrelated to ACE inhibition, would link ACEIs to B1 receptors. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that lisinopril was inactive on the B1 receptor. The structure of lisinopril is identical to that of enalaprilat except for the presence of a lysine side chain in the P1′ position; enalaprilat and most of the other ACEIs have only a methyl group at this position in contrast to the –(CH2)4-NH2 of lisinopril. Thus, the presence of this large charged substituent is likely to be the reason why lisinopril does not activate the B1 receptor; it could prevent access to a recessed zinc-binding site, or the positively charged side chain could be repelled by a positive charge on the receptor (37.Menard J. Patchett A.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 56: 13-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ACEIs are used extensively with few side effects (1.Pfeffer M. Giles T.D.

The B1 receptor can be rapidly induced under various pathological conditions (for example, by cytokines, ischemia and atherosclerosis) (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar, 16.McLean P.G. Perretti M. Ahluwalia A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 194-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) undoubtedly encountered by many subjects treated with ACEIs. A recent report (38.Marin Castaño M.E. Schanstra J.P. Neau E. Praddaude F. Pecher C. Ader J.L. Girolami J.P. Bascands J.L. Circulation. 2002; 105: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), published after submission of this manuscript, showed that ACEIs themselves can induce expression of the B1 receptor in rodent kidney, heart, and vasculature and that B1 receptor stimulation plays a role in the hypotensive effect of ACEIs. Furthermore, the up-regulation is dependent on stimulation of the B1 receptor itself because B1 receptor antagonists blocked it (38.Marin Castaño M.E. Schanstra J.P. Neau E. Praddaude F. Pecher C. Ader J.L. Girolami J.P. Bascands J.L. Circulation. 2002; 105: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mode of activation of the receptor at the cellular or molecular level was not investigated, but our results indicate it could be due to direct stimulation of the B1 receptor by ACEIs. Activation of B1 receptor by ACEIs could mediate some of the beneficial effects of these drugs by stimulating NO production. For example, administration of an ACEI shortly after acute myocardial infarction reduced the incidence of death or development of severe congestive heart failure (3.Ambrosioni E. Borghi C. Magnani B. the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) study investigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 4.Gaudron P. Kugler L. Hu K. Fraccarollo D. Bauer W. Eilles C. Ertl G. Am. J. Cardiol. 2000; 86: 139-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Acute myocardial infarction also induces B1 receptor expression (39.Tschope C. Heringer-Walther S. Koch M. Spillmann F. Wendorf M. Leitner E. Schultheiss H.P. Walther T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1537-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The induction and activation of the B1 receptor could prove advantageous under various stressful conditions, ranging from infection to cardiovascular disorders (15.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). The B1 receptor may protect the heart in ischemic preconditioning (40.Bouchard J.F. Chouinard J. Lamontagne D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activation of B1receptors in an ischemic heart inhibited norepinephrine outflow and prevented potentially lethal ventricular fibrillation (41.Chahine R. Adam A. Yamaguchi N. Gaspo R. Regoli D. Nadeau R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Neointima formation after balloon angioplasty was suppressed by the B1 receptor (42.Agata J. Miao R.Q. Yayama K. Chao L. Chao J. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also by ACEIs after endothelial injury (7.Powell J.S. Clozel J.P. Muller R.K. Kuhn H. Hefti F. Hosang M. Baumgartner H.R. Science. 1989; 245: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The novel mode of action of ACEIs via B1 receptor, described above, may add to the therapeutic effects of ACEIs (43.Gavras H. Brunner H.R. Laragh J.H. Sealey J.E. Gavras I. Vukovich R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 291: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) in other pathological conditions (44.Siebeck M. Spannagl E. Schorr M. Stumpf B. Fritz H. Whalley E.T. Cheronis J.C. Immunopharmacology. 1996; 33: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and furthermore it may contribute to some side effects. In conclusion, using cultured cells which express B1receptor either constitutively or after transfection we demonstrated a direct activation of the BK B1 receptor by ACEIs and identified the site of action. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a direct effect of ACEIs, apart from their effects on ACE, that relates to the therapeutic efficacy of this important class of drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2026333217,"Electron microscopy has demonstrated the unusual L-shaped structure of the respiratory complex I consisting of two arms, which are arranged perpendicular to each other. We found that the Escherichia coli complex I has an additional stable conformation, with the two arms arranged side by side, resulting in a horseshoe-shaped structure. The structure of both conformations was determined by means of electron microscopy of gold thioglucose-stained single particles. They were distinguished from each other by titration of the complex with polyethylene glycol and by means of analytical ultracentrifugation. The transition between the two conformations is induced by the ionic strength of the buffer and is reversible. Only the horseshoe-shaped complex I exhibits enzyme activity in detergent solution, which is abolished by the addition of salt. Therefore, it is proposed that this structure is the native conformation of the complex in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2017619080,"Although a number of genetic defects are commonly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a large percentage of AML cases are cytogenetically normal. This suggests a functional screen for transforming genes is required to identify genetic mutations that are missed by cytogenetic analyses. We utilized a retrovirus-based cDNA expression system to identify transforming genes expressed in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We identified a new member of the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, designating it RasGRP4. Subsequently, cDNA sequences encoding rodent and human RasGRP4 proteins were deposited in GenBankTM. RasGRP4 contains the same protein domain structure as other members of the RasGRP family, including a Ras exchange motif, a CDC25 homology domain, a C1/diacyglycerol-binding domain, and putative calcium-binding EF hands. We show that expression of RasGRP4 induces anchorage-independent growth of Rat1 fibroblasts. RasGRP4 is a Ras-specific activator and, interestingly, is highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and myeloid cell lines. Unlike other RasGRP proteins, RasGRP4 is not expressed in the brain or in lymphoid cells. We demonstrated that 32D myeloid cells expressing RasGRP4 have elevated levels of activated Ras compared with control cells, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment greatly enhanced Ras activation. PMA induced membrane localization of RasGRP4 and 32D cells expressing RasGRP4 were capable of cytokine-independent proliferation in the presence of PMA.

Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. Churchill Livingstone, Inc., Edinburgh1995: 993-1014Google Scholar). Chromosomal translocations are common in AML, and the study of these chromosomal abnormalities has led to the identification of a number of AML-associated oncogenes including AML1-Eto, PML-RARα, and CBFβ-MYH11 among others (2Look A.T. Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). However, up to 50% of AML cases are cytogenetically normal, suggesting that subtle genetic defects, including point mutations and small deletions, play a causative role in the development of the disease (3Mrozek K. Heinonen K. de la Chapelle A. Bloomfield C.D. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 17-31PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that a functional screen of cytogenetically normal AML samples may be an effective approach to identify these mutations. Most oncogene screening efforts in the past have utilized cell lines as sources of expressed genes and inefficient transfection techniques to deliver these genes to target cells. We have applied a retrovirus-based cDNA expression system that has been used to efficiently screen cDNA libraries representing genes expressed in rodent and human tumor cell lines (4Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We expanded this system to utilize primary tumor samples as sources of expressed oncogenes. This insures that the genes that are surveyed are those expressed in the cancer patient, and it also circumvents any mutations or aberrant expression of genes that may be the result of artificial selection inherent in the establishment and long-term maintenance of cells in culture. We used this highly efficient retroviral-based cDNA expression system to detect oncogenes in cytogenetically normal AML patients. Recently, we identified an internal deletion mutation in the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in a patient with cytogenetically normal AML (5Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T. Caligiuri M.A. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8655-8666Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This mutation would not have been detected by cytogenetic analyses, demonstrating the credence of this system to identify oncogenes in these AML patients. In this study, we describe the isolation of a novel transforming protein expressed in a patient with AML that exhibits homology to the RasGRP family of Ras activators (6Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have designated it RasGRP4 and have initiated its characterization and possible role in myeloid cell oncogenesis. During the course and review of our studies, R. L. Stevens and colleagues depos-ited sequences in GenBankTMthat encode for the same protein, which they also designated RasGRP4. 2Although our initial database search failed to identify sequences identical to our isolated transforming sequences, during the course of our study and the review of our manuscript, R. L. Stevens and colleagues also identified mouse (GenBankTMaccession numbers AF331457 and AY040628) and rat (GenBankTMaccession numbers AF465263, AF465264, and NM130824) RasGRP4 cDNAs and submitted an additional human sequence (GenBankTM accession number XM056604).2Although our initial database search failed to identify sequences identical to our isolated transforming sequences, during the course of our study and the review of our manuscript, R.

A human multiple tissue mRNA Northern blot (BD Biosciences/CLONTECH) was probed per the manufacturer's instructions with the open reading frame of RasGRP4 radiolabeled by random priming. Wild-type RasGRP4 was cloned by PCR from reverse-transcribed total RNA of human peripheral blood leukocytes using primers designed from sequence information from the AML-derived RasGRP4 cDNA. This sequence has been assigned the GenBankTM accession number AF448437. RasGRP4 cDNA and the AML-derived RasGRP4 cDNA were cloned into pBabepuro-HA, a retroviral vector designed to place a HA epitope tag coding sequence at the 5′-end of the cDNA, as PCR-amplified EcoRI fragments. These cDNAs were also cloned into pcDNA3HA, a modified version of pcDNA3 designed to introduce an HA epitope tag at the 5′-end of the cDNA. All plasmid inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Full-length human RasGRP3 was kindly provided by Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). TheEcoRV/XbaI fragment of RasGRP3 was subcloned into pcDNA3. RasGRP2 was constructed from two EST clones (GenBankTM accession numbers aa035643 and t78563) as described (7Kedra D. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E.

Puromycin (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml to select stable cell lines, and stable lines were maintained under drug selection. PMA (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 100 nm in all experiments. 32D cells expressing H-Ras(61L) have been described previously (5Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T. Caligiuri M.A. Der C.J.

Soft agar assays were performed using single-cell suspensions in agar (5 × 103 Rat1 cells/60-mm dish) as described previously (11Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras was measured utilizing a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 as described (12Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For experiments with Rat1 cells, 7 × 105 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours later the cells were depleted of serum for 18 h and then treated with 100 nm PMA or 0.1% Me2SO for 30 min prior to harvesting. For experiments with 32D cells, 3 × 106 cells were plated in 10 ml of growth medium and grown overnight. Cells were then washed twice with RPMI only and incubated in 10 ml of RPMI in conical tubes for 1 h before treatment with 100 nm PMA or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 30 min. Transient activation of GTPases in 293T cells has been described previously (9Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

For subcellular fractionation, cells were cultured and treated the same as for the experiments that measured cellular GTPase activation (see above). S100/P100 subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described except the protein in each fraction was resuspended in 2× sample buffer (20 mm NaPO4 pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) following acetone precipitation (13Cox A.D.

Equivalent proportions of S100 and P100 were analyzed by immunoblotting. 32D cells were washed twice with RPMI to deplete the culture medium of IL-3 (WEHI3B conditioned medium). Cells were than plated at a concentration of 2 × 105/ml in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. 100 nm PMA or 0.1% Me2SO was added, and cells were counted daily by trypan blue exclusion. Growth medium with PMA was replenished every 2–3 days. The following antibodies were used for immunoblot analyses: anti-HA (Covance), anti-pan Ras (Calbiochem), and anti-FLAG (Sigma). To identify transforming genes in cytogenetically normal AML, we created and screened cDNA libraries from primary patient samples. We utilized both Rat1 fibroblasts and Rat intestinal epithelial-1 cells as biological screening assays for genes that induce cellular transformation. We have determined previously that these lines are useful for identifying transforming genes because they are efficiently infected by retrovirus and have a very low rate of spontaneous transformation (5Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T. Caligiuri M.A. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8655-8666Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We independently identified a 2293-bp cDNA twice as a gene that induces Rat1 cell transformation. Standard nucleotide BLAST data base searching identified the cDNA as a previously unidentified gene on human chromosome 19. The cDNA contains an open reading frame that encodes a 673-amino acid protein. An NCBI BLAST search indicated that the protein encoded by the cDNA is homologous to members of the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (6Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ClustalW alignments indicate that RasGRP4 shows 39% identity to RasGRP2, 38% identity to RasGRP1, and 36% identity to RasGRP3 over the entire length of the proteins. Therefore, we have designated this protein RasGRP4. Compared with data base genomic sequence as well as two RasGRP4 cDNAs that were isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from normal individuals, the AML-derived RasGRP4 cDNA contains a point mutation at codon 620 that changes a glutamic acid to a lysine in the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The cDNA and amino acid sequences of wild-type RasGRP4 are shown in Fig.1A. RasGRP4 exhibits a similar domain structure to the three human members of the RasGRP protein family (Fig. 1B) (6Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a central CDC25 homology domain that is known to exert the catalytic function of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Ras family proteins (Ras, R-Ras, Rap, and Ral proteins). A phylogenetic tree indicating the relationship of the CDC25 homology domain of RasGRP4 to the CDC25 homology domains of other human Ras, Rap, or Ral exchange factors is shown in Fig. 1C. The strongest sequence similarity is seen with the CDC25 homology domains of RasGRP proteins. Amino-terminal to the CDC25 homology domain is a Ras exchange motif that is present in other Ras exchange factors and is believed to play a critical role of CDC25 catalytic activity in vivo but notin vitro. Carboxyl terminal to the CDC25 homology domain is a C1 domain, a cysteine-rich domain that binds diacylglycerol in RasGRP and protein kinase C family proteins (14Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol has been shown to regulate RasGRP subcellular location and catalytic activity (8Clyde-Smith J. Silins G.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, other RasGRP family members contain two calcium-binding EF hands between the CDC25 homology and C1 domains. This region of RasGRP4, however, shows only weak homology to these domains. This weak homology is in part due to a stretch of three prolines in the second putative EF hand, which may alter its ability to bind calcium. These prolines are not present in the EF hands of the other RasGRP proteins. It has been postulated that intracellular calcium can regulate the activity of RasGRP proteins through the EF hands (8Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A.

However, the effect of calcium on RasGRP protein activity remains unclear. Finally, unlike RasGRP2, RasGRP4 does not contain a myristylation signal sequence at its amino terminus, indicating that RasGRP4 is not lipid modified in this manner (8Clyde-Smith J. Silins G.

Our Northern blot analysis indicates that RasGRP4 is expressed highly in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.1D). Significantly lower transcript levels are seen in other tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, liver, placenta, and lung. An ∼4-kb message is seen in these tissues. A multiple tissue expression array probed with the cDNA for RasGRP4 indicated the highest expression of RasGRP4 in bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocytes and lower expression in other tissues. 3G.

While RasGRP1 is expressed in lymphoid cells but not myeloid cells (15Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), high expression of RasGRP4 in peripheral blood leukocytes and its isolation from myeloid cells suggests that RasGRP4 may have a distinct role in these cells. Indeed, Northern analysis using hematopoietic cell lines indicated that RasGRP4 is highly expressed in myeloid cells compared with lymphoid cells.3 While RasGRP1 plays a role in the activation of Ras in response to T-cell receptor signaling (21Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dower N.A. Stang S.L. Bottorff D.A. Ebinu J.O. Dickie P. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), RasGRP4 may function in a myeloid-specific signaling pathway required for proper development and function of cells of this hematopoietic lineage. To verify that RasGRP4 was the basis for the transformation seen in our library screen, we established Rat1 fibroblasts stably infected with a retrovirus expression vector encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged version of RasGRP4. In contrast to cells infected with the empty vector, the Rat1 cells stably expressing RasGRP4 cDNA readily grew in soft agar (Fig.2A). Rat1 cells expressing the AML-derived point-mutated RasGRP4 promoted equivalent colony formation in soft agar, indicating that the mutation in the tumor-derived sequence did not alter the transforming signal of the protein, at least in the assays that we performed.3 Previous studies have described a potent transforming activity for RasGRP1 and a weak activity for RasGRP3, whereas RasGRP2 did not exhibit transforming activity (19Yamashita S. Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Tobiume M. Okada Y. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25488-25493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). RasGRPs have been shown to function as GEFs for Ras and/or Rap proteins (6Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively activated mutants of Ras, but not Rap1, are potent transforming proteins (23Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Hence, we sought to determine whether RasGRP4 functions as an activator of Ras. For these analyses, we utilized a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the GTP-dependent Ras-binding domain from the Ras effector, the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase, in a pull-down assay (12Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) to determine whether the level of activated GTP-bound Ras was elevated in Rat1 cells stably overexpressing RasGRP4. Cells expressing the AML-mutated or wild type RasGRP4 contained an elevated level of GTP-bound Ras when compared with empty vector-infected control cells (Fig. 2B). As expected from their similar transforming activities, we found no significant difference in the ability of the AML-derived point mutated RasGRP4 or wild-type RasGRP4 to activate Ras. Thus, we conclude that transformation by RasGRP4 likely occurs by causing persistent activation of endogenous Ras proteins. RasGRP2 (in this case the shorter unmyristylated form, CalDAG-GEFI) activates Rap1 but not Ras (8Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), whereas RasGRP3 activates both Ras and Rap (17Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamashita S. Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Tobiume M. Okada Y. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25488-25493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next compared the ability of RasGRP4 to activate Ras and Rap in 293T cells with that of other RasGRP proteins. These analyses involved pull-down assays using the GST-Raf-RBD for Ras and a GST fusion to the RBD of RalGDS to pull down activated Rap (9Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24van Triest M. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1901; 333: 343-348Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). In agreement with previous observations, we found that RasGRP3 activated both Ras and Rap1, whereas the Rap-specific short form of RasGRP2 (i.e.CalDAG-GEFI) activated Rap1 and not Ras. In contrast, transient expression of RasGRP4 activated Ras but did not activate Rap1 (Fig.2C). Expression of Rlf, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ral GTPase (25Wolthuis R.M. Bauer B. van't Veer L.J. de Vries-Smits A.M. Cool R.H. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 353-362PubMed Google Scholar), did not activate Ras or Rap1. Thus, RasGRP4 acts as a Ras-specific GEF and, like other RasGRPs, is not an activator of Ral. 4J. F. Rebhun and L. A. Quilliam, unpublished observations. Diacylglycerol or phorbol ester interaction with the C1 domain has been shown to promote membrane association and GEF activity of the three known RasGRP proteins (8Clyde-Smith J. Silins G.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether RasGRP4 function is modulated by an increase in diacylglycerol, we determined whether treatment with the diacylglycerol analog, PMA, would enhance the transforming activity of RasGRP4 when expressed in Rat1 cells. PMA treatment induced morphological transformation of Rat1 cells expressing RasGRP4 but not vector control cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that PMA further stimulated RasGRP4 activity. This morphologic transformation is similar to that caused by expression of constitutively activated mutants of Ras in Rat1 cells (26Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 27Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Graham S.L. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMA treatment did not significantly increase the ability of Rat1 fibroblasts expressing RasGRP4 to grow in soft agar.3However, these cells grew quite efficiently in soft agar (1500 agar colonies/5000 cells plated) in the absence of PMA, and thus PMA could only increase soft agar growth by 3-fold at most. Taken together, we interpret these results to suggest that a lower threshold of Ras activation is sufficient to promote anchorage-independent growth but not morphologic transformation. Therefore, although PMA treatment to further activate Ras did not greatly enhance growth in soft agar, it did raise the threshold level of Ras to that required for morphologic transformation. Previous studies have shown that PMA stimulated RasGRP function by promoting enhanced plasma membrane association (8Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar). Because RasGRP4 mRNA is expressed highly in peripheral blood leukocytes and was isolated from a myeloid leukemia, we evaluated the ability of PMA to regulate RasGRP4 subcellular location and activity in 32D mouse myeloid progenitor cells (28Metcalf D. Blood. 1985; 65: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). For these analyses, we established 32D cells stably expressing HA epitope-tagged RasGRP4 and then determined whether PMA treatment also promoted membrane association of this exchange factor (Fig.3A). We treated 32D cells expressing RasGRP4 with PMA for 30 min and performed subcellular fractionation. PMA treatment induced a translocation of RasGRP4 from the S100 soluble fraction to the P100 membrane-containing fraction (Fig. 3B). Identical results were seen in Rat1 cells, with translocation occurring within 5 min of PMA treatment.3 We next determined whether this increase in membrane association coincided with enhanced Ras activation in 32D cells expressing RasGRP4. 32D cells expressing RasGRP4 exhibited elevated basal Ras-GTP levels when compared with control empty vector-infected cells (Fig 3C). This level of activated Ras was greatly enhanced by PMA treatment, whereas PMA alone did not further activate Ras in control cells (Fig. 3C). Rap1 was not activated under these conditions,3 consistent with the inability of RasGRP4 to activate Rap1 in 293T cells (Fig. 2C). The elevated basal levels of Ras activation in cells expressing RasGRP4 is likely due to the significant amount of RasGRP4 that is already associated with membranes (Fig. 3B). Identical results were obtained with the wild-type and AML-mutated forms of RasGRP4, suggesting that the AML-derived mutation does not alter the ability of RasGRP4 to translocate to membranes and activate Ras in response to PMA treatment (Fig. 3, B and C). These data indicate that RasGRP4, like other RasGRP family members, has a functional C1 diacylglycerol-binding domain that regulates the activity of the CDC25 domain. Thus, RasGRP4 likely plays a role downstream of extracellular stimuli that elicit elevated diacylglycerol levels, such as those that stimulate G protein-coupled receptor or receptor tyrosine kinase activation of phospholipase C β or γ, respectively (30Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, because had we identified RasGRP4 as a transforming protein, we determined whether RasGRP4 was capable of altering the growth properties of myeloid cells. To evaluate this possibility, we analyzed the ability of RasGRP4 to promote cytokine-independent growth of 32D cells. 32D cells require interleukin-3 (IL-3) for survival and growth (28Metcalf D. Blood. 1985; 65: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 31Cortez D. Kadlec L. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5531-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Removal of IL-3 from 32D cells induces a rapid and complete apoptotic response resulting in all cells dying within 48 to 72 h. Expression of several leukemia-associated oncogenes (e.g. Bcr-Abl, Flt3) promotes the growth and survival of these cells in the absence of IL-3 (32Laneuville P. Timm M. Hudson A.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1360-1366PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mizuki M. Fenski R. Halfter H. Matsumura I. Schmidt R. Muller C. Gruning W. Kratz-Albers K. Serve S. Steur C. Buchner T. Kienast J. Kanakura Y. Berdel W.E. Serve H. Blood. 2000; 96: 3907-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of RasGRP4 in 32D cells did not alter the rate of cell death in response to IL-3 withdrawal. However, treatment of these cells with PMA resulted in an increase in cell viability 5G. W. Reuther and C. J. Der, unpublished observations. and promoted 32D cell growth in the absence of IL-3 (Fig.4, B and C). This IL-3 independence is reversible, as removal of PMA from the growth medium resulted in apoptosis of the culture.5 PMA did not affect the survival or growth of control cells in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 4A). Thus, PMA-mediated activation of RasGRP4 can promote growth transformation of mouse myeloid cells. Our observation that activation of RasGRP4 can promote IL-3-independent growth of 32D cells was unexpected, because we and others had found that expression of activated versions of Ras in 32D cells does not induce IL-3-independent growth, although activated Ras can inhibit apoptosis in these cells (34Mavilio F. Kreider B.L. Valtieri M. Naso G. Shirsat N. Venturelli D. Reddy E.P. Rovera G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 301-308PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2207-2212PubMed Google Scholar). PMA treatment of 32D cells expressing constitutively activated H-Ras(61L) did not promote IL-3 independence, suggesting that the affect of PMA on RasGRP4 cells is not merely a cooperation between Ras activation and other signals activated by PMA (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained with 32D cells expressing activated K-Ras(12V) or N-Ras(12D).5 This suggests that aberrant activation of RasGRP4 in myeloid cells may promote the transformation of myeloid cells to a growth factor-independent state more efficiently than activated alleles of Ras itself. How might this occur? One possibility is that RasGRP4 activation likely causes concurrent activation of multiple Ras isoforms, and possibly R-Ras family proteins, hence causing a quantitatively stronger and qualitatively distinct activation of signaling pathways from those activated by a single mutated Ras protein. Alternatively, it is possible that RasGRP4 activation of Ras, causing the rapid GDP/GTP cycling of Ras, has different downstream signaling consequences than are caused by GTPase-deficient, chronically GTP-bound activated Ras. Evidence for this latter possibility is provided from observations that fast GDP/GTP-cycling mutants of Rho small GTPases show greater transforming potency than GTPase-deficient mutants (36Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we expressed two different Ras mutants, H-Ras(117E) and H-Ras(119H), in 32D cells. Although these mutants have an increased rate of cycling between GDP/GTP binding and are highly transforming (37Der C.J. Weissman B. MacDonald M.J. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 105-112Google Scholar), they were unable to transform 32D cells to IL-3 independence.5 Cells expressing these forms of Ras behaved similarly to 32D cells expressing GTPase-deficient H-Ras(61L) in the absence of IL-3 (Fig.4D). We confirmed the H-Ras(117E) and H-Ras(119H) DNA constructs used in these experiments were highly transforming in NIH3T3 cells.3 This finding suggests that the effect of PMA-activated RasGRP4 on 32D cell growth may be mediated by concurrent activation of multiple Ras isoforms or other Ras-like GTPases (e.g. R-Ras) by RasGRP4. During the course of our studies, Stevens and colleagues2 deposited a human cDNA sequence encoding a protein nearly identical to RasGRP4 (GenBankTM accession number AY048119). The sequence of this protein is identical to what we found for wild-type RasGRP4 except for three amino acid positions. Amino acid positions 120, 261, and 671 are Gln, Arg, and Leu, respectively, in our sequence, and Leu, Cys, and Pro, respectively, in their sequence. The reason for these discrepancies is unclear, but the sequences at these positions were identical in the three different cDNA sources we utilized. Identified as a mast cell-restricted signaling protein in an asthma patient, the Stevens' group2 also designated their protein RasGRP4, and they further identified human sequences that encoded defective variants of RasGRP4 (GenBankTM accession numbers AY048120, AY048121, and NM052949). Whether these defective variants are simply inactive proteins or function as dominant negative proteins that can block the function of other RasGRP proteins, will be interesting to determine. In addition, after the submission of our study, the Stevens' group2 also identified mouse (GenBankTM accession numbers AF331457 and AY040628) and rat (GenBankTM accession numbers AF465263, AF465264, and NM130824) RasGRP4 cDNAs and submitted an additional human sequence (GenBankTM accession numbers XM056604). In summary, we have identified a new member (RasGRP4) of the RasGRP family of Ras family guanine nucleotide exchange factors through a screen for transforming genes expressed in AML patients. Although the patient-derived cDNA encodes for a mutated protein, our analyses did not determine a functional difference from wild-type RasGRP4. Perhaps the mutated form will exhibit altered functions in other biological assays or, alternatively, simply represents a polymorphism. Is the aberrant activation of RasGRP4 important for AML development? The chromosomal location of RasGRP3 is involved in chromosomal rearrangements in AML, and proviral integration-mediated activation of RasGRP2 has been observed in a mouse model of AML (17Lorenzo P.S. Kung J.W. Bottorff D.A. Garfield S.H. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 943-949PubMed Google Scholar,20Dupuy A.J. Morgan K. von Lintig F.C. Shen H. Acar H. Hasz D.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Boss G.R. Largaespada D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11804-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence analysis using the NCBI Genome data base indicates RasGRP4 is located at chromosome 19q13, a region identified as undergoing rearrangement in human leukemias and other cancers (38Mitelman F. Johansson B. Mertens F. Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer. 2002; cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/MitelmanGoogle Scholar). Thus, aberrant regulation of RasGRP4 may be a common undiscovered event in AML development. Is Ras activation important for AML oncogenesis? N-Ras is frequently mutated in AML patients (39Bos J.L.

Aaronson S.A. Blood. 1986; 67: 753-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it has been proposed that at least two oncogenic events are required to induce AML (41Gilliland D.G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Also, activation of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway, a major downstream component of Ras signaling, is seen in about half of all AML cases (42Towatari M. Iida H. Tanimoto M. Iwata H. Hamaguchi M. Saito H. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This suggests that direct (e.g. point mutation of N-Ras) or indirect (possibly through RasGRP4 activation) stimulation of Ras signaling plays an important role in AML. Our future studies will evaluate whether RasGRP4 is aberrantly overexpressed or activated in human AML and whether Ras-mediated signaling pathways are important for AML development."

In one instance, a differentially methylated imprinting control region (ICR) at the H19 locus has been shown to involve a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator function that apparently partitions the neighboring Igf2 and H19 genes in different expression domains in a parent of origin-dependent manner. It is not known, however, if this mechanism is unique to the Igf2/H19 locus or if insulator function is a common feature in the regulation of imprinted genes. To address this question, we have studied an ICR in the Kcnq1 locus that regulates long range repression on the paternally derived p57Kip2 and Kcnq1 alleles in an imprinting domain that includes Igf2 and H19. We show that this ICR appears to possess a unidirectional chromatin insulator function in somatic cells of both mesodermal and endodermal origins.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase imprinting control region fetal calf serum Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase imprinting control region fetal calf serum To examine whether chromatin insulator properties is a common feature of imprinting control regions, we analyzed the activity of the Kcnq1 ICR in enhancer-blocking assays. Our results are consistent with the notion that a CpG methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator function is not restricted to the H19 ICR but includes the Kcnq1 ICR as well. The 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR segment was inserted into unique ClaI or NotI sites in both orientations in the E-p-neo-scs vector (8Zhong X. Krangel M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 b). To facilitate cloning into episomal plasmids, we inserted a fragment with multiple cloning sites from the parent pREP4 plasmid (amplified using forward primer, AAG CTG ATC TAT CAT GTC TGG ATC CGG CC, and reverse primer, AAG CTG ATC CAT TCA CCA CAT TGG TGT GC, flanked with either SalI or ClaI sites at their 5′ ends) into a unique SalI (with the SV40 enhancer in the ClaI site) and ClaI (with the SV40 enhancer in the SalI site) sites of pREPH19A and -C (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr.

A 3.6-kb NotI-XhoI Kcnq1 ICR fragment was subcloned into the NotI-XhoI sites of multiple cloning fragment at the SalI and ClaI positions. An opposite orientation of Kcnq1 ICR at the SalI position was achieved by sub-cloning a NotI fragment of the Kcnq1 ICR into the NotI site of the multiple cloning site. Equimolar amounts of each experimental and control linearized construct (approximately 1 pmol, 5.0–10.0 μg, depending on the construct) was introduced into 4 × 106 human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells in triplicate electroporations, as has been described (8Zhong X. Krangel M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar). Following recovery on ice in the presence of 20% FCS, the cells were transferred to 10 ml of RPMI 1640, 10% FCS and cultured at 37 oC for 48 h to allow integration of the plasmid constructs. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 1.0 ml of RPMI with 10% FCS, and mixed with 30 ml of soft agar medium containing 950 μg/ml active G418. The mixture was then poured in 10-cm plates and incubated at 37 °C for 3 weeks to allow growth of drug-resistant colonies. The pREP4-based episomal vectors were transfected into Hep3B cells, as has been described (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The RNase protection expression analysis was performed as previously described using a 365-bp H19 antisense probe and a 150-bp GAP (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) antisense probe as control (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr.

All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol of the RPAIII kit (Ambion). Quantification of individual protected fragments was done using a Fuji FLA 3000 phosphorimaging device. The H19 expression was corrected with respect to both internal control (GAP) and episome copy number as determined by Southern blot analysis of BglII restricted DNA, hybridized with H19 and PDGFB probes (9Kanduri C.

A purified Kcnq1 ICR 3.6-kb fragment was methylated with 2 units/μg SssI methyltransferase in the presence of 180 μm S-adenosylmethionine for 16 h at 37 °C. The methylation reaction was terminated by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 15 min, and the methylation status of the purified fragment was analyzed by digestion with HhaI. The mock-methylated fragment was treated in the same way without the addition of SssI. Following linearization of pREPH19A with XhoI and NotI, the methylated and mock-methylated ICR fragments were ligated within the vector overnight at 14 °C. Each ligation mixture was then phenol:chloroform-extracted (1:1) and used directly for transfection. Hygromycin-selected clones were individually harvested, and cells from each clone were equally divided for DNA and RNA extraction. DNA was extracted by lysing the cells overnight with 1% SDS supplemented with proteinase K. DNA was then purified with phenol:chloroform (1:1) extraction. The RNA was extracted with an RNA kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For genotyping, DNA from cell clones was restricted with BstBI /BstZ17I, and for methylation analysis the DNA was digested with PstI and HhaI and analyzed by standard Southern blot hybridization protocols (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr.

Twenty μg of digested DNA was restricted with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on a 1.7% gel and blotted to a Hybond N+ membrane (AmershamBiosciences) followed by hybridization with probes; an 810-bp EagI/PstI fragment (probe B), an 860-bp NsiI-BsaHI fragment, and a 1.5-kb BglII PDGFB fragment (probe D) (see Fig. 1 a) according to standard protocols.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1128-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we exploited two different insulator assays, which monitor both position-dependent or independent gene silencing. These different parameters are often used to distinguish between chromatin insulator and silencer functions (14Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 291: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the first assay, the reporter consisted of a neo-resistance gene cassette driven by the Vδ1 promoter in combination with its cognate endogenous Eδ4 enhancer (8Zhong X. Krangel M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar). The known insulator element active in mammalian cells, scs (8Zhong X. Krangel M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar), was included in the vector to prevent interaction of the Vδ1 promoter with the enhancer on adjacent copies in tandem arrays. The 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragment (Fig. 1 a) was inserted between the Vδ1 promoter and the Eδ.4 enhancer (Fig. 1 b). The number of neo-resistant colonies that formed following electroporation of p-neo-scs (Fig. 1 b) provided a baseline for Vδ1-driven neo-cassette expression in the absence of an enhancer. This is the level that one would expect to see in constructs carrying insulators or silencers that ablate the influence of an enhancer completely. The inclusion of the Eδ.4 enhancer increased the number of colonies more than 10-fold (Fig. 1 b). This level of neo-reporter activity was set to 100%, to which all other constructs were compared (Fig. 1 b). As a negative control, construct E-2.7-p-neo-scs was used which contains 2.7 kb of anonymous DNA placed between the enhancer and promoter. No significant reduction in colony number was observed with this construct (Fig. 1 b). However, when the Kcnq1 ICR was inserted between the enhancer and the promoter, there was a strong reduction of colony numbers. Insertion upstream of the enhancer had no repressive effect, thus documenting a position-dependent function typical of chromatin insulators (Fig. 1 b). Interestingly, this insulator function depended on the orientation of the Kcnq1 ICR, as has been shown earlier for the H19 ICR insulator (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To confirm the chromatin insulator activity of the Kcnq1 ICR and to allow the examination of the effect of methylation on this activity (see below), we tested this locus in another enhancer blocking assay, using the SV40 enhancer and a mouse H19 reporter gene. This assay is based on the stable propagation of episome-based plasmids in cultured cells and analysis of reporter gene expression by RNase protection analysis (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Following transfection of plasmids into Hep3B cells, hygromycin selection, and expansion for 30 days or more, RNA extracted from these cells was subjected to RNase protection analysis and adjusted for episome copy numbers as has been described (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have previously showed that the SV40 enhancer activates the H19 reporter gene more than 200-fold (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When the Kcnq1 ICR was positioned between the reporter gene and the enhancer, the steady-state levels of mouse H19 reporter transcripts were reduced more than 40-fold (Fig. 1 c). Conversely, when the Kcnq1 ICR fragment was inserted in the opposite orientation or outside the reporter gene enhancer context, there was little or no effect on reporter gene expression levels (Fig. 1 c). We conclude that two independent assays document that the Kcnq1 ICR possesses a polar/unidirectional chromatin insulator function in two different types of somatic cells. Next, we were interested in determining whether or not the unidirectional insulating property of KcnqI ICR depended on the presence of enhancer elements in the 3.6-kb fragment. To this end, we deleted SV40 enhancer from episomal insulator constructs and examined reporter gene activity in the Kcnq1ICR-containing pREP constructs by scoring for numbers of hygromycin-resistant colonies of transfected Hep3B cells. Fig. 1 c shows that the deletion of the SV40 enhancer from the episomal Kcnq1 insulator constructs (termed: −enh) results in no detectable hygromycin promoter activity. This result was obtained with the Kcnq1 ICR inserted in either orientation ruling out that the unidirectional insulating property depends on an endogenous enhancer We have earlier shown that the insulator activity of the H19ICR is CpG methylation-sensitive (13Holmgren C. Kanduri K. Dell G. Ward A. Mukhopadhya R. Kanduri M. Lobanenkov V. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1128-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By analogy, CpG methylation might control the insulating properties of the Kcnq1 ICR, which is methylated only on the maternal allele. To test the effect of DNA methylation on the insulating function of the Kcnq1 ICR we generated in vitro-methylated and mock-methylated 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragments. The procedure for obtaining mock-methylated and methylated fragments between the reporter gene and the SV40 enhancer in the episomal vector has been described and discussed earlier (13Holmgren C. Kanduri K. Dell G. Ward A. Mukhopadhya R. Kanduri M. Lobanenkov V. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1128-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, in vitro-methylated and mock-methylated fragments were ligated into unmethylated episomal vector and transfected into Hep-3B cells. Following hygromycin selection for 3–4 weeks, 20 clones were expanded from each of the mock-methylated and methylated transfections and genotyped/epigenotyped as described earlier (9Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on extensive Southern blot hybridization analyses, we selected three clones harboring methylated Kcnq1 ICR and one clone containing the mock-methylated Kcnq1 ICR fragments, which were unrearranged and maintained episomally (data not shown). To document absence of de novo methylation or demethylation in the expanded clones, the extracted DNA was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzyme,HhaI. Fig. 2 a shows that whereas the insert of the mock-methylated clone remained unmethylated, the in vitro preimposed methylation patterns were generally maintained in the other expanded clones with insignificant exception in clones 1 and 2, which displayed a minor proportion of unmethylated ICR sequences. The effects of CpG methylation were monitored by first examining the chromatin conformation at the Kcnq1 ICR. Fig. 2 b shows that three DNase I hypersensitive sites map within the Kcnq1 ICR in both mouse fetal and adult liver and that these sites were recapitulated in the mock-methylated clone but not in the methylated clone 1 (Fig. 2, c–e), documenting epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions in this region. To make sure that DNase I degraded mock and methylated clones equally, the blots were reprobed with a 1.5-kb BglII fragment human PDGFB gene. As can be seen in Fig. 2 d, the PDGFB gene is degraded equally between methylated and mock-methylated samples. The differential sensitivity of methylated Kcnq1 ICR to DNase I could be due to methylation-induced chromatin compaction. We next analyzed the effect of DNA methylation on the unidirectional insulator activity of the Kcnq1 ICR. Importantly, expression analysis of the H19 reporter gene revealed full insulator function in the mock-methylated clone whereas the insulator function was significantly reduced in the clones with a methylated insert (Fig. 3). The various degrees of insulating properties of the methylated clones 1 to 3 appear to reflect the stringency of methylation status of the Kcnq1 ICR insert (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 summarizes these observations leading us to propose that the Kcnq1 ICR is a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator that operates in a polar/unidirectional fashion.Figure 4Model explaining how the methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator function reported here might explain manifestation of the tissue-specific imprinting status of Kcnq1 depending on the position of hypothetical enhancers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observations reported here support an emerging consensus that epigenetically controlled chromatin insulator functions are common denominators with respect to the manifestation of imprinted states. The methylation sensitivity of the chromatin insulator function in the Kcnq1 ICR explains the effect of loss of methylation at the KCNQ1 ICR on the maternally inherited chromosome. This is the most frequent abnormality observed in children with BWS, accounting for roughly 50% of non-uniparental disomies cases (15Engel J. Smallwood A. Harper A. Higgins M. Oshimura M. Reik W. Schofield P. Maher E. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Importantly, the chromatin insulator function must be physically positioned between enhancers and target promoters to function. Given the position of the chromatin insulator function at the Kcnq1 ICR, any blocked enhancer function with respect to the Kcnq1 promoter must be located 5′ of the ICR. Conversely, the unidirectional feature of the Kcnq1 insulator implies that enhancers 3′ of the ICR are not insulated from promoters upstream of the Kcnq1 ICR. Although the polarity of the insulator clearly does not depend on an endogenous enhancer element, as shown here, it might impinge on the promoter for the antisense transcript, which maps within the Kcnq1ICR. 3C. Kanduri, et al., unpublished observation. However, the observations that the Kcnq1 ICR is also vital for the paternal-specific repression of the upstream Ipl, Orctl2, and Cdnk1c genes2 (6Horike S. Mitsuya K. Meguro M. Kotobuki N. Kashiwagi A. Notsu T. Schulz T. Shirayoshi Y. Oshimura M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2075-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and that several lineage-specific enhancers have been identified in the intergenic region between Cdnk1c and Kcnq1 (16John R.M. Ainscough J.F.-X. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are not compatible with a unidirectional chromatin insulator, suggesting that additional cis elements are involved in long range repression emanating from the Kcnq1 ICR. Several of these cis elements map to CTCF binding sites, 4G. Fitzpatrick, et al., unpublished observation. underscoring a commonality in the link between insulators, CTCF, and imprinting control regions. In the mouse, imprinting of Kcnq1 is relaxed during late gestation becoming completely biallelic in adults (17Gould T. Pfeifer K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the KcnqI ICR possesses similar chromatin conformation in both fetal and adult liver tissues suggesting that the KcnqI ICR has no role by itself in the developmental de-repression of the paternal KcnqI allele. The developmentally regulated activation of the paternal Kcnq1 allele could hence be explained by a switch in usage from upstream to downstream (with respect to the Kcnq1 ICR) enhancers in adult cells (Fig. 4) We thank Michael Krangel for providing the E-p-neo series of enhancer-blocking assay constructs."
https://openalex.org/W2171514590,"Perceptual completion can link widely separated contour fragments and interpolate illusory contours (ICs) between them. The mechanisms underlying such long-range linking are not well understood. Here we report that completion is much poorer when ICs cross the vertical meridian than when they reside entirely within the left or right visual hemifield. This deficit reflects limitations in cross-hemispheric integration. We also show that the sensitivity to the interhemispheric divide is unique to perceptual completion: a comparable task which did not require completion showed no across-meridian impairment. We propose that these findings support the existence of specialized completion mechanisms in early visual cortical areas (V1/V2), since those areas are likely to be more sensitive to the interhemispheric divide."
https://openalex.org/W2005672276,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent activator of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway that leads to up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Hence, TNF induces apoptosis in the presence of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis. We report that a novel triterpenoid, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9,-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) inhibits NF-κB-mediated gene expression at a step after translocation of activated NF-κB to the nucleus. This effect appears specific for the NF-κB pathway as CDDO does not inhibit gene expression induced by the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). CDDO in combination with TNF caused a dramatic increase in apoptosis in ML-1 leukemia cells that was associated with activation of caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, translocation of Bax, cytochrome crelease, and caspase-3 activation. Experiments with caspase inhibitors demonstrated that caspase-8 was an initiator of this pathway. TNF also induced a transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which upon addition of CDDO was converted to a sustained activation. The activation of JNK was also dependent on caspase-8. Sustained activation of JNK is frequently pro-apoptotic, yet inhibition of JNK did not prevent Bax translocation or cytochromec release, demonstrating its lack of involvement in CDDO/TNF-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was acutely induced by CDDO/TNF in every leukemia cell line tested including those that overexpress Bcl-xL, suggesting that the mitochondrial pathway is not required for apoptosis by this combination. These results suggest that the apoptotic potency of the CDDO/TNF combination occurs through selective inhibition of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins, bypassing potential mitochondrial resistance mechanisms, and thus may provide a basis for the development of novel approaches to the treatment of leukemia.

Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). In many systems, the apoptotic potential of TNF is only realized when cells are co-treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). This effect of CHX may be caused by inhibition of the translation of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins such as TRAF1/2 and c-IAP1/2 (2.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by TNF is initiated at the membrane where engagement of the tumor necrosis factor receptor results in the recruitment of TRADD and then FADD. A conserved sequence in FADD called the death effector domain serves as a docking site for procaspase-8, which upon activation initiates apoptosis by either of two distinct routes. The first pathway involves caspase-8-directed cleavage of Bid to its active form, tBid, resulting in translocation to the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm (3.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 4.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V.

The released cytoplasmic cytochrome cinteracts with caspase-9 and Apaf-1 in the presence of dATP to create the “apoptosome” that serves to cleave and activate caspase-9 (5.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 then activates caspase-3, which carries out the execution phase of apoptosis. The second pathway of apoptosis involves the direct proteolysis and activation of caspase-3 by caspase-8. tumor necrosis factor actinomycin D 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid cycloheximide extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor of NF-κB c-Jun N-terminal kinase nuclear factor-κB mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/ERK kinase benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethylketone 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate cyclooxygenase-2 inducible nitric-oxide synthase rel family member p65 MAP kinase kinase 4 MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 tumor necrosis factor actinomycin D 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid cycloheximide extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor of NF-κB c-Jun N-terminal kinase nuclear factor-κB mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/ERK kinase benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethylketone 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate cyclooxygenase-2 inducible nitric-oxide synthase rel family member p65 MAP kinase kinase 4 MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 CDDO is a novel oleanane triterpenoid with promising clinical potential as a chemopreventive agent and as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. In vitro studies have shown that nanomolar levels of CDDO induce differentiation or inhibit the proliferative capacity of human leukemia and breast cancer cell lines in culture (6.Suh N. Wang Y.

At these concentrations, CDDO also binds as a partial agonist to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (7.Wang Y. Porter W.W. Suh N. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Leesnitzer L.M. Plunket K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Sporn M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of CDDO near 1 μm completely inhibit cytokine-induced COX-2 and iNOS mRNA (6.Suh N. Wang Y. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Dmitrovsky E. Hickey W.F. Maue R.A. Place A.E. Porter D.M.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) cell lines. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade is activated in response to a wide array of cellular stresses including environmental damage, chemotherapeutic agents, and cytokines such as TNF (10.Saleem A. Datta R. Yuan Z. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1651-1658PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

The kinetics of JNK activation are also stimulus dependent with cytokines inducing a rapid transient increase in JNK activity and chemical stresses causing a delayed but sustained activation of JNK. Sustained JNK activation has been implicated as an upstream signal for the initiation of apoptosis (13.Chen Y.R. Wang X.P. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 14.Stadheim T.A. Xiao H. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1533-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies have confirmed the importance of JNK in apoptosis whereby JNK-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts resist chemical and UV radiation-induced cytochromec release and apoptosis (15.Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). However, these cells retain apoptotic sensitivity to the Fas ligand. The observation that cells deficient in JNK are sensitive to death receptor-induced apoptosis lends support to other studies that have concluded that JNK is dispensable for TNF-induced apoptosis (16.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Conversely, recent studies have demonstrated that JNK signaling is required for TNF-induced death (17.De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18.Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). It was reported that TNF-induced JNK activation is inhibited by NF-κB-inducible genes and that suppression of these genes by inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway causes a sustained increase in JNK activation. Moreover, inhibition of JNK was found to suppress TNF-induced apoptosis. Here, we investigated the effect of CDDO on NF-κB signaling and apoptosis in response to TNF treatment. We found that whereas CDDO did not inhibit the initial TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, NF-κB-dependent resynthesis of IκBα was blocked. The inhibition of IκBα resynthesis was followed by rapid apoptosis that was much greater than additive when compared with cells treated with TNF or CDDO alone. Moreover, CDDO converted TNF-induced JNK activation from a transient signal to a sustained induction that was sensitive to caspase-8 inhibition. However, inhibition of JNK activity did not prevent CDDO/TNF-induced apoptosis. The combination of CDDO plus TNF was effective at inducing apoptosis in a variety of human leukemia cell lines including those overexpressing Bcl-xL. Hence, this combination may represent an effective therapeutic strategy in the treatment of human leukemia. Stock solutions of CDDO (10 mm) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at −20 °C. TNF, CHX, and actinomycin D (act D) were purchased from Sigma and prepared in Me2SO at stock concentrations of 10 μg/ml, 15 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml, respectively. The general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the caspase-8 selective inhibitor zIETD-fmk (Enzyme Systems, Livermore, CA) were dissolved in Me2SO at stock concentrations of 20 mm and 10 mm, respectively, and then stored at −20 °C. SP600125 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 5 mm and stored at −20 °C.

Perez, DHMC, Lebanon, NH) and Jurkat cells were passaged in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% humidified air. Cells were treated according to the schedules described in the results. In studies utilizing CDDO, cells were treated for 1 h with CDDO prior to addition of TNF. Cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 20 min at 37 °C. An aliquot of cells was transferred to a microscope slide, fitted with a coverslip, and DNA staining was visualized with an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. Cells exhibiting condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. At least 200 cells were scored in each group, and data were expressed as the percentage of cells with condensed chromatin. The preparation of nuclear and cytosolic extracts is a modification of a previously reported procedure (20.Barchowsky A. Munro S.R. Morana S.J. Vincenti M.P. Treadwell M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L829-L836PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2, resuspended in 250 μl buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged (15,800 × g for 2 min), and the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was reserved. The pellet (nuclear fraction) was washed in Buffer A plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were obtained using the digitonin permeabilization method (21.Single B. Leist M. Nicotera P. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were permeabilized on ice with 8.75 μg of digitonin/106 cells in 33 μl of buffer containing 75 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4, and 250 mm sucrose. Cells were incubated for 30 s in ice-cold buffer followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 14,600 × g. The supernatant was then harvested as the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer not containing digitonin. Whole cell lysates were prepared by boiling samples in Laemmli sample buffer. Cells were pelleted (200 ×g for 5 min), washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), resuspended in boiling Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then sonicated and stored at −20 °C until assayed. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%), with the exception of blots probed for cytochrome c and Bax where 15% SDS-PAGE gels were used, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were subsequently blocked in 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween-20. They were then incubated with appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween-20. They were then incubated for 45 min with either goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). We initially characterized the response of ML-1 human myelocytic leukemia cells to TNF. Since TNF is known to activate NF-κB signaling we performed a time course with TNF and measured IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, a requisite sequence of events in the activation of NF-κB (22.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In agreement with a previous report (23.Mudipalli A. Li Z. Hromchak R. Bloch A. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), ML-1 cells exhibited rapid IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in response to TNF (Fig. 1 A). This response was followed by IκBα resynthesis and phosphorylation, both of which depend on activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (Fig. 1 A). In addition to NF-κB activation, TNF transiently stimulates JNK signaling (24.Guo Y.L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We observed TNF to induce a rapid but transient increase in JNK activity with peak activation occurring at 10 min and then declining by 30 min as assessed with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes the activated form of JNK (Fig. 1 A). The kinetics of JNK dephosphorylation were strongly associated with the kinetics of IκBα resynthesis. This finding is in agreement with recent reports suggesting the involvement of NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in the suppression of JNK activation (17.De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18.Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To assess the capacity of ML-1 cells to undergo apoptosis in response to TNF, cells were exposed to TNF in combination with either CHX or act D for 3 h. As an index of apoptotic activity, lysates were immunoblotted for D4-GDI cleavage, a marker of caspase-3 activation (19.Krieser R.J. Eastman A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A 3-h treatment with either TNF, CHX, or act D alone exhibited no evidence of apoptosis as measured by D4-GDI cleavage (Fig. 1 B). However, apoptosis was markedly increased by TNF in combination with either CHX or act D (Fig. 1 B). We and others have shown that stress-induced apoptosis is associated with a sustained activation of the JNK pathway (13.Chen Y.R. Wang X.P. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 14.Stadheim T.A. Xiao H. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1533-1540PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Stadheim T.A. Kucera G.L. Leuk. Res. 2002; 26: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether apoptosis induced by TNF was also associated with a sustained increase in JNK activation. Whereas treatment with either TNF, CHX, or act D alone produced little increase in JNK phosphorylation by 3 h, TNF in combination with CHX or act D increased JNK phosphorylation with the intensity of JNK phosphorylation correlating with D4-GDI cleavage (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, we observed cleavage of the 54-kDa phospho-JNK isoform that correlated with D4-GDI cleavage. Cleavage of JNK has previously been reported to occur in a caspase-dependent manner after treatment with microtubule-interfering agents (14.Stadheim T.A. Xiao H. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1533-1540PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation of sustained JNK activation and cell death induced by CHX/TNF or act D/TNF is consistent with the findings of others (24.Guo Y.L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). CHX or act D inhibited TNF-induced IκBα resynthesis (Fig. 1 B). The inhibition of IκBα resynthesis correlated with sustained phospho-JNK levels and D4-GDI cleavage suggesting that the synthesis of NF-κB-dependent proteins may be important to maintaining the anti-apoptotic phenotype in TNF-treated cells. Taken together, these results show that apoptosis induced by TNF in combination with CHX or act D is characterized by a sustained activation of JNK and an inhibition of IκBα resynthesis. TNF induces COX-2 expression in a NF-κB-dependent manner (26.Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), whereas CDDO has been reported to inhibit cytokine-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein (6.Suh N. Wang Y. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Dmitrovsky E. Hickey W.F. Maue R.A. Place A.E. Porter D.M. Spinella M.J. Williams C.R. Wu G. Dannenberg A.J. Flanders K.C. Letterio J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nathan C.F. Nguyen L. Porter W.W. Ren R.F. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Subbaramaiah K. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that CDDO may negatively regulate NF-κB signaling. Since NF-κB has been implicated in the protection of TNF-treated cells from apoptosis (27.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), we tested whether CDDO would inhibit NF-κB signaling and increase apoptosis in TNF-treated ML-1 cells. Cells were treated with CDDO alone or in combination with TNF for 3 h and then assayed for JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis as determined by D4-GDI cleavage. CDDO concentrations of as much as 1 μm did not activate JNK and caused no cytotoxicity as assessed by D4-GDI cleavage (Fig. 2). However, JNK activation and apoptosis were detected at a CDDO concentration of 10 μm, the highest dose tested. In contrast, CDDO and TNF co-treatment resulted in a marked increase in JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis at lower concentrations of CDDO (1 μm) (Fig. 2). ERK activation was also measured and found to be unaffected by 1 μm CDDO treatment (data not shown). These data indicate that whereas short term exposure to CDDO or TNF separately are not acutely toxic, their use in combination results in a dramatic increase in the incidence of apoptosis. To investigate where CDDO inhibits the NF-κB signal transduction cascade, we measured TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation over a 10-min timeframe in the presence or absence of CDDO. CDDO had no effect on TNF-induced phosphorylation or degradation of IκBα, suggesting that CDDO may be inhibiting NF-κB signaling at a level downstream of IκBα degradation (Fig. 3 A). The impact of CDDO on TNF-induced JNK activation was also measured. CDDO did not affect the kinetics of JNK phosphorylation by TNF over this short time period (Fig. 3 A). As mentioned previously, TNF causes the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα followed by NF-κB-dependent resynthesis of IκBα. Thus, we tested whether CDDO affects IκBα resynthesis. IκBα was degraded and then resynthesized in response to TNF (Fig. 3 B). However, when cells were exposed to TNF in combination with CDDO no resynthesis of IκBα was observed (Fig. 3 B). p65RelA is a member of the NF-κB family and heterodimerizes with other family members and binds to IκBα in an inactive complex in unstimulated cells. Upon incubation with TNF, IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded by a ubiquitination-dependent process allowing NF-κB translocation into the nucleus where it can modulate gene expression. Because of our finding that resynthesis of the NF-κB-dependent protein IκBα was inhibited by CDDO, we next tested whether CDDO might be interfering with the translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus. ML-1 cells were pretreated with CHX or CDDO for 1 h followed by TNF for 15 min. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared and immunoblotted for p65RelA expression. TNF treatment caused the translocation of p65RelA from the cytosol to the nucleus, whereas treatment with either CDDO or CHX alone had no affect on p65RelA translocation (Fig. 3 C). In cells treated with CDDO or CHX in combination with TNF, there was no inhibition of p65RelAtranslocation. We also measured IκBα protein levels, which should be predominantly cytosolic. Indeed, we found IκBα to be exclusively cytosolic and, as expected, was degraded in all samples treated with TNF. Taken together these results indicate that CDDO inhibits IκBα resynthesis at a level downstream of p65RelAaccumulation in the nucleus. The finding that CDDO did not inhibit TNF-induced p65RelA translocation into the nucleus suggested that CDDO might be having an effect at the level of NF-κB binding to DNA or on subsequent transcriptional activity. Alternatively, CDDO could be acting in a nonselective manner thereby suppressing the synthesis of all proteins. We measured the capacity of CDDO to inhibit protein expression induced by the phorbol ester TPA. Cells were treated with either CDDO or CHX for 1 h followed by TPA or TNF for 3 h. Lysates were immunoblotted using antibodies to two proteins known to be induced by TPA, p21WAF1 and Mcl-1 (28.Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem.

CHX caused a reduction in basal levels of p21WAF1 and Mcl-1 as well as an inhibition of IκBα resynthesis after treatment with TNF (Fig. 4 A). However, CDDO did not inhibit TPA-induced p21WAF1 or Mcl-1. These results suggest that CDDO does not suppress protein synthesis in general but instead exerts an inhibitory effect on protein synthesis that is selective in nature. Presumably, the target of CDDO is at the level of transcription because 1 μm CDDO has been previously shown to inhibit cytokine-induced iNOS and Cox-2 mRNA (6.Suh N. Wang Y. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Dmitrovsky E. Hickey W.F. Maue R.A. Place A.E. Porter D.M. Spinella M.J. Williams C.R. Wu G. Dannenberg A.J. Flanders K.C. Letterio J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nathan C.F. Nguyen L. Porter W.W. Ren R.F. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Subbaramaiah K. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). However, TPA can also cause mRNA stabilization in addition to enhancing transcription (28.Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To confirm that TPA was indeed inducing transcription in this model, cells were incubated with act D. We found that whereas CDDO pretreatment had no effect on TPA-induced p21WAF1 and Mcl-1 levels, act D completely blocked the induction of these proteins (Fig. 4 B). These results are consistent with the idea that CDDO is a selective inhibitor of transcription. CDDO at a concentration of 5 μm has been shown to induce apoptosis after 24 h in cell culture through a caspase-8-dependent mechanism (8.Ito Y. Pandey P. Place A. Sporn M.B. Gribble G.W. Honda T. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 261-267PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether nontoxic concentrations of CDDO that sensitize ML-1 cells to apoptosis in the presence of TNF also activated caspase-8. ML-1 cells were treated with TNF in the presence or absence of CDDO, and cells were scored for apoptosis. Whereas CDDO or TNF treatment alone displayed no apoptosis after 3 h, the combination of CDDO and TNF caused a rapid induction of apoptosis in 100% of the cell population by 3 h (Fig. 5 A). We also observed the conversion of TNF-induced JNK phosphorylation from a weak transient signal to a strong sustained activation (Fig. 5 B). This increase in JNK phosphorylation preceded the cleavage of D4-GDI, the activation of caspa"

To investigate the self-assembly properties of NEMO and to understand further the mechanism of activation of the IKK complex, we purified wild-type and mutant NEMO expressed in Escherichia coli. In the absence of its IKK partners, recombinant NEMO (rNEMO) is a metastable functional monomer correctly folded, according to its fluorescence and far-UV CD spectra, which is binding specifically to the IKK complex. A minor fraction of rNEMO was found tightly associated with DnaK (E. coli Hsp70). We also examined the interaction of NEMO with prokaryotic and eukaryotic Hsp70, and we showed that the Hsp70-NEMO complex forms a supramolecular structure probably corresponding to an assembly intermediate. In vivo cross-linking experiments indicate that native NEMO in association with IKK is in equilibrium between a dimeric and a trimeric form. Similarly to native NEMO, a NEMO mutant deleted from its IKK binding N-terminal domain (residues 242–388) forms a stable trimeric coiled-coil, suggesting that the association of NEMO with IKK or with Hsp70 prevents incorrect interdomain pairing reactions that could lead to aggregation or to an non-native oligomeric state of rNEMO. We propose a model in which the activation of the IKK complex occurs through the trimerization of NEMO upon binding to a not yet identified upstream activator.

Among the signaling pathways known to date, the transcription factor NF-κB is one of the most intensely studied regulators of gene expression, playing a crucial role in inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Baeuerle P.A.

In most non-induced cell types it is sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive state through its association with members of a family of inhibitory proteins known as IκB. After cell stimulation, IκB proteins are rapidly phosphorylated by the IκB kinase complex (IKK) and are then degraded by the 26 S proteasome upon polyubiquitination (7Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar).

IKKα and IKKβ sharing 52% identity possess a similar organization in functional domains including a kinase, a leucine zipper, and a helix-loop-helix domain (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Although in cells IKKα and IKKβ are active both as homo- or as heterodimers promoted by their leucine zipper motifs, the heterodimer is the predominant form (12Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The recent generation of IKKα- and IKKβ-deficient mice showed different phenotypes assigning different functional roles to each catalytic subunit. Thus, whereas IKKβ is required for the activation of NF-κB, IKKα but not IKKβ seems rather involved in keratinocyte differentiation (13Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). NEMO, the third component of the IKK complex, was originally identified by functional complementation of cells that did not respond to a variety of stimuli (14Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). It associates preferentially with IKKβ, and its presence is crucial for the stimuli-dependent activation of the IKK complex. NEMO, which has no known catalytic activity, contains at least four structural motifs as deduced from the primary structure analysis. The N-terminal domain contains a large coiled-coil domain (CC1, residues 93–231) carrying most of the essential peptidic determinants required for binding to IKKβ (15May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is composed of three sub-domains including a coiled-coil (CC2, residues 246–286), leucine zipper (LZ, residues 303–337), and zinc finger motifs (ZF, residues 390–412). Consistent with an essential role for NEMO in the activation of the NF-κB pathway, two human pathologies, Incontinentia Pigmenti and Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia with Immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), were recently shown to be associated with a partial or total loss-of-function of NEMO (16Smahi A.

Interestingly, mutations responsible for EDA-ID were mainly found in the C-terminal part of the molecule. To date the molecular mechanism by which the IKK complex is activated remains unclear. It has been proposed that NEMO activates the IKK complex by recruiting the IKK kinase to a receptor. However, IKKβ alone is sufficient for the recruitment of IKK to TNF receptor 1 after TNFα stimulation in NEMO-deficient cells, indicating that NEMO is not essential for TNF-induced IKK recruitment (18Devin A. Lin Y. Yamaoka S. Li Z.W. Karin M. Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3986-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro cross-linking (12Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) showed the ability of NEMO to self-associate. NEMO oligomerization has also been shown to be crucial for IKK activation (19Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.H. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis experiments mapped the region of NEMO responsible for its self-association (21Ye J. Xie X. Tarassishin L. Horwitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9882-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but no correlation with its oligomeric state could be established. To understand further the molecular role of NEMO in the activation of the IKK complex, we have studied the biochemical properties of purified murine NEMO recombinant protein (rNEMO) as well as of a truncated C-terminal domain produced in Escherichia coli. The homologous Hsp70 of E. coli, DnaK, was found tightly associated to rNEMO, and we characterized this association by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation methods. As the Hsp70 protein family is relatively well conserved, the in vitro and in vivo association of NEMO with human Hsp70 was examined. We also investigated the oligomeric state of NEMO in vivo by protein cross-linking experiments. Consistent with our results a model was proposed in which the bipartite function of the C-terminal of NEMO modulates the activation of the IKK complex. Octyl glucoside (OG) and dodecyl maltoside (DDM) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tetraethylene glycol monooctyl ether (TGME) and Brij 35 were from Sigma, and the zwitterion detergent, zwittergent 3-16, was from Calbiochem. Bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH) and bis(maleimido)ethane (BMOE) were from Pierce. Murine NEMO was expressed in E. coli with the pRSETa expression system (Invitrogen). The NEMO cDNA (14Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) was cloned in-frame with the vector into BamHI and PvuII sites to give plasmid pRSETa/NEMO. The encoded polypeptide (rNEMO) contains an N-terminal extension of 34 residues (MRGS(H)6GMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDRW) inserted at position 2 in NEMO. This sequence contains a His tag and a site of proteolysis by enterokinase. A truncated mutant of NEMO corresponding to a part of its C-terminal domain (amino acids 242–388) was made by PCR mutagenesis using the plasmid pRSETa/NEMO as template. Briefly, NEMO cDNA was amplified between the 5′ primer oligonucleotide 5′- GCACGCTAGCTACGACAGCCACATTAAGAGC and the 3′ primer oligonucleotide 5′- GCACGGATCC CTA GTCAGGAGGTTCTTCAGGAGG. This introduced NheI and BamHI sites (underlined) and a stop codon (bold) at position 388 in the polypeptide sequence. After amplification, the fragment was digested with NheI and BamHI and cloned into a pET-28b expression vector (Novagen). The nucleotide sequences of NEMO and of the D242-F388Stop fragment were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of rNEMO was performed starting from a 2-liter culture of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pRSETa/NEMO grown at 22 °C in 2× YT/ampicillin (50 μg/ml) medium to A600 = 1, and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the medium for 5 h. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were washed twice in a buffer, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmdithioerythritol, resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithioerythritol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and broken in a French press at 1,500 pounds/square inch. The lysate was then diluted 2.5-fold with the equilibrium buffer of the Ni-NTA column (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DDM) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on a 25-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, 1.6 × 12.5 cm) charged with Ni2+. After washing with the equilibrium buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, the bound material was eluted at 110 mm imidazole by a 400-ml linear gradient (10–400 mm imidazole) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DDM. Fractions containing rNEMO were pooled (70 ml) according to optical density profile and SDS-PAGE, and dialyzed twice against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithioerythritol, and 1 mm DDM (buffer A). An rNEMO sample was then applied to a Resource Q column (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the buffer A and eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient 30–500 mm KCl. Fractions containing rNEMO (according to the OD profile and to SDS-PAGE) were pooled (15 ml) and dialyzed against 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mm DDM. The solution was then applied onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (1.6 cm × 15 cm, Bio-Rad) and eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient (10–400 mm) of potassium phosphate. The peak of rNEMO was pooled (65 ml), concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore), and dialyzed twice against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DDM, and 50% glycerol before freezing at −80 °C at a concentration of 4.9 mg/ml. The first purification steps of the C-terminal fragment (D242-F388Stop fragment) were the same as described above for rNEMO except that the recombinant protein was produced at 37 °C from 1 liter of culture, and 0.1 mm DDM was used instead of 1 mm in all buffers. The elution from the Ni-NTA column was performed using a higher concentration of imidazole (250 mm) as compared with rNEMO. Fractions (5 ml) containing the C-terminal domain were pooled and dialyzed against buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.1 mm DDM (buffer B). The protein sample (≈15 mg) was then loaded on a Resource Q column (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the buffer B. A majority of the protein sample (80%) passed through the column and corresponded to homogeneous D242-F388Stop fragment (see Fig. 5). 20% was bound to the matrix and eluted with a 120-ml gradient (50 mm to 1 m) of KCl. This fraction contained truncated rNEMO associated to DnaK with a stoichiometry of 1:1 as judged by SDS-PAGE. Both fractions were dialyzed twice against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 50% glycerol, and 1 mm DDM and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined either by the method of Bradford or by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.352 unit·mg−1·cm2 for rNEMO and of 0.181 unit·mg−1·cm2 for the truncated rNEMO. Microsequencing of an internal peptide of the DnaK protein was performed as described previously (22Fontan E. Briend E. Saklani-Jusforgues H. d'Alayer J. Vandekerckhove J. Fauve R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8353-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the amino acid sequence comparisons were carried out using the protein data base Colibri. Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads suspensions (25 μl, Qiagen) equilibrated with the buffer C (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DDM, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mmdithioerythritol) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the purified His-tagged NEMO. After separation of beads with a magnet, the excess protein was removed, and beads captured with His-NEMO were washed twice with a 100-μl volume of buffer D (20 mmNaPO4, pH 7.0, 20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DDM, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm dithioerythritol). DnaK (StressGen) or human Hsp70 (Sigma) was then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer C containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Magnetic beads were separated and washed 3 times with buffer D (100 μl). Hsp70 proteins trapped by His-tagged NEMO were recovered by elution with buffer D containing 300 mm imidazole followed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. Cell culture, transfection of 293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (14Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using anti-Hsp70 antibodies provided by Sigma. Cell culture and preparation of S100 extracts from 70Z/3 murine pre-B cell and the NF-κB unresponsive mutant 1.3E2 were carried out as described previously (14Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). His-tagged NEMO or His-tagged C-terminal domains (0.15 mg/ml, 200 μl), which were used as bait, were incubated with Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads (100 μl, Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer C. After separation with a magnet, the supernatant containing His-tagged proteins in excess was removed, and the beads saturated with His proteins were washed twice with buffer D (200 μl) and incubated in a 200-μl volume of buffer D at 4 °C for 1 h with S100 extracts from 70Z/3 and 1.3E2 cells containing 0.8 and 1 mg/ml of proteins, respectively. After extensive washing in buffer D, His-tagged proteins were recovered by elution with buffer D containing 300 mm imidazole (100 μl). The IKK complex trapped (pellet) or not trapped (supernatant) was detected by Western blotting using anti-IKKα antibodies (Imgenex). The amount of His-tagged protein immobilized by Ni-NTA beads was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie staining. The CD spectrum of rNEMO (15 μm) or of the truncated C-terminal domain (36 μm) was recorded from 182 to 260 nm at 20 °C and pH 7.0 in a buffer 20 mm potassium phosphate containing 1 mm DDM and 1 mm dithioerythritol (buffer E) using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectrodichrograph (Longjumeau, France). Cells (20 μl) with a path length of 0.1 mm were used, and the product of the time constant and the rate of scanning were below 0.33 nm (23Hennessey J.P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Each spectrum was the result of the average of three scans taken from the same sample minus the average of three scans from the reference buffer. Deconvolution of CD spectra was performed according to the method of Chang et al. (24Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) using the MDFITT program as described previously (25Agou F. Yang Y.S. Gesquiere J.C. Waller J.P. Guittet E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fluorescence spectrum was recorded in buffer E at 20 °C on a PTI spectrofluorometer QuantamasterTM. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm to minimize the contribution of tyrosyl residues to the total fluorescence. The excitation and emission bandwidths were both set to 2 nm. The fluorescence yield was determined as described previously (26Deville-Bonne D. Sellam O. Merola F. Lascu I. Desmadril M. Veron M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14643-14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The apparent Stokes radius of rNEMO was determined both at 20 and 4 °C by filtration of 400-μl samples on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm DDM, and 1 mmdithioerythritol (buffer F), developed at a constant flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The respective elution of standard globular protein or rNEMO was described in terms of Ve −V0 (ml) corresponding to the product of Kav and VT −V0, where Ve is the elution volume of the particular protein; V0 and VT are void and total volumes of the column determined with blue dextran 2000 and dithioerythritol, respectively. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa, RS = 82.3 Å), ferritin (440 kDa, RS = 59.1 Å), catalase (232 kDa,RS = 52.4 Å), aldolase (158 kDa,RS = 46.4 Å), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa,RS = 35.2 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa,RS = 27.5 Å), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa,RS = 21.1 Å), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa,RS = 16.4 Å) were used for calibration. Prior to sedimentation, rNEMO was injected on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in buffer F at 4 °C. The fraction (0.8 mg/ml in 500 μl) corresponding to the median of the elution peak was analyzed by centrifugation, using the equilibrium buffer of the column as reference. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 10 °C to minimize protein aggregation on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-Ti60 titanium four-hole rotor with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Samples of 400 μl were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm, and radial scans of absorbance at 280 nm were taken at 1-min intervals. Data were analyzed using the computer programs Svedberg (27Philo J.S.

The first scans with incomplete clearing of the meniscus were not taken into account for the fitting function. The XLA-VELOC program supplied by Beckman was used for the calculation of the apparent sedimentation coefficient g(s*)t from the time derivative of the sedimentation velocity concentration profile as described previously (28Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient of species M1determined using two species model with Svedberg corresponded to the peak position in the g(s*) profiles. Sedimentation and diffusion coefficients were corrected to standard conditions, s20 w and D20 w. A partial specific volume of 0.720 cm3/g at 10 °C for rNEMO was calculated from its amino acid composition according to Ref. 29Laue T.M. Bhaivari D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E.

Solvent density and viscosity at 10 °C were 1.008 g/cm3 and 1.3 × 10−2cp, respectively, determined from published tables (29Laue T.M. Bhaivari D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J.

Hydrodynamic parameters such as frictional ratio f/f0 and Stokes radius were deduced from the Teller method (30Teller D.C. Nature. 1976; 260: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using the SEDNTERP program provided by John Philo. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with rNEMO were carried out at 10 °C at 8,000 or 12,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Initial loading concentrations (120 μl) were either 0.34 mg/ml in a buffer 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm OG, and 1 mmdithioerythritol or 0.25 mg/ml in a buffer 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mmTGME, and 1 mm dithioerythritol. In the study of the C-terminal fragment, experiments were performed using two loading concentrations (1 and 1.2 mg/ml in 120 μl) and two rotor speeds (12,000 and 18,000 rpm) in a single run as described in Table II. Protein samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 h, and duplicate scans (2 h apart) were overlaid to determine that there were no further changes in the sample cell. After collecting data at equilibrium, the samples were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 12 h to sediment the protein, and radial scans were again collected to obtain a base-line correction for each cell. To determine the buoyant molecular mass, we followed the formalism of Reynolds and Tanford (31Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because the density of the detergent TGME (C8E4) was close to that of buffer, the second term in the second member of Equation 1 was negligible. In contrast, the ν̄Det of detergent micelle OG was low (0.92 ± 0.004 ml/g at 20 °C (32Lustig A. Engel A. Tsiotis G. Landau E.M. Baschong W. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the addition of sucrose can change dramatically the oligomer equilibrium or the protein hetero-association. We rather used an OG concentration of 10 mm below its critical micelle concentration (30 mm) to prevent detergent micelle formation such that the second term becomes negligible due to a low δDet. At 10 °C the densities were 1.009 and 1.007 g/ml in the buffers containing 10 mm TGME and 10 mm OG, respectively. The partial specific volumes of DnaK and of DnaK-rNEMO complex calculated from their amino acid composition were 0.731 and 0.726 ml/g, respectively, at 10 °C.

We have recently shown that Gs-coupled receptors can stimulate PLC-ε, apparently via formation of cyclic AMP and activation of the Ras-related GTPase Rap2B. Here we report that PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR expressed in HEK-293 cells also involves, in part, similar mechanisms. M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation and [Ca2+]i increase were reduced by 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (dd-Ado), a direct adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. On the other hand, overexpression of Gαs or Epac1, a cyclic AMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap GTPases, enhanced M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation. Inactivation of Ras-related GTPases with clostridial toxins suppressed the M3 mAChR responses. The inhibitory toxin effects were mimicked by expression of inactive Rap2B, but not of other inactive GTPases (Rac1, Ras, RalA, Rap1A, and Rap2A). Activation of the M3 mAChR induced GTP loading of Rap2B, an effect strongly enhanced by overexpression of Gαs and inhibited by dd-Ado. Overexpression of PLC-ε and PLC-β1, but not PLC-γ1 or PLC-δ1, enhanced M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation and [Ca2+]i increase. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive PLC-ε mutant reduced PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR and abrogated the potentiating effect of Gαs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR is a composite action of PLC-β1 stimulation by Gαq and stimulation of PLC-ε apparently mediated by Gs-dependent cyclic AMP formation and subsequent activation of Rap2B.

The eleven PLC isoforms (PLC-β1–4, PLC-γ1–2, PLC-δ1–4, and PLC-ε) identified so far differ largely in their structure and regulatory mechanisms. Receptor regulation of PLC-β and PLC-γ isozymes is well established. While tyrosine kinase receptors, such as those for epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, activate PLC-γ enzymes by recruitment to the autophosphorylated receptor and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate PLC-β enzymes, either via GTP-liganded α subunits of the Gq class of G proteins or by βγ dimers liberated from Gi type G proteins (3.Exton J.H.

The very recently identified PLC-ε contains, in addition to the PLC-defining catalytic and calcium-binding domains, two Ras-binding domains and a Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain. Initial data suggest that the activity of PLC-ε is controlled by Gα12 and Ras and Rap GTPases, by yet unresolved mechanisms; thus, PLC-ε may link signaling by heterotrimeric G proteins and Ras-related GTPases (7.Lopez I.

We very recently observed that Gs-coupled receptors,i.e. the β2-adrenoreceptor expressed in HEK-293 cells and the prostaglandin E1 receptor endogenously expressed in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, can induce PLC stimulation and PLC-dependent calcium signaling (15.Schmidt M.

These receptor responses were apparently dependent on Gs-mediated cyclic AMP formation and under control of the Ras-related GTPase Rap2B. As activation of the M3 mAChR expressed in HEK-293 can increase cyclic AMP levels (11.Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), we examined whether M3mAChR signaling to PLC may involve cyclic AMP and Rap GTPases as well. We report here that the M3 mAChR can stimulate PLC-ε and that this PLC stimulation is apparently mediated by Gs-dependent formation of cyclic AMP and subsequent activation of the GTPase Rap2B. myo-[3H]Inositol (10–25 Ci/mmol) and d-myo-[3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ([3H]IP3; 21 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Expression of the encoded proteins was verified by the immunoblotting of cell lysates with specific antibodies. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. For measurement of inositol phosphate formation, cellular phospholipids were labeled by incubating cells for 24 h with myo-[3H]inositol (0.5 μCi/ml) in growth medium. Thereafter, the adherent cells were first treated for 10 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution, containing 118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmd-glucose, buffered at pH 7.4 with 15 mm HEPES, plus 10 mm LiCl, followed then by further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of stimulatory agents and determination of [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. For measurement of IP3 formation, unlabeled cells were incubated for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C with and without carbachol.

To study the effects of dd-Ado, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with the agent or its solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%); dd-Ado was also present during the PLC assays. To study the effects of clostridial toxins, the cells were treated for 24 h without and with the toxins at the indicated concentrations, followed by PLC activity assays. Intracellular free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined in cell suspensions with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 in a Hitachi spectrofluorometer as described previously (17.Schmidt M.

After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 15 μg of purified glutathioneS-transferase-tagged RalGDS-RBD (Rap-binding domain of the Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and finally incubated in Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 95 °C. Bound Rap2-GTP was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-Rap2 antibody (15.Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomansney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat.

For detection of Ras (dilution of 1:400), RalA (dilution 1:5000), Rac1, Rap1A, Rap2A, Rap2B, HA-tagged Epac1, HA-tagged Gαs, PLC-β1, PLC-δ1, PLC-γ1 (each at a dilution of 1:500), and PLC-ε (dilution 1:2500), equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 or 15% acrylamide gels. After a transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and a 1-h incubation with the antibodies at the above given dilution factors, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Data shown in figures are means ± S.E. of n independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Comparisons between means were either with the Student's paired t test or one-way analysis of variance test, and a difference was regarded significant at p < 0.05. Curves were analyzed by fitting iterative nonlinear regression analysis to the experimental data with the GraphPad Prism program (Version 2.0, 1995). We have recently reported that stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by the β2-adrenoreceptor expressed in HEK-293 cells or direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin results in PLC stimulation (15.Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomansney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To examine whether cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP-dependent processes are involved in PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR as well, several approaches were used. First, we studied the effect of the P-site adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, dd-Ado (19.Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), on PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. Treatment of the cells with dd-Ado (10 μm) had no effect on unstimulated inositol phosphate accumulation or IP3 levels. However, dd-Ado strongly reduced, by 30–40%, IP3 formation or inositol phosphate accumulation (see below) stimulated by the mAChR agonist, carbachol (Fig. 1 A). In line with this inhibition, dd-Ado significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced the carbachol (1 μm)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i from 485 ± 25 nm to 246 ± 35 nm (n = 8–10). Second, we examined whether overexpression of Gαs, the adenylyl cyclase-stimulatory G protein, alters PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR. In cells overexpressing Gαs, basal inositol phosphate formation was not altered. However, PLC stimulation induced by carbachol (1 μm) was increased by about 50%. This increase in PLC stimulation was almost fully suppressed by treatment of the cells with 10 μm dd-Ado (Fig. 1 B). Together, these data suggested that PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR is, at least in part, dependent on cyclic AMP formation. As observed with β2-adrenoreceptor-induced PLC stimulation (15.Schmidt M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), treatment of HEK-293 cells with the protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89 (10 μm), had no significant effect on PLC stimulation induced by carbachol, neither in control cells nor in cells overexpressing Gαs (data not shown), suggesting that the action of cyclic AMP is mediated by another effector. Therefore, we overexpressed Epac1, a cyclic AMP-activated GEF for Rap GTPases (18.De Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L.

Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, similar to Gαs, overexpression of Epac1 had no effect on basal PLC activity, but strongly enhanced PLC stimulation induced by carbachol (1 μm). Overexpression of Epac1 also strongly enhanced the potency of carbachol to increase [Ca2+]i in HEK-293 cells. While carbachol increased [Ca2+]iin control cells with an EC50 value of 450 ± 14 nm, this value was reduced by about one order of magnitude, to 26 ± 2 nm, in cells overexpressing Epac1 (Fig. 2 A). These data suggested that cyclic AMP/Epac1-controlled Rap GTPases are involved in PLC stimulation by the M3mAChR. To study whether and which type of Rap GTPases are involved in PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR, we first examined the effects of C. difficile toxin B-1470 andC. sordellii lethal toxin, known to inactivate Ras-related GTPases (21.Schmidt M. Voß M. Thiel M. Bauer B. Grannaß A. Tapp E. Cool R.H. de Gunzburg J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

Treatment of HEK-293 cells for 24 h with 300 pg/ml toxin B-1470 and 100 ng/ml lethal toxin strongly reduced inositol phosphate accumulation (data not shown) and IP3 formation induced by carbachol (Fig. 2 B). PLC stimulation induced by the direct G protein activators, AlF4− (intact cells) and GTPγS (permeabilized cells), was also strongly reduced in cells treated with the toxins (data not shown). The reduction in M3 mAChR-mediated IP3 formation was paralleled by an attenuation of receptor-mediated [Ca2+]iincrease. While carbachol (1 μm) increased [Ca2+]i by 485 ± 50 nm(n = 8) in control cells, this increase was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced to 305 ± 35 nm (n = 10) and 265 ± 25 nm (n = 6) in cells treated with toxin B-1470 and lethal toxin, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of the cells with the toxins, however, did not alter the number of cell surface M3 mAChRs, determined by binding of the membrane-impermeant mAChR antagonist,N-[3H]methylscopolamine, in intact cells (16.Schmidt M. Frings M. Mono M.-L. Guo Y. Oude Weernink P.A. Evellin S. Han L. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32603-32610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the carbachol-induced binding of [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) to G proteins, measured in permeabilized cells (23.Schmidt M.

Furthermore, the toxins had no effect on the cellular PIP2 levels, measured as [3H]PIP2 or PIP2 mass in control and toxin-treated cells (24.Oude Weernink P.A. Schulte P. Guo Y. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Haverland S. Voβ M. Schmidt M. Mayr G.W. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and did not reduce Ca2+ (1 μm)-stimulated PLC activity, measured with exogenous PIP2 in cell lysates (17.Schmidt M. Bienek C. Rümenapp U. Zhang C. Lümmen G. Jakobs K.H. Just I. Aktories K. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, inhibition of PLC and calcium signaling by the GTPase-inactivating toxins was apparently not due to a loss of cell curface receptors, a defective receptor-G protein coupling, a fall in PLC substrate levels, or a general reduction in PLC activities, suggesting that inhibition of M3 mAChR signaling to PLC by the toxins is caused by inactivation of small GTPases specifically involved in PLC stimulation. To identify the specific GTPase, we expressed inactive mutants of the GTPases serving as toxin substrates. Compared with the expression of the endogenous GTPases, the various GTPase mutants were overexpressed to a comparable level (Fig. 3 A). However, the GTPase mutants largely differed in their effects on PLC signaling. Expression of inactive Rac1, H-Ras, RalA, RalB (not shown), Rap1A, and Rap2A did neither change basal PLC activity nor PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR. In contrast, in cells expressing S17N Rap2B PLC stimulation induced by carbachol was reduced by 40–50% (Fig. 3 A). In line with their distinct effects on PLC stimulation, expression of S17N Rap2B, but not S17N Ras or S17N Rap1A (not shown), strongly (p < 0.0001) reduced the carbachol (1 μm)-induced [Ca2+]i increase, from 535 ± 55 nm in control cells to 310 ± 45 nm (n = 6–8) in cells expressing S17N Rap2B (Fig. 3 B). Next, we studied whether Rap2B is activated by the M3 mAChR and whether this activation is affected by agents inhibiting or enhancing receptor-mediated PLC stimulation. Carbachol (1 μm) treatment of HEK-293 cells enhanced GTP loading of endogenous and overexpressed Rap2B, as determined by extraction of the GTPase from cell lysates with immobilized RalGDS-RBD (Fig. 4). Expression of constitutively active Gα12 (Q229L Gα12) or overexpression of wild-type Gαi2 (not shown), both of which did not alter carbachol-induced PLC stimulation (14, not shown), had no effect on M3 mAChR-induced Rap2B activation. In contrast, overexpression of Gαs or Epac1 (not shown), which by themselves did not alter the activity state of Rap2B, strongly enhanced the stimulatory effect of carbachol (Fig. 4). Treatment of the cells with dd-Ado (10 μm) almost completely (by 90 ± 5%;n = 4) abrogated the potentiating effect of Gαs (data not shown). Thus, the M3 mAChR activates Rap2B and, similarly as observed for PLC stimulation, this activation is apparently controlled by cyclic AMP. We next sought to determine which PLC isozyme is activated by the M3 mAChR. For this, we examined the effects of overexpression of PLC-β1, PLC-γ1, PLC-δ1, and PLC-ε on basal and receptor-stimulated PLC activities. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, overexpression of PLC-γ1, which increased PLC stimulation by epidermal growth factor (not shown), did neither change basal PLC activity nor its stimulation by carbachol (1 μm). In cells overexpressing PLC-δ1, basal PLC activity was increased by 2.5-fold, whereas carbachol-stimulated PLC activity was not altered. In contrast, overexpression of PLC-β1 and PLC-ε enhanced PLC stimulation by carbachol by 50 and 70%, respectively, without altering basal PLC activity. In line with these data, carbachol (1 μm)-induced [Ca2+]i increase was strongly potentiated in cells overexpressing PLC-β1 or PLC-ε, from 470 ± 55 nm in control cells to 700 ± 45 nm in cells overexpressing PLC-β1 (n = 6–8; p < 0.0001) and from 524 ± 35 nm to 940 ± 65 nm in cells overexpressing PLC-ε (n = 8–10;p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to wild-type PLC-ε, expression of the catalytically inactive PLC-ε mutant, H1144L PLC-ε (7.Lopez I. Mak E.C. Ding J. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), reduced PLC stimulation by carbachol by 25% (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, expression of H1144L PLC-ε almost fully reversed the potentiating effect of co-expressed Gαs, suggesting that potentiation of PLC stimulation by Gαs is due to activation of the PLC-ε isozyme. This assumption was corroborated by studies with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, dd-Ado, in cells overexpressing PLC-ε or PLC-β1. As shown in Fig. 6 B, dd-Ado (10 μm) strongly reduced the potentiating effect of overexpressed PLC-ε on carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation, whereas dd-Ado was without effect in cells overexpressing PLC-β1, suggesting that cyclic AMP is involved in stimulation of PLC-ε, but not PLC-β1, by the M3 mAChR. We have recently reported that overexpression of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), which acts as a GTPase-activating protein for Gαq and Gαi proteins (25.De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 26.Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), strongly reduces M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation (14.Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Woznicki M. Han L. Jakobs K.H. Fahami-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, in cells overexpressing RGS4 M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation was reduced by about 40%. Most important, the inhibitory effect of dd-Ado (10 μm) on PLC stimulation was fully retained in cells overexpressing RGS4. In contrast, in cells expressing S17N Rap2B, in which the M3 mAChR response was reduced to a similar extent as in cells overexpressing RGS4, treatment with dd-Ado did not cause a further reduction in receptor-mediated PLC stimulation (Fig. 7 B). PTX-insensitive stimulation of PLC by GPCRs is generally assumed to be caused by direct activation of PLC-β isozymes by activated α-subunits of Gq type G proteins (3.Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 36: 481-509Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4.Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The M3 mAChR is a prototypical example of such GPCRs. PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR that preferentially couples to G proteins of the Gq family is PTX-insensitive (11.Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 12.Wess J. Crit. Rev.

Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently reported that PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR is specifically suppressed by RGS proteins inactivating PTX-resistant Gαq, but not Gα12 type G proteins (14.Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Woznicki M. Han L. Jakobs K.H. Fahami-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the Gαq-inactivating RGS4 reduced PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR only partially, by 60–70% (14.Rümenapp U. Asmus M. Schablowski H. Woznicki M. Han L. Jakobs K.H. Fahami-Vahid M. Michalek C. Wieland T. Schmidt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2474-2479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In studies with Gs-coupled receptors, we made very recently the unexpected observation that such receptors, i.e. the β2-adrenoreceptor expressed in HEK-293 cells and the prostanoid receptor endogenously expressed in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, can also mediate PLC stimulation (15.Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomansney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This PLC stimulation was PTX-insensitive and apparently mediated by Gs-dependent formation of cyclic AMP and activation of the Ras-related GTPase Rap2B, finally resulting in stimulation of the PLC-ε isozyme (15.Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomansney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As the M3 mAChR can couple to Gs and increase cyclic AMP formation (11.Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar,27.Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we examined in the present study whether PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR may involve similar mechanisms. We report here that PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR expressed in HEK-293 cells is a composite action on PLC-β1 and PLC-ε isozymes and that stimulation of PLC-ε by the M3 mAChR is apparently mediated by Gs-dependent cyclic AMP formation and activation of the GTPase Rap2B. First, treatment of the cells with the P-site adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, dd-Ado, reduced PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR. Second, overexpression of Gαs, which by itself had no effect on PLC activity, strongly enhanced M3 mAChR signaling to PLC. Third, a similar enhancement of M3mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation was observed in cells overexpressing the cyclic AMP-activated GEF for Rap GTPases, Epac1, while inhibition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A by H-89 was without effect. Fourth, inactivation of Ras-related GTPases with C. difficile toxin B-1470 and C. sordellii lethal toxin strongly reduced PLC stimulation. Fifth, the inhibitory toxin effects were mimicked by expression of an inactive Rap2B mutant, but not by inactive mutants of other GTPases serving as toxin substrates. Sixth, the M3 mAChR induced activation of Rap2B, and this activation was enhanced by overexpression of Gαs or Epac1 and suppressed by dd-Ado. Seventh, PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR was enhanced by overexpression of PLC-ε, similar to overexpression of PLC-β1, and reduced by expression of a catalytically inactive PLC-ε mutant. Finally, using various combinations, i.e. Gαs with H1144L PLC-ε and dd-Ado with PLC-β1, PLC-ε, RGS4, and S17N Rap2B, evidence is provided that cyclic AMP-dependent PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR involves Rap2B and the PLC-ε isozyme and that this stimulation is largely independent of PLC-β1 stimulation by Gαq. Activation of Gs and stimulation of adenylyl cyclase is not considered a primary function of the M3 mAChR, compared with coupling to Gq and stimulation PLC-β isozymes (12.Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were surprised to observe that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by dd-Ado and overexpression of cyclic AMP-activated Epac1 had such marked effects on M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation. Similarly as reported before by others (11.Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), increases in total cellular cyclic AMP levels in HEK-293 cells expressing the M3 mAChR were observed only at rather high carbachol concentrations (>1 μm) (data not shown). However, as shown herein, inhibition of M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation by dd-Ado was largely independent of the carbachol concentration used (Fig. 1 A), and overexpression of Epac1 markedly increased PLC stimulation and [Ca2+]iincrease induced by carbachol at low concentrations. A possible explanation for this finding is that, in contrast to many other GEFs for other small GTPases, Epac1 is a membrane-associated protein even in its basal activity state, i.e. in the absence of cyclic AMP, and is activated by cyclic AMP at the plasma membrane (28.De Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, similarly as recently described for activation of thel-type Ca2+ channel Cav 1.2 by the Gs- and adenylyl cyclase-coupled β2-adrenoreceptor (29.Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), Epac1 and the adenylyl cyclase may be assembled into a signaling complex at the plasma membrane, and local increases in cyclic AMP concentration not detected by measuring total cellular cyclic AMP levels may suffice to activate Epac1 and in consequence Rap2B. The existence of such a signaling complex is under investigation. The magnitude of PLC inhibition caused by expression of S17N Rap2B was in the similar range as the inhibition induced by treatment of the cells with dd-Ado. Taking the transfection efficiency of 50–60% into consideration, these data suggest that S17N Rap2B, in addition to inhibiting cyclic AMP-dependent stimulation of PLC-ε by the M3 mAChR, may also interfere with receptor stimulation of PLC-β1 via Gq proteins. However, PLC-β1, in contrast to PLC-ε, does not contain binding domains for Ras/Rap proteins, making a direct interaction of PLC-β1 with Rap2B unlikely. Recently, RGS14 has been shown to interact with Rap GTPases via a RBD domain also found in RGS12 (30.Traver S. Bidot C. Spassky N. Baltauss T. de Tand M.-F. Thomas J.-L. Zalc B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29275-29281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, no data have been reported whether Rap GTPases alter the GTPase-activating activities of these RGS proteins. Furthermore, RGS12 and RGS14 preferentially act on PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins (33.Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas PLC stimulation by the M3 mAChR is fully PTX-resistant. Thus, although an indirect action of Rap2B on Gαq cannot be excluded, an alternative explanation for the pronounced inhibitory effect of S17N Rap2B is that Rap2B is also activated by Gαq, independent of Gs-dependent cyclic AMP formation, finally resulting in stimulation of PLC-ε. Activation of Rap GTPases (Rap1 and Rap2) is not only achieved by the cyclic AMP-activated GEFs, Epac1 and Epac2 (18.De Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 20.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), but also by other Rap-specific GEFs, such as the CalDAG-GEFs, which are presumably activated by the second messengers, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (35.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and the PDZ-GEFs, for which the activation mechanisms are not yet known (36.De Rooij J. Boenink N.M. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38125-38130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable to assume that Gαq,e.g. by increasing Ca2+ and diacylglycerol levels via stimulation of PLC-β isozymes, activates Rap2B and thereby PLC-ε. Such a reaction may also explain why overexpression of PLC-ε enhanced M3 mAChR-mediated PLC stimulation at least as efficiently as overexpression of PLC-β1 (see Fig. 5). The involvement of additional Rap-GEFs in the M3 mAChR response will be addressed in future studies. In conclusion, we report here that PLC and calcium signaling by the M3 mAChR is mediated by the two PTX-insensitive G proteins, Gq and Gs, finally resulting in stimulation of PLC-β1 and PLC-ε, respectively. While stimulation of PLC-β1 is most likely caused by direct interaction with activated Gαq proteins, stimulation of PLC-ε is apparently dependent on cyclic AMP formation and activation of Epac1 and in consequence Rap2B. This GTPase seems also to be involved in overall PLC stimulation by Gq, suggesting that Rap2B and its exchange factors play a major role in PLC stimulation by GPCRs. We thank K. Baden, M.

The basic structure of the axoneme consisting of nine outer microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair (9 + 2 arrangement) is one of the most highly conserved structures in all of cell biology (1Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: S107-S124Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar,2Haimo L.T. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: S125-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 9 + 2 arrangement is found in many diverse organisms ranging from the flagella of Chlamydomonas and the gill cilia of freshwater mussels to the sperm flagella of sea urchins and respiratory tract cilia of humans. Despite the structural similarity, each of these axonemes is specialized for a particular function. Thus, the waveform of a sperm flagellum (3Ishijima S. Witman G.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which functions to propel the sperm forward, is very different from the coordinated beating of respiratory tract cilia, which function to transport mucus over airway surfaces (4Satir P. Sleigh M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Moreover, the regulation of the activity of each specialized axoneme is also likely to be unique. For example, increases in Ca2+have been shown to stimulate ciliary beating of tracheal epithelial cells (5Salathe M. Bookman R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 431-440PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Paramecium cilia respond to increased Ca2+ by reversing the direction of beating (6Naitoh Y. Kaneko H. Science. 1972; 176: 523-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These functional differences are a reflection of unique modifications of the structure and composition of each specialized axoneme. For example,Chlamydomonas flagella have three outer arm dynein heavy chains (DHCs) 1The abbreviations used are: DHCdynein heavy chainHBEhuman bronchial epithelialPCDprimary ciliary dyskinesiaLC-MS/MSliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometryPBSphosphate-buffered salinePBSTPBS plus Tween 20 (7King S.M.

Marchese-Ragona S.P. Johnson K.A. Wall J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 11: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clear that although the basic structure and components of cilia and flagella are conserved, specialization of function has resulted in important variations of structure and regulation among the different motile axonemes. dynein heavy chain human bronchial epithelial primary ciliary dyskinesia liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry phosphate-buffered saline PBS plus Tween 20 The Chlamydomonas flagellum represents the most thoroughly characterized axonemal structure. Through the use of readily obtained mutants and computer-assisted image analysis of electron micrographs, the positions and functions of many of the proteins that make up the inner and outer dynein arms, which provide the force for axonemal motility, have been identified in this species. As noted above, the outer dynein arms of Chlamydomonas contain three DHCs known as α, β, and γ (7King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The arrangement and composition of DHCs in the inner arms are more complex with at least eight different DHCs organized into seven distinct inner arm complexes (9Porter M.E. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F37-F42Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, our understanding of mammalian axonemes, including human respiratory tract cilia, is limited. This is partly because of the difficulties involved in obtaining sufficient material for biochemical characterization but also because, unlike Chlamydomonas, the development of mutants (i.e. murine knock-out models) is time- and labor-intensive. However, there is a naturally occurring disease in which individuals display an inherited defect in ciliary function known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (10Schidlow D.V. Ann. Allergy. 1994; 73: 457-470PubMed Google Scholar, 11Meeks M. Bush A. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2000; 29: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cilia from PCD patients demonstrate an abnormal pattern of ciliary beating and in some cases are completely immotile. In most cases of PCD, the defects in ciliary function are correlated with abnormal ciliary structure with the absence of inner and/or outer dynein arms being the most frequently reported defect. Thus, cilia from these individuals are analogous to mutant flagella from Chlamydomonas, and studies of these defective cilia will probably yield new information about the structure of mammalian axonemes. To further our understanding of the structure and regulation of human respiratory tract cilia, we have begun a detailed characterization of the components of this complex organelle. By culturing human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells under conditions that support ciliated cell differentiation, we have obtained sufficient quantities of human ciliary axonemes for biochemical and molecular analysis. As an approach to identify specific components of the inner dynein arm, ciliary axonemes from normal cells were compared with ciliary axonemes from PCD cells lacking inner dynein arms. Proteins absent in the PCD cilia were identified by mass spectrometry of the corresponding protein from control cilia. This approach identified human DNAH7 as a likely component of the axonemal inner arm. To further characterize this DHC, the partial sequence data obtained by mass spectrometry were used to clone a full-length cDNA. The expression of DNAH7 during ciliogenesis was examined both by Northern blotting and by using specific antibodies developed against a recombinant fragment of the protein. Finally, the expression of DNAH7 was examined in HBE cells from the PCD patient. HBE cells were obtained from excess surgical tissue under protocols approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board. HBE cells were obtained from normal subjects (transplant donors), a patient with established PCD who required a lung transplant, and as disease controls, cystic fibrosis patients. No differences were observed between cilia from the normal and cystic fibrosis cells. Passage 1 or passage 2 HBE cells were grown at an air-liquid interface using previously described procedures (12Gray T.E. Guzman K. Davis C.W. Abdullah L.H. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar,13Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. William Davis C. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

After reaching confluence, medium was removed from the apical surface, and cultures were fed from only the basal surface for the remainder of the experiment. The medium was replaced every 2–3 days, and cilia were isolated from well differentiated cultures after 4–6 weeks. Cilia were isolated essentially as described previously (14Hastie A.T. Dicker D.T. Hingley S.T. Kueppers F. Higgins M.L. Weinbaum G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Reed W. Carson J.L. Moats-Staats B.M. Lucier T., Hu, P. Brighton L. Gambling T.M. Huang C.H. Leigh M.W. Collier A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Heavily ciliated cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove mucus and cell debris. Deciliation buffer (14Hastie A.T. Dicker D.T. Hingley S.T. Kueppers F. Higgins M.L. Weinbaum G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was added to the surface, and the culture was rocked gently for 1 min. The supernatant was collected, and the procedure was repeated. The two washings were pooled and after pelleting debris at 1000 × g, the ciliary axonemes were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and frozen at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA reagent (Pierce). For analysis of high molecular weight ciliary proteins, samples were electrophoresed on 4% Tris-glycine-SDS gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To facilitate analysis by mass spectrometry, proteins were visualized by staining with colloidal blue (Pro-Blue, Owl Separation Systems, Woburn, MA) according to the manufacturer with the omission of the first fixation step. In-gel digestion with trypsin, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), and searching of data bases were all performed using standard techniques essentially as described previously (16Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley A. Koc H. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32585-32591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of the high molecular weight protein identified a partial cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number Z83801) encompassing the P1-loop of a DHC. The sequence of DNAH7 that lies 5′ to the P1-loop was obtained by sequence walking employing successive steps of PCR with vector primers and DNAH7-specific primers obtained from verified sequences from the previous step. An oligo(dT) and random-primed cDNA library generated from heavily ciliated HBE cell RNA prepared by Stratagene in λZAP was used as template. The sequence of DNAH7 that lies 3′ to the P1-loop was obtained by amplification of the sequence between the P1-loop region and another partial cDNA sequence identified by mass spectrometry, KIAA0944 (GenBankTM accession number AB023161). In general, PCR was performed for 40 cycles (4 min at 94 °C initially followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 5 min) using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reaction conditions were as follows: 50 μl of total volume containing 2 μl of cDNA library supernatant, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.75 μl of enzyme mix (Expand Long Template PCR System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the buffer system provided by the manufacturer. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Automated DNA Sequencing Facility. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to verify the sequence obtained from the library and to search for mutations in the PCD patient. Primer pairs located throughout the sequence were used that yielded 24 overlapping sequences of 700–800 bp. Total RNA was isolated from well differentiated cultures of HBE cells using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio). First strand cDNA was prepared using 3 μg of total RNA and 250 ng of random primers with SuperScript II RNaseH− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. 1 μl of the first strand reaction was used in a 50-μl PCR mixture containing 10 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in manufacturer's buffer with 2 mm MgCl2. Reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min with a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. RT-PCR products were gel-purified using QIAquickTM gel extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Products were directly sequenced in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Sequencing Facility using DNAH7-specific sequencing primers. To verify identified sequence variations on genomic DNA, genomic sequence from the data base (GenBankTM accession numbers AC068528, AC068919, and AC013274) was used to design primers on either side of the variation, usually one primer in the exon and one primer in the intronic region surrounding the exon. These primers were used to amplify the region of interest from genomic DNA (50 ng). PCR conditions and sequencing were as described above for RT-PCR. Sequence assembly and analyses were performed using Vector NTI suite 6 (InforMax), GCG (Genetics Computer Group), and BLAST (NCBI) programs. For antibody production, a 0.8-kb BglII/EcoRI cDNA fragment of DNAH7 consisting of amino acids 1531–1780 of our established sequence was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate plasmid pET-H7. This construct was used to produce a DNAH7 peptide that was designated H7. In addition, a peptide from a similar region of DNAH9 (GenBankTM accession number AF257737) consisting of amino acids 2057–2346 was obtained by PCR of the differentiated airway cell library using primers 5′-ATCAAGTCCGTGCTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-CAAGATCTGAACCATGCTCTGCTCTG-3′, which contains a BglII site. The product was cloned into the pET-28a vector using BglII and BamHI (the BamHI site was in the DNAH9 cDNA sequence) to produce plasmid pET-H9. This plasmid produced a peptide that was designated H9. For antibody production, the H7 peptide was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) using a HisTrap purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein was further fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the band containing H7 peptide was excised and submitted to Aves Laboratories (Tigard, OR) for immunization to obtain chicken anti-DNAH7 antibody. The chicken IgY from the eggs of the immunized chickens was purified by the manufacturer. For testing the specificity of the antibodies produced, [35S]methionine-labeled H7 and H9 proteins were generated using TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol using plasmids pET-H7 and pET-H9 as templates. Immunoprecipitation was conducted by mixing 1 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins with 1 μl of anti-DNAH7 chicken IgY. The mixture was then incubated with 25 μl of immobilized anti-chicken IgY (Promega) in 500 μl of PBS containing 1% Empigen BB detergent, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound proteins were removed by several washes of the beads with the binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH,6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. Cultured cells were washed with cold PBS and scraped into SDS lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol). Samples were then boiled for 5 min and passed through a 25-G needle 10 times to shear the genomic DNA. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA kit. One-tenth volume of 1 m dithiothreitol and 1% bromphenol blue were added before gel electrophoresis. The total cell lysates (50 μg) or aliquots of purified cilia were separated on precast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in NuPAGE transfer buffer at 30 volts for 2 h using the Novex Xcell blotting apparatus. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with BlockHen (Aves Laboratories) diluted 1:5 in PBST (0.58 mNa2HPO4, 0.017 mNaH2PO4, 0.68 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) or with 5% milk in PBST followed by the incubation with the chicken anti-DNAH7 IgY (1:10,000 dilution) or anti-β-tubulin IV (1:4000 dilution, monoclonal, Biogenetex, Seabrook, TX) for 1 h. β-Tubulin IV is known to be localized in cilia (17Renthal R. Schneider B.G. Miller M.M. Luduena R.F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and was used as a control for axonemal protein loading. Membranes were then washed with PBST plus 1% milk and incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-chicken IgY from Aves Laboratories or rabbit anti-mouse IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Immunoreactivity was detected using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunostaining, ciliated cultures of HBE cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and embedded in paraffin. The sections were deparaffinized twice in xylene and rehydrated in an ethanol series. Slides were then immersed in methanol containing 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activities. Slides were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% goat or rabbit serum, 1% gelatin, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) and then for 1 h with the anti-DNAH7 (1:250 dilution in blocking buffer) or anti-β-tubulin IV (diluted 1:500) antibodies. Preimmune IgY from the same chicken that generated the anti-DNAH7 antibody was used as a control for anti-DNAH7 antibody at a 4-fold higher concentration. The sections were then washed with PBST followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h. The signal was detected with SIGMA FAST DAB (Sigma) for 15 min. The sections were lightly counterstained with methyl green, dehydrated in ethanol, and coverslipped with permount. 15 μg of total RNA isolated as described above was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel according to NorthernMaxTM protocols (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was transferred to Hybond-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting according to the manufacturer's instructions and cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). A gel-purified PCR fragment containing nucleotides 51–812 of DNAH7 cDNA was used as a probe for detecting DNAH7 expression. A DNA fragment containing nucleotides 1–718 of the human intermediate chain dynein cDNA (IC78, GenBankTM accession number NM_012144), another protein known to be associated with cilia (18Pennarun G. Escudier E. Chapelin C. Bridoux A.M. Cacheux V. Roger G. Clement A. Goossens M. Amselem S. Duriez B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1508-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), was obtained by PCR from the differentiated airway cell library. This fragment was used as a probe to detect IC78 message. Probes were labeled with32P using Megaprime DNA-labeling system (AmershamBiosciences) and purified on MicroSpinTM G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations were performed in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C, and blots were washed according to manufacturer's instructions before being exposed to film at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Light microscope images were captured with a Hamamatsu C5810 color 3CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonic Systems, Bridgewater, NJ) and processed in Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Electron micrographs and blots were scanned with a Umax powerlook III flatbed scanner (Umax Technologies, Inc., Fremont, CA) and also processed in Adobe Photoshop. Normal HBE cells were cultured at an air-liquid interface under conditions that favor mucociliary differentiation. Under these conditions, HBE cells differentiate to produce a heavily ciliated epithelium that resembles native tracheobronchial epithelium (12Gray T.E. Guzman K. Davis C.W. Abdullah L.H. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. William Davis C. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cilia in these cultures become coordinated and are capable of actively transporting mucus (19Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Cilia were isolated from these well differentiated cultures by using a non-ionic detergent in the presence of calcium (14Hastie A.T. Dicker D.T. Hingley S.T. Kueppers F. Higgins M.L. Weinbaum G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Reed W. Carson J.L. Moats-Staats B.M. Lucier T., Hu, P. Brighton L. Gambling T.M. Huang C.H. Leigh M.W. Collier A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These preparations are highly enriched for cilia (Fig. 1, A and B) and consist primarily of intact ciliary axonemes with the 9 + 2 microtubules, inner and outer dynein arms, and radial spokes clearly visible (Fig. 1 C). HBE cells were obtained from a PCD patient who underwent a lung transplant operation for severe bronchiectasis. Light microscopic examination of cilia obtained from a nasal scrape demonstrated abnormal ciliary motion. Electron microscopy revealed a number of ciliary abnormalities with the most consistent defect being a deficiency of inner dynein arms. Thus, although structures resembling outer dynein arms were observed on a majority of axonemal doublets, the inner arm structures were only rarely observed (Fig. 2, A–C). These PCD cells when cultured at an air-liquid interface differentiated normally to produce a mucociliary epithelium. These cultures also reproduced the phenotypic defect present in PCD patients. Whereas cilia of normal or non-PCD disease control (i.e. cystic fibrosis) cells exhibited abundant ciliary activity, which frequently was coordinated, the cilia in the PCD cultures appeared straight and rigid and beat only infrequently. Electron micrographs of cilia from cultured PCD cells also reproduced the deficiency of inner dynein arms observed in the freshly excised tissue. To identify components of the inner dynein arm, cilia were isolated from differentiated cultures of normal and disease control (cystic fibrosis) HBE cells and compared with cilia isolated from differentiated cultures of PCD cells. Proteins that are components of the inner dynein arm, including the inner arm DHCs, would be expected to be absent or greatly reduced in the axonemes from the PCD cells. Because DHCs are too large to resolve by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (molecular mass of ∼500 kDa), we examined the DHC composition of these samples by SDS-PAGE on low percentage gels. Under these conditions, four bands were clearly resolved from the normal axonemes in the high molecular weight region of the gel where DHCs would be expected to migrate (Fig. 3 A). In most samples, the two upper bands appeared more intense than the lower two bands and are likely to contain outer arm DHCs (14Hastie A.T. Dicker D.T. Hingley S.T. Kueppers F. Higgins M.L. Weinbaum G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Reed W. Carson J.L. Moats-Staats B.M. Lucier T., Hu, P. Brighton L. Gambling T.M. Huang C.H. Leigh M.W. Collier A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, axonemes isolated from the PCD cells showed a distinct absence of the lowest of the four high molecular weight protein bands. To verify that this was a specific reduction in the protein(s) present and not a sample preparation or loading artifact, different quantities of axonemal proteins isolated from normal and cystic fibrosis cultures were compared with axonemes isolated from PCD cultures as noted above and analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 3 B). This experiment shows that even when less protein was loaded from the control samples, all four protein bands were clearly detected. This result demonstrates that in the PCD cilia, a protein or proteins present in this lowest band are specifically reduced or absent. Because this protein band is likely to represent inner arm components, we sought to identify the protein(s) present in this band. Isolated axonemes from control cultures were separated by SDS-PAGE as described above, and the lowest of the four high molecular weight protein bands was excised. To obtain sufficient sample for analysis by mass spectrometry, ∼40 gel slices from several different cultures were pooled. The protein was digested with trypsin, and the purified peptides were analyzed by capillary LC/MS/MS. High quality amino acid sequence was obtained on >30 peptides. An initial search of the data bases using Mascot identified seven peptides that matched DHC sequences, including several with an identity to known human DHCs (Table I). These peptides matched sequences located near the conserved catalytic region of DHCs including two human dyneins identified as HDHC2 (GenBankTM accession number Z83801 (20Neesen J. Koehler M.R. Kirschner R. Steinlein C. Kreutzberger J. Engel W. Schmid M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and DHC3 (GenBankTM accession number U53532 (21Vaisberg E.A. Grissom P.M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)). These results were not unexpected, because the catalytic region around the first nucleotide-binding site (P-loop region) of the DHCs is highly conserved and is the region most represented in the data base. Both of these sequences are probably derived from inner arm axonemal DHCs. Because there are no other human full-length inner arm sequences available to date, the other peptides are most likely derived from sequences outside the conserved P-loop region and may represent additional inner arm DHCs. One sequence (Table I, row number 1) was uniquely specific for a human DHC previously identified as HDHC2 and is the subject of this report.Table IPeptide matches obtained from LC-MS/MS of the isolated high molecular weight proteinSequencem/zGenBank™ accession numberDescription1GINAGADILMFEGTELK889.8Z83801Human dynein heavy chain2YAYEYLGNSPR666.8U53532Human dynein heavy chain3IGDST(L/I)EYAPDFR742.3P23098Sea urchin dynein4MVVFVDDVNMPAR754.7U03970Sea urchin dynein5ELQNQLNEIVELVR848.9U53532Human dynein heavy chain6...NDGFVEADDLR870.7U03978Sea urchin dynein7...SDDSDFEWKSQR913.3U53532Human dynein heavy chain Open table in a new tab To further characterize this human DHC and investigate its possible role in PCD, the full-length sequence was obtained by a combination of techniques. Anchored PCR was used to walk in the 5′ direction from the P-loop region of HDHC2 using a library constructed from heavily ciliated cultures of human airway cells (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). To obtain the 3′ end of the cDNA, we again took advantage of the mass spectrometry data. During the course of this work, the peptide sequences obtained by LC/MS/MS were used to search the data bases for newly deposited sequences. One of these searches resulted in the identification of a partial cDNA isolated from human brain designated KIAA0944 (GenBankTMaccession AB023161 (22Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R.

Human and murine GLM-R cDNAs encode open reading frames of 732 and 716 amino acids, respectively, and the corresponding genes are located in close proximity to gp130 genes on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 13. GLM-R is specifically expressed on CD14-positive cells and is up-regulated more than 50-fold upon activation of those cells. To address the question of whether GLM-R is a signaling receptor, we constructed a chimeric molecule, consisting of the extracellular domain of human growth hormone (hGH) receptor, and the intracellular domain of GLM-R. When transfected into factor-dependent 32D cells, this chimeric molecule could signal for proliferation and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and STAT-5 upon stimulation with hGH. Thus, GLM-R is a novel signaling receptor chain potentially involved in the development and function of monocytes and macrophages.

Unfortunately, the lack of significant sequence homology has hampered the identification of novel members of this family by homology screens and, more recently, data mining. The cognate receptors, however, form a family of so-called type I cytokine receptors and share several structural motifs, including a cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domain with 2 pairs of conserved cysteine residues and a WSXWS sequence motif in the extracellular domain (3.Bazan J.F.

These features allow for homology-based identification of novel receptors, which in turn can be used as tools to subsequently identify their ligands by a variety of different screening techniques (4.de Sauvage F.J.

Ligand binding induces homo- or heteromerization of at least two receptor subunits. In the former case, two identical receptor subunits form a homodimeric receptor that is sufficient for ligand binding and signaling (e.g. GH-R) (7.de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar), while in the latter case, a ligand-specific α-chain forms a high affinity receptor only in combination with a signal transducing β-chain, which is often shared among several α-chains (e.g. IL-3, 5 and GM-CSF) (8.Itoh N. Yonehara S. Schreurs J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Yahara I. Arai K. Miyajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In either situation, ligand binding to the receptor leads to activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (Jak) family, which associate with the receptor subunits through conserved box-1 and box-2 motifs within the membrane proximal part of the intracellular domain (9.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Jak activation leads to phosphorylation of cytoplasmic target proteins, in particular the intracellular domains of the receptors and members of the STAT protein family, which are recruited to phosphotyrosines on the receptor by means of their Src homology type 2 (SH2) domains (10.Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 11.Ihle J.N. Nosaka T. Thierfelder W. Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of STATs induces dimerization and translocation to the nucleus and results in specific activation of gene transcription (12.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Seven STAT proteins are known to date (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6). Analysis of animals deficient for STAT isoforms indicates that STATs mediate many of the specific effects of cytokines (13.Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), highlighting their key importance in cytokine receptor signaling. In addition to specific target gene regulation and in combination with other signaling pathways activated by cytokine receptors, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and phophatidylinositol 3-kinase, STATs can contribute to anti-apoptotic and mitogenic signals upon activation (9.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Human GLM-R was first identified at the level of genomic DNA in the public data base (GenBank™ accession number AC008857). A cDNA encoding full-length human GLM-R was subsequently cloned from a pooled tissue cDNA library. Murine GLM-R was obtained by a combination of cross-species library screening and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a murine spleen library. Primers for the PCR were designed based on sequences obtained by data mining in the murine genomic data base (Celera). Two clones stemming from independent PCR reactions were sequenced and confirmed to match with each other and the mRNA sequence predicted from genomic DNA using Genscan software (14.Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a chimeric molecule, consisting of the extracellular domain of human GH-R and the intracellular domain of human GLM-R was obtained by recombinant PCR (15.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar), using the partially complementary primers 5′-CTTTTCGAAACAGCAAAGGAAACCCAACAAATTGACTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGTTTCCTTTGCTGTTTCGAAAAGAGAAAAAC-3′ (antisense). This construct was cloned under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter into the expression vector pRK5tkneo. Total RNA from human organs was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), and total RNA from cell lines or sorted cells was isolated using the RNeasy kit and DNase I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Taqman™ quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using a sequence detector 7700 instrument was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For each sample, duplicate test reactions and a control reaction into which no reverse transcriptase had been added were analyzed for expression of GLM-R mRNA and a housekeeper mRNA, rpl-19. If a signal was observed in the control reaction due to contamination with genomic DNA, it was subtracted from the signal in the test reaction. Arbitrary expression units were calculated by dividing GLM-R expression by rpl-19 expression. Probes and primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer triplets were 5′- CCTGGAGTCCCTGAAACGAA-3′ (sense), 5′-GTTGGTTCCCCCAGCACTG-3′ (antisense), and 5′-CTCTTACATTGTTCAGGTCATGGCCAGCA-3′ (probe) for human GLM-R and 5′-GATGCCGGAAAAACACCTTG-3′ (sense), 5′-TGGCTGTACCCTTCCGCTT-3′ (antisense), and 5′-CCTATGCCCATGTGCCTGCCCTT-3′ (probe) for human rpl-19. A construct encoding the extracellular domain of human GLM-R fused to an octahistidine tag was derived by recombinant PCR and cloned into a modified version of the pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). GLM-R-His8 was expressed in high-five insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. Monoclonal antibodies against GLM-R-His8 were raised in BALB/c mice. Heparinized blood was obtained with informed consent from healthy volunteers. 35 ml of a 1:2 dilution of blood in phosphate-buffered saline were layered over 15 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) and centrifuged for 30 min at 500 × g. Interphase peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were recovered and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. For RNA isolation, leukocyte subsets were separated using paramagnetic beads coupled to various marker antibodies according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Milteny, Auburn, CA). For FACS analysis, PBMC were incubated for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 10 μg/ml total human IgG and 5 μg/ml murine IgG1 (Sigma) to prevent binding of GLM-R antibodies to Fc recptors expressed on some cell types. Cells were then stained with 1 μg per million cells of biotinylated anti-GLM-R (IgG1) or biotinylated isotype control antibody for 15 min followed by two washes with the same buffer. In a second round of staining, cells were simultaneously incubated with streptavidin-coupled phycoerythrin and various marker antibodies directly coupled to either fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cychrome™ (BD PharMingen). Fluorescence was detected using an Epics-XL flow cytometry system (Beckman Coulter Inc.). For stimulation experiments, isolation of monocytes from PBMC was performed by a depletion strategy employing paramagnetic beads coupled to antibodies against CD3, CD7, CD19, CD45RA, CD56, and IgE (Milteny). We chose this approach to avoid activation of monocytes by ligation of the CD14 antigen, which would occur in a positive selection approach. These monocytes were stimulated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) and 100 ng/ml interferon-γ (IFNγ) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 4 h. 32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum,l-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells was used as a source of IL-3 and added to the culture at 5–10% final concentration. Cells were transfected by electroporation and bulk selected in 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 10 days. G418-resistant cells were then stained with a monoclonal antibody against hGH-R (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), and single positive cells were sorted by FACS into individual wells of 96-well plates. After 1 week of expansion, clones were re-examined by FACS for hGH-R surface expression and by proliferation assay for factor dependence. Three clones with significant hGH-R expression and low background proliferation were selected for further experiments. Cells were starved for 20 h in complete medium without growth factors at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Subsequently, 5 × 104 cells per well were seeded into 96-well plates containing different concentrations of hGH- or WEHI-3B-conditioned medium in triplicates. Cells were allowed to proliferate for 22 h with addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine per well during the last 6 h of the incubation period. Thymidine incorporation was determined using a Top Count liquid scintillation counter according to the manufacturer's instructions (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). 107 cells per condition were washed free of IL-3 and starved for 6 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Purified recombinant hGH (Genentech Inc.) or murine IL-3 (R&D Systems) were added to final concentrations of 100 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. After 15 min at 37 °C, cells were quick-chilled in ice water and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was performed as described previously (16.Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and gelshifts were detected with the oligonucleotide probes m67 5′-CATTTCCCGTAAATCAT-3′ (17.Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and βCAS 5′-GATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC-3′ (18.Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, polyclonal anti-STAT-1 (sc-464X), anti-STAT-3 (sc-482X), and anti-STAT-5 (sc-835X) (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm NaVO4, and Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 20 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 20000 × gat 2 °C, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. Precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was carried out using a 1:1 mixture of 4G10-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and PY20-agarose (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). After washing three times with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose by Western blot. STAT-3 was detected by sc-482, and STAT-5 was detected by sc-835 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). We first identified GLM-R by screening the public human genomic data base for molecules with cytokine receptor homology domains and used this sequence information to clone the corresponding human cDNA from a pooled tissue library. Only one major open reading frame was present, and it encoded a protein of 732 amino acid (aa) residues with characteristic features of type I cytokine receptors (Fig. 1 A). A predicted signal peptide of 19 aa is followed by a cytokine receptor homology domain (aa 20–227) with two pairs of conserved cysteine residues and a WSDWS signature motif. Three modules with homology to fibronectin type III domains (aa 228–324, 325–420, 421–516) complete the extracellular domain, and a single transmembrane region (aa 517–539) connects to an intracellular domain of 193 amino acids (aa 540–732). Within the cytoplasmic tail, a box-1 motif (aa 550–563) typically involved in the association with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Jak family, and four tyrosine residues that may serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules with SH2 domains are present. A slightly shorter murine homolog of 716 amino acids was cloned from a spleen library and shows 59.1% identity and 67.5% similarity to the human molecule (Fig. 1 B). All hallmark features except the second pair of cysteines and two cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are conserved between the two sequences. The lack of the cysteines in the murine protein does not appear to be due to alternative mRNA splicing, since analysis of murine genomic sequences did not reveal the presence of an alternative exon with those features (not shown). Human GLM-R is most homologous to the IL-6 signal transducer chain, gp130 (19.Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), at 24.73% identity, followed by GCSF-R (20.Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorensen E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and IL-12Rβ2 (21.Presky D.H. Yang H. Minetti L.J. Chua A.O. Nabavi N. Wu C.Y. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14002-14007Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) (23.94 and 20.09% identity, respectively) (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, analysis of genomic sequences indicated that GLM-R and gp130 are separated by only 24 kilobases (kb) on human chromosome 5, and by 19 kb in a synthenic region on mouse chromosome 13. In light of the relatively low level of sequence conservation, this chromosomal localization pattern further confirms that mGLM-R and hGLM-R are true homologs. To gain insight into the potential function of this receptor, we next sought to determine the expression pattern of GLM-R. The abundance of this transcript was generally so low that we were unable to reliably detect it by Northern blot analysis in any organ (not shown). Supporting low expression levels is a total lack of human expressed sequence tags (EST) corresponding to GLM-R in the public data base. We therefore analyzed GLM-R expression in a comprehensive panel of human total RNAs by real time quantitative PCR (Taqman™), using primers located in exon 11 (Fig. 2 A). Highest levels of GLM-R transcript were detected in testis, prostate, thymus, bone marrow, and trachea. GLM-R amplification product from testis RNA became detectable after 25 cycles of PCR (thymus, 26 cycles; prostate, 27 cycles), whereas rpl-19 amplification product was detectable after 18 cycles (thymus, 17 cycles; prostate, 18 cycles). Therefore, GLM-R expression in testis was roughly 27 or 128-fold lower than rpl-19 expression (thymus, prostate, 29or 512-fold lower). Using a similar calculation, it can be determined that in most tissues, GLM-R is expressed at 103-105-fold lower levels than rpl-19. Because type I cytokine receptors frequently play a role in blood cell development and function, and because GLM-R expression levels were comparably high in thymus and bone marrow, we were interested in the expression of GLM-R on different blood cell types. To this end, we isolated PBMC from healthy human volunteers by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation, and separated the different cell subsets using paramagnetic beads coupled to antibodies against CD4 (helper T cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T-cells), CD14 (monocytes), CD19 (B-cells), and CD56 (natural killer cells). Taqman™ PCR was then performed on RNA isolated from those cell fractions, using primers located in exon 11 of human GLM-R (Fig. 2 B). Again, the absolute levels of GLM-R expression were low, but CD14-positive and, to a lesser extent, CD56-positive cells displayed significantly higher expression than CD4-, CD8-, or CD19-positive cells. This expression pattern was confirmed by FACS analysis with monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of GLM-R. GLM-R protein was only detectable at low to moderate levels on CD14-positive cells, and was barely detectable on CD56-positive cells. No GLM-R was expressed on CD4-, CD8-, or CD19-positive cells. Similar results were obtained from four independent blood donors, and a representative set of histograms is shown in Fig. 2 C. Compatible with the monocyte-specific expression of GLM-R, we found high levels of GLM-R transcripts in two monocytic human cell lines, THP-1 and U937 (Fig. 2 D), whereas all other cell lines tested did not express GLM-R. Finally, we found that GLM-R was induced between 56- and 91-fold in freshly isolated human monocytes after 4 h of stimulation with a combination of 1 μg/ml LPS and 100 ng/ml IFNγ (Fig. 2 E). Again, GLM-R induction was confirmed at the protein level by FACS (not shown). Up-regulation of GLM-R was not observed upon activation of T or B cells with appropriate stimuli, suggesting that this is a phenomenon restricted to monocytes (not shown). To address whether GLM-R is capable of transmitting a signal upon activation, we constructed a chimeric molecule consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human GH (hGH) receptor, joined to the cytoplasmic region of human GLM-R (Fig. 3 A). This construct was stably transfected into IL-3-dependent murine 32D cells (22.Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and three clones staining positive with an anti-hGH-R antibody were used for further analysis (Fig. 3 B). All clones gave comparable results in subsequent assays. First, we examined whether the hGH-R·GLM-R chimera could signal for proliferation when stimulated with hGH (Fig. 3 C). We found that only hGH-R·GLM-R-transfected cells were able to proliferate in a dose-dependent manner in response to hGH, while both transfected and parental cells proliferated comparably in IL-3 (Fig. 3 D). The Jak/STAT pathway is critical for transmitting the signal generated by cytokine receptors (9.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), and STAT proteins were previously shown to transmit many of the specific effects of cytokines (13.Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). To analyze which of the STAT proteins are activated upon stimulation of the chimeric receptor with hGH, we performed EMSA. We used a mutated form of the serum-inducible element of the fos promoter (m67) (17.Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) to test for STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-4 activation, and the mammary gland factor response element of the β-casein gene (βCAS) (18.Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to test for STAT-5 and STAT-6 activation. Upon hGH stimulation, hGH-R·GLM-R-transfected cells displayed formation of a strong complex on the m67 probe, while parental cells did not respond. This complex was completely supershifted with an antibody against STAT-3 (Fig. 4 A). A less intense yet clearly identifiable complex was present when extracts were incubated with the βCAS probe, and this complex was supershifted completely with an antibody against STAT-5 (Fig. 4 B). STAT-3 and STAT-5 were also activated upon stimulation with IL-3 in both parental and transfected cells, as described previously (23.Mu S.X. Xia M. Elliott G. Bogenberger J. Swift S. Bennett L. Lappinga D.L. Hecht R. Lee R. Saris C.J.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 4532-4543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pallard C. Gouilleux F. Charon M. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15942-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B). To exclude the presence of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3, a complex containing activated STAT-1 and STAT-2, we also tested our extracts on the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (25.Reich N. Evans B. Levy D. Fahey D. Knight Jr., E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) probe, but did nor observe any hGH-specific gelshifts (not shown). Thus, no STAT molecules other than STAT-3 and STAT-5 are activated by hGH-R·GLM-R under these conditions. Specific activation of STAT-3 and STAT-5 upon activation of hGH-R/GLM-R was confirmed by phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot with antibodies specific for STAT-3 and STAT-5 (Fig. 4 C). Here we describe a novel molecule that displays the typical architecture and structural features of type I cytokine receptors. It shares significant homology to known members of this receptor family, most notably gp130 and GCSF-R and is found in close physical proximity to gp130 on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 13. GLM-R was found to be expressed predominantly on activated monocytes. In support of this finding, GLM-R was expressed in two monocytic cell lines, THP-1 and U937, but not in a number of other cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid origin. Furthermore, strong induction of GLM-R upon stimulation with LPS and IFNγ was seen in monocytes and in the two cell lines (not shown). Together, these expression data suggest that monocytes and possibly macrophages are a likely site of physiologic activity of this receptor, and prompt further analysis of its function in those cells. Expression in monocytes is also likely to account for the elevated GLM-R levels detected in thymus and bone marrow. On the other hand, the presence of GLM-R in testis and prostate might suggest that GLM-R has additional functions outside the immune system. We chose to assess the capacity of GLM-R to signal by fusing its intracellular domain to the ligand binding domain of hGH-R, a receptor that is well known to homodimerize upon stimulation with hGH. The resulting chimeric molecule was able to transduce a proliferative signal into myeloid 32D cells and caused activation of the transcription factors STAT-3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT-5. Thus, GLM-R is capable of signaling, but it remains to be determined whether its extracellular domain binds a ligand by itself or whether additional receptor subunits are required to form a functional receptor. Using proliferation of 32D cells transfected with the full-length human molecule as a readout, we found that GLM-R is not a sufficient receptor for IL-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 23, GCSF, GM-CSF, Epo, TPO, PRL, GH, OSM, CT-1, and OB (not shown). These cells can now be used to screen a variety of sources for a GLM-R ligand, but such a strategy will only be successful if GLM-R can act as a homodimer or if necessary accessory chains are endogenously expressed in 32D cells. GLM-R preferentially activated STAT-3, while STAT-5 activation was low but detectable. These two proteins were shown to have very different functions in myeloid cells. Enforced expression of constitutively active STAT-5a or STAT-5b resulted in factor independence and myeloid differentiation of BaF3 cells (26.Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and macrophage differentiation of M1 cells (27.Kawashima T. Murata K. Akira S. Tonozuka Y. Minoshima Y. Feng S. Kumagai H. Tsuruga H. Ikeda Y. Asano S. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3652-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), while macrophages deficient in STAT-5a displayed a defect in GM-CSF-induced proliferation and gene expression (28.Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leonard W.J. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, repopulation of all blood cell lineages, including monocytes, was severely compromised when STAT-5a−/−5b−/−bone marrow cells instead of wild-type cells were used as a graft to rescue lethally irradiated animals (29.Bunting K.D. Bradley H.L. Hawley T.S. Moriggl R. Sorrentino B.P. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2002; 99: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that STAT-5 plays an important role in the development and proliferation of monocytes/macrophages. On the other hand, STAT-3 appears to be involved in the negative regulation of macrophage activation, a function mainly exerted by IL-10 (30.Riley J.K. Takeda K. Akira S. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16513-16521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 31.O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In a mouse model in which STAT-3 was deleted in a tissue-specific fashion in macrophages and neutrophils, macrophages were constitutively activated, which led to chronic enterocolitis through activation of Th1 cellsin vivo (32.Takeda K. Clausen B.E. Kaisho T. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Forster I. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 10: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), a phenotype which is mimicked by IL-10-deficient mice (33.Kuhn R. Lohler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Cell. 1993; 75: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3664) Google Scholar). In the case of GLM-R, it will be interesting to study the effects of GLM-R activation on proliferation and activation of monocytes or monocytic cell lines, and how these effects are controlled by the subtle balance of STAT activation. Taken together, our data suggest that GLM-R is a receptor for a yet unknown helical cytokine that likely acts on monocytes and possibly also macrophages. Using the receptor as a tool, it will hopefully be possible to identify this ligand, which is critical to the further understanding of the biological function of GLM-R.

In view of these unique conditions, the protein systems participating in peroxide metabolism and in redox signaling are of special interest. The genes for a second thioredoxin (DmTrx-2) and a thioredoxin peroxidase (DmTPx-1) were cloned and expressed, and the proteins were characterized. In its disulfide form, the 13-kDa protein thioredoxin-2 is a substrate of thioredoxin reductase-1 (Km = 5.2 μm,kcat = 14.5 s−1) and in its dithiol form, an electron donor for TPx-1 (Km = 9 μm, kcat = 5.4 s−1). DmTrx-2 is capable of reducing glutathione disulfide with a second order rate constant of 170 m−1s−1 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. Western blot analysis indicated that this thioredoxin represents up to 1% of the extractable protein of D. melanogaster Schneider cells or whole fruit flies. Recombinant thioredoxin peroxidase-1 (subunit molecular mass = 23 kDa) was found to be a decameric protein that can efficiently use Trx-2 but not Trx-1 as a reducing substrate. The new electron pathway found in D. melanogaster is also representative for insects that serve as vectors of disease. As a first step we have cloned and functionally expressed the gene that is the orthologue of DmTrx-2 in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. As Drosophila melanogaster does not contain glutathione reductase, the thioredoxin system has a key function for glutathione disulfide reduction in insects (Kanzok, S. M., Fechner, A., Bauer, H., Ulschmid, J. K., Müller, H. M., Botella-Munoz, J., Schneuwly, S., Schirmer, R. H., and Becker, K. (2001) Science 291, 643–646).

Aerobic life conditions that are based on metabolizing molecular oxygen are linked inseparably to the occurrence of reactive oxygen species. These compounds are cytotoxic for the organism but even more so for invaders such as microorganisms and tumor cells. The oxidative challenge is counteracted by a shield of enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems including superoxide dismutase (2 O 2⨪ + 2H+ → H2O2 + O2), catalase (2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2), peroxidases (ROOH + AH2→ ROH + H2O + A; AH2 = hydrogen donor), and the tripeptide glutathione (1Nordberg J. Arnér E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar). Glutathione is the most abundant intracellular non-protein thiol compound. Being present in millimolar concentrations, reduced glutathione (GSH) serves as a powerful antioxidant and effective radical scavenger. The oxidized or disulfide form of glutathione (GSSG) is recycled to the thiol form by the NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme glutathione reductase (GR): NADPH + H+ + GSSG → NADP+ + 2 GSH (2Williams C.H., Jr. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). GR occurs in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms but not in dipteric insects such as Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Thus the redox metabolism of these species, and probably also of further insects, differs significantly from most other forms of life (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Because glutathione is also a key player for intracellular redox homeostasis in D. melanogaster (4Sohal R.S. Arnold L. Orr W.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1990; 56: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), high GSH levels must be maintained by an alternative pathway. A potent candidate to substitute for GR is the thioredoxin system. Thioredoxins (Trx) 1The abbreviations used are: TrxthioredoxinAgAnopheles gambiaeDmDrosophila melanogasterESTexpressed sequence tagGHOST assaythioredoxin-dependent GSSG reduction assayGRglutathione reductaseIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideTrxRthioredoxin reductaseTPxthioredoxin peroxidasetBuOOHt-butyl hydroperoxide are small thiol proteins with a molecular mass of about 12 kDa that are present in all organisms studied thus far. Reduction of the protein disulfide (TrxS2) to the dithiol form (Trx(SH)2) is catalyzed by the homodimeric NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR): NADPH + H+ + TrxS2 → NADP+ + Trx(SH)2. TrxR is closely related both structurally and mechanistically to GR (5Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams C.H., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). thioredoxin Anopheles gambiae Drosophila melanogaster expressed sequence tag thioredoxin-dependent GSSG reduction assay glutathione reductase isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside thioredoxin reductase thioredoxin peroxidase t-butyl hydroperoxide The main difference between GR and TrxR is an additional redox center located in the C-terminal region of high Mrthioredoxin reductases as they are found in most eukaryotes (6Williams C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Mammalian TrxRs have an adjacent redox active cysteine-selenocysteine pair (7Zhong L. Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 8Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9533-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereas in the thioredoxin reductase of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum this redox center is represented by two cysteines separated by a spacer sequence of four amino acids (9Wang P.F. Arscott L.D. Gilberger T.W. Müller S. Williams C.H., Jr. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductase is also present in the fruit fly, D. melanogaster. These insect thioredoxin reductases (DmTrxR-1 and DmTrxR-2) are the prototype of a third class of high Mr TrxRs; they possess two neighboring C-terminal cysteine residues that are essential for thioredoxin reduction (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A large number of cellular functions are based on thioredoxins. They have an important role in DNA synthesis as electron donors for ribonucleotide reductase (10Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress (11Nishinaka Y. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Redox Rep. 2001; 6: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Numerous disulfide bonds participating in protein folding or in redox control of transcription are effectively and selectively reduced by thioredoxins (12Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thioredoxins are also able to perform a dithiol-disulfide exchange reaction with glutathione disulfide (GSSG), thereby producing GSH. In organisms possessing GR this reaction can serve as a backup system under conditions of GR insufficiency (15Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Türbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In insects this normally supportive trait has evolved into a key pathway. Furthermore, thioredoxins exert antioxidative functions as electron donors of thioredoxin peroxidases (TPx), protective enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide as well as organic peroxides. Thioredoxin peroxidases obviously also have regulatory functions in redox state-associated signaling,e.g. in pathways mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α (16Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K.

In organisms containing different thioredoxins, it is a key issue as to whether these isoproteins differ not only in their intracellular localization but also in their functions. A thioredoxin from Drosophila, named deadhead gene product (dhd, DmTrx-1), has already been functionally characterized and recombinantly expressed (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K.

Petschek J.P. Albrecht E.B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we introduce a second thioredoxin (DmTrx-2) from D. melanogaster and a closely related thioredoxin from the mosquito A. gambiae (AgTrx-1). To specify the functions of DmTrx-2, we studied its reaction with DmTrxR-1 as well as the important dithiol-disulfide exchange with GSSG and its role in peroxide detoxification. For this objective we recombinantly expressed and characterized thioredoxin peroxidase-1 from D. melanogaster(DmTPx-1). DmTrx-2 but not DmTrx-1 was found to be a substrate for the enzyme. This result indicates a clear separation of cellular function between thioredoxins from the same organism. Fruit flies, D. melanogaster Schneider cell lines and A. gambiae cDNA and cells were kindly provided by Dr. Hans-Michael Müller from the EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany. Escherichia coli Trx and TrxR were gifts from Professor Charles H. Williams, Jr., University of Michigan. His-tagged human thioredoxin mutant C73S (hTrx(C73S)) (19Gromer S. Merkle H. Schirmer R.H.

D. melanogaster thioredoxin reductase-1 (DmTrxR-1) and thioredoxin-1 (DmTrx-1) were expressed and purified as previously described (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). PCR chemicals and restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas, precast polyacrylamide gels from Bio-Rad, and molecular mass standards from Amersham Biosciences. Antibiotics, substrates for enzymatic assays, and further chemicals were from BioMol, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Sigma. All compounds were of the highest available purity. Drosophila EST clone GH15403 containing the complete dmtrx-2 gene was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). For ligation into the expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen), the dmtrx-2 gene was PCR-cloned using the forward primer GCGC GGATCC GTG TAC CAG GTG AAAGAT AAG G containing a BamHI restriction site and the reverse primer CGC AAGCTT TTA GAT ATT GGC CTT GAT GAC ATC with a Hin dIII restriction site. The pET-30a vector (Novagen) was applied for expression of wild-type DmTrx-2. For this PCR cloning we used the forward primer GCGC CATATG GTG TAC CAG GTG AAA GAT AAG G, which contains an NdeI restriction site. The reverse primer was the same as shown above. Hot start PCR was conducted using the following conditions: 3 min at 95 °C, and 80 °C hold; and then 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s (30 cycles), 3 min at 72 °C, and 15 °C hold. The PCR fragments were isolated from an agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), digested with the restriction enzymes, and ligated to the expression vectors. E. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) were then transformed with the plasmids, and the inserts were verified by sequencing (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). His-tagged DmTrx-2 (pQE-30/dmtrx-2) was overexpressed in E. coliNovaBlue. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 2× YT medium containing 50 μg carbenicillin/ml. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min (T = 4 °C), cells were resuspended in buffer U (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and treated with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and DNase (0.02 mg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. As protease inhibitors, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μm pepstatin, and 80 nm cystatin were added, and cells were disintegrated by ultrasound. The homogenate was centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) column with a yield of 150 mg of His-tagged protein/liter of culture. SDS-PAGE using a 15% gel showed a single band at the expected size of 13 kDa, the purity being >95%. Wild-type DmTrx-2 (pET-30/dmtrx-2) was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) (Novagen). Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in 2× YT medium and 40 μg kanamycin/ml. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. The raw protein extract with a content of ∼130 mg of thioredoxin-2 from 1 liter of culture was isolated as described above and was then treated with a heat shock of 60 °C for 1 min. The denaturated E. coli proteins were separated by centrifugation at 38,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation at 4 °C (50% followed by 70% saturation). The 70% pellet, containing ∼90 mg of thioredoxin, was redissolved in 100 mm potassium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and purified over a Sephadex G75® column. The overall yield was about 60 mg/liter of medium. SDS-PAGE using a 15% gel revealed a single band at the expected size of 11.7 kDa; purity was >90%. The agtrx-1 gene was PCR-cloned from an A. gambiae cDNA using the forward primer GCGCGGATCC GTG TAC ATG GTG AAA GAT TCC containing a BamHI restriction site and GCGC AAGCTT TTA CGC CGA ATG CTG CTG G as a reverse primer with a Hin dIII restriction site. Hot start PCR was conducted using the following conditions: 3 min at 95 °C, and 80 °C hold; and then 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s (30 cycles), 3 min at 72 °C, and 15 °C hold. The cloning procedure was identical to that described for dmtrx-2. E. coli NovaBlue-competent cells were transformed with the plasmid, and the insert was verified by sequencing (MWG Biotech). Agtrx-1 in pQE-30 vector was overexpressed in E. coli NovaBlue. The cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C in 2× YT medium containing 50 μg of carbenicillin/ml. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 4 h at 30 °C. Homogenization and purification were identical to DmTrx-2 giving a yield of 40 mg/liter of His-tagged protein. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with a 15% gel showing a single band at the expected size of 13 kDa. DmTPx-1 was PCR-cloned from EST clone LD33645 (Research Genetics) using GCGC GGATCC CCC CAG CTA CAG AAG CCC as a forward primer with BamHI restriction and TAGGTGACACTATAGAACTCGAG as a pOT vector reverse primer. Conditions for the hot start PCR were as follows: 3 min at 95 °C, 80 °C hold; and then 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 45 s (30 cycles), 3 min at 72 °C, 15 °C hold. The PCR product of ∼930 bp was blunt end-cloned into pT7blue vector (Novagen Perfectly Blunt Cloning Kit) and sequenced (MWG Biotech). The sequence was identical to the DmTPx-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. AF167098). A PstI restriction site is contained in the fragment downstream of the stop codon. The fragment was therefore digested with BamHI and PstI, giving a 789-bp product that was cloned into the pQE-30 expression vector. E. coliBL21 (Novagen) cells were transformed with the (pQE-30/dmtpx-1) plasmid and grown overnight at 37 °C in 2× YT medium containing 50 μg of carbenicillin/ml. Protein expression was then induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were disintegrated as described above, and the supernatant was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The yield was 20 mg/liter of culture medium, and SDS-PAGE revealed a single band at ∼20 kDa, which was lower than the expected 23 kDa. For determination of molecular mass, 1 mg of DmTPx-1, 0.5 mg of glutathione reductase (110 kDa), 1 mg of aldolase (160 kDa), 1 mg of catalase (250 kDa), and 1 mg of ferritin (450 kDa), respectively, in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, were applied to a Sephadex G200® column (d = 1 cm; l= 100 cm). Proteins were separated at a flow rate of 13 ml/h at T = 4 °C and collected in 1.3-ml fractions. A second gel filtration with 1 mg of glutathione reductase and 1 mg of DmTPx-1 was conducted as described above but in a buffer additionally containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. Assays were conducted at 25 °C using a reaction mixture volume of 1 ml consisting of buffer T (100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and 100 μm NADPH. For determination of Km values, thioredoxin concentrations were varied from 3 to 50 μm (39–650 μg/assay). The assay was started with 10 milliunits of DmTrxR-1 (1 unit = 1μmol of NADPH consumption/min), and thioredoxin-dependent NADPH oxidation was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.Km and Vmax values were obtained by applying the Michaelis-Menten equation. To the reaction mixture (1 ml, 25 °C) containing 100 μm NADPH and 1 unit of DmTrxR-1 in buffer T, different amounts (3–50 μm; 39–650 μg) of the thioredoxins (DmTrx-1, DmTrx-2, AgTrx-1, P. falciparum thioredoxin (PfTrx-1), or human thioredoxin mutant C73S (hTrx(C73S)) were added to determine the Km and Vmax values. NADPH consumption was followed at 340 nm. When thioredoxin reduction had reached an end point, 70 μmtBuOOH was added, and the assay was started with 10 milliunits of DmTPx-1. The Km values for H2O2, tBuOOH, and cumene hydroperoxide were estimated by a similar assay at a constant thioredoxin concentration. To the 1-ml mixture containing 50 μm DmTrx-2 (>5 Km), 100 μm NADPH, and 1 unit of DmTrxR in buffer T, peroxides were added with resulting end concentrations of 3–50 μm. The reaction was started with 10 milliunits of thioredoxin peroxidase. The GHOST assay was conducted as described previously (15Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Türbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,19Gromer S. Merkle H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mixture contained 100 μm NADPH and DmTrx-2 concentrations from 5–50 μm. The assay was started by the addition of 1 unit of DmTrxR-1, and NADPH oxidation was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. After thioredoxin reduction was complete, 1 mm GSSG was added, and GSSG reduction was followed by further NADPH consumption. The composition of the assay mixture guarantees that >98% of thioredoxin is present in reduced form. Under steady state conditions the overall reaction rate,v, depends on the concentrations of Trx(SH)2 and GSSG. v=−d[Trx(SH )2]/dt=k2[Trx(SH )2][GSSG] =d[Trx(SH )2]/dt=Vmax[TrxS2]/(Km+[TrxS2]) =Vmax([Trxtot]−[Trx(SH )2])/(Km+[Trxtot]−[Trx(SH )2]) REACTION 1This allows the determination of k2, the second order rate constant for the reaction Trx(SH )2+GSSG→TrxS2+2GSH REACTION 2 One mg of recombinant DmTrx-2 and AgTrx-1, respectively, was injected as an antigen into rabbits (Bioscience, Göttingen, Germany). Insect cell extracts (10 and 50 μg of total protein) as well as 500 ng of purified DmTrx-1 and DmTrx-2 were applied to a 15% SDS-PAGE. When electrophoresis was completed, the proteins were blotted overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44969) Google Scholar). After incubation with the anti-Trx IgGs the second antibody (swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate) was added. For staining, the nitrocellulose paper was exposed to a solution of 1-chloronaphthol and hydrogen peroxide in sodium citrate buffer. When we attempted to characterize D. melanogaster thioredoxin peroxidase-1 (21Rodriguez J. Agudo M. Van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Santarén J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Radyuk S.N. Klichko V.I. Spinola B. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in detail, it became obvious that the known thioredoxin isoprotein DmTrx-1 (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K.

Dev. 1997; 62: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) is not the genuine substrate of this enzyme. Consequently we cloned and functionally expressed the gene of a second thioredoxin from Drosophila (DmTrx-2) and its putative orthologue from A. gambiae (AgTrx-1). A. gambiae is the predominant mosquito vector of malarial parasites. Genome analysis shows that the dmtrx-2 gene coding for a protein of 106 amino acids contains three exons and two introns (see GenBankTM accession no. AE003625). According to the available ESTs, dmtrx-2 is transcribed in all of the developmental stages of Drosophila. Western blot analyses revealed that DmTrx-2 is expressed in larvae and in imagines of the fruit fly as well as in Schneider cell lines. The corresponding band could be clearly detected with 10 μg of total protein and represents 0.3–1% of extracted protein (Fig. 1). The gene product from the malarial mosquito A. gambiae, which is putatively isofunctional to DmTrx-2, was also studied. Like thioredoxin-2 from Drosophila, AgTrx-1 was found to be a highly expressed protein in vivo. The concentrations are in the same order of magnitude as estimated for DmTrx-2. As shown in Fig. 2, DmTrx-2 shares 56% sequence identity with its relative from A. gambiae (AgTrx-1) but also a considerable 50% with cytosolic human thioredoxin. In contrast, the similarity to DmTrx-1 is significantly lower, showing only 37% identical residues. Thus DmTrx-1 differs from DmTrx-2 as much as P. falciparum thioredoxin does. We expressed His-tagged DmTrx-2 and AgTrx-1 as well as wild-type DmTrx-2 in E. coli. Purification of the authentic Drosophila thioredoxin was based on procedures established for thioredoxins from other sources (24Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). E. coli thioredoxin is an inevitable contaminant of purified DmTrx-2, but it was found to represent only <0.05% when using E. coli TrxR for detection. Furthermore E. coli thioredoxin is a poor substrate for D. melanogaster TrxR-1 (Km> 700 μm) so that even several percent E. coli thioredoxin would not interfere with the kinetic characterization of DmTrx-2.Figure 2Multiple sequence alignment (Clustal W) of thioredoxins. This search was conducted with (NCBI accession numbers shown in parentheses): DmTrx-2 (AAF52794), DmTrx-1 (P47938), thioredoxin from man (hTrx; JH0568), A. gambiae(AgTrx-1; AAF68382), and with a P. falciparum thioredoxin (PfTrx-1; AAF34541). Only a few amino acid sequences (marked by asterisks or plus signs), such as the active site motif WCGPC with its two cysteines, are conserved among all species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wild-type and His-tagged DmTrx-2 are equally good substrates of D. melanogaster thioredoxin reductase-1 (Table I). The measured kinetic parameters, notably the kcat/Km ratio of 3 × 106m−1s−1, are in the same order of magnitude as for the DmTrx-1/DmTrxR-1 system and for other homologous thioredoxin systems. Catalysis most likely depends on a dithiol-disulfide exchange between the C-terminal redox center of TrxR and its substrate Trx (6Williams C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L.

The rate, k, of this reaction is equal to kcat/Km if a dithiol-disulfide exchange is the rate-limiting chemical reaction during catalysis. Otherwise k is even greater, that is >3 × 106m−1 s−1. AgTrx-1 was found to be an excellent heterologous substrate of DmTrxR-1, with a kcat/Km ratio of 1.2 × 106m−1s−1.Table IBasic biological properties of D. melanogaster thioredoxin-2 (DmTrx-2, NCB accession no.

Because the Drosophila genome does not encode a genuine glutathione reductase (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the maintenance of redox homeostasis and antioxidative defense by the thioredoxin system is a key issue (Fig. 3). Thioredoxin reductase is likely to substitute for GR in an indirect way because the broad TrxR substrate spectrum does not include GSSG. Glutathione is most probably kept in reduced state by a non-enzymatic dithiol-disulfide exchange reaction with Trx(SH)2. Using the GHOST assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), k2 was determined to be 170m−1 s−1 (= 0.01 μm−1 min−1) at 25 °C. This is basically identical with the published value for DmTrx-1 as a GSSG-reducing protein (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Under assumed in situ conditions (10 μm Trx-1, 50 μm Trx-2, 200 μm GSSG, and 1 unit/ml TrxR) the thioredoxin system would allow GSSG fluxes of more than 100 μmmin−1. Although DmTrx-1 and DmTrx-2 reduce glutathione disulfide equally well, this is not the case for the reduction of DmTPx-1. The occurrence of this enzyme had already been shown in different developmental stages of Drosophila (21Rodriguez J. Agudo M. Van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Santarén J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As described by Orr and collaborators (22Radyuk S.N. Klichko V.I. Spinola B. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), DmTPx-1 is a cytosolic protein, and overexpression of the gene in Schneider cells results in a higher survival rate under peroxide exposure. DmTPx-1, a protein of 194 amino acids and a molecular mass of 21.7 kDa/subunit, shows sequence elements that are typical for type I TPx, notably in the environment of the two conserved cysteines, Cys47 and Cys168(Fig. 4). The enzyme was recombinantly expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein. Gel filtration under reducing (5 mmdithiothreitol) and nonreducing conditions revealed that DmTPx-1 has an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa which would correspond to a homodecamer (230 kDa) or a homododecamer (∼276 kDa). This result is in good agreement with the known decameric crystal structure of TPx-B (= hTPx-1) from human erythrocytes (25Schroder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2072716831,"While cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is a highly inducible gene, COX-1 is widely known as a noninducible gene and is constitutively expressed in a variety of cell lines and human tissues. Recently, several reports have indicated that COX-1 is also regulated at the transcriptional level by various stimuli. We present evidence that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce COX-1 transcription and translation in normal human astrocyte (NHA) cells and glioma cell lines. HDAC inhibitors increased acetylated histone H4 protein expression in NHA cells. The levels of COX-1 mRNA and protein were maximal at 24 and 48 h, respectively, after treatment with the specific HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). In addition, TSA-treated NHA cells produced prostaglandin E2 as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after incubation with 10 μm exogenous arachidonic acid, indicating that the induced COX-1 is functionally active. In addition to NHA cells, this up-regulation of COX-1 after treatment with HDAC inhibitors was observed in 5 different glioma cell lines. The nucleotide sequence of the inducible COX-1 cDNA was confirmed identical to human COX-1 that was previously reported. HDAC inhibitors stimulatedCOX-1 promoter activity as measured by luciferase reporter assays, suggesting that the induction of COX-1 is regulated at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, mutation analysis of theCOX-1 promoter suggests that TSA-responsive element exists in the proximal Sp1-binding site at +25 to +31. In conclusion, COX-1 is an inducible gene in glial-derived cells including immortalized cells, and appears to be transcriptionally regulated by a unique mechanism associated with histone acetylation.

Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that an increase in histone acetylation by HDAC inhibitors decreases COX-2 expression and increases 15-lipooxygenase-1 (15-LO-1) expression, apoptosis, and differentiation in human colorectal carcinoma cells (19.Kamitani H. Geller M. Eling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23.Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E.

The expression of 15-LO-1 in human colorectal epithelial cells, the high expression of 15-LO-1 in tumors, and the link between 15-LO-1 expression and histone acetylation was found. Moreover, the acetylation of histone H3 and STAT6 is required for transcriptional activation of the 15-LO-1 gene (24.Shankaranarayanan P. Chaitidis P. Kuhn H. Nigam S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42753-42760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated the effects of HDAC inhibitors on the expression of lipid metabolizing enzymes, COX-1, COX-2, and 15-LO-1, in human brain cell lines. In the brain, COX-2 plays an important role in various pathological conditions (25.O'Banion M.K. Miller J.C. Chang J.W. Kaplan M.D. Coleman P.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26.Pistritto G. Mancuso C. Tringali G. Perretti M. Preziosi P. Navarra P. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 246: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) such as ischemia, seizure, and injury, and has been proposed to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (27.Satoh K. Nagano Y. Shimomura C. Suzuki N. Saeki Y. Yokota H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 283: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28.Yermakova A.V. Rollins J. Callahan L.M. Rogers J. O'Banion M.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of COX-1 is regulated during brain development (29.Kawasaki M. Yoshihara Y. Yamaji M. Watanabe Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and COX-1 is also up-regulated by retinoic acid during neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cell lines (30.Schneider N. Lanz S. Ramer R. Schaefer D. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, little else is known about the regulation of COX-1 expression in the human brain. We selected the normal human astrocyte (NHA) cell line for this study for several reasons. 1) Astrocytes are the major cell population in the central nervous system (31.Amruthesh S.C. Boerschel M.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and, reports using human astrocytes are lacking. 2) Activated astrocytes produce cytokines, and these factors eventually lead to neuronal damage (25.O'Banion M.K. Miller J.C. Chang J.W. Kaplan M.D. Coleman P.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27.Satoh K. Nagano Y. Shimomura C. Suzuki N. Saeki Y. Yokota H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 283: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3) Last, prostaglandins and lipid metabolites formed by astrocytes may contribute to central nervous system pathology and physiology (26.Pistritto G. Mancuso C. Tringali G. Perretti M. Preziosi P. Navarra P. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 246: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31.Amruthesh S.C. Boerschel M.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A.

Here, we report for the first time that HDAC inhibitors induce only COX-1 expression, not COX-2, in normal human astrocyte cells and glioma cell lines. The NHA cell line was obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). The human glioma cell lines (A172, T98G, U87MG, U138MG, and U373MG) and the human colorectal carcinoma cell line Caco-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ were obtained from R&D system (Minneapolis, MN). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT) and sodium butyrate (NaBT), trichostatin A (TSA), HC toxin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. NHA cells were grown in astrocyte growth medium from Clonetics and cells from passages 3 to 7 were used in these experiments. The glioma cell lines and Caco-2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1 mmsodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD), and gentamicin (10 μg/ml), and cells from passages 5 to 15 were used. In these studies, TSA and HC toxin were dissolved in Me2SO, and NaBT was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The semiconfluent cells on 100-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then sonicated on ice four times for 20 s at 50% power. Protein content was quantified by the bicinchronic acid method using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Aliquots of the 20 μg of protein were boiled in protein sample buffer (9% SDS, 15% glycerol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 6% β-mercaptoethanol) and separated on SDS-PAGE using 8% acrylamide gels. Ovine COX-1 purified protein (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI) and murine recombinant COX-2 protein (Cayman) were also loaded on the gel with the experimental samples for positive control. After electrophoretic transfer of the protein from the polyacrylamide gel to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked by incubating with 10% dry milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) overnight at 4 °C. After being washed three times in TBS-T, the membrane was probed with monoclonal anti-human COX-1 mouse antibody (Cayman) diluted 1:4000 in TBS-T, 1% dry milk, polyclonal anti-human COX-2 rabbit antibody (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) diluted 1:4000 in TBS-T, 1% dry milk, or with polyclonal anti-human goat actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:2000 in TBS-T, 1% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:5000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL), anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), or anti-goat (Santa Cruz) immunoglobulin antibody in TBS-T, 1% dry milk. The membrane was washed three more times with TBS-T and immunocomplex was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The semiconfluent cells on 150-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 50 mmsodium bisulfite, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 8.6% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100) and homogenized by Dounce homogenizer (KONETES GLASS CO., Vineland, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of suspension buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 13 mm EDTA). The pellets were then resuspended in 125 μl of ice-cold distilled water, sulfuric acid was added to a final concentration of 0.4 n. Subsequently, lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were precipitated with ×10 volumes of acetone at −20 °C overnight. The precipitated histones were collected by centrifugation, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in distilled water. Protein concentration was measured by using BCA protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of histones (10 μg) were electrophoresed on an 18% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes or stained with Coomassie Blue. Blots were blocked by incubating with PBS containing 3% dry milk (PBS-MLK) for 20 min at room temperature, and then probed with anti-acetylated histone H4 anti-rabbit antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at a dilution of 1:2000 in PBS-MLK overnight at 4 °C. After washing, blots was incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:3000 in PBS-MLK for 1.5 h, and detected by an ECL kit. For Coomassie Blue staining, gels were incubated for 1 h in staining buffer (0.25% Coomassie Blue, 10% acetic acid, and 40% methanol), and then destained with repeated changes of acid/methanol. Total RNA from the semiconfluent cells on 100-mm diameter dishes was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA samples (10 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis in a 0.66 mformaldehyde, 1% agarose gel. The RNA was transferred in 10 × SSC onto nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action and UV cross-linked with a Stratalinker UV light source (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Human COX-1 was purchased from Oxford. The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It-II random prime kit (Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 60 °C for 2 h, followed by hybridization at 60 °C overnight. The blots were then washed once in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The membrane was exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using Advantage reverse transcription for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The reaction solution was diluted to final volume of 100 μl by adding of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Ten μl of the cDNA solution were used as PCR. PCR mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 2.0 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.4 μm each of the following primers, which were specific for full-length human COX-1 (33.Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Primers for COX-1 (5′-GCACCCCAGCAGCCGCGCCATGA-3′, 5′-GCTGCTTTCCTGCCCCTCAGAGCTC-3′) were used. The samples for COX-1 were then subjected to a first denaturation (4 min at 94 °C), and 30 cycles of denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), annealing (1 min at 70 °C), and extension (2 min at 72 °C), followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR product of 1.8-kb fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced by ABI PRISM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready kit (PerkinElmer Life Science, Foster City, CA). 1 × 105 NHA cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The cells were treated with or without 200 ng/ml TSA in astrocyte growth medium with 5% FBS. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with astrocyte basal medium from Clonetics without FBS containing 10 μm arachidonic acid (Cayman) for 1 h. The supernatants were harvested, and then samples were stored at −80 °C until further use. Concentrations of PGE2 in cell culture supernatants were determined by enzyme immunoassay using a PGE2 monoclonal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lower limit of sensitivity for detection of PGE2 was 31.3 pg/ml in our experimental condition. The results are expressed as nanograms/ml per 105 cells. COX-1 promoter/reporter plasmids were constructed as previously described (34.Xu X.M. Tang J.L. Chen X. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6943-6950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, the 5′-untranslated region of COX-1, from −1960 to +115, from −609 to +115, from −430 to +115, and from −2 to +115 were generated by PCR amplification using genomic DNA from NHA cells. PCR was performed using Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotides illustrated here are relative to the transcription initiation site that is +1 (GenBank™accession number AF440204). The following primers were used: upstream primers, from −1960, 5′-ACCGGTACCGAGCCAGAAG-3′; from −609, 5′-GATGGTACCACTGAGGGCT-3′; from −430, 5′-CTGGGTACCCTGTCTGAGGA-3′; from −2, 5′-GCGGGTACCCGAGGTGACA-3′; downstream primer, from +115, 5′-TGGAAGCTTGGACGCAGAGT–3′. All of upstream PCR primers containedKpnI recognition site, and downstream primer containedHindIII recognition site. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel, digested, and cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). In pGL3-2/+115, the Sp1 putative binding sites (+25/+31) were mutated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For the point mutation of Sp1-binding sites, the following primers were used: MUT sense, 5′-CTGGAGGGAGGAGCGG TTTT AGAGCCGGGGGAAGGG-3′; and MUT antisense, 5′-CCCTTCCCCCGGCTC TA AAACCGCTCCTCCCTCCAG-3′. Each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For transfection experiment, cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cell/well and incubated in astrocyte growth medium containing FBS for 24 h. After washing the cells with PBS, 500 ng of luciferase reporter construct was transfected using 2.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of astrocyte basal medium without FBS at 37 °C for 4 h. The medium was replaced and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h with HDAC inhibitors (1 mm NaBT, 200 ng/ml TSA, or 20 nmHC toxin) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO). The cells were harvested using 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) for the luciferase assay and quantification of protein content. Twenty μl of cell lysate was used for firefly luciferase assays. Relative light unit values were measured with firefly assay reagent (Promega) and a model TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA), and protein concentrations from corresponding cell lysate were measured using the BCA protein assays. Data were expressed as relative light units per microgram of protein. All luciferase assays were carried out in triplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (35.Shaw-White J.R. Bruno M.D. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2658-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assays. An oligonucleotide probe was synthesized based on the sequence of the promoter region ofCOX-1 including the known Sp1-binding site: WT-COX1-Sp1, GAGGAGCGGGGGTGGAGCCGGGGGAA (nucleotides +17 to +42). Each complementary oligonucleotide was annealed at a concentration of 250 mmin 250 mm Tris (pH 7.8) at 95 °C for 15 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. Probe was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The Sp1 GELSHIFT kit was obtained from Geneka Biotechnology (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and the procedure for reaction between the probe and 4 μg of nuclear extracts was followed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, nuclear extracts were incubated with or without antibodies in 4 μl of binding buffer B and 2 μl of stabilizing solution D (total volume was 16 μl) at 4 °C for 20 min, and each mixture was incubated after adding 200,000 cpm of labeled probe in 2 μl of binding buffer C and 1 μl of stabilizing solution D (total volume was 24 μl) at 4 °C for 20 min. For supershift assay, 4 μg of antibodies for Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (Santa Cruz) were used. Samples were then resolved in 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide (38:2) gel, at 4 °C in 1 × TGE buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. Caco-2 cell nuclear extracts (Geneka Biotechnology) were used as a positive control. To examine the effects of several HDAC inhibitors on the expression of lipid metabolizing enzymes in NHA cells, cells were treated with NaBT, HC toxin, and TSA for various times and doses. Levels of 15-LO-1, COX-1, and COX-2 protein and mRNA were analyzed by Western blot and Northern blot analysis, respectively. We did not detect the expression levels of 15-LO-1 and COX-2 in HDAC inhibitors or vehicle-treated cells (data not shown) as observed in colorectal carcinoma cells (19.Kamitani H. Geller M. Eling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, treatment with HDCA inhibitors increased levels of COX-1 mRNA (2.7 kb) and protein (67 kDa) (Fig. 1, A and B). TSA treatment enhanced COX-1 mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). The COX-1 mRNA and protein was detected at 12 h after treatment and the level was maximal at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, the induction of COX-1 appeared in a dose-dependent manner in NHA cells. NHA cells were treated with various concentrations of TSA ranging from 0 (vehicle) to 500 ng/ml (Fig. 2 C). TSA increased COX-1 protein even at 20 ng/ml. To confirm that COX-1 expression was induced, RNA was isolated from TSA-treated cell and reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with specific primers for human COX-1. After PCR, the 1.8-kb fragment was cloned into the TA vector (3.9-kb) and partially sequenced (33.Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The sequence was identical to the reported human COX-1 (data not shown). These results indicate that HDAC inhibitors altered the expression of COX-1 rather than the induction of COX-2 and 15-LO-1 in NHA cells.Figure 2Induction of COX-1 in NHA cells by treatment with TSA. Semiconfluent NHA cells were treated with 200 ng/ml TSA for the times indicated. A, total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern hybridization using probe for a human COX-1.B, proteins were extracted from the cells, and examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for COX-1, COX-2, and actin. C, the semiconfluent NHA cells were treated with various concentrations of TSA for 48 h. Equal amounts (20 μg) of total protein were examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for COX-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NHA cells are normal glial cells. Then, to ascertain whether treatment with HDAC inhibitors stimulate COX-1 expression in transformed glial cells, we examined five glioma (glial tumor) cell lines, A172, T98G, U87MG, U138MG, and U373MG. Induction of COX-1 protein was observed after TSA treatment in all five cell lines (Fig. 3), suggesting that COX-1 is an inducible gene in glial-derived cells, and that regulation of COX-1 expression in glial-derived cells appears to be controlled by a unique mechanism associated with histone acetylation. COX-2 protein expression was not detected in these glioma cell lines except U87MG cells. TSA did not alter COX-2 protein expression in U87MG cells. NHA cells were treated with or without 200 ng/ml TSA for 48 h, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium, containing 10 μmexogenous arachidonic acid. After 1 h incubation, the concentrations of PGE2 in the cell culture supernatants were determined using an EIA. PGE2 production increased f"

Although several parasite proteins involved in DNA replication have been described, the various mechanisms engaged in DNA metabolism of this major pathogen remain largely unexplored. As a step toward understanding this complex network, we describe the identification of Plasmodium falciparum replication protein A large subunit (pfRPA1) through affinity purification and mass spectral analysis of a purified 55-kDa factor. Gel retardation experiments revealed that pfRPA is the major single-stranded DNA binding activity in parasite protein extracts. The activity was expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner with peak activities in late trophozoites and schizonts, thus correlating with the beginning of chromosomal DNA replication. Accordingly, the pfrpa1 message was detected in parasites 20–24 h post-invasion which is in agreement with the expression of other P. falciparumDNA replication genes. Our results show that pfRPA1 is encoded by an unusual 6.5-kb transcript containing a single open reading frame of which only the C-terminal 42% of the deduced protein sequence shows homologies to other reported RPA1s. Like the orthologues of other protozoan parasites, pfRPA1 lacks the N-terminal protein interaction domain and is thus remarkably smaller than the RPA1s of higher eukaryotes.

Plasmodium falciparum causes one of the most life-threatening parasitic diseases in humans being responsible for up to 2 million deaths per year. Malaria pathogenesis is associated with the intracellular erythrocytic stage of the life cycle of the parasite involving repeated rounds of invasion, growth, and schizogony. Parasites that eventually differentiate into gametocytes are taken up by the female anopheline vector where zygote formation and sporogony take place. Sporozoites injected into a human host by the bite of an infective mosquito invade hepatocytes and, after schizogony, release thousands of merozoites capable of invading red blood cells. During each replication event, the timing, rate, and extent of genome multiplication have to be controlled appropriately and coordinated at each developmental stage. Most of the studies on DNA replication in P. falciparum have been conducted during the erythrocytic stages. Several genes involved in eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication and their encoded proteins have been identified in this parasite, including DNA polymerases α (DNA pol α) 1The abbreviations used are: DNA pol α and δ, DNA polymerases α and δ; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A; RPA1, large subunit of RPA; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; hpi, h post-invasion; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ORF, open reading frame; DTT, dithiothreitol; aa, amino acid; oligo, oligonucleotides; MS, mass spectroscopy.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2547-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been shown that expression of these genes follows a stage-specific pattern coinciding with the beginning of chromosomal replication which starts 28–31 h after merozoite invasion and continues through most of schizogony (8Inselburg J. Banyal H.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 10: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Due to their complex life cycle and constant immunological pressure exerted by their hosts, the processes of DNA metabolism in Plasmodium parasites must be both very efficient and flexible. The high degree of genetic variability observed in this parasite (9Scaife J.G. Genet. Eng. 1988; 7: 57-90Google Scholar, 10Weber J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and the fact that DNA replication occurs at five distinct developmental points, namely intrahepatocytic schizogony, intraerythrocytic schizogony, microgametogenesis, premeiotic DNA synthesis, and sporozoite development (11White J.H. Kilbey B.J. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) indicate the operation of highly regulated mechanisms of DNA replication, recombination, and repair. In fact, dynamic processes of DNA metabolism may be one reason for the outstanding success of this parasite because this supports rapid adaptation to environmental challenges such as immune pressure and action of antimalarial drugs. In addition, the unusually high AT content of ∼80% in the P. falciparum genome (12McCutchan T.F. Dame J.B. Miller L.H. Barnwell J. Science. 1984; 225: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Pollack Y. Katzen A.L. Spira D.T. Golenser J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) may also indicate peculiarities in the replication machinery of the parasite. Hence, investigation of the components involved in DNA metabolism of P. falciparum might reveal features unique to this parasite and may consequently lead to the identification of new potential drug targets for malaria therapy. The eukaryotic single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) plays essential roles in various aspects of DNA metabolism, including replication, recombination, and repair (for review see Ref. 14Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). The protein has high affinity for ssDNA (15Fairman M.P. Stillman B.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 16Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this system RPA interacts with large T-antigen and DNA pol α/primase, and these interactions seem to be important in loading DNA pol α/primase onto the RPA-coated unwound origin of replication to allow initiation of DNA synthesis to occur (20Brown G.W.

RPA exists as a heterotrimeric complex consisting of subunits of ∼70, 34, and 14 kDa in all eukaryotic organisms examined (14Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Among these, genes coding for RPA subunits have been identified and described in two protozoan parasites. In Crithidia fasciculata the large subunit of RPA (RPA1) is only 51 kDa in size (33Brown G.W. Hines J.C. Fisher P. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the predicted size of the large subunit of Cryptosporidium parvum RPA is 54 kDa (34Zhu G. Marchewka M.J. Keithly J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 367-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both RPA homologues the N-terminal protein-interaction domain is lacking, which has been shown to be required for stimulation of DNA pol α/primase and important in DNA recombination and repair (35Firmenich A.A. Elias-Arnanz M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1620-1631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gomes X.V. Wold M.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7884-7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). During our studies of protein-DNA interactions in P. falciparum promoters, we observed the major ssDNA binding activity in parasite nuclear extracts with binding properties resembling those described for RPAs of other organisms. Affinity purification and mass spectrometric analysis identified a 55-kDa protein as the P. falciparum RPA large subunit homologue (pfRPA1). Interestingly, as in the apicomplexan parasite C. parvum and the trypanosomatid C. fasciculata, this protein lacks the N-terminal protein-interaction domain. Further sequence analysis revealed that the P. falciparum rpa1 transcript is unusually long (∼6.5 kb) and encodes a single exon ORF potentially coding for a predicted protein of 1145 amino acids (aa). However, the region sharing homology with other RPA large subunits consists of only the C-terminal 42%. The biological significance of this unusual organization remains unknown. We have also shown that the presence of pfrpa1 message and pfRPA1 activity correlate with timing of chromosomal DNA replication as it has been described for other P. falciparum replication factors. The identification of a key molecule involved in DNA metabolism in P. falciparum provides a deeper understanding of such essential processes in this parasite and may lead to new pharmacological intervention strategies. P. falciparum3D7/K+ parasites were cultured in 150-mm Petri dishes at 5% hematocrit as described previously (40Trager W. Jenson J.B. Nature. 1978; 273: 621-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% albumax (Invitrogen). Growth synchronization was achieved by sorbitol lysis (41Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar) which eliminates all but ring stage parasites. Protein extracts were prepared with modifications according to Hoppe-Seyler et al. (42Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Rittmuller C. von Knebel D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Parasites were released from red blood cells by saponin lysis and washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The parasite pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 0.65% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted at 2500 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing cytoplasmic proteins was removed and stored at −80 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in lysis buffer before resuspension in 1 pellet volume of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 800 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmPMSF, 3 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 μm leupeptin). After vigorous shaking at 4 °C for 30 min, the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant (nuclear proteins) was diluted with 1 volume of dilution buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 30% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C. 1 liter of parasite culture (5–8% parasitaemia) yielded ∼2–4 mg of nuclear proteins and 100–200 mg of cytoplasmic proteins. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions. The double-stranded oligonucleotide 5B1c was obtained by incubating equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides 5B1f and 5B1rc in 1× React3 (Invitrogen) at 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature in a heating block. 5B1c was either labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (see above) or with Klenow enzyme in a fill-in reaction by incubating 1 pmol of DNA in 1× React2 buffer (Invitrogen) in the presence of 50 μm dATP/dGTP/dTTP and 10 μCi (3000 Ci/mmol) of [α-32P]dCTP at 30 °C for 20 min.

EMSA reactions were carried out by incubating 1–2 μg of crude nuclear proteins, 5–10 μg of crude cytoplasmic proteins, or ∼0.1–0.5 ng of purified protein (see below) with 5 fmol of radiolabeled probe in EMSA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mmMgCl2, 25 mm ZnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 100–500 ng of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA in a 20-μl reaction volume for 20 min at room temperature. Binding reactions were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE. For competition experiments the labeled probe was added 10 min after incubation of protein and competitor DNA. In EMSAs using purified proteins poly(dI-dC) was omitted, and bovine serum albumin (10 μg) was added. To assess the molecular weight of the ssDNA-protein complex ∼4 or 20 μg of crude nuclear or cytosolic protein extracts, respectively, were incubated with 60 fmol of labeled 5B1f oligo in EMSA buffer as described, followed by exposure to UV light for 10 min in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Protein-DNA complexes were incubated at 95 °C in 1× SDS sample buffer for 5 min and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Prestained molecular weight markers were used to estimate the molecular mass of the ssDNA-protein complexes. ∼6–10 or 20–40 μg of crude nuclear or cytosolic protein extracts, respectively, were incubated with 20 fmol of [γ-32P]dATP-labeled 5B1f oligonucleotide (in the presence of 1.25 mm PMSF) and UV cross-linked as described above. DNA-protein complexes were incubated with 2 μg of porcine pancreas trypsin at room temperature in the same buffer. Aliquots were removed at time points indicated in Fig. 4. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. As matrix for affinity purification, the biotinylated 90-base oligo 5B1Af (a trimer of 5B1f) was tethered to magnetic streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (Dynal) according to the supplier's instructions. Cytoplasmic extracts from a total of 7.5 liters of asynchronous parasite culture (5–8% parasitaemia) were spun at 3000 × g for 10 min to pellet cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated with 2 mg of Dynabeads (80 pmol oligo/mg beads) in binding buffer BB (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.65% Nonidet P-40) on a rotating wheel for 1 h at room temperature. Dynabeads were collected by use of a magnetic stand and washed 2 times with 1 ml of wash buffer W1 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmPMSF, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) and 2 times with buffer W2 containing 200 mm KCl. Bound proteins were eluted stepwise twice in 200 μl of elution buffer EB1 and twice in EB2 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmPMSF, 10% glycerol) containing 0.5 and 1 m KCl, respectively. Purification from nuclear extracts was performed by incubation of 4.5 ml of crude nuclear extract (1–2 μg/μl) from a total of 2.8 liters of asynchronous parasite culture (5–8% parasitaemia) with 1 mg of Dynabeads (10 pmol of oligo/mg of beads) in binding buffer BB (20 ng poly(dI-dC)/μl) as described above. Dynabeads were washed 2 times in 300 μl of buffer W1 and once in buffer W3 (250 mm KCl). Bound proteins were eluted stepwise twice in 50 μl of EB1 followed by elution in 50 μl of EB2. Wash fractions and eluates were analyzed by EMSA and SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Samples were stored at −80 °C. A gel piece containing the Coomassie Blue-stained purified cytoplasmic ssDNA-binding factor was washed five times for 1 min each in 30 μl of 40% n-propyl alcohol followed by five 1-min washes each in 30 μl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3(50% acetonitrile). The gel piece was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator and then digested with 0.5 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 10 μl of 0.1 mNH4HCO3 for 2 h at 37 °C. The gel piece was extracted with 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min followed by 15 μl of acetonitrile for 1 min. Extraction was repeated twice, and the pooled supernatants were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. Peptides were redissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 5 μl were used for mass spectral analysis. Separation of peptides was done on 100-μm inner diameter capillary columns packed with POROS R2 material. Mass spectral data were acquired on a TSQ7000 triple quadrupole instrument (Finnigan) with data-controlled switching between precursor ions and daughter ions (43Stahl D.C. Swiderek K.M. Davis M.T. Lee T.D. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For precursor ion scanning resolution of the first quadrupole was set to 1 Da. For operation in the MS/MS mode, the resolution of the first quadrupole was decreased to transmit a window of 4 Da, and the resolution of Q3 was adjusted to 1.5 Da. The daughter ion spectra were used to identify the protein with SEQUEST program (44Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Parasite total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) as described (45Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and RNA was stored in formamide at −80 °C. For Northern blot analysis equal amounts of RNA extracted from synchronized parasite cultures was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels (5 mm guanidine isothiocyanate) (45Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and vacuum-transferred to a Hybond-XL nylon membrane (AmershamBiosciences). Probes for Northern analysis of pfrpa1 were gel-purified PCR products (see Fig. 6) radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primers and Klenow polymerase. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in UltraHyb (Ambion). Sequence data for pfrpa1 (GenBankTM accession number AL035475) was obtained from the Sanger Center website at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_falciparum/. Sequencing of P. falciparum chromosome 4 was accomplished as part of the Malaria Genome Project. Preliminary sequence data from the Plasmodium yoellii genome were obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research website (www.tigr.org). This sequencing program is carried on in collaboration with the Naval Medical Research Center. In the course of investigations of P. falciparum promoters by gel retardation assays using dsDNA probes, we detected a dominant nonspecific DNA binding activity in parasite nuclear extracts derived from asynchronously growing cultures. This activity was only observed, however, when probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase which also labels ssDNA molecules. In contrast, when we used Klenow enzyme to fill in 4-base 5′ protrusions at the ends of double-stranded complementary oligonucleotides (ensuring that only double-stranded molecules are labeled), the DNA-protein complex was hardly detected (data not shown). EMSAs using end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides showed that this activity was due to the interaction of a nuclear factor with ssDNA. Fig. 1 A shows the interaction between this factor and the radiolabeled 30-base single-stranded oligonucleotide probe 5B1f (the sequence of 5B1f corresponds to a conserved motif found in var gene promoters (46Voss T.S. Thompson J.K. Waterkeyn J. Felger I. Weiss N. Cowman A.F. Beck H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 1 B the single-stranded oligonucleotides 5B1f and 5B1rc added at a 20-fold molar excess competed with binding to the labeled probe. However, a double-stranded 155-bp competitor restriction fragment containing the 5B1f sequence (5B1sub5) did not compete for binding. EMSA competition experiments further revealed that the affinity of the nuclear factor was higher for single-stranded polypyrimidine than for polypurine oligomers (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, heterogeneous dsDNA was a much weaker competitor, and yeast tRNA did not compete at all even if added at 2000-fold weight excess. To further investigate for sequence preferences, we used mutated forms of oligonucleotide 5B1f (5B1fmut1–5, see Table I) in gel retardation competition studies. In these oligos consecutive stretches of six nucleotides each were mutated, where A was replaced by G, G replaced by T, and T replaced by C. Whereas oligos 5B1fmut1, 5B1mut4, and 5B1fmut5 competed equally well or even better compared with the wild type sequence 5B1f, the ssDNA-binding factor had a clearly reduced affinity for oligonucleotides 5B1fmut2 and 5B1fmut3 (Fig. 1 C), indicating a certain degree of sequence preference independent of the pyrimidine/purine content. To investigate whether the ssDNA binding activity was present throughout the intra-erythrocytic life cycle, we performed gel retardation experiments using nuclear extracts prepared from synchronously growing cultures. The ssDNA binding activity was absent in mid-ring stage parasites (8–16 h post-invasion (hpi)) (Fig. 2). The activity faintly appeared in young trophozoites (16–24 hpi) and increased to maximal levels in parasites older than 34 hpi. Parasite nuclear extracts derived from the very early ring stage (0–8 hpi) also contained the ssDNA binding activity. A major ssDNA binding activity was also observed in cytoplasmic parasite extracts, but the complexed probe migrated at a slightly different position than the complex formed with the nuclear factor (Fig. 3 A). However, when various protease inhibitors were used during protein isolation and EMSAs, and when using fresh cytoplasmic extracts in gel retardation assays, an additional signal migrating at the same position as the nuclear complex was observed (Fig. 3 B). This suggested identical activities in both subcellular compartments with proteolytic activities in cytosolic extracts acting on the ssDNA-binding factor during protein isolation and gel retardation experiments. In EMSA affinity assays using a variety of different competitor DNAs, the cytoplasmic and nuclear activities behaved identically (Fig. 3 C). These observations supported the assumption that both activities were exerted by the same protein. To investigate this possibility in more detail, we compared limited tryptic digests of UV-cross-linked EMSA reactions by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Without trypsin digestion the major cross-linked complexes in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts migrated at an equal position (∼65 kDa). The additional larger signal observed in nuclear extracts was probably due to another abundant ssDNA binding activity that was unstable under electrophoresis conditions without UV cross-linking. Furthermore, in both experiments an identical pattern of labeled tryptic fragments was observed indicating that the ssDNA binding activity was retained in tryptic fragments of equal size. Taken together, these findings clearly suggested that the activities present in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were identical. Both major ssDNA binding activities from nuclear and cytosolic extracts were purified by affinity purification. Straptavidin-coated magnetic beads with tethered biotinylated 90-base oligonucleotide 5B1Af (a 3-mer of 5B1f) were incubated with crude protein extracts in binding buffer. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 and 1 m KCl, and all fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (data not shown). Testing for ssDNA binding activity using gel retardation revealed that most of the ssDNA binding activity was eluted at 0.5m salt (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobilities of ssDNA-protein complexes formed with crude extracts and purified fractions were identical and are presented in Fig. 5 A. Fig. 5 B shows SDS-PAGE analysis of the 0.5 m cytosolic eluate revealing a dominant band at ∼55 kDa and two additional enriched proteins at 30 and 25 kDa. Similar results were obtained for the nuclear 0.5m eluate. However, the purified cytosolic 55-kDa protein had a slightly smaller size than the nuclear factor (data not shown) which is in agreement with the observed difference in mobility of the corresponding ssDNA-protein complexes in EMSA experiments. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis of UV cross-linked ssDNA-protein complexes obtained with crude extracts and the purified factors revealed a size of ∼65 kDa for each complex (Fig. 5 C). These results strongly suggested that the 55-kDa factor was responsible for ssDNA binding because the size difference of 10 kDa observed between the purified protein alone and the UV cross-linked ssDNA-protein complexes was accounted for by the covalent attachment of the 30-base oligonucleotide 5"
https://openalex.org/W2052592595,"K+ channel-associated protein/protein inhibitor of activated STAT (KChAP/PIAS3β) is a potassium (K+) channel modulatory protein that boosts protein expression of a subset of K+ channels and increases currents without affecting gating. Since increased K+efflux is an early event in apoptosis, we speculated that KChAP might induce apoptosis through its up-regulation of K+ channel expression. KChAP belongs to the protein inhibitor of activated STAT family, members of which also interact with a variety of transcription factors including the proapoptotic protein, p53. Here we report that KChAP induces apoptosis in the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which expresses both K+ currents and wild-type p53. Infection with a recombinant adenovirus encoding KChAP (Ad/KChAP) increases K+ efflux and reduces cell size as expected for an apoptotic volume decrease. The apoptosis inducer, staurosporine, increases endogenous KChAP levels, and LNCaP cells, 2 days after Ad/KChAP infection, show increased sensitivity to staurosporine. KChAP increases p53 levels and stimulates phosphorylation of p53 residue serine 15. Consistent with activation of p53 as a transcription factor, p21 levels are increased in infected cells. Wild-type p53 is not essential for induction of apoptosis by KChAP, however, since KChAP also induces apoptosis in DU145 cells, a prostate cancer cell line with mutant p53. Consistent with its proapoptotic properties, KChAP prevents growth of DU145 and LNCaP tumor xenografts in nude mice, indicating that infection with Ad/KChAP might represent a novel method of cancer treatment.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a multistage process starting with cell shrinkage followed by chromatin condensation, caspase activation, and cellular fragmentation with subsequent removal of apoptotic bodies by neighboring cells. Early cell shrinkage is due in part to increased K+ efflux (reviewed in Ref. 1Yu S.P. Canzoniero L. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Loss of K+ during apoptosis is not an epiphenomenon but is critical to its progression. Block of K+ currents by channel-specific drugs or high extracellular K+ prevents apoptosis (2Yu S.P. Yeh C.H.

Importantly, caspase activation, considered the point of no return in apoptosis, only occurs after cellular K+loss (6Hughes F.M. Cidlowski J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 1999; 39: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this process, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms generating increased K+ efflux.

KChAP, a soluble protein, binds transiently to the cytoplasmic NH2 termini of its target channels and increases channel expression in a transcription-independent manner. Both total channel protein and surface expression are increased in response to KChAP. We hypothesized that the increased K+ channel expression conferred by KChAP might be associated with apoptosis.In addition to K+ channels, KChAP/PIAS3β interacts with other binding partners, most notably a variety of transcription factors. KChAP belongs to the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) gene family. There are four mammalian members of this family: 1) KChAP (7Wible B.A. Yang Q. Kuryshev Y.A. Accili E.A. Brown A.M. J.

The multiple names of most of these genes reflect their independent cloning as binding partners of different proteins. KChAP and PIAS3 are alternatively spliced products of a single gene; in KChAP, a small intron in the NH2-terminal coding region is retained, generating an in-frame insertion of 39 amino acids. We refer to KChAP as PIAS3β to distinguish it from the original mouse PIAS3 clone (10Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), which we refer to as PIAS3α. Mouse PIAS3 (PIAS3α) binds to activated STAT3 and prevents its attachment to DNA (10Chung C.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been found to interact with p53 and differentially affect its transcriptional activity. PIASy blocked the ability of p53 to transcribe its target gene, p21 (15Nelson V. Davis G.E. Maxwell S.A. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas PIAS1 activated p53-mediated gene expression including p21 (19Megidish T. Xu J.H. Xu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The interactions of PIAS proteins (KChAP/PIAS3β) with K+channels and p53 were the starting point of the present experiments. We hypothesized that KChAP might contribute to apoptosis, on the one hand by increasing K+ efflux in association with apoptotic cell volume decrease and, on the other, by activating p53. To test this hypothesis, a nonreplicating, recombinant adenovirus containing KChAP cDNA was constructed (AdKChAP) for infection of LNCaP cells, selected because they express both K+ currents and wild type p53. We found that overexpression of KChAP increased K+ efflux, reduced LNCaP cell volume, and induced apoptosis as evidenced by positive COMET assay and PARP cleavage. KChAP interacted with the p53 tetramerization domain in yeast two-hybrid studies, and total p53 as well as the phosphoserine 15 form were increased in Ad/KChAP-infected LNCaP cells. Consistent with activation of p53 transcription factor activity, p21, a G1 cell cycle arrest protein, was up-regulated in these cells. Ad/KChAP also produced apoptosis in another prostate cancer cell line, DU145 cells, which contain mutant p53. Given its proapoptotic effects independent of p53 status, we proposed that KChAP might act as a tumor suppressor, and we found that injection of Ad/KChAP into LNCaP and DU145 tumor xenografts in nude mice produced apoptosis and suppression of tumor growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Adenovirus InfectionLNCaP, DU145, and Jurkat cells were obtained from the American Type Culture collection. LNCaP and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, while DU145 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. All media also contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In the LNCaP experiments with high extracellular K+ in the medium, RPMI medium was assembled from the individual components as outlined by Invitrogen so that we could adjust the [K+]. The total amount of K+ plus Na+ in the media was kept constant at 108.4 mm so that when [K+] was elevated, [Na+] was correspondingly decreased. Staurosporine (STS) was from Sigma, and a 1 mm stock solution was prepared in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. A final concentration of 1 μm was used to induce apoptosis.A replication-defective, recombinant KChAP/adenovirus was constructed as follows. Full-length KChAP cDNA was subcloned in the vector, pShuttle-CMV, and sent to Q-Biogene (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) for adenovirus construction and purification. Expression of KChAP from the recombinant adenovirus, Ad/KChAP, was verified by Western blotting lysates of infected cells with a KChAP-specific antibody, 088, which recognizes only overexpressed KChAP (see details below). Recombinant Ad/GFP and Ad/LacZ were purchased from Q-Biogene. Viral infections were performed by diluting the virus to the appropriate concentration in standard medium and overlaying the cells (1 ml/35-mm dish). The medium was not changed before the cells were harvested.Antibodies and Western BlottingWe used two KChAP antibodies in this study, both of which were generated in our laboratory. 899 was raised against a bacterial fusion protein that consisted of the COOH-terminal 169 amino acids of KChAP (5Krick S. Platoshyn O. McDaniel S.S. Rubin L.J. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L887-L894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It recognizes both endogenous and overexpressed KChAP. 088 was raised against a peptide in the NH2 terminus of KChAP that is not present in PIAS3 (SPSPLASIPPTLLTPGTLLGPKREVDMH), hence the PIAS3α and PIAS3β/KChAP nomenclature used here. 088 recognizes overexpressed but not endogenous KChAP. Affinity-purified antibodies were used in Western blotting. Other antibodies used for Western blotting to detect the following proteins were obtained from commercial sources: p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); STAT1, STAT3, and cyclins A, B, and D3 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); actin (clone AC-40; Sigma); phospho-p53 (Ser15) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); PARP (we used two antibodies interchangeably that recognize both intact and cleaved PARP, one from Cell Signaling Inc. and one from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA)); monoclonal Rb (BD PharMingen); and p21 (WAF1 Ab1; Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA)).Cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 containing freshly added protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) for 30 min on ice. Insoluble debris was pelleted at 20,800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysate protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce), and aliquots were boiled in a reducing SDS sample buffer to denature protein. SDS-PAGE gels were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry blotting apparatus. Blots were blocked overnight in 5% milk (Bio-Rad) in PBS-T (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer were incubated with the blots for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (AmershamBiosciences) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with the ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences).Yeast Two-hybrid AssayFull-length KChAP (residues 1–619) in the GAL4 activation domain vector, pGAD424, was used as described (5Krick S. Platoshyn O. McDaniel S.S. Rubin L.J. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L887-L894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine p53 (residues 90–390) in a GAL4 DNA binding domain vector was from the CLONTECH Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid kit. The murine p53 carboxyl terminus (residues 290–390) and subfragments (Phe324–Thr352) and (Phe334–Thr352) with EcoRI and SalI sites incorporated at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the fragments, respectively, were generated by PCR. PCR products were subcloned using TOPO cloning (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced before cloning in frame into pGBT9 and pGAD424. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with combinations of pGBT9 and pGAD424 plasmids, and interaction was determined by β-galactosidase filter assays as previously described (7Wible B.A. Yang Q. Kuryshev Y.A. Accili E.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11745-11751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).COMET AssayDNA degradation was assayed in cells overexpressing Ad/KChAP or Ad/LacZ using the kit from Trevigen. Briefly, 106 cells/ml were mixed with molten low melting agarose at a ratio of 1:10. Immediately, 50 μl of this mixture was spread onto slides. Slides were immersed in prechilled lysis solution at 4 °C for 30 min. After a brief rinse in 1× TBE, the slides were subjected to horizontal electrophoresis at 1 V/cm (measured electrode to electrode) for 11 min. The slides were then put in ice-cold methanol for 5 min followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature in ethanol. After drying, the slides were stained with SYBR green for epifluorescence microscopy.Rb+ FluxLNCaP cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes at 250,000 cells/well. On the following day, cells were infected with either Ad/GFP or Ad/KChAP (multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 100). Rb+ fluxes were measured 24 h after infection using the nonradioactive method of Terstappen (20Terstappen G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To load Rb+, cells were incubated for 4 h (37 °C) in a modified Tyrode's solution containing 5 mm RbCl, 145 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4 at 37 °C), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed three times with Rb+-free PBS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 1 ml of normal Tyrode's solution. The supernatant containing released Rb+ was collected, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 to measure Rb+ remaining in the cells. Samples were diluted (1:4) with ionization buffer (PBS containing 2.5% HNO3), and Rb+ content was determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry at 780 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 3100). A calibration curve was constructed to determine Rb+concentrations. Relative Rb+ efflux was calculated as the amount of Rb+ in the supernatant divided by total Rb+ (supernatant plus cell lysate).Flow Cytometric AnalysisK+ ContentAt 72 h postinfection with either Ad/GFP or Ad/KChAP (MOI = 100), LNCaP cells were collected by trypsin treatment and washed in PBS. The K+-sensitive dye, potassium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (PBFI) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was dissolved in Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) and incubated with the cells in standard medium at a final concentration of 5 μm for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then chilled on ice, and propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was added. Flow cytometry was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACS Vantage machine. Ten thousand cells from each treatment group were analyzed. Excitation of PBFI was at 340 nm, and emission was captured at 425 nm. Propidium iodide was excited by a 488-nm argon laser at the same time.DNA ContentFor analysis of DNA content, cells were trypsinized either 24 or 72 h postinfection as described above, washed with PBS, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for at least 8 h at −20 °C. After washing in PBS, propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was added. Ten thousand cells were examined by flow cytometry for each sample using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (excitation at 488 nm).Tumor Production and Adenovirus Injection in Nude MiceTumor cells (DU145 or LNCaP; 2 × 106cells/injection site) were suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, mixed with an equal volume of cold Matrigel on ice, and injected subcutaneously into both flanks of 8–9-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored using calipers every 2–3 days. Tumor volume was calculated as (L ×W 2)/2, where L represents length and W is width in millimeters. When tumors reached an average size of 50–60 mm3 (about 2 weeks for DU145 and 5 weeks for LNCaP), mice were divided into three treatment groups: 1) PBS, 2) Ad/GFP, and 3) Ad/KChAP. Both tumors on an individual mouse received the same treatment. Ad/GFP and Ad/KChAP were diluted in sterile PBS to 5 × 108 plaque-forming units/μl. Injections (1 μl/mm3 of tumor) were delivered directly into the tumors every 2–3 days for a total of three injections per week. Assuming 106 cells per mm3 of tumor, about 500 plaque-forming units of virus per tumor cell was injected at 48–72 h intervals. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 48 h after the final injection, and tumors were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. During the experiments, the animals were housed and handled in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.Immunohistochemistry and Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay of Tumor SectionsEight-micron sections were prepared from frozen tumors dissected from the three treatment groups (PBS, Ad/GFP, and Ad/KChAP), mounted, and fixed on glass slides. Overexpressed KChAP was detected by incubating sections with the 088 antibody (1:100 dilution in 0.2% gelatin plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS) for 2 h at room temperature, washing with PBS, and incubating with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. Color development was done with the ABC and DAB kits from Vector Laboratories following their instructions. Apoptosis of cells in tumors subjected to different treatments was determined by the TUNEL assays using the Apo-Tag kit (Oncor, Inc.), following the manufacturer's instructions.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that infection of a recombinant adenovirus overexpressing KChAP/PIAS3β (Ad/KChAP) in LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cells produces apoptosis, and direct injection of Ad/KChAP into xenografts of LNCaP and DU145 cells in nude mice suppresses tumor growth. These data support a link between overexpression of KChAP/PIAS3β and the increased K+ efflux that results during apoptotic volume decrease. Increased K+ efflux from Ad/KChAP-infected LNCaP cells was shown by Rb+ flux measurements, and decreased intracellular K+ and cell shrinkage were demonstrated by flow cytometry. Apoptosis in Ad/KChAP-infected LNCaP cells was blocked by high extracellular K+, indicating that KChAP-enhanced K+ efflux is critical for apoptosis. The identity of the K+ channel(s) that carries the increased outward current has not yet been determined. We attempted to infect cells in the presence of K+ channel blockers such as 4-AP, TEA, and quinidine to assess the effects on apoptosis, but these experiments were unsuccessful, since the drugs also interfered with viral infection. LNCaP cells are known, however, to possess several outward K+ currents including voltage-gated delayed rectifier channels (30Skyrma R.N. Prevarskaya N.B. Dufy-Barbe L. Odess M.F. Audin J. Dufy B. Prostate. 1997; 33: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Laniado M.E. Fraser S.P. Djamgoz M.B. Prostate. 2001; 46: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as well as several two-pore K+ channel-like currents.2 Recently, two-pore K+ channels were proposed as candidates for mediating apoptotic volume decrease (32Trimarchi J.R. Liu L. Smith P.J.S. Keefe D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C588-C594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Future experiments should reveal both the K+ channels mediating apoptotic volume decrease in LNCaP cells and the role of KChAP in modulating these channels. With the results presented here, we propose that KChAP is an attractive candidate for the long sought after mediator of apoptotic volume decrease.KChAP/PIAS3β not only affects K+ channels but, as a member of the PIAS family, interacts with a variety of transcription factors. We have found that KChAP/PIAS3β, like other members of the PIAS family, binds to p53 and alters its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the same KChAP domain that binds to Kv channel NH2 termini (i.e. the 98-amino acid M-fragment) (8Kuryshev Y.A. Gudz T.I. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C931-C941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also interacts with p53 in yeast two-hybrid experiments. We have identified a 28-residue fragment from the COOH terminus of p53, consisting of the tetramerization domain, which is sufficient for interaction with KChAP. This result is consistent with a recent report indicating that PIAS1 also interacts with the tetramerization domain of p53 (19Megidish T. Xu J.H. Xu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Our data show that KChAP/PIAS3β activates p53 in LNCaP cells. When p53 is activated as a transcription factor, the cell cycle arrest protein gene, p21, is a target. We see both increased total p53 and p21 levels in Ad/KChAP-infected LNCaP cells, suggesting an activation of p53. PIAS1 has been shown to interact with p53 and activate its transcriptional activity (19Megidish T. Xu J.H. Xu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another PIAS family member, PIASy, interacts with p53 but depresses rather than enhances its activity as a transcription factor (15Nelson V. Davis G.E. Maxwell S.A. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting distinct functions of individual PIAS proteins.One mechanism whereby PIAS proteins might activate p53 is suggested by our observation of increased p53 phosphorylation on serine 15 in Ad/KChAP-infected cells. Phosphorylation of this residue has been shown previously to correlate with increased stability of p53 as well as increased transcriptional activity (24Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 25Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). KChAP-induced loss of K+ is not required for p53 activation, since serine 15 phosphorylation is also detected in cells bathed in high extracellular K+. This effect is distinct from caspase activation, which requires loss of intracellular K+. It is not known whether other PIAS proteins induce the same modification in p53 or how KChAP produces this post-translational modification. Several kinases have been implicated in the phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 including ATM, ATR, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (reviewed in Ref. 33Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PIAS1 has been shown to induce apoptosis in U2OS cells via activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (34Liu B. Shuai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36624-36631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible link between c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p53 phosphorylation. We have observed activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase as well as p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 kinases in Ad/KChAP-infected LNCaP cells.2The pleiotropic nature of PIAS protein action as well as the variety of binding partners identified thus far must now be considered in light of the recent implication of PIAS proteins as SUMO-1 E3 ligases. PIAS1 has been shown to catalyze the sumoylation (i.e. covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein, SUMO-1) of p53 in mammalian cells (35Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and interestingly, sumoylation was previously reported to increase the transcriptional activity of p53 (36Gostissa M. Hengstermannm A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 37Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevesiae, the PIAS homolog, Siz1, has been shown to act as an E3-like factor for SUMO-1 conjugation to the septins, a process required for yeast budding (38Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 39Takahashi Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 40Takahashi Y. Kahyo T. Toh-e A. Yasuda H. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48973-48977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor, another PIAS-binding protein, can be modified by sumoylation (41Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), although it is not known whether PIAS proteins mediate this process. It will be important to determine the role that sumoylation plays in the involvement of PIAS proteins with all binding partners, including the interaction of KC"

The Thermotoga maritima TM0065 gene codes for a protein (TM-IclR) that is homologous to the IclR family. We have determined the crystal structure of TM-IclR at 2.2 Å resolution using MAD phasing and synchrotron radiation. The protein is composed of two domains: the N-terminal DNA-binding domain contains the winged helix-turn-helix motif, and the C-terminal presumed regulatory domain is involved in binding signal molecule. In a proposed signal-binding site, a bound Zn2+ ion was found. In the crystal, TM-IclR forms a dimer through interactions between DNA-binding domains. In the dimer, the DNA-binding domains are 2-fold related, but the dimer is asymmetric with respect to the orientation of signal-binding domains. Crystal packing analysis showed that TM-IclR dimers form a tetramer through interactions exclusively by signal-binding domains. A model is proposed for binding of IclR-like factors to DNA, and it suggests that signal-dependent transcription regulation is accomplished by affecting an oligomerization state of IclR and therefore its affinity for DNA target.

A model is proposed for binding of IclR-like factors to DNA, and it suggests that signal-dependent transcription regulation is accomplished by affecting an oligomerization state of IclR and therefore its affinity for DNA target. The IclR (isocitrate lyase regulator) family of prokaryotic transcription regulators mediates the signal-dependent expression of operons related to carbon metabolism in eubacteria and archaea (1Nasser W. Reverchon S. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There are over 100 known members of the IclR family found in 44 species of bacteria and 2 archaea, with 9 IclR homologues in Escherichia coli alone (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/cgi-bin/Entrez/blink?pid = 7442884). The most well-characterized members of the IclR family include the E. coli IclR glyoxylate shunt repressor that regulates acetate utilization encoded by aceBAK operon (2Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 173-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sunnarborg A. Klumpp D. Chung T. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Erwinia chrysanthemi pectin degradation pathway repressor KdgR (4Nasser W. Reverchon S. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the glycerol catabolism pathway repressor GylR of Streptomyces coelicolor (5Hindle Z. Smith C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In each instance, the role of the IclR family member is to repress transcription of specific catabolic genes in the absence of specific substrates and then mediate de-repression in response to an excess of a signaling molecule. Several IclR-like proteins have been shown to regulate aromatic acid metabolism (6Kok R.G. D'Argenio D.A. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5058-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they also have been implicated in control of expression of sporulation and virulence genes (7van Wezel G.P. van der Meulen J. Kawamoto S. Luiten R.G. Koerten H.K. Kraal B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5653-5662Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Nomura K. Nasser W. Kawagishi H. Tsuyumu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14034-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, a specific regulatory function has not been defined for many IclR sequence homologues. The mechanism of signal-dependent transcriptional repression and de-repression can be deduced from the gene and operon structure and from genetic and mutagenesis studies. It has been proposed that IclR family members comprise two domains. The N-terminal domain, which has been designated PF01614 in the Pfam catalogue of motifs (9Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) 1The abbreviations used are: HTHhelix-turn-helixDBDDNA-binding domainMADmultiple wavelength anomalous dispersion DNA-binding motif, which is responsible for binding to the palindromic operator sequence (10Pan B. Unnikrishnan I. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3982-3984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Donald L.J. Chernushevich I.V. Zhou J. Verentchikov A. Poppe-Schriemer N. Hosfield D.J. Westmore J.B. Ens W. Duckworth H.W. Standing K.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The regulatory C-terminal domain most likely binds the signal molecule (small ligand). Mutations in the C-terminal region of the PobR repressor, a member of IclR family, alter the signal specificity without altering transcription activation or DNA binding functions (6Kok R.G. D'Argenio D.A. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5058-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of signal binding is unknown; however, the current model assumes that binding of the signal molecule to the C-terminal domain de-represses transcription by modulating either DNA binding, receptor multimerization, or the interaction of the repressor with the transcriptional machinery (6Kok R.G. D'Argenio D.A. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5058-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Donald L.J. Chernushevich I.V. Zhou J. Verentchikov A. Poppe-Schriemer N. Hosfield D.J. Westmore J.B.

Although the specific biochemical function of this protein is unknown, a role in sugar metabolism is predicted. The TM0065 gene is located within a cluster of genes that is implicated in xylulose metabolism, and in E. coli, the catabolism of endogenously formed xylulose is mediated by the T. maritime IclR homologue YiaJ (12Ibanez E. Campos E. Baldoma L. Aguilar J. Badia J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the first crystal structure of an IclR-like transcriptional regulator at 2.2 Å resolution. TM-IclR is a dimer; each monomer consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain with a HTH motif and a C-terminal α/β domain. The C-terminal domain has features that are consistent with binding of a small signal molecule that may inhibit repression by TM-IclR. The model for TM-IclR mediated regulation is proposed. The open reading frame of TM-IclR was amplified and cloned, and protein was purified and concentrated following procedures described previously (13Korolev S. Ikeguchi Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Pegg A.E. Savchenko A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 9: 27-31Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of iclR was amplified by PCR from T. maritima genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection). The gene was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a modified pET15b cloning vector (Novagen) in which the TEV protease cleavage site replaced the thrombin cleavage site, and a double stop codon was introduced downstream from the BamHI site. This construct provides for an N-terminal His6 tag separated from the gene by a TEV protease recognition site (ENLYFQ↓G). The fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene) harboring an extra plasmid encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg, and ATA for Ile). Large-scale expression of the recombinant proteins was performed by subculturing a 25-ml culture grown in a 250-ml flask, inoculated from fresh transformants, into 2 liters of LB with appropriate antibiotics in either a 6-liter flask or a custom-baffled 4-liter flask. The sample was induced at an A600 of 0.6–0.8 with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after growth at 37 °C, 220 rpm and grown overnight at 15 °C, 220 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 8000 rpm; Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20 centrifuge). The cell pellet was resuspended to 40 ml with binding buffer, supplemented with 1 mm each of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The purification procedure used buffers containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 5, 30, and 250 mm imidazole for the binding, wash, and elution buffers, respectively. The harvested cells were lysed by adding 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to the thawed sample before sonication (5 × 30 s; duty cycle, 50%; operation load, 6). Fresh protease inhibitors were added before the sample was clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 17000 rpm; Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25 centrifuge). The clarified lysate was passed by gravity through a DE52 column in series with a Ni2+ column. Contaminating proteins were removed by washing the Ni2+ column with 50 column volumes of wash buffer. The bound protein was removed with elution buffer as qualitatively determined by the Bradford assay. The sample was then brought to a final concentration of 0.5 mm EDTA, followed by the addition of a final concentration of 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. The His tag was removed by cleavage with recombinant His-tagged TEV protease (60 μg TEV/mg recombinant protein). The cleavage step was done concurrently with dialysis in binding buffer without imidazole at 4 °C overnight. The cut His tag and His-tagged TEV protease were removed from the purified recombinant protein by passage through a second Ni2+ column. The sample was prepared for crystallization screening by a second dialysis in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, followed by concentration to 10 mg/ml using a BioMax concentrator (Millipore). Finally, any particulate matter was removed from the sample by passage through a 0.2 μm Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filtration device (Millipore). The protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging drops by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution (9 mg/ml) with 2 μl of 0.1 m HEPES pH 7, 5% PEG 8000, and 5% glycerol and equilibrated at 20 °C over 100 μl of this solution. Crystals, which appeared after 3 days, were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with crystallization buffer plus 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant prior to data collection. High pressure liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superose-12 HR column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, using the System Gold (Beckman). The column was calibrated with cytochrome c(12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and blue dextran (2000 kDa). A 25-μl TM-IclR protein sample at a 2 mg/ml concentration or premixed with standard proteins was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min before being injected into the column through a 20-μl injection loop. Chromatography was carried out at 20 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluted proteins were detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The three-wavelength inverse-beam MAD data up to 2.5 Å (peak, 12.6603 keV (0.9794 Å); inflection point, 12.6620 keV (0.9793 Å); high energy remote, 13.0000 keV (0.95385 Å)) were collected from a Se-Met-labeled protein crystal. One crystal (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm) was used to collect at 100 K all data MAD sets to 2.5 Å with 6 s exposure/1°/frame using a 200 mm crystal-to-detector distance. The total oscillation range was 160°, as predicted using strategy module within HKL2000 suite (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

All data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (Table I) to an R-merge of 6.6%, 7.0%, and 8.0% for inflection point, peak, and remote, respectively. The native data were collected at 1.0332 Å wavelength to 2.2 Å (R-merge, 6.0%) from a single crystal at the SBC 19ID beamline and were used for phase extension and model refinement.Table ISummary of crystal and MAD dataUnit cella = 115.23 Å, b = 61.08 Å, c = 95.91 Å, β = 110.51°Space groupC2Mass Da (246 residues)28,118Mol (AU)2SeMet (AU)14MAD data collectionEdgePeakRemoteHigh resolutionWavelength (Å)0.97940.97930.95381.0332Resolution range (Å)2.52.52.530–2.2 (2.28–2.2)No. of unique reflections22,29121,60221,09427,598Completeness (%)97.896.994.685.9 (59.6)R merge (%)6.57.08.06.0 (29.9) Open table in a new tab The structure was determined by MAD phasing using CNS (15Brunger A.T.

Electron density calculated at 1.2 ς is well connected for most of the main chain, except for a few areas on the surface of the molecules (Fig. 1). Molecule A is better ordered than molecule B.

Calculation of binding cavities were done with SURFNET (18Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and VOIDOO (19Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 178-185Google Scholar). The structure of the full-length (246 residues) TM-IclR was determined and refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The final R-factor is 0.237 with a free R of 0.300 and preserving proper stereochemistry (Table I). The PROCHECK analysis showed that all but two residues, Asn31 and Lys56 in subunit A, had backbone conformations (φ, ψ) in the most favorable region. These two residues (φ, ψ) are in the additionally allowed region. The electron density for the main chain is continuous except for some regions on the surface of the molecules, and the electron density for most of the side chains is excellent (Fig. 2). The protein consists of two α/β domains, a small N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a larger C-terminal putative signal-binding (repression inhibition) domain (Fig. 3). These domains are linked by an α-helix and a short loop, which we term the “linking region.” The protein crystallized as a dimer; the dimerization interface is formed entirely by the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 3 B). The HTH DNA-binding motif of the N-terminal domain is composed of two small, consecutive α-helices (H2 and H3 and the 4-residue turn connecting them). This motif is found in many other transcriptional regulators (20Wintjens R. Rooman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 294-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The HTH motif is followed by a short α-helix and a β-hairpin, which connects to the linking region. The architecture of the DNA-binding domain closely resembles that of the winged HTH, a relatively recently recognized but well-established major groove DNA-binding domain (21Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The distance between HTH motifs in the dimer is relatively short (33.46 Å between Cα of Val34 in HTH), suggesting that IclR spans a narrow minor groove and recognizes a rather short (12–14-bp) palindromic DNA sequence, consistent with the proposed AT-rich 14-bp binding site for the E. coli IclR protein (10Pan B. Unnikrishnan I. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3982-3984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Donald L.J. Chernushevich I.V. Zhou J. Verentchikov A. Poppe-Schriemer N. Hosfield D.J. Westmore J.B. Ens W. Duckworth H.W. Standing K.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is also quite clear that in order for the HTH motifs to interact with the major groove, the N termini must be inserted into the minor groove of the DNA. The dimerization interface comprises the α-helices H1 and H4. The hydrophobic interface formed by the two H1 α-helices from the N-terminal domains includes four aromatic side chains, two from each monomer. A number of additional hydrophobic interactions (such as Ala7-Leu4) and H-bonds (such as Asp12-Tyr67) are also found at the dimer interface. The C-terminal putative regulatory and signal-binding domain is composed of a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, five α-helices, and one short 310 helix (Fig. 3). The strongly curved β-sheet forms a half barrel and divides the five α-helices into two subgroups; two relatively longer α-helices (H4 and H5) lie on the outside of the curved sheet with the remaining three (H6, H7, and H8) on the inside, forming an α/β/α structure. The H6 α-helix is inserted into the half barrel and is parallel to the sheet surface. The α-helices H7 and H8 close one end of the half barrel. There is an additional short β-strand (S5′) within the long loop (L3) at the edge of the β-sheet (Fig. 3). In the dimer, the C-terminal domains do not contact each other. The crystal structure also revealed a divalent metal ion in each of the C-terminal domains (modeled as Zn2+ ion) bound to Cys196 (Zn-S distance is 2.70 Å) and located near the N terminus of α-helix H6 (Fig. 4). In addition, the metal-binding site (443 Å3), as obtained from SURFNET (18Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), contains three water molecules and is the best candidate region for a signal-binding pocket. Moreover, an unassigned electron density was found also at the subunit interface formed by α-helices H4 in the “linking region.” A molecule of formate (HCO2−) was modeled into this density, although formate was not present under the purification or crystallization conditions. The putative formate molecule, which refined well, is sandwiched by pairs of 2-fold related Ser69, Gly68, and Ile65. It is not clear what role formate could play, if any, in TM-IclR function. The formate binding site could also accommodate acetate. Acetate is utilized as a sole source of carbon by enzymes encoded in the IclR-controlled aceBAK operon in E. coli, and, therefore its binding might be functionally relevant. The crystal asymmetric unit contains a dimer that is predicted to be a minimal DNA binding unit because the majority of proteins with domains containing HTH function as dimers and bind 2-fold symmetric DNA targets. In promoters known to be regulated by IclR family members, many palindromes (or pseudopalindromes) have been identified (10Pan B. Unnikrishnan I. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3982-3984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Donald L.J. Chernushevich I.V. Zhou J. Verentchikov A. Poppe-Schriemer N. Hosfield D.J. Westmore J.B. Ens W. Duckworth H.W. Standing K.G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 2-fold character of the operators for the IclR family is therefore consistent with the 2-fold symmetry of the DNA-binding domains in the crystal structure. The C-terminal ligand-binding domains, which are not directly involved in dimer formation, are not related by 2-fold symmetry, thus making the dimer asymmetric. The linking regions (residues 62–79) in the two monomers in the asymmetric unit adopt two different conformations, which results in two different orientations of the ligand-binding domains with respect to the HTH dimer (Fig. 3 B). The difference in the orientation of the two ligand-binding domains is clearly explained by the differences in the main chain torsion angles (φ, ψ) for the residues Phe75 (−66.9°, 135.9°versus −97.7°, 93.1°) and Asn76(−113.5°, 94.4° versus −47.7°, −40.0°) in the linking regions in the two monomers. Therefore, it is clear that Phe75 and Asn76 can assume two distinct conformations. This asymmetry may have functional implications (see below). Analysis of crystal packing revealed that TM-IclR dimers may form tetramers. Although the ligand-binding domains do not participate in formation of the asymmetric dimer, they interact directly with the corresponding domains from neighboring asymmetric units. These interactions result in the formation of a tetramer, a dimer of identical asymmetric dimers (Fig. 3 C). The tetramerization interface is substantial (5366.3 Å2) and is composed exclusively of the ligand-binding domains, suggesting that the tetramer may be of biological relevance. This contention is supported by recent mass spectroscopy experiments on the DNA-bound form of the IclR protein from E. coli (22Donald L.J. Hosfield D.J. Cuvelier S.L. Ens W. Standing K.G. Duckworth H.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These experiments also suggested that both dimeric and tetrameric species existed in solution for IclR and GclR repressors of E. coli. Size exclusion chromatography showed that the TM-IclR is a dimer in solution (data not shown). Taken together, the structural information and the oligomerization experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that TM-IclR is a dimer in the absence of signal and DNA but adopts a tetrameric structure when bound to DNA in the absence of signal molecule. In the dimer, the HTH reading heads are positioned to interact with a palindromic 12–14-base pair operator, with specific contacts predominantly in the major groove of the DNA. The H2 α-helix is aligned ∼90° to the predicted recognition α-helix (H3). The α-helix H3 is partially disordered in molecule B, perhaps because the DNA is absent from the structure. The two helices are connected by a short loop. The 3 residues that connect the H2 and H3 α-helices (Asn31, Met32, and Ser33) are in left-handed helix, α-helix, and α-helix conformations, respectively. These residues constitute a typical turn in a HTH motif. In TM-IclR, the surface encompassing the HTH is positively charged (Figs. 3 D and5), providing additional verification for DNA binding. The amino acid sequences of H2 and H3 α-helices are not conserved among members of IclR family, except for two hydrophobic resides (Met41 and Leu44) as well as Glu25 and Ser35 (Fig. 1), which suggests that these α-helices mediate DNA sequence specificity among IclR family members that recognize different DNA targets. The N-terminal end of the H1 α-helix that precedes the HTH appears to be in a position to contact the minor groove of the DNA (the N terminus, Asn2, Thr3, Lys5, and Lys6 are good candidates to make contacts with DNA), therefore suggesting that nucleotides near the 2-fold dyad may affect IclR specificity. These interactions would be enhanced by partial positive charge of the N terminus of α-helix. The sequence of the H1 α-helix is not conserved, except for Leu4 and Ile10 (Fig. 1). In addition, the region consisting of the β-hairpin (the wing) and the loop connecting H1 and H2 α-helices in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain may serve as a flexible hinge (Gly19 and conserved Gly48 and Gly61) to accommodate DNA targets with different half-site spacing. Therefore, the wing portion of the winged HTH in TM-IclR may be functionally/structurally different from that of other winged domains such as hRFX1 (23Gajiwala K.S. Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W. Mach B. Burley S.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the flexibility of this moiety and its contribution to DNA binding need to be thoroughly examined by biochemical/physical analyses including high-resolution x-ray crystallography using a number of different DNA targets with different half-site spacings, although the TM-IclR DNA target has yet to be identified. In any case, the β-hairpin in TM-IclR is much smaller than that of hRFX1 and may not interact with DNA directly as seen in the hRFX1 structure. The HTH domain of TM-IclR was compared with other HTH motifs in the structural data base. When the spatial arrangement of the α-helices H1, H2, and H3 was compared, the HTH domain of TM-IclR was most similar to those of three HTH protein groups: toxin repressor (24Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), CAP (25Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and HNF-3/fork head (26Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The wing portion of TM-IclR was also compared with other proteins and was found to be quite different from other domains with respect to the size of the loop. The histone H5 and HNF-3 winged domains have longer loops compared with TM-IclR (27Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); the toxin repressor family has shorter loops (24Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the SmtB HTH,Synechococcus PCC7942 trans-acting dimeric repressor, is structurally almost identical to the HTH of TM-IclR (27Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that TM-IclR is a dimer in solution in the absence of the signal molecule and the DNA target. We modeled TM-IclR dimer on a linear 20-base pair fragment of B-DNA by examining other prokaryotic DNA-binding HTH domain-DNA complexes (Fig. 5). Two consecutive major grooves of the DNA are contacted by the two HTH reading heads, which consist of the two consecutive α-helices (H2-H3) connected by the sharp turn. The α-helix H1 is modeled to be in close contact with the minor groove between the two major grooves. Although the DNA-binding domain of TM-IclR has a winged HTH motif, the wing is too far from DNA and may not interact directly with DNA. Rather, it may provide flexibility to the reading head if the protein binds DNA targets with different half-site spacing. Interestingly, the dimer in the crystal structure appears to form a tetramer with the asymmetric unit dimer that is related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The tetramer is created by interaction between the signal domains of two asymmetric dimers. This observation is consistent with recent mass spectroscopy experiments suggesting that it is a tetramer that binds the DNA targets (22Donald L.J. Hosfield D.J. Cuvelier S.L. Ens W. Standing K.G. Duckworth H.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To gain insight as to the possible relevance of the tetramerization observed by mass spectroscopy and observed in the crystal structure, we modeled the TM-IclR tetramer on a fragment of duplex DNA (Fig. 5). In the tetrameric assembly found in the crystal structure, the two dimeric DNA-binding domains are aligned parallel and approximately linearly. There are two possible ways that this tetramer can bind the DNA target: (i) model A, two operator sites might be aligned sequentially with a specific spacing (6–8 bp) between the two sites; or (ii) model B, the two operator sites might be aligned side by side (from two different duplexes or a looped duplex) (Fig. 5). In model A, the tetramer binds a DNA target composed of two 2-fold symmetry-related binding sites; each binding site would contain two 2-fold symmetry-related half-sites. This interaction would be predicted to increase the specificity for an operator consisting of two 14-bp half-sites with the proper half-site spacing. In model B, the two DNA sites would be located in two different duplexes or on the same duplex with a separation of >100 bp. In this model, either the DNA loops back, forming an anti-parallel arrangement, or the DNA loops around, forming a parallel arrangement reminiscent of the tetrameric lac repressor-operator interaction (28Friedman A.M. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T.A. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Analysis of the acetate operon (10Pan B. Unnikrishnan I. LaPorte D.C. J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whose expression is under the transcriptional control of the iclR gene in E. coli, indicated that the E. coli IclR repressor recognizes a 35-bp palindromic sequence. This observation is consistent with the binding of two IclR dimers to two 14-bp binding sites separated by 7 bp (model A). The C-terminal domain comprises a six strand anti-parallel β-sheet, which separates five α-helices. The fold most closely resembles the structure of profilin, an actin-binding protein, although there is little sequence identity (6%). Both structures contain a pocket within the β-sheet. In TM-IclR, the pocket is formed by the inner surface of concave β-sheet, the loop (L3), and a small α-helix (H6). The pocket contains the residues in PobR that mediate inducer (6Kok R.G. D'Argenio D.A. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5058-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are reasonably conserved among IclR family members (Fig. 1). In the TM-IclR structure, the pocket is occupied by water molecules and a divalent metal ion (assigned as Zn2+) bound to Cys196. This region is formed by parts of TM-IclR that mediate tetramer formation, residues 214–220 and 114–118. The proximity of the presumed ligand-binding region to the region involved in tetramerization suggests that ligand binding and tetramerization may be linked. Because tetramerization and DNA binding are also connected, the proximity of the signal-binding and tetramerization domains revealed in the crystal structure may provide the link between signal binding and DNA binding. Based on the structural data, we can propose the following mechanism for TM-IclR-mediated gene regulation. We suggest that TM-IclR binds weakly to DNA as a dimer in the absence of signal molecule. In the presence of two adjacent binding sites, IclR cooperatively forms a high-affinity, stable tetrameric complex that represses transcription. In the presence of the signal molecule, whose identity at present remains unknown, binding to the specific site leads to a disruption of the tetramer, decreased affinity for DNA, and increased transcription. This hypothesis is consistent with published data, in which it has been shown that the binding of ligands to IclR inhibits DNA binding. For example, the formation of the IclR-DNA complex is inhibited by the binding of phosphoenol pyruvate, one of the metabolites involved in glyoxylate bypass (29Cortay J.C. Negre D. Galinier A. Duclos B. Perriere G. Cozzone A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Glyoxylate bypass occurs when acetate becomes the sole source of carbon. The enzymes in the glyoxylate pathway are encoded by the aceBAK operon, which is also under IclR control. There is also some evidence that IclR-mediated gene regulation can be further modulated by the level of IclR expression (30Gui L. Sunnarborg A. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4704-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could affect equilibrium between dimers and tetramers.

The prototypic isozyme, sPLA2-IIA, binds very poorly to zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) and thereby acts poorly on the PC-rich external leaflet of the plasma membrane of resting cells (41Koduri R.S.

In activated cells, however, this enzyme is sorted into the caveolin-rich vesicular and perinuclear compartments during its secretion and internalization processes through the association with glypican, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). After proper sorting, the enzyme releases AA from the rearranged membrane microdomains that may be rich in anionic or oxidized phospholipids (14Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Yamamoto S. Kuwata H.

Conversely, HSPGs can also exert a negative regulatory effect on these heparin-binding sPLA2s by facilitating their internalization and degradation in some instances (47Kim K.P. Rafter J.D.

In the present study, we have examined the regulation of AA release and eicosanoid biosynthesis by sPLA2-IIF, the newest member of the group II subfamily of sPLA2s. Our results reveal that the modes of action of sPLA2-IIF share some features of those of other group II subfamily sPLA2s and sPLA2-X, but sPLA2-IIF displays some novel features. The expression of sPLA2-IIF is elevated in various tissues during inflammatory responses in vivo, suggesting that, as has been proposed for other group II subfamily sPLA2s, sPLA2-IIF may play a role in inflammation.

Previous studies have revealed that arrestins themselves are also subject to regulation. In the present study, we focused on identifying potential mechanisms involved in regulating the function of arrestin-3. Using metabolic labeling, phosphoamino acid analysis, and mutagenesis studies, we found that arrestin-3 is constitutively phosphorylated at Thr-382 and becomes dephosphorylated upon β2-adrenergic receptor activation in COS-1 cells. Casein kinase II (CKII) appears to be the major kinase mediating arrestin-3 phosphorylation, since 1) Thr-382 is contained within a canonical consensus sequence for CKII phosphorylation and 2) wild type arrestin-3 but not a T382A mutant is phosphorylated by CKII in vitro. Functional analysis reveals that mutants mimicking the phosphorylated (T382E) and dephosphorylated (T382A or T382V) states of arrestin-3 promote β2-adrenergic receptor internalization and bind clathrin, β-adaptin, and Src to comparable levels as wild type arrestin-3. This suggests that the phosphorylation of arrestin-3 does not directly regulate interaction with endocytic (clathrin, β-adaptin) or signaling (Src) components and is in contrast to arrestin-2, where phosphorylation appears to regulate interaction with clathrin and Src. However, additional analysis reveals that arrestin-3 phosphorylation may regulate formation of a large arrestin-3-containing protein complex. Differences between the regulatory roles of arrestin-2 and -3 phosphorylation may contribute to the different cellular functions of these proteins in G protein-coupled receptor signaling and regulation.

Arrestins were initially described to attenuate or arrest intracellular signaling of GPCRs such as rhodopsin and β2AR. In the continuous presence of a stimulus, many cellular receptors lose their responsiveness to stimuli through a process known as desensitization. Desensitization of GPCRs is largely mediated by two protein families, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins. GRKs specifically phosphorylate agonist-activated receptors. Subsequently, arrestins translocate from the cytosol and bind to plasma membrane-localized phosphorylated receptors. Binding of arrestin to the intracellular surface of receptors physically blocks interaction of the receptor with its cognate heterotrimeric G protein, thus terminating signal transduction.

The prototypical arrestin, arrestin-1 (visual arrestin), regulates light-dependent signal transduction of rhodopsin in rod photoreceptor cells (3.Yamaki K. Takahashi Y. Sakuragi S. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Another retina-specific arrestin, arrestin-4 (cone arrestin or X-arrestin), is enriched in cone photoreceptor cells but has not been further characterized (4.Murakami A. Yajima T. Sakuma H. McLaren M.J. Inana G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The nonvisual arrestins, arrestin-2 (β-arrestin-1) and arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2), are expressed ubiquitously and are involved in desensitization of numerous GPCRs (1.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 5.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Nonvisual arrestins have also been demonstrated to mediate internalization (endocytosis) of various GPCRs. Both arrestin-2 and-3 directly bind clathrin and AP2, the two major structural components of the clathrin-based endocytic machinery (7.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). By doing so, they target receptors to clathrin-coated pits and promote receptor internalization. Nonvisual arrestins additionally mediate interaction with the GDP-bound form of ADP-ribosylation factor-6, a plasma membrane-specific regulator of endocytic membrane trafficking, and with ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide binding site opener, an ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor (9.Claing A.

Arrestin-2 also interacts withN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), an ATPase that binds to SNARE complexes and plays an essential role in membrane trafficking (10.McDonald P.H. Cote N.L.

The interaction of nonvisual arrestins with various proteins involved in protein trafficking supports an important functional role for arrestins in receptor internalization. Recently, arrestins have been shown to play a role not only in “negative” regulation of GPCRs but also in transmitting “positive” signals from receptors via interaction of arrestins with Src family tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (11.Luttrell L.M.

In the case of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 interaction, arrestin-3 also directly binds the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases Raf-1 and ASK1, respectively, thereby serving as a scaffolding molecule and mediating GPCR-stimulated activation of the specific mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (15.McDonald P.H.

Despite numerous studies suggesting an essential role of arrestins in GPCR regulation, the detailed mechanism underlying the function of arrestins and receptor-mediated modulation of arrestin activity is unclear. However, several reports on arrestin phosphorylation provide some insight into potential regulation of arrestin function. Studies with Drosophila visual arrestin-2 demonstrate that it undergoes light-dependent phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and that phosphorylation is necessary for dissociation of arrestin from rhodopsin (18.Matsumoto H. Kurien B.T. Takagi Y. Kahn E.S. Kinumi T. Komori N. Yamada T. Hayashi F. Isono K. Pak W.L. Jackson K.W. Tobin S.L.

In comparison, mammalian arrestin-2 was reported to be constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-412 by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and become dephosphorylated following β2AR stimulation (20.Lin F.T.

Arrestin-2 phosphorylation was proposed to regulate the interaction of arrestin with clathrin and Src, since a S412D mutant mimicking phosphorylated arrestin-2 had reduced binding to these proteins (11.Luttrell L.M.

Notably, arrestin-3 shares ∼80% amino acid identity with arrestin-2 but does not contain the corresponding serine residue. Thus, arrestin-3 might be phosphorylated at other sites or perhaps be regulated by different mechanisms. Here, we report that arrestin-3 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II at Thr-382 and that arrestin-3 phosphorylation may regulate its interaction with novel binding partners. pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR, arr2, arr3, arr3-(1–360), arr3-(1–370), arr3-(201–409), and arr3-(284–409) plasmids were previously described (22.Krupnick J.G.

Other mutant arrestin-3 constructs were generated by two-step polymerase chain reaction using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using pcDNA3-arr3 as template. First, an N-terminal fragment of the mutant was created using a sense primer, arr22 (5′-tcagcaacaaccgggaga-3′), and a mutagenic antisense primer. A C-terminal fragment of the mutant was generated using a mutagenic sense primer and an antisense primer, pcDNA3-rev (5′-caacagatggctggcaac-3′). The mutagenic primers used were as follows: S337A, sense (5′-ggcggggacgtcgcagtggagctgcc-3′) and antisense (5′-ggcagctccactgcgacgtccccgcc-3′); S360A/T365A, sense (5′-ccttcccaggccccaggcagctgttcctgaagcagatgcccccgtgg-3′) and antisense (5′-ccacgggggcatctgcttcaggaacagctgcctggggcctgggaagg-3′); T382A, sense (5′-ccaactatgccgcagacgacgacatcg-3′) and antisense 5′-cgatgtcgtcgtctgcggcatagttgg-3′; T382V, sense (5′-actatgccgtagacgacgacga-3′) and antisense (5′-tcgtcgtctacggcatagt-3′; T382E, sense (5′-ccaactatgccgaagacgacgacatcg-3′) and antisense (5′-cgatgtcgtcgtcttcggcatagttgg-3′. The mutation site in each primer is underlined. After purification of the PCR products, 50 ng each of N- and C-terminal fragments were used as template for a second round of PCR amplification with arr22 and pcDNA3-rev primers. PCR products were digested with XhoI, purified, and ligated into XhoI-digested and phosphatase-treated pcDNA3-arr3. Mutations were confirmed by dideoxy dye termination sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Thomas Jefferson University). COS-1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was done with Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. COS-1 cells transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR, pcDNA3-arr2, or pcDNA3-arr3 constructs were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min and labeled for 2 h in the same medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For β2AR stimulation, 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol was added to the labeling medium 15 min before the end of labeling. Cells were then washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and harvested for immunoprecipitation of arrestins. COS-1 cells grown on 60-mm dishes, labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and incubated with or without isoproterenol were washed with TBS twice, incubated with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A in TBS on ice for 20 min, and scraped into 3 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then lysed using a Dounce homogenizer (15 strokes), and unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. A crude plasma membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 3000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was then suspended in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors). The 3000 × g supernatant was then centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet (vesicle membrane fraction) was dissolved in 1 ml of IP buffer. The remaining supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was diluted with an equal volume of IP buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. The protein concentration of the three subcellular fractions was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). COS-1 cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were washed with ice-cold TBS twice and lysed in 1 ml of IP buffer. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 20 min. The cell lysate or various subcellular fractions were precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Arrestin-2 or -3 proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating with purified polyclonal antibodies, KEE and 182, respectively, for 2 h and subsequently with protein A-agarose for an additional 2 h. KEE is a highly specific anti-arrestin-2 antibody generated against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of arrestin-2 (KEEEEDGTGSPRLNDR) (24.Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

After washing with IP buffer four times, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (DuPont). The membrane was then exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C, and phosphorylation of arrestins was determined by autoradiography. The total amount of immunoprecipitated arrestins was detected by probing a comparable membrane with monoclonal antibody F4C1, an antibody that detects an epitope common to all mammalian arrestins (25.Dua H.S.

Eye Res. 1992; 11: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Metabolically radiolabeled and immunoprecipitated arrestins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The arrestin bands were excised, washed successively with methanol and water, eluted, and digested with 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The samples were lyophilized, dissolved in 3 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then spotted on a 20 × 20-cm silica gel plate (Eastman Kodak Co.) along with phosphoamino acid standards. The amino acids were separated by thin layer chromatography (isopropyl alcohol/HCl/water = 7:1.5:1.5) for 5 h. Phosphoamino acid standards were developed using 0.2% ninhydrin solution spray (Sigma), and [32P]phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. One microgram of purified arrestin-3 was incubated with 0.1 μm casein kinase I (CKI), casein kinase II (CKII), GRK2, or GRK5 in 20 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 6× SDS-sample buffer, and the samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. CKI and CKII were purchased from New England Biolabs, and GRK2 and GRK5 were purified from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. For in vitro phosphorylation of arrestins in COS-1 extracts, cells overexpressing wild type or T382A mutant arrestin-3 proteins were harvested in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors) and ruptured by freezing and thawing. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 20 min. Cell extracts (60 μg of protein) were then incubated with or without 0.05 μm CKII in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ- 32P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped on ice, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. Arrestins were immunoprecipitated as described above, and the phosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography. Visualization of arr3-GFP fusion protein was performed as previously described (26.Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells containing stably expressed β2AR and transiently expressed arr3-GFP, arr3(T382V)-GFP, or arr3(T382E)-GFP were plated on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes. Two hours before analysis, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LM-510) using a heated (37 °C) microscope stage as described (27.Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Internalization of FLAG-β2AR was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (28.Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR and various arrestin constructs were split into poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates after 24 h. The next day (48 h post-transfection), cells were treated with 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol and 0.1 mm ascorbate at 37 °C for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 30 min, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in TBS for 5 min at ambient temperature, and washed three times with TBS. Cells were then blocked with TBS containing 1% BSA (TBS/BSA) for 45 min, incubated with a primary antibody (M1 (Sigma), 1:1000 dilution in TBS/BSA) for 1 h, washed three times with TBS, blocked again with TBS/BSA for 15 min, incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad), 1:1000 dilution in TBS/BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with TBS. Colorimetric visualization of antibody binding was performed using an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad), and samples were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader using Microplate Manager software (Bio-Rad). The reading from cells that did not express flag-β2AR was used as blank and subtracted. The percentage of surface receptor loss was determined by calculating the change of antibody-accessible FLAG-β2AR. Arrestin-3 constructs were transcribed and translatedin vitro using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, pcDNA3-arr3 (wild type, T382A, or T382E) were added to a reaction mixture containing TNT buffer, 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 mm amino acid mixture (without leucine), 1 μl of RNasin, 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and 5 μl of [3H]leucine (1 mCi/ml, 179 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and stopped by snap-freezing. To calculate incorporated radioactivity, 1 μl of reaction mix was spotted onto Whatman filter paper and then successively incubated in ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, boiling 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and 100% ethanol for 1 min. The precipitated materials were dissolved in 1% SDS and 50 mm NaOH, and radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter with scintillant. The in vitrotranslated proteins were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The clathrin cage binding assay has been described previously (7.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 nm of in vitro synthesized3H-labeled arrestins were incubated with or without 200 nm clathrin cages for 10 min at ambient temperature in a total volume of 50 μl in 100 mm Na-MES, pH 6.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine. Samples were then cooled on ice, loaded onto a 75-μl cushion of 0.2m sucrose in 100 mm Na-MES, pH 6.8, and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a TLA100.1 rotor for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were solubilized in 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, incubated with ENTENSIFY (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. After development, films were scanned with a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) to quantitate the amount of radiolabeled arrestins that were co-sedimented with clathrin cages. The percentage of bound arrestin was calculated by comparing the signal from the co-sedimented arrestins to a set of arrestin standards. Binding of in vitro translated arrestins to clathrin-coated vesicles (CVs) was done in the same manner as the clathrin cage binding assay using 50 nm CVs (50 nm clathrin trimers). Clathrin cages and CVs were generously provided by Dr. James H. Keen (Thomas Jefferson University). GST or GST-β2-adaptin (residues 700–937) fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(De3)pLysS cells and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. Five micrograms of purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with 10 μg of COS-1 cell lysates containing overexpressed arrestin-3, arr3(T382V), or arr3(T382E) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C (in a total volume of 100 μl). The beads were then washed twice with 500 μl of binding buffer, and bound arrestins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by immunoblotting using purified rabbit polyclonal anti-arrestin-3 antibody 182. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR and various pcDNA3-arrestin-3 constructs were stimulated with 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol for 2 min at 37 °C and then lysed in 1 ml of coimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of purified polyclonal anti-arrestin-3 antibody 182 for 1 h followed by incubation with protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate arrestin-3. Immunocomplexes were then extensively washed with coimmunoprecipitation buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Coimmunoprecipitated endogenous β-adaptin and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-C) were detected with an anti-β-adaptin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and a monoclonal antibody against PP2A-C (generously provided by Dr. Brian Hemmings), respectively. For coimmunoprecipitation with Src, pcDNA3-Src was co-transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR and pcDNA3-arrestin-3. COS-1 cells were then stimulated for 5 min with (−)-isoproterenol, and Src was detected using anti-Src monoclonal antibody GD11 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). pcDNA3-arr3, arr3(T382A), or arr3(T382E) was transfect"

The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, which act as co-receptors along with CD4 for HIV docking and entry, are down-modulated by their respective ligands, MIP-1β/SDF-1α or by the HIV envelope protein, gp120. We have studied the role of the proteasome pathway in the down-regulation of these receptors. Using the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, we observed that the CCR5 receptor is constitutively associated with the ζ subunit of proteasome. Immunoprecipitation studies in CCR5 L1.2 cells revealed that this association was increased with MIP-1β stimulation. The proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and epoxomicin, attenuated MIP-1β induced CCR5 down-modulation as detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and confocal microscopy. The proteasome inhibitors also inhibited the SDF-1α and gp120 protein-induced down-modulation of the CXCR4 receptor in Jurkat cells. However, the inhibitors had no significant effect on the gp120-induced internalization of the CD4 receptor. These inhibitors also blocked cognate ligand-mediated chemotaxis but had no effect on SDF-1α-induced p44/42 MAP kinase or MIP-1β-induced p38 kinase activities, thus indicating differential effects of the inhibitors on signaling mediated by these receptors. These results indicate that the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor down-modulation mechanism and chemotaxis mediated by these receptors are dependent upon proteasome activity.

It has been demonstrated that the ligand-induced endocytosis of CCR5 and CXCR4 plays an important role in inhibiting HIV entry into the cells (20Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,21Signoret N.

Furthermore, effective anti-HIV activity of the chemically modified form of the CC chemokines correlates with the ability of these ligands to induce irreversible and efficient down-regulation of CCR5 (20Mack M.

Receptor phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been shown to regulate CXCR4 receptor internalization (22Su S.B. Gong W. Grimm M. Utsunomiya I. Sargeant R. Oppenheim J.J.

Recently, a degradation motif was identified in the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 (26Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Moreover, the agonist-mediated ubiquitination of the CXCR4 receptor was observed to be blocked when the lysine residues in this degradation motif were mutated. In the present studies, we further delineate the signaling pathway that regulates CXCR4 and CCR5 down-modulation induced by cognate ligands and the HIV envelope protein gp120. We have observed that the proteasome pathway plays a major role in the down-modulation of these receptors.Proteasomes have been shown to play an important role in regulating the levels of several cell surface receptors including the interleukin-2 receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (27Yu A. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 381-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol.

Proteasomes are also essential for the production of peptides for MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I antigen presentation (30Androlewicz M.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, proteasomes have also been implicated as controlling the level of certain transcriptional factors and cell cycle regulatory proteins (31Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 32Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It has been shown that proteasome inhibitors blocked interference with HIV gag polypeptide processing and decreased the infectivity and release of secreted virions (33Schubert U. Ott D.E. Chertova E.N. Welker R. Tessmer U. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Krausslich H.G. Yewdell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). HIV-1 encoded Env and Vpu protein-mediated degradation of the CD4 receptor are also dependent on proteasomes (34Fujita K. Omura S. Silver J. J. Gen.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because proteasomes play a major role in viral processing, we thought it interesting to determine whether the proteasome pathway also regulates HIV co-receptor expression. Moreover, it was of interest to find out whether the proteasome pathway also regulates chemotaxis mediated by these receptors. Our present work suggests that chemokine CXCR4 and CCR5 receptor down-modulations are indeed regulated by the proteasomal pathway. Furthermore, our studies have also shown that the proteasome pathway also regulates CXCR4 and CCR5-mediated chemotaxis but has no effect on MAP kinases induced by these receptors.DISCUSSIONCCR5 and CXCR4 receptor interaction with the HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 triggers molecular events that eventually result in HIV infection. It has been shown that gp120 can induce rapid internalization of these receptors (40Wang J.M. Ueda H. Howard O.M. Grimm M.C. Chertov O. Gong X. Gong W. Resau J.H. Broder C.C. Evans G. Arthur L.O.

Furthermore, the cognate ligands of CCR5 (MIP-1β or RANTES) and of CXCR4 (SDF-1α) can efficiently block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 or CXCR4 (13Townson J.R. Graham G.J. Landau N.R. Rasala B.

Therefore, information about the mechanism of CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor internalization by HIV gp120 or upon stimulation with chemokine ligands is important for the development of anti-viral strategies. In this study, we have shown that the proteasome pathway plays an important role in ligand- and gp120-mediated CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor internalization.Recent studies have shown that the cytoplasmic tail of the CCR5 receptor is involved in receptor trafficking (43Shioda T. Nakayama E.E. Tanaka Y. Xin X. Liu H. Kawana-Tachikawa A. Kato A. Sakai Y. Nagai Y. Iwamoto A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Shoida et al. (43Shioda T. Nakayama E.E. Tanaka Y. Xin X. Liu H. Kawana-Tachikawa A. Kato A. Sakai Y. Nagai Y. Iwamoto A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that a natural variant of CCR5 that lacked the C-terminal was impaired for surface expression. Similarly, complete removal of the cytoplasmic tail of CCR5 almost completely abolished trafficking to the cell surface. The naturally occurring CCR5 mutant, CCR5Δ32, which has a 32-bp deletion in the second extracellular loop, reduced the cell surface expression of CCR5 in a gene dose-dependent manner (44Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Van Ryk D.I. Locati M. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2287-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of the CCR5 receptor harbors a highly basic domain and a cysteine cluster. This motif was observed to be critical for the cell surface expression of CCR5 (45Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further analyze the role of this domain for ligand- and gp120-mediated signal transduction and receptor internalization, we used the yeast two-hybrid approach to identify the proteins that interact with the CCR5 cytoplasmic tail.

Recently, a degradation motif was identified in the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 (26Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Moreover, the agonist-mediated ubiquitination of the CXCR4 receptor was observed to be blocked when the lysine residues in this degradation motif were mutated. In the present studies, we further delineate the signaling pathway that regulates CXCR4 and CCR5 down-modulation induced by cognate ligands and the HIV envelope protein gp120. We have observed that the proteasome pathway plays a major role in the down-modulation of these receptors. Proteasomes have been shown to play an important role in regulating the levels of several cell surface receptors including the interleukin-2 receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (27Yu A. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 381-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol.

Proteasomes are also essential for the production of peptides for MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I antigen presentation (30Androlewicz M.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2001; 8: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, proteasomes have also been implicated as controlling the level of certain transcriptional factors and cell cycle regulatory proteins (31Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 32Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It has been shown that proteasome inhibitors blocked interference with HIV gag polypeptide processing and decreased the infectivity and release of secreted virions (33Schubert U. Ott D.E. Chertova E.N. Welker R. Tessmer U. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Krausslich H.G. Yewdell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). HIV-1 encoded Env and Vpu protein-mediated degradation of the CD4 receptor are also dependent on proteasomes (34Fujita K. Omura S. Silver J. J. Gen.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because proteasomes play a major role in viral processing, we thought it interesting to determine whether the proteasome pathway also regulates HIV co-receptor expression. Moreover, it was of interest to find out whether the proteasome pathway also regulates chemotaxis mediated by these receptors. Our present work suggests that chemokine CXCR4 and CCR5 receptor down-modulations are indeed regulated by the proteasomal pathway. Furthermore, our studies have also shown that the proteasome pathway also regulates CXCR4 and CCR5-mediated chemotaxis but has no effect on MAP kinases induced by these receptors. DISCUSSIONCCR5 and CXCR4 receptor interaction with the HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 triggers molecular events that eventually result in HIV infection. It has been shown that gp120 can induce rapid internalization of these receptors (40Wang J.M. Ueda H. Howard O.M. Grimm M.C. Chertov O. Gong X. Gong W. Resau J.H. Broder C.C. Evans G. Arthur L.O.

Furthermore, the cognate ligands of CCR5 (MIP-1β or RANTES) and of CXCR4 (SDF-1α) can efficiently block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 or CXCR4 (13Townson J.R. Graham G.J. Landau N.R. Rasala B.

Therefore, information about the mechanism of CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor internalization by HIV gp120 or upon stimulation with chemokine ligands is important for the development of anti-viral strategies. In this study, we have shown that the proteasome pathway plays an important role in ligand- and gp120-mediated CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor internalization.Recent studies have shown that the cytoplasmic tail of the CCR5 receptor is involved in receptor trafficking (43Shioda T.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that a natural variant of CCR5 that lacked the C-terminal was impaired for surface expression. Similarly, complete removal of the cytoplasmic tail of CCR5 almost completely abolished trafficking to the cell surface. The naturally occurring CCR5 mutant, CCR5Δ32, which has a 32-bp deletion in the second extracellular loop, reduced the cell surface expression of CCR5 in a gene dose-dependent manner (44Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Van Ryk D.I. Locati M. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2287-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of the CCR5 receptor harbors a highly basic domain and a cysteine cluster. This motif was observed to be critical for the cell surface expression of CCR5 (45Venkatesan S.

To further analyze the role of this domain for ligand- and gp120-mediated signal transduction and receptor internalization, we used the yeast two-hybrid approach to identify the proteins that interact with the CCR5 cytoplasmic tail. We observed a physical interaction between the CCR5 cytoplasmic tail and ζ, an α subtype of the 20 S catalytic particle of the 26 S proteasome. We further confirmed this association by using the mammalian two-hybrid system and under in vitro conditions by co-immunoprecipitation. The observed association was enhanced by MIP-1β stimulation.

Furthermore, the cognate ligands of CCR5 (MIP-1β or RANTES) and of CXCR4 (SDF-1α) can efficiently block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 or CXCR4 (13Townson J.R. Graham G.J. Landau N.R. Rasala B.

Therefore, information about the mechanism of CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor internalization by HIV gp120 or upon stimulation with chemokine ligands is important for the development of anti-viral strategies. In this study, we have shown that the proteasome pathway plays an important role in ligand- and gp120-mediated CCR5 and CXCR4 receptor internalization. Recent studies have shown that the cytoplasmic tail of the CCR5 receptor is involved in receptor trafficking (43Shioda T. Nakayama E.E. Tanaka Y. Xin X. Liu H. Kawana-Tachikawa A. Kato A. Sakai Y. Nagai Y. Iwamoto A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Shoida et al. (43Shioda T. Nakayama E.E. Tanaka Y. Xin X. Liu H. Kawana-Tachikawa A. Kato A. Sakai Y. Nagai Y. Iwamoto A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that a natural variant of CCR5 that lacked the C-terminal was impaired for surface expression. Similarly, complete removal of the cytoplasmic tail of CCR5 almost completely abolished trafficking to the cell surface. The naturally occurring CCR5 mutant, CCR5Δ32, which has a 32-bp deletion in the second extracellular loop, reduced the cell surface expression of CCR5 in a gene dose-dependent manner (44Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Van Ryk D.I. Locati M. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2287-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of the CCR5 receptor harbors a highly basic domain and a cysteine cluster. This motif was observed to be critical for the cell surface expression of CCR5 (45Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further analyze the role of this domain for ligand- and gp120-mediated signal transduction and receptor internalization, we used the yeast two-hybrid approach to identify the proteins that interact with the CCR5 cytoplasmic tail. We observed a physical interaction between the CCR5 cytoplasmic tail and ζ, an α subtype of the 20 S catalytic particle of the 26 S proteasome. We further confirmed this association by using the mammalian two-hybrid system and under in vitro conditions by co-immunoprecipitation. The observed association was enhanced by MIP-1β stimulation. Recently, the ζ subunit of proteasome was shown to associate with presenilin-1 (PSEN1) in the cells (46Van Gassen G., De Jonghe C. Pype S. Van Criekinge W. Julliams A. Vanderhoeven I. Woodrow S. Beyaert R. Huylebroeck D. Van Broeckhoven C. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 376-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Presenilin-1 has been shown to be degraded via the proteasome pathway during the development of Alzheimer's disease. Because 26 S proteasome is involved in the turnover of various cellular proteins (47Wojcik C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 48Driscoll J. Histol. Histopathol. 1994; 9: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar), we anticipated that the proteasome pathway might regulate CCR5 receptor trafficking. In the present studies, we used the specific proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and epoxomicin to explore the potential role of proteasomes in the endocytosis of the CCR5 receptor. Pretreatment of cells with these inhibitors completely prevented endocytosis of the CCR5 receptor. Further studies indicated that the proteasome pathway also regulates endocytosis of another co-receptor of HIV-1, CXCR4. Both ligand- and HIV gp120-induced down-modulation of the CXCR4 receptor was completely dependent on the proteasome pathway. However, gp120-induced endocytosis of the HIV receptor, CD4, was not significantly inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor pretreatments. Interestingly, the gp120-mediated down-modulation of the CXCR4 receptor was observed to be dependent on the CD4 receptor. Absence of the CD4 receptor prevented down-modulation of the CXCR4 receptor upon gp120 stimulation but not upon SDF-1α stimulation. These studies suggest that gp120-induced down-modulation of the CXCR4 and CD4 receptors may involve different mechanisms but that CXCR4 down-modulation induced by gp120 requires CD4. The proteasome pathway has previously been shown to play a major role in the ligand-mediated endocytosis of a variety of receptors (27Yu A. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 381-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol.

Recently, it was shown that the Ubiquitin/proteasome system also regulates HIV gag polypeptide processing and HIV-1-encoded Vpu protein-mediated degradation of the CD4 receptor (34Fujita K. Omura S. Silver J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been implicated as playing a role in CXCR4 lysosomal sorting and degradation (26Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CCR5Δ32 mutation has been shown to result in a product that never reaches the cell surface (44Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Van Ryk D.I. Locati M. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2287-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this could be the result of misfolding and consequent proteolytic degradation, perhaps by the proteasome. We also investigated the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the downstream functional effects mediated by the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors. We observed a reduction of about 80% in CCR5 and about 40–50% in CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis upon pretreatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitors. However, these compounds had no effect on CCR5-mediated p38 kinase and CXCR4-mediated MAP kinase activities. Proteasomes have been shown to regulate the activity of transcription factor NF-κB by degrading phosphorylated IκB (31Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). IκB acts as an inhibitor for the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. In our previous studies, we have shown that nitric oxide plays an important role in SDF-1α-induced and CXCR4-mediated chemotactic activity (36Ganju R.K. Dutt P., Wu, L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our studies have also shown that SDF-1α-induced MAP kinase activation is not dependent on the nitric oxide and NF-κB pathways. Proteasomes have also been shown to regulate chemotaxis mediated by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in oral squamous carcinoma cells (49Ikebe T. Takeuchi H. Jimi E. Beppu M. Shinohara M. Shirasuna K. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the degradation of IκB was also suppressed by proteasomes in tumor necrosis factor α-induced cells. These studies provide new information about the role of the proteasome pathway in regulating CCR5 and CXCR4 down-modulation induced by cognate ligands and HIV gp120. Proteasomes may also partially regulate CCR5- and CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. Both of these events are important in HIV infection and in other physiological and pathological processes.

https://openalex.org/W2038240598,"Tn 5 transposase (Tnp) is a 53.3-kDa protein that is encoded by and facilitates movement of transposon Tn 5. Tnp monomers contain a single active site that is responsible for catalyzing a series of four DNA breaking/joining reactions at one transposon end. Based on primary sequence homology and protein structural information, we designed and constructed a series of plasmids that encode for Tnps containing active site mutations. Following Tnp expression and purification, the active site mutants were tested for their ability to form protein-DNA complexes and perform each of the four catalytic steps in the transposition pathway in vitro. The results demonstrate that Asp-97, Asp-188, and Glu-326, visible in the active site of Tn 5 crystal structures, are absolutely required for all catalytic steps. Mutations within a series of amino acid residues that are conserved in the IS4 family of transposases and retroviral integrases also impair Tnp catalytic activity. Mutations at either Tyr-319 or Arg-322 reduce both hairpin resolution and strand transfer activity within protein-DNA complexes. Mutations at Lys-333 reduce the ability of Tnps to form protein-DNA complexes, whereas mutations at the less strongly conserved Lys-330 have less of an effect on both synaptic complex formation and catalytic activity.

Movement of the transposon occurs via a conservative transposition mechanism that involves the complete excision of the transposon from the donor DNA prior to insertion into a new location (Fig. 1). This excision from the donor and insertion into the target involves four catalytic steps at each end of the transposon (2Bhasin A. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 95: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These reactions take place within a protein-DNA complex termed a synaptic complex. The synaptic complex consists of two DNA end sequences and two molecules of transposase (4Bhasin A. Goryshin I.Y. Steiniger-White M. York D. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol.

Tnp is unable to promote catalytic reactions in the absence of a synaptic complex because the active site of the transposon monomer that binds to one end of the transposon is responsible for catalytic reactions on the other transposon end or in trans (5Davies D.R.

In both the initial 3′ nicking step and the hairpin resolution step, a water molecule acts as a nucleophile to hydrolyze a DNA–phosphate bond. In the hairpin formation and strand transfer steps, the 3′-hydroxyl group of the transferred strand end acts as a nucleophile.Within the active site is a triad of acidic residues termed the DDE motif. This motif is believed to occur in all transposase and retroviral integrase proteins. The function of this triad is to coordinate divalent metal ions that are required for catalysis (8Bujacz G.

Studies performed on HIV integrase have demonstrated that these two basic residues are important for catalytic activity and can be cross-linked to DNA ends (12Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The DDE glutamate residue and the second lysine in Tnp make up part of the YREK signature motif that is conserved at the primary sequence level among all members of the IS4 family of transposases (including Tn 5) (13Rezsohazy R.

It is still not clear, however, what role these residues play in catalysis and why their conservation has been absolute among related transposases that otherwise have little sequence identity.In vivo transposition of Tn 5 occurs at a very low frequency, probably because high rates of transposition would be detrimental to the survival of the cell. The low level of transposition is in part due to the very low level of activity in the protein. This low level of activity has been increased by point mutagenesis (19Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S.

A hyperactive transposase double mutant that contains the mutations E54K and L372P (EK/LP) is able to promote transposition of OE defined DNA segments in vitro. The transposition rate facilitated by Tnp EK/LP can further be increased by replacing the OE DNA end sequences with a 19-bp site termed mosaic end (ME). This end sequence is an artificially constructed end that differs from the OE at three positions and results in a 10–50-fold increase in transposition rate when used in conjunction with the E54K Tnp mutation (24Zhou M.

Alanine substitutions were introduced at seven evolutionarily conserved amino acids. Additionally, conservative amino acid mutations were constructed at three of these positions based on structural information. Following protein purification, the active site mutant Tnps were characterized by gel shift assays for defects in synaptic complex formation and subsequently tested for the ability to promote each of the four catalytic steps in the transposition pathway. Results show that Tyr-319 and Arg-322 are important for hairpin resolution and strand transfer, whereas Lys-333 is necessary for formation of synaptic complexes. Alanine substitutions at any of the DDE motif residues are catalytically inactive at all reaction steps without greatly impairing synaptic complex formation.

Some transposases and retroviral integrases contain a pair of lysine residues that follow the DDE glutamate (E XXXK XXK). Studies performed on HIV integrase have demonstrated that these two basic residues are important for catalytic activity and can be cross-linked to DNA ends (12Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The DDE glutamate residue and the second lysine in Tnp make up part of the YREK signature motif that is conserved at the primary sequence level among all members of the IS4 family of transposases (including Tn 5) (13Rezsohazy R. Hallet B. Delcour J. Mahillon J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1283-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).

It is still not clear, however, what role these residues play in catalysis and why their conservation has been absolute among related transposases that otherwise have little sequence identity. In vivo transposition of Tn 5 occurs at a very low frequency, probably because high rates of transposition would be detrimental to the survival of the cell. The low level of transposition is in part due to the very low level of activity in the protein. This low level of activity has been increased by point mutagenesis (19Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S.

A hyperactive transposase double mutant that contains the mutations E54K and L372P (EK/LP) is able to promote transposition of OE defined DNA segments in vitro. The transposition rate facilitated by Tnp EK/LP can further be increased by replacing the OE DNA end sequences with a 19-bp site termed mosaic end (ME). This end sequence is an artificially constructed end that differs from the OE at three positions and results in a 10–50-fold increase in transposition rate when used in conjunction with the E54K Tnp mutation (24Zhou M.

In this paper we describe the analysis of mutant Tnps that contain the hyperactive mutations E54K and L372P as well as an additional amino acid change in the active site. Alanine substitutions were introduced at seven evolutionarily conserved amino acids. Additionally, conservative amino acid mutations were constructed at three of these positions based on structural information. Following protein purification, the active site mutant Tnps were characterized by gel shift assays for defects in synaptic complex formation and subsequently tested for the ability to promote each of the four catalytic steps in the transposition pathway. Results show that Tyr-319 and Arg-322 are important for hairpin resolution and strand transfer, whereas Lys-333 is necessary for formation of synaptic complexes. Alanine substitutions at any of the DDE motif residues are catalytically inactive at all reaction steps without greatly impairing synaptic complex formation.

https://openalex.org/W2018006181,"In cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels, binding of cGMP or cAMP drives a conformational change that leads to opening of an ion-conducting pore. One region implicated in the coupling of ligand binding to opening of the pore is the C linker region. Here, we used crosslinking of endogenous cysteines to study interregion proximity. We demonstrate that an individual amino acid--C481--in the C linker region of each of two neighboring subunits can form a disulfide bond. Further, using tandem dimers, we show that a disulfide bond between C35 in the N-terminal region and C481 in the C linker region can form either within a subunit or between subunits. From our data on proximity between individual amino acids and previous studies, a picture emerges of the C linker as a potential dimerization interface."

F1-catalyzed synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi is coupled with proton translocation through Fo, which resides in the membrane. F1 part can be separated from Fo part as a water-soluble ATPase that has subunit composition α3β3γδε and hence is often called F1-ATPase. Catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are located on the β subunits, whereas the α subunits contain noncatalytic nucleotide-binding sites. In the crystal structure of the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (MF1),1 the coiled-coil structure of the γ subunit is surrounded by a semi-hexagonal ring of α3β3 (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). F1-ATPase is a rotary motor enzyme; ATP-dependent rotation of the γ subunit relative to the α3β3 ring, as predicted by biochemical studies (2Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Kinosita K., Jr. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of three β subunits in the ring, hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule drives a 120° rotation of the γ subunit (6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K., Jr. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). It is intriguing how the local conformational changes accompanied by each of reaction steps in the catalytic cycle, such as ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release of ADP and Pi, are amplified and transformed into the force to dislocate the γ subunit. Recent progress shows that each 120° rotation is further divided into a 90° substep that is driven by ATP binding and a 30° substep presumably driven by the release of the product, most likely ADP (7Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K.Jr. Ito H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding induces a large conformational change of the β subunit (8Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Each of the three β subunits in the initial MF1 structure, which was disclosed in 1994 (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar), takes one of the two conformations: an “open” form in which catalytic site is empty or a “closed” form in which the catalytic site is occupied by AMP-PNP or ADP. Consistent with that, the β subunits of the crystal structure of the TF1 subcomplex α3β3 without bound nucleotides were all in the open form (9Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure. 1997; 5: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Compared with the open form, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the β subunit in the closed form swings ∼30° toward the amino-terminal domain so that the catalytic cleft located between two domains is closed. A nucleotide-induced transition from the open to the closed conformation is inherent in the nature of the β subunit, because even the isolated β subunit undergoes the open-close motion responding to nucleotide binding (10Tozawa K. Sekino N. Soga M. Yagi H. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the coordinated open-to-closed and closed-to-open motions of the β subunits in F1-ATPase accompanied by ATP binding and ADP release drive 90° and 30° rotations of the γ subunit, respectively. In contrast to the nucleotide-dependent open-close motion, the conformational events of the β subunit at the steps of hydrolysis of ATP and release of Pi are unclear. In the case of other ATP-driven motor proteins, myosin and kinesin, the structures of the ATP-bound form and the ADP-bound form are different (12Kikkawa M. Sablin E.P. Okada Y. Yajima H. Fletterick R.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2001; 411: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and Pi release is assumed to be the step of power stroke (14Suzuki Y. Yasunaga T. Ohkura R. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Nature. 1998; 396: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,15Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The initial structure of MF1, however, shows that the ADP-bound β subunit and the AMP-PNP-bound β subunit are in a very similar, closed conformation. Therefore, it appears that the loss of Pi from the catalytic site does not cause significant conformational changes or that the intermediate species of the enzyme generated upon Pi release is too unstable to form crystals even though its conformation is different from the known structures. Indeed, a third conformation of the β subunit was reported recently (16Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); one of the β subunits in the AlF4−-inhibited MF1 exists in a “half-closed” conformation, the catalytic site of which is occupied by ADP and sulfate in mimicry of Pi. Biochemical studies on the kinetics of Pi release and the related conformational changes are few, mainly because of the absence of methods to monitor Pi release from F1-ATPase. The present work has aimed at real time monitoring of conformational changes of the β subunit caused by Pi release. Some Trp residues introduced into the β subunits of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase were reported to confer different fluorescence between AMP-PNP binding and ADP binding (17Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12042-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled γ subunit was also reported to change its conformations upon ATP cleavage (20Turina P. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13465-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14275-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of them reported fluorescence changes of the β subunit caused by Pi release by time-resolved measurements. We have sought for new positions for the Trp mutation that can monitor changes of fluorescence upon Pi release. Concurrently for that purpose, we have adopted the Pi-binding protein that enabled real time monitoring of Pi release from the enzyme. Analyses, including kinetic comparison of fluorescence changes and Pi release after addition of ATP, have established that a Trp introduced at position 333 (R333W) reflects Pi release well. The residue 333 of the β subunit, located in helix H, which interacts with the “switch II loop,” appears to sense γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide and changes its conformation upon loss of Pi from the catalytic site. Nucleotides were purchased from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mop reagents 7-methylguanosine and purine nucleotide phosphorylase were purchased from Sigma. The fluorescent probe for phosphate-binding protein, [2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC) was purchased from Molecular Probes. The buffers used in the measurements are abbreviated as follows: TK buffer, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl; TKM2 buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2; TKM4 buffer, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2; KPi buffer, 100 mmKPi, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmEDTA; NaPi buffer, 100 mmNaPi, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl; and reverse phase buffer: 100 mm NaPi, pH 6.9, 4 mmEDTA. Unless otherwise indicated, TKM2 buffer was used for measurements. To eliminate contaminated Pi from buffers, TKM and TK buffers for PBP assays contain 200 μm7-methylguanosine and 0.01 unit/ml purine nucleotide phosphorylase (named Pi mop) (22Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). E. coli strain JM109 was used for plasmid amplification. JM103Δ(uncB-uncD) was used for overexpression of the α, β, and γ subunits of F1-ATPase. Plasmids used were pucβ, which carried a gene for the β subunit, for mutagenesis and expression, and pkkαγ, which carried genes for the α and γ subunits, for expression. The βR333W and βD311W mutations into the β subunit were introduced by the Kunkel method (24Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) using primer oligonucleotides annealed to the single strand DNA of pucβ: 5′-GATAAATCCCCATCTCCGCAAGCTTCCACTCCAGGTTCGTC-3′ for βR333W introducing cleavage site of HindIII and 5′-CGTCGTGGCCGGAGCCGGATCCGTATAGTCCCAGGCCGGGACGTAAATC-3′ for βD311W introducing cleavage site of BamHI (mutated bases are underlined). For preparation of the isolated β(R333W) and α3β(D311W)3γ, mutated plasmids were transformed into JM103Δ(uncB-uncD) for overexpression and purified using NaPi buffer as previously described (25Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because α3β(R333W)3γ and α3β(D311W/R333W)3γ could not be expressed using the pkkαγβ system, a novel lysate reassembly method was developed. The plasmids pkkαγ, pucβ(R333W), and pucβ(D311W/R333W) were each expressed separately in JM103Δ(uncB-uncD). Pellets from centrifugation of the cultures were diluted in NaPi buffer. The cells containing mutated β subunits were each mixed with those containing the α and γ subunits. The mixture was disrupted by a French pressure cell and was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min for reassembly of the subcomplex. It was then incubated at 60 °C for 15 min, and the insoluble denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 40,000 rpm. Purification of the subcomplexes were performed by ammonium sulfate gradient in NaPi buffer using a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (Tosoh). The purified β subunit and subcomplexes were stored as ammonium sulfate precipitates. They were diluted in TK buffer, concentrated by Vivaspin (Sartorius), and applied twice to a gel filtration (Superdex 200; Amersham Biosciences) for final purification (flow was 0.5 ml/min first with TK buffer and second with KPi buffer) on the day of measurements. Analysis of residual nucleotides after purification of the enzyme was performed as previously described (26Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of residual nucleotides bound to α3β(R333W)3γ was less than 0.1 mol/mol after gel filtration with KPi buffer and TK buffer. The number of nucleotides bound to α3β(R333W)3γ at the end points of the fluorescence measurements was estimated by the following protocol. The mixtures of nucleotides and α3β(R333W)3γ from stopped flow measurements were each applied to an Ultrafree filtration device (molecular weight, 5 k cutoff; Millipore). After centrifugation for 2 min at 2 kilorounds per minute at 25 °C, the nucleotide contents in 100 μl of the filtrates were quantified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (ODS-80Ts; Tosoh) using reverse phase buffer. The amount of nucleotides bound to α3β(R333W)3γ was estimated by subtracting the concentration of the nucleotides free in solution (concentration in the filtrate) from the initial concentration. The fluorescence measurements of the Trp mutant subcomplexes and the isolated β(R333W) subunit were carried out by excitation at 295 nm, and detection of emission at 345 nm was carried out using a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500; Jasco). In a cuvette, 1.2 ml of 5 μm β(R333W) or 1 μm α3β3γ mutants was mixed with 20 μl of ATP or ADP while stirring. Measurements of α3β(R333W)3γ were carried out also by a stopped flow apparatus (SFM-400; BioLogic) using a xenon lamp as a source of light. ATP in TK buffer (30 μl of 1.0 or 0.5 or 0.25 μm) 2All the stopped flow measurements and bound nucleotide measurements were repeated with 75 μl of mixing shots to be sure that the effects of carry-over from the previous shots were minimum. The rate constants and the amount of bound nucleotides (except for AMP-PNP, 0.41 mol/mol in Table I) were essentially the same (± 5%) as those obtained with 30 μl/shot. was mixed with the same volume of 2 μmα3β(R333W)3γ in TKM4 buffer over 20 ms. The same method was applied to ADP, AMP-PNP, and ADPγS. TK buffer prevents ATP at submicromolar concentrations from decomposition into ADP and Pi before addition to α3β(R333W)3γ. The same stopped flow experiments were also performed using buffers that were treated with Pi mop to ensure that the buffer conditions were the same as those used for measurement of Pi release. There was no change in the Trp fluorescence profile between with and without Pi mop in solutions (data not shown). The unisite catalysis was measured using the stopped flow apparatus in the quenched flow mode. It was started by mixing 250 μl of 2 μmα3β(R333W)3γ with the same volume of 1 μm ATP and stopped after various time periods by perchloric acid quenching. Hydrolyzed nucleotides were analyzed by a reverse phase column (ODS-80Ts; Tosoh) using the reverse phase buffer as previously described (26Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of Pi from α3β(R333W)3γ was measured using a PBP assay (22Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PBP labeled with MDCC was prepared as previously described (22Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Binding of Pi to MDCC-labeled PBP (MDCC-PBP) increases the fluorescence emission at 464 nm when the complex is excited at 425 nm. By virtue of rapid binding of Pi to MDCC-PBP (kon = 1.36 × 108m−1 s−1) and high affinity of PBP for Pi (Kd = ∼0.1 μm) (22Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), the increase in the Piconcentration in the solutions could be monitored as the increase of fluorescence emission in real time. PBP assays were carried out using a stopped flow apparatus (SFM-400; BioLogic) under the same conditions as the Trp fluorescence measurements. 30 μl of 2 μmα3β(R333W)3γ in TKM4 buffer was mixed with the same volume of 4 μm MDCC-PBP and 1 μm ATP in TK buffer. The buffers contain Pimop for elimination of Pi to avoid saturation of MDCC-PBP with contaminated Pi. To estimate the rate of formation of the MgADP-inhibited form under the fluorescence measurement conditions, the following experiment was carried out. 20 μl of 11 μmα3β(R333W)3γ and 200 μl of 0.55 μm ATP were manually mixed and preincubated at 25 °C for varying periods of time. 150 μl of the incubated solution was injected into the ATP-regenerating system (27Matsui T.

The time course of ATP hydrolysis was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer (V-550; Jasco). The slope of the absorbance is initially small as the majority of the molecules are in the MgADP-inhibited form, but it gradually increases because of reactivation by binding of ATP to the α subunit (28Jault J.M.

Therefore, the ratio of active α3β(R333W)3γ was estimated from the initial slope of 10 s of absorbance at 340 nm compared with that without preincubation. The concentrations of β(R333W), α3β(R333W)3γ, α3β(D311W/R333W)3γ, and α3β(D311W)3γ were analyzed by BCA assay (Pierce) and absorbance at 280 nm. Data processing was performed by BioKine software (BioLogic), Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software), Excel 97 (Microsoft), and Dynafit (BioKin) (29Kuzmic P. Anal.

The initial crystal structure of MF1 suggests that Arg-333 in TF1-β (Arg-337 in MF1-β) in helix H interacts with Asp-311 in TF1-β (Asp-315 in MF1-β) of the switch II loop only when the β subunit is in the closed conformation (Fig. 1) (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). Ren et al. (30Ren H. Dou C. Stelzer M. Allison S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31366-31372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that cysteines introduced at positions 311 and 333 of TF1-β can readily form an intramolecular cross-link in two of the three β subunits in the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1. Cross-linking abolished ATPase activity almost completely by fixing two β subunits in the closed conformation. We introduced Trps into the same positions and examined the fluorescence response of the mutant, expecting to have enabled fluorescent detection of nucleotide-induced open-close motion of the β subunits. Trp fluorescence of 1 μm α3β(D311W/R333W)3γ subcomplex decreased when 0.5 μm ADP was added (Fig.2A). The fluorescent response to the same concentration of ATP was very different from that observed for ADP; a transient fluorescence increase was followed by rapid decay. The final level of fluorescence after decay was similar to that attained by ADP. Then, to determine which (or both) Trp was responsible for this transient fluorescence change, we made two single mutants, α3β(D311W)3γ and α3β(R333W)3γ. The fluorescence response of α3β(D311W)3γ to ADP was similar to that of ATP, that is, a similar extent of increase and no further rapid changes (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, fluorescence of α3β(R333W)3γ showed a two-phase response to ATP addition: transient increase and rapid decay (Fig.2C). The addition of ADP caused only a slight increase in fluorescence. The final level of fluorescence change by ATP was almost the same as that attained by ADP. It appeared that these two phases might represent certain steps in the catalysis occurring at a single catalytic site. Therefore, further fluorescence measurements were focused on α3β(R333W)3γ, using a stopped flow apparatus, which could provide higher time resolution than manual mixing. It should be added that the three mutants mentioned above retained ATPase activity of rotary catalysis at a saturating ATP concentration (2 mm): 140 turnovers/s (α3β (D311W/R333W)3γ), 29 turnovers/s (α3β(D311W)3γ), and 106 turnovers/s (α3β(R333W)3γ), which are 61, 13, and 46%, respectively, of that of the α3β3γ subcomplex without these mutations. Hereafter, we focus on the characteristics of α3β(R333W)3γ.FIG. 2Time courses of fluorescence changes of the Trp mutants. At the times indicated by arrowheads, ATP or ADP was manually mixed with α3β(D311W/R333W)3γ (A), α3β(D311W)3γ (B), and α3β(R333W)3γ (C). The concentrations of subcomplexes and nucleotides in the mixtures were 1 and 0.5 μm, respectively. The details of the experiments are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To understand whether the different fluorescence response of α3β(R333W)3γ to ATP or ADP is generated from intersubunit interaction in the subcomplex or from conformational changes within a β subunit, fluorescence response of the isolated β(R333W) subunit to ATP or ADP was examined. Because the isolated β subunit can bind nucleotide but does not retain catalytic ability (31Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3480-3485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nucleotide-induced change of Trp fluorescence of β(R333W) can be solely attributed to the nucleotide binding. The addition of ATP or ADP to the isolated β(R333W) caused an instantaneous increase in Trp fluorescence that was followed by a slow increase (∼30 s), and the fluorescence remained constant after saturation (Fig.3A). The reason for the slow increase is not known, but it is worth noting that the extent of the fluorescence increase by ATP is significantly larger than by ADP, just as observed for initial fluorescence increase of α3β(R333W)3γ. The Kdvalues for ATP and ADP estimated from fluorescence changes at various concentrations of nucleotide (Fig. 3B) are similar to each other: 20 μm for ATP and 27 μm for ADP, consistent with the values reported previously (32Odaka M. Kaibara C. Amano T. Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results suggest that conformational changes within a β subunit induced by AT(D)P binding can explain the initial increase of fluorescence observed for the α3β(R333W)3γ subcomplex. The different magnitude of fluorescence increase in response to ATP and ADP indicates that the Trp residue introduced at position 333 of the β subunit is able to sense the presence of γ-phosphate of the bound adenine nucleotides, and this ability is inherent in the β(R333W) subunit. For α3β(R333W)3γ, the initial increase in fluorescence by the addition of ATP was our initial focus (Fig.4). The addition of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, to α3β(R333W)3γ induced an increase in fluorescence that was similar to that observed for ATP, but no subsequent decay was observed (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the decay was not observed for binding of ATP in the absence of Mg, where hydrolysis was blocked (data not shown). Another ATP analog, ATPγS, which is a poor substrate for F1, also induced a similar fluorescence increase (Fig. 4A) that was followed by a slower decay. Taken together, we concluded that the initial fluorescence increase reflected the occupation of a catalytic site of the β subunit by ATP (step 1 of SchemeFS1). The rates of nucleotide binding calculated from the fluorescence changes of α3β(R333W)3γ were (1.7 ± 0.3) ×107m−1 s−1 for ATP, (4.1 ± 0.7) ×107m−1s−1 for ADP, (1.3 ± 0.0) ×106m−1 s−1 for AMP-PNP, and (2.8 ± 0.2) ×107m−1s−1 for ATPγS.SCHEME 1Reaction scheme of uni-site ATP hydrolysis by F1 ATPase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Decay of the fluorescence of α3β(R333W)3γ after the initial increase was observed under the conditions where unisite catalysis (33Grubmeyer C.

From the time courses of Trp fluorescence upon the addition of various nucleotides (Fig. 4A), it is assumed that ATP hydrolysis or an event that occurs immediately after that causes fluorescence decay. Typically, a slowly hydrolyzed ATP analog, ATPγS, causes slow decay. To test the assumption described above, the time course of generation of ADP (step 2 of Scheme FS1) was measured. α3β(R333W)3γ and ATP were mixed using a stopped flow apparatus under the same conditions as the fluorescence measurements, and the reactions were stopped after various periods of time by the addition of perchloric acid. Acid quenching liberates substrates from denatured enzymes. Therefore, irrespective of whether the substrate is released or still bound to the enzyme, the generation of ADP can be detected by this method. The generation of ADP occurred with the rate constant of 14.4 s−1 (Fig.5), which is greater than the rate of fluorescence decay (2.7 s−1; Fig. 4). Therefore, the cause of fluorescence decay can be assigned to a step after ATP hydrolysis such as Pi release and/or ADP release, etc. To determine which is the case, the release of ADP and Pi was examined. Analysis of the enzyme-bound nucleotides was carried out by sampling the mixtures of 1 μm α3β(R333W)3γ and 0.5 μm nucleotides from stopped flow fluorescence measurements and applying them each to an Ultrafree filtration device. The amount of nucleotides in the filtrates was analyzed. Virtually all (92%) of the product ADP remained bound to the enzyme even after all of the ATP had been hydrolyzed (Table I). Therefore, it is not feasible to assign the fluorescence decay to ADP release as the cause of the fluorescence decrease. We also measured the amount of enzyme-bound nucleotide when ADP, AMP-PNP, and ATPγS were added. Again, nearly all of the added nucleotides were stably bound to the enzyme (Table I). Taking this into account, the highest Trp fluorescence level by ATP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP (Fig. 4A) can be assigned to the γ-phosphate (γ-thiophosphate)-bound form.Table IConcentrations of nucleotides remained bound to 1 μM of α3β(R333W)3γ after incubation with 0.5 μM of nucleotidesNucleotideBound concentrationμMATP0.46ADP0.45AMP-PNP0.46ATPγS0.45 Open table in a new tab To monitor the time course of Pi release from the enzyme (step 3 of Scheme FS1), a PBP assay was adopted. Fluorescence of a coumarin-labeled PBP (MDCC-PBP) increases severalfold when Pi binds. The versatility of monitoring of Pi release from α3β(R333W)3γ by the PBP assay was carefully assessed and established (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, real time, continuous monitoring of Pi released from F1-ATPase became possible for the first time. We found that Pi was released from α3β(R333W)3γ with a rate constant of 2.8 ± 0.1 s−1 (Fig.6), which is the same rate as that of the fluorescence decay (Fig. 4). Thus, it is suggested that the decay of fluorescence after the initial increase reflects the decay of the enzyme form with bound ADP-Pi to the enzyme form with bound ADP only, that is, release of Pi from the enzyme. However, if there is a rapid conversion from the active enzyme-ADP complex into inactive enzyme-ADP complex, this conversion is also a candidate for the fluorescence decay. This possibility should be considered because it is known that the so-called MgADP-inhibited form, an inactive form of enzyme-ADP complex, tends to be generated under these conditions. We examined this possibility next. The MgADP-inhibited form (step 4 of Scheme FS1) is not caused by a mere product inhibition but by stable retention of MgADP at the catalytic site. The MgADP can either be picked up from the bulk phase medium or can be a remnant of hydrolysis that remains bound to the enzyme (27Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When the MgADP-inhibited form of F1-ATPase is exposed to ATP and Mg2+, it shows no ATPase activity initially but is gradually reactivated with a time constant of ∼30 s (27Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 43Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E.

Therefore, the population of the MgADP-inhibited form in a certain preparation of F1-ATPase can be assessed from the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis. Under the same conditions used for the fluorescence measurement, we took an aliquot from the solution at the indicated times, injected it into the ATPase assay mixture and measured the initial ATPase activity. The initial ATPase activities were plotted as a function of the time and the rate of generation of the MgADP-inhibited form in the solution was estimated (Fig. 7). The time constant of the onset of MgADP inhibition thus estimated was 15 s, which is much slower than the fluorescence decay. Therefore, the possibility that the fluorescence decay is caused by generation of the MgADP-inhibited state is unlikely. In other words, the lifetime of active MgADP bound form is long enough to be maintained during fluorescence changes of several seconds. Taking these results together, we can conclude that under unisite conditions, the increase in Trp fluorescence of the α3β(R333W)3γ subcomplex occurs upon ATP binding, and the decay occurs as a function of Pirelease (Table II).Table IIRate constants of the reaction steps and corresponding Trp fluorescence changesReaction stepStep in Scheme FS1Rate constantTrp fluorescenceATP binding1(1.7 ± 0.3) × 107m−1 s−1IncreaseATP hydrolysis214.4 ± 0.2 s−1Negligible changePirelease32.8 ± 0.1 s−1DecayADP inhibition46.7 × 10−2 s−1 Open table in a new tab The novel Trp mutant α3β(R333W)3γ revealed that the residue Arg-333 senses the presence of γ-phosphate at the catalytic site of β subunit as well as changes in the surrounding structure upon nucleotide binding and Pirelease. Although Arg-333 does not directly contact the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide in the crystal structure, this residue somehow recognizes conformational differences between ATP-bound (or ADP-Pi-bound) and ADP-bound conformations of the β subunit. It is worth noting that when a nucleotide is bound to the catalytic site, the mutated residue Arg-333 interacts with the switch II loop, a switch region common to a wide range of nucleotide triphosphate-utilizing proteins including GTP-binding proteins and motor proteins (12Kikkawa M.

A function of switch II in myosin and kinesin is to transmit conformational changes caused by γ-phosphate release to a distant point where motility of motor proteins is exerted (41Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of myosin, an alanine mutation introduced into Gly-457 in the switch II loop causes loss of motility (42Sasaki N. Shimada T. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20334-20340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of monomeric kinesin motor KIF1A, the switch II loops of the ADP-bound and ATP-bound forms were in different conformations (12Kikkawa M. Sablin E.P. Okada Y. Yajima H. Fletterick R.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2001; 411: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies using fluorescence energy transfer and other analyses of conventional kinesin indicated a difference between ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms in the flexibility of the neck linker (15Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is natural to assume that F1-ATPase, another motor protein, might undergo an analogous conformational change when Pi is released. However, real images of the conformational change of F1-ATPase that we detected by the fluorescence change cannot be directly assumed by comparing crystal structures of various nucleotide binding states that are solved to date. The crystal structure of F1-ATPase containing β subunits in the ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and empty forms in one molecule (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar) suggested that Pi release does not cause drastic conformational changes because the structure of AMPPNP-bound and ADP-bound β subunits are very similar to each other, both in the same closed conformation. There is a possibility that introduced Trp reflects a very subtle change in the conformation accompanying Pirelease. A new crystal structure (16Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) was discovered recently that contains a third half-closed conformation of the β subunit, which is in between the closed and open forms. This new conformation is thought to be in a transition state where the products ADP and Piare both bound. The existence of this half-closed conformation indicated partial opening of the β subunit during ATP hydrolysis. As a next step, further opening of ADP-bound form induced by Pi release can naturally be assumed. Therefore, another possibility is that the fluorescence change reflects the difference of these two partially open states: one with bound ADP-Pi and the other with bound ADP. This problem has direct implications on the conformational transitions accompanying the catalytic cycle but awaits further studies to be clarified. The present research also revealed new information about the ATPase reaction by direct, real time measurements of some of the kinetic parameters of the unisite catalysis (Table II). The parameters shown here give insights into the reaction mechanism. The first is the rate of nucleotide binding. Comparing the results of stopped flow measurements (unisite catalysis conditions) with the previous single molecule observation of rotating F1-ATPase at low ATP concentrations (bi-site or tri-site catalysis conditions), the rates of ATP binding are in the same range ((1.7 ± 0.3) ×107m−1 s−1 and 2.7×107m−1 s−1, respectively). This indicates that the rates of ATP binding are almost the same for the first and second (or third) catalytic sites. The second is that Pi release predominantly occurs while ADP remains bound to the enzyme in unisite catalysis. The third is that the rate of Pi release is slower than that of ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that the F1·ADP·Pi complex has to wait for some conformational change that allows Pirelease. Future studies should be directed at the observation of conformational changes of the β subunit in F1-ATPase at each step (including Pi release) of during rotational catalysis. For this purpose, a new probe that is tractable by single molecule observation is necessary. Dr. Martin R.

We show here that HSAkin17 protein is directly associated with chromosomal DNA as judged by cross-linking experiments on living cells. We detected increased amounts of DNA-bound HSAkin17 protein 24 h after γ irradiation, with 2.6-fold moreHSAkin17 molecules after 6 Gy of irradiation (46,000–117,000 molecules). At this time we observed that highly proliferating RKO cells displayed the concentration and co-localization of HSAkin17 and replication protein A in nucleoplasmic foci. Our results suggest that 24 h post-irradiationHSAkin17 protein may localize at the sites of unrepaired DNA damages. RKO clones expressing an HSA KIN17 antisense transcript (RASK.5 and RASK.13 cells) revealed that reducedHSAkin17 protein levels are correlated with a decrease in clonogenic cell growth and cell proliferation, as well as an accumulation of cells in early and mid-S phase. Taken together our observations support the idea that HSAkin17 protein is a DNA maintenance protein involved in the cellular response to the presence of DNA damage and suggest that it helps to overcome the perturbation of DNA replication produced by unrepaired lesions."

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), delayed sporulation (13.Neigeborn L. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and sensitivity to the microtubule-destabilizing drug benomyl (12.Shero J.H. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this work we show thatmck1Δ cells are also sensitive to caffeine. Overexpression of MCK1 has been shown to suppress temperature-sensitive mutations in CBF2 and CBF5, which encode essential centromere-binding proteins. Mck1p was found to bind to and phosphorylate Cbf2p in vitro (14.Jiang W. Lim M.Y. Yoon H.J. Thorner J. Martin G.S. Carbon J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15.Jiang W. Koltin Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 153-160PubMed Google Scholar). More recently,MCK1 and RIM11 have been implicated in the protein ubiquitination pathway (16.Andoh T. Hirata Y. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6712-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, MCK1 has been implicated in the response to high concentrations of NaCl in growth medium (17.Piao H.L. Pih K.T. Lim J.H. Kang S.G. Jin J.B. Kim S.H. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that Mck1p down-regulates pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), encoded by the CDC19/PYK1gene, in vivo (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like mck1Δ mutants, strains overproducing pyruvate kinase fail to grow at 37 °C and do not accumulate normal amounts of glycogen. Cells overexpressingCDC19, like mck1Δ, adapt poorly to growth on non-fermentable carbon sources (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Rosenzweig R.F. Genet. Res. 1992; 59: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19.Rosenzweig R.F. Genet. Res. 1992; 59: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Finally, diploid cells overexpressing CDC19 show markedly diminished sporulation efficiency (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to that observed inmck1Δ/mck1Δ diploids. Deletion ofMCK1 was found to exacerbate each of these CDC19overexpression phenotypes (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of Brazill et al. (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Mck1p might directly phosphorylate pyruvate kinase, thereby down-regulating the activity of this enzyme. In this report we investigate this possibility. We find that Mck1p does not in fact phosphorylate pyruvate kinase but instead acts to inhibit an intermediary kinase, which would otherwise phosphorylate the glycolytic enzyme. We identify this intermediary kinase as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The genome of S. cerevisiae contains three genes encoding PKA catalytic subunits, TPK1, TPK2, andTPK3, and one gene, BCY1, encoding the cAMP binding and negative regulatory subunit of PKA. A purified Tpk1p·Bcy1p complex phosphorylates purified pyruvate kinase, and this phosphorylation is stimulated by cAMP. Consistent with this result, we find that loss of Bcy1p increases pyruvate kinase activityin vivo. Phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase by Tpk1p·Bcy1p is inhibited by the addition of purified Mck1p in vitro. Mck1p also inhibits purified Tpk1p alone. This inhibition is dependent on Mck1p catalytic activity, but Mck1p does not phosphorylate Tpk1p (or indeed Bcy1p) in vitro. Mck1p autophosphorylation on tyrosine-199 is required for efficient phosphorylation of exogenous substrates but not for Mck1p autophosphorylation on other residues or for inhibition of Tpk1p in vitro. Finally, autophosphorylation by Mck1p on tyrosine (and hence phosphorylation of exogenous substrates) is not required for the regulation of PKA by Mck1p in vivo. We propose that, in addition to phosphorylating some target proteins, Mck1p also directly binds to and inhibits, but does not phosphorylate, the catalytic subunits of PKA. Purified bovine brain myelin basic protein (MBP), cAMP, LRRASLG (Kemptide), PKI, l-lactate dehydrogenase, DEAE-Sephadex, CM-Sephadex, and cAMP-agarose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). S-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Peapack, NJ). Nickel-agarose was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI) and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-His6 tag antibodies were purchased from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody clone 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Modified Bradford protein concentration assay reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. (Hercules, CA). Partially purified pyruvate kinase was a gift of Tom Nowak (University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN) and fully purified pyruvate kinase was generously provided by Barry Stoddard (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) (20.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) where appropriate. Selection for plasmid maintenance was provided where necessary by growing strains in synthetic minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate nutrients (20.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Media containing non-fermentable carbon sources (acetate, glycerol, dl-lactate, or ethanol) were made by adding the relevant compound to suitable medium to a final concentration of 2%. In the cases of lactate and acetate, agar plates were made using unbuffered acids at 0.2%. All other plates contained 2% glucose as the carbon source. Agar plates contained 10 mm caffeine where indicated. Standard molecular biology techniques were used in the construction of plasmids (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All plasmids were sequenced to check for errors introduced in PCR and DNA ligation steps. Plasmid pDD7 is an MCK1 deletion construct in which theMCK1 open reading frame (ORF) has been disrupted with theURA3 gene flanked by direct repeats of the hisGgene (3.Lim M.Y. Dailey D. Martin G.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21155-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pDD4 is a 2-μm plasmid based on YEp352 (22.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) encoding MCK1 under the control of its own promoter (3.Lim M.Y. Dailey D. Martin G.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21155-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF encoding C-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tagged Mck1p was constructed using a PCR-based approach consisting of two steps. The first step amplified the regions immediately flanking the 3′-end of the MCK1 ORF using plasmid pDD4 as a template. These reactions used two pairs of primers. Primer pUCforward (5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC-3′) was used with primer A (5′-CTC GAG TTA CGC GTG ATG ATG ATG ATG ATG TGA CGC GTC AGC AAC TTT CGT AGG TTT AAT TTT ATC-3′) in one reaction, whereas the other reaction contained primer pUCreverse (5′-AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA GGA-3′) and primer B (5′-CAT CAT CAC GCG TAA CTC GAG TAA TTT TCT ATT AAT TTG TTC TCT TTC C-3′). The second step in the construction of the His6-tagged Mck1p construct combined the products of the first step and re-amplified the whole region using primers pUCforward and pUCreverse. The resultant full-length PCR product was cleaved with BstXI andPstI and subcloned into the corresponding sites in pDD4, producing plasmid pTRYMHU. The DNA sequence of this plasmid was confirmed to encode a protein incorporating the amino acid sequence Ser(His)6Ala-CO2H in place of the terminal glutamate residue of wild-type Mck1p. This plasmid was found to fully complement the mck1Δ mutation in vivo. 2T. F. R., unpublished observation. Insertion of a BamHI site at the 5′-end of theMCK1 ORF was necessary to subclone the ORF downstream of theGAL promoter. The approach taken was similar to that for the insertion of the His6 tag (above). The outlying primers in this case were primer pUCforward and primer C (5′-TTT ATT ATC TTG CGG GGA C-3′). The BamHI site was introduced using a primer with the sequence 5′-CTA GTA GGA TCC AAT ATG TCT ACG GAA GAG CAG AAT GGT GTT CC-3′ and another primer complementary to this sequence. PCR reactions were performed as described for the generation of the His6-tagged construct above. The final PCR product was digested with HindIII and BsrGI and subcloned into the corresponding sites in pTRYMHU to yield plasmid pTRYBMHU. TheMCK1 ORF was then subcloned into plasmid YEp352GAL (23.Benton B.M. Zang J.H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by cleaving plasmid pTRYBMHU with BamHI and subcloning the 2-kb fragment bearing the MCK1 ORF into the BamHI site of YEp352GAL. The resulting plasmid was named pTRYGMHU. The BCY1 ORF was cloned by PCR amplification using yeast genomic DNA as template and primers flanking the BCY1 locus (5′-TTA TCT CTC TCT GAT GAC GTG-3′ and 5′-ATA TCA CGA TTA TAG TCG CAG C-3′). The resulting PCR product was cleaved with EcoRV andScaI and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pRS423 (24.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate plasmid YEpBCY1H. The BCY1 ORF was transferred to a 2-μm plasmid bearing the TRP1 marker by digesting the YEpBCY1H plasmid with XhoI andEcoRI and subcloning it into the corresponding sites of plasmid pRS424. The plasmid was finally cut with BamHI andSmaI, blunt-ended using Klenow DNA polymerase, and re-ligated to destroy these unwanted sites, yielding plasmid YEpBCY1. A vector constitutively overexpressing histidine-tagged TPK1was constructed in the following manner. The TPK1 locus was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-TGG ATC CAA TAT GTC GAC TGA AGA ACA AAA TGG AGG-3′ and 5′-TAC TCG AGT TAC GCG TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGT GAC GCG AAG TCC CGG AAA AGA TCA GCA TAT GGG-3′. The ends of the PCR product were trimmed with BamHI, blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase, and cut again with XhoI. The resulting fragment was then subcloned into the SmaI-SalI sites of plasmid pAD4M (25.Martin G.A. Viskochil D. Bollag G. McCabe P.C. Crosier W.J. Haubruck H. Conroy L. Clark R. O'Connell P. Cawthon R.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 843-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), producing plasmid pTRYAT1HL. Standard molecular biology techniques were used in the construction of yeast strains (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains used in this work include YPH500 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1(24.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), BJ2168 (MAT a leu2 trp1 ura3–52 prb1–1122 pep4–3 pre1–451 (26.Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar)), DBY1 (MATαura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 mck1Δ::hisG (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and JCY100 (MAT a ura3–52 leu2::hisG trp1::hisG his3::hisG (27.Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Thorner J. Nature. 1997; 390: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28.Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar)). Strains TRYBJm (MAT a leu2 trp1 ura3–52 prb1–1122 pep4–3 pre1–451 mck1Δ::hisG) and JCYmck1Δ (MAT a ura3–52 leu2::hisG trp1::hisG his3::hisG mck1Δ::hisG) were constructed by transforming strains BJ2168 and JCY100, respectively, with the 6.3-kbXhoI-XbaI fragment derived from pDD7. The resulting transformants were grown on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for the recombination of the hisG repeats and consequent loss of the URA3 marker gene (29.Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Successful deletion of the MCK1 locus was confirmed by PCR. Strain Y27300 (MAT a/αhis3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0/LYS2 MET15/met15Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0 bcy1Δ::kanMX4/BCY1) and its corresponding wild-type strain, BY4743 (MAT a/αhis3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 met15Δ0/MET15 LYS2/lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) were obtained from EUROSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany) (30.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the MCK1 coding region using a similar approach to that adopted for the original His6 tagging of this ORF (see above). In each case a pair of PCR primers flanking the ORF were used (5′-ACA GCG GAT CAA AGG TGA-3′ and 5′-TAG GAG TTA AGC CCA AG-3′). The various mutants were created using the following PCR primers in conjunction with primers having complementary sequence. The D164A primer was 5′-CGT TTG TCA TCG TGC TAT CAA ACC ATC C-3′ and the Y199F primer was 5′-GCC TTC AAT TAG TTT CAT CTG TTC AAG-3′. In each case the PCR product was cleaved with BsaBI and BsrGI and subcloned into the corresponding site in either pDD4 (giving rise to pTRYMU-D164A and pTRYMU-Y199F) or pTRYGMHU (giving rise to pTRYGMHU-D164A and pTRYGMHU-Y199F). C-terminally His6-tagged Mck1p was overproduced from plasmid pTRYGMHU transformed into strain TRYBJm. Expression was induced by growing cells for 24 h at 30 °C in 2-liter synthetic complete medium containing 2% galactose. To purify mutant Mck1p, the plasmids pTRYGMHU-D164A or pTRYGMHU-Y199F were substituted for plasmid pTRYGMHU in this initial induction step. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently lysed as described by Kellogg et al. (31.Kellogg D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujiinakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The lysis buffer (buffer A) consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 145 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. Following clarification of the lysate by ultracentrifugation, Tween 20 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. The lysate was passed through a nickel-agarose column (1-ml bed volume) previously equilibrated in buffer A. The flow-through from the column was discarded, and the column was washed with ten volumes of buffer A. A second wash was performed with six column volumes of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The Mck1 protein was then eluted with three column volumes each of buffer A containing 50 and 100 mmimidazole. These final fractions were assayed for protein concentration using a Bradford-based assay (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) and checked for Mck1p content by SDS-PAGE (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (34.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer B (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol). The protein was then further purified by running the dialysate over an S-Sepharose column (1-ml bed volume) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with ten volumes of buffer B and a further five volumes of buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl. Purified Mck1p was then eluted using buffer B containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. Mck1p typically eluted in the range of 300–400 mm NaCl. Fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting. Western blotted membranes were probed with anti-Mck1p (2.Dailey D. Schieven G.L. Lim M.Y. Marquardt H. Gilmore T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6244-6256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-His6 tag antibodies. The procedure for purifying PKA subunits from yeast was based on the work of Hixson and Krebs (35.Hixson C.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2137-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tpk1p, His6-tagged at its C terminus, was overproduced in strain BJ2168 using the 2-μm plasmid pTRYAT1HL, which expresses His6-tagged Tpk1p under the control of the constitutive ADH1 promoter. The regulatory subunit Bcy1p was co-overproduced with His6-tagged Tpk1p using a second 2-μm plasmid, YEpBCY1, which expresses BCY1 under the control of its own promoter. Such co-overexpression has been previously found to enhance TPK1 expression (36.Zoller M.J. Kuret J. Cameron S. Levin L. Johnson K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9142-9148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from a 2-liter culture and lysed as described for the purification of Mck1p. The cells were lysed into 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. The lysate was fractionated by adding ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, with 0.1% Tween 20. This fraction was loaded onto a nickel-agarose column (1-ml bed volume) equilibrated in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5. This buffer was used throughout the nickel-agarose column chromatography with increasing amounts of imidazole added. The column was washed with ten volumes of buffer containing 5 mm imidazole followed by a further six column volumes with 20 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted in buffer containing 50–100 mm imidazole. Both here and subsequently, fractions were assayed for Tpk1p content by Western blotting with an anti-His6 tag antibody. Peak fractions were pooled and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex column (0.5-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA. Again, this buffer was used throughout this anion exchange chromatography step, with varying concentrations of NaCl added. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer, and the protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl in the same MOPS buffer. Fractions were assayed by immunoblotting for the His6 tag, and peak fractions (typically in the range 100–200 mmNaCl) were pooled. The pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight in buffer B (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, as for the purification of Mck1p) and applied to a CM-Sephadex column (0.5-ml bed volume) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed in 10 volumes of buffer before the protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl in buffer B. The 100–200 mm NaCl fractions were found to contain two SDS-PAGE bands by silver staining (Fig. 1). The higher molecular weight band was found to cross-react with the anti-His6 tag antibody. The lower band could be removed from the fraction by a brief binding step to cAMP-agarose (50-μl bed volume per 200-μl sample volume). These observations, combined with subsequent kinase assays using Kemptide as a substrate, identified these two bands as Tpk1p and Bcy1p, respectively. Mck1p autophosphorylation was assayed using the procedure described by Lim et al. (3.Lim M.Y. Dailey D. Martin G.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21155-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mck1p tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed by Western blotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody clone 4G10 as described by Zhan et al. (37.Zhan X.L. Hong Y. Zhu T. Mitchell A.P. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphotransferase activity of Mck1p or Tpk1p was measured in a similar manner to that described by Limet al. (3.Lim M.Y. Dailey D. Martin G.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21155-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. To measure Mck1p activity toward exogenous substrates, purified Mck1p was incubated in reaction buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl) with 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (approximately 800 Ci/mol) and 1 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP). The reactions were incubated for between 15 and 30 min at 30 °C before being quenched by addition of sample buffer and boiling, prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. The assay for Tpk1p activity toward pyruvate kinase was conducted in an essentially identical fashion to the assay for Mck1p activity toward MBP. Between 2 and 5 μg of purified pyruvate kinase was used as a substrate in these assays, in place of MBP. Approximately 5 ng of Tpk1p was used per reaction, and 170 ng of Mck1p was added during studies of its inhibitory activity. The total reaction volume was 10 μl. Reactions were quenched by addition of an equal volume of reaction buffer, and half of the total reaction volume was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Adenosine 3′:5′ cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) was added to reactions as indicated to a final concentration of 10 μm. PKA phosphorylation of its synthetic substrate, Kemptide (amino acid sequence LRRASLG), was assayed as described by Toda et al.(38.Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McMullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Synthetic mammalian protein kinase inhibitor peptide (PKI, amino acid sequence TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD) was added to reactions where indicated (1 μg per reaction). Assays of pyruvate kinase activity were performed using an assay coupled to l-lactate dehydrogenase as described by Juricaet al. (39.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were assayed for protein concentration using a Bradford-based assay (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Invasive growth of yeast cells on agar plates was measured using a plate adhesion assay (40.Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Cells were streaked onto YPD or synthetic minimal solid medium and allowed to grow for 3–5 days. The plates were photographed before and after washing under a stream of running water. The results of Brazill et al. (11.Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Mck1p might down-regulate pyruvate kinase by direct phosphorylation. We set out to determine if purified Mck1p phosphorylates purified pyruvate kinasein vitro. Mck1p was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1) using a C-terminal His6tag, a nickel-agarose column, and cation exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme retained catalytic activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP) (Fig. 4) and had a K m for ATP of 70 μm, comparable to that previously determined for the untagged enzyme (27 μm in Dailey et al. (2.Dailey D. Schieven G.L. Lim M.Y. Marquardt H. Gilmore T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6244-6256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 70 μm in Lim et al. (3.Lim M.Y. Dailey D.

https://openalex.org/W2035379436,"The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins are essential for the maintenance of genomic stability of human cells. Compared with hereditary or even sporadic carcinomas, MMR gene mutations are very uncommon in leukemia. However, genetic instability, attested by either loss of heterozygosity or microsatellite instability, has been extensively documented in chronic or acute malignant myeloid disorders. This observation suggests that in leukemia some internal or external signals may interfere with MMR protein expression and/or function. We investigated the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on MMR protein expression and activity in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. First, we show here that unstimulated U937 cells displayed low level of PKC activity as well as MMR protein expression and activity compared with a panel of myeloid cell lines. Second, treatment of U937 cells with TPA significantly increased (3–5-fold) hMSH2 expression and, to a lesser extent, hMSH6 and hPMS2 expression, correlated to a restoration of MMR function. In addition, diacylglycerol, a physiological PKC agonist, induced a significant increase in hMSH2 expression, whereas chelerythrine or calphostin C, two PKC inhibitors, significantly decreased TPA-induced hMSH2 expression. Reciprocally, treatment of HEL and KG1a cells that exhibited a high level of PKC expression, with chelerythrine significantly decreased hMSH2 and hMSH6 expression. Moreover, the alteration of MMR protein expression paralleled the difference in microsatellite instability and cell sensitivity to 6-thioguanine. Our results suggest that PKC could play a role in regulating MMR protein expression and function in some myeloid leukemia cells.

Second, treatment of U937 cells with TPA significantly increased (3–5-fold) hMSH2 expression and, to a lesser extent, hMSH6 and hPMS2 expression, correlated to a restoration of MMR function. In addition, diacylglycerol, a physiological PKC agonist, induced a significant increase in hMSH2 expression, whereas chelerythrine or calphostin C, two PKC inhibitors, significantly decreased TPA-induced hMSH2 expression. Reciprocally, treatment of HEL and KG1a cells that exhibited a high level of PKC expression, with chelerythrine significantly decreased hMSH2 and hMSH6 expression. Moreover, the alteration of MMR protein expression paralleled the difference in microsatellite instability and cell sensitivity to 6-thioguanine. Our results suggest that PKC could play a role in regulating MMR protein expression and function in some myeloid leukemia cells.

Biochemical and genetic studies in eukaryotes have defined at least five genes, hMSH2, hMSH6, hMSH3,hMLH1, and hPMS2, the products of which are required for the human mismatch repair (reviewed in Refs. 1Jiricny J.

The hMSH2 protein, in combination with either hMSH6 (in a complex called hMutSα) or hMSH3 (hMutSβ complex), binds to the mismatch. Each complex preferentially recognizes a different subset of mismatches. The protein complex hMutSα binds to the single mispairs and small loops, whereas hMutSβ is directed toward the larger loops. Subsequently the recognition complex recruits another heterodimer, hMutLα, comprising hMLH1 and hPMS2, to facilitate mismatch correction. mismatch repair acute myeloid leukemia diacylglycerol 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol electrophoresis migration shift assay fetal calf serum microsatellite instability 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide myelin basic protein protein kinase C 6-thioguanine 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate mismatch repair acute myeloid leukemia diacylglycerol 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol electrophoresis migration shift assay fetal calf serum microsatellite instability 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide myelin basic protein protein kinase C 6-thioguanine 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate MMR-deficient cells exhibit a high mutation rate in both coding and noncoding microsatellite sequences (4O'Driscoll M.

In the case of solid tumors, MMR dysfunction accounts for inherited familial cancer syndrome of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancers, and for certain sporadic tumors, including colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer (5Boyer J.C.

Bignami M. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the model of toxicity based on abortive attempts to repair DNA damage induced by cytotoxic drugs. Consequently, the loss of MMR activity contributes to cell resistance to methylating agents (13Branch P. Aquilina G. Bignami M. Karran P.

Different mechanisms are involved in the MMR inactivation process related to the development of cancer: (i) a first mutation, either germinal (hereditary cancer) or somatic (sporadic cancer), followed by another somatic event (18Fishel R. Kolodner R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); (ii) an epigenetic silencing mechanism such as the loss of hMLH1 expression associated with promoter methylation of the hMLH1 gene (19Herman J.G.

In the case of leukemia, genetic instability with loss of heterozygosity or microsatellite instability (MSI) has been observed in acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, and chronic myeloid leukemia cells (23Inoue K.

On the other hand, MSH2 knock-out mice have an increased propensity to develop lymphoma (30Lowsky R. DeCoteau J.F. Reitmair A.H. Ichinohasama R. Dong W.F., Xu, Y. Mak T.W. Kadin M.E. Minden M.D. Blood. 1997; 89: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MSI is quite infrequent in primitive myeloid leukemia (31Sill H. Goldman J.M. Cross N.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Kodera T. Kohno T. Takakura S. Morishita K. Hamaguchi H. Hayashi Y. Sasaki T. Yokota J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999; 26: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), some reports suggesting its occurrence in secondary and therapy-induced leukemia (33Zhu Y.M. Das-Gupta E.P. Russell N.H. Blood. 1999; 94: 733-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tasaka T. Lee S. Spira S. Takeuchi S. Nagai M. Takahara J. Koeffler H.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 98: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or the opposite (35Rimsza L.M. Kopecky K.J. Ruschulte J. Chen I.M. Slovak M.L. Karanes C. Godwin J. List A. Willman C.L. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Investigations on the presence of mutations in MMR genes have shown that these mutations are uncommon events in leukemia (36Hangaishi A. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Hosoya N. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1997; 89: 1740-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these observations show that MMR deficiency is rarely involved in leukemia cell genetic instability. However, it is conceivable that, in leukemia cells, MMR deficiency does occur as a result of negative transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Little is known about the intracellular or extracellular signals that may influence MMR gene expression. A recent report pointed out that MSI was found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with abnormal expression of hMSH2 protein in a significant proportion of the patients (33Zhu Y.M. Das-Gupta E.P. Russell N.H. Blood. 1999; 94: 733-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to obtain new insights into a putative control of MMR by internal or external signals, we evaluated the influence of phorbol ester-induced protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation on MMR protein expression and function in monocytic acute leukemia U937 cells. PKC, a serine-threonine kinase (for review, see Ref. 37Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), plays a pivotal role in signal transduction, and its activation was reported to regulate the methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) DNA repair gene (38Boldogh I. Ramana C.V. Chen Z. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Grosch S. Grombacher T. Mitra S. Kaina B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3950-3956PubMed Google Scholar,39Srivenugopal K.S. Mullapudi S.R. Shou J. Hazra T.K. Ali-Osman F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 282-287PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the potential involvement of PKC activation on the expression of MMR protein should be considered. In this study we present evidence that MMR protein expression was induced in U937 cells when treated with phorbol ester that stimulates PKC activity (39Srivenugopal K.S. Mullapudi S.R. Shou J. Hazra T.K. Ali-Osman F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 282-287PubMed Google Scholar). Reciprocally, PKC inhibition led to a decrease of MMR protein expression. Variations of protein expression correlated with the MMR activity as determined by in vitro assays and cell response to the cytotoxic agent, 6-TG. These results suggest a direct and/or indirect involvement of PKC in the regulation of MMR protein expression and function in myeloid cells. HeLa cells were from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany). Six AML cell lines derived from distinct stages of myeloid differentiation were used, and their immunophenotypes have been previously reported (40Bailly J.D. Muller C. Jaffrezou J.P. Demur C. Gassar G. Bordier C. Laurent G. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar). U937 (monocytic) (41Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar), HL-60 (myelocytic), HEL (erythromyeloblastic), KG1a (pre-myeloblastic), and Jurkat (lymphoid) cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). TF-1 (erythromyeloblastic) and UT-7 (megakaryoblastic) cell lines were generous gifts from Dr. W. Vainchenker and Dr. A. Turhan, respectively (INSERM U362, Villejuif, France). All the myeloid leukemic cell lines used in the study are p53-negative (42Clave E. Carosella E.D. Gluckman E. Dubray B. Socie G. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1996; 35: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). U937, HL-60, UT-7, HeLa, and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). TF-1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (5 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium of TF-1 and UT-7 cells. KG1a cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% FCS. Culture media were supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (200 units/ml). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2–5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), 6-TG, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8), calphostin C, and chelerythrine were obtained from Sigma (St Quentin-Fallavier, France). PKC activity was determined in cell extracts as previously reported (43Mansat V. Laurent G. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Jaffrezou J.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5300-5304PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total PKC was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P into myelin basic protein (MBP). Cells (5 × 105) were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mmglycerophosphoric acid, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 15 min. The assay was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm ATP, 2.5 μg/ml MBP, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid and collected on Whatman GF/C filters. Following extensive washes with 10% trichloroacetic acid, water, and finally ethanol, the incorporation of 32P into MBP was measured by scintillation counting. After cell lysis, total cell proteins (40 μg) were separated in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred on nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France). The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-hMLH1 (2 μg/ml, clone G168-15, BD PharMingen, Le Pont de Claix, France), anti-hPMS2 (1 μg/ml, clone 9, Calbiochem, Meudon, France), anti-hMSH2 (1 μg/ml, clone GB12, Calbiochem), anti-hMSH6 (1 μg/ml, clone 44, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (0.1 μg/ml, Sigma) was also used as a loading control. Detection of the primary antibodies was done using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and generation of chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The levels of protein expression were determined by optical densitometry. A separate Western blot was carried out for the detection of each MMR protein, but β-actin was simultaneously detected on the same membrane. Cytospin preparations of cell suspensions were permeabilized with 90% methanol for 15 min. Slides were air-dried, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-hMSH2 (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) was applied at 5 μg/ml for 2 h. After washing with PBS containing 1% nonfat milk, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 1 h. Slides were washed in PBS, air-dried, and mounted with an anti-fading solution (Vector Laboratories). Slides were examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. The confocal imaging system was a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) scanning assembly incorporating argon and helium/neon lasers coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 fluorescence microscope. Images were digitized and photographs were taken using Ilford FP4 films (44Lautier D. Bailly J.D. Demur C. Herbert J.M. Bousquet C. Laurent G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Laser settings were kept identical for the examination of samples to be compared. The substrates were 34-mer duplex32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing a single G-T mispair (45Stephenson C. Karran P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21177-21182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a matched G-C as a control. Band shift assays were performed as previously reported (46Macpherson P. Humbert O. Karran P. Mutat. Res. 1998; 408: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) except for the use of replicative cell extracts (150 μg). Briefly, extracts were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 2 pmol of non-radioactive competitor duplex in 15 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). The radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotide (20 fmol) was then added and incubation continued for another 20 min. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels, and the products were detected by autoradiography. Replicative cell extracts used in the in vitro assay were prepared as described (47Karran P. Macpherson P. Ceccotti S. Dogliotti E. Griffin S. Bignami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15878-15886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates for mismatch correction were nicked circular molecules containing a single TC mispair constructed as described (48Humbert O. Fiumicino S. Aquilina G. Branch P. Oda S. Zijno A. Karran P. Bignami M. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Repair assays were carried out as previously reported (48Humbert O. Fiumicino S. Aquilina G. Branch P. Oda S. Zijno A. Karran P. Bignami M. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, correction of the TC mispair restored a MluI restriction site. After incubation of the heteroduplex substrate (90 ng) with cell extracts (up to 200 μg) for 60 min at 37 °C in a buffer (25 μl) containing 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm each dNTP, 4 mm ATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 1 μg creatine phosphokinase, and DNA purification, repair was checked by restriction enzyme digestion followed by gel electrophoresis. Specific repair of the mismatch heteroduplex by proficient extracts resulted in the generation of a new 3.9-kb band, whereas non-correction by deficient extracts led to a simple linearization of the substrate (4.5 kb). The toxicity of 6-TG was evaluated by the MTT assay, performed as described elsewhere (49Canitrot Y. Frit P. Salles B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 103 cells/well were plated, then treated with the drug. After a 72-h incubation time period, cells were centrifuged and the MTT assay was performed. The survival curves were determined with the solvent (water) alone as a control, and the percentages of viable cells were determined by spectrophotometric measurement. Drug concentrations that correspond to 50% of viable cells (IC50) were determined and used to compare cell sensitivities to 6-TG treatment. MSI was assessed in U937 (four clones), HL-60 (two clones), KG1a (two clones), and HEL (one clone) cell lines and compared with Jurkat cell line. Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using a DNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from leukemic cell lines was investigated using two microsatellite markers (BAT25 (intron 16 of c-kit oncogene) and BAT26 (intron 5 of hMSH2) for MSI. Primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (France) and were fluorescently labeled. The PCR reaction was set up in a 50 μl of volume containing 25 ng of DNA, 25 μm amounts of each primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTP, and 1.25 units of Taq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer). Amplification was performed in a model 480 thermocycler (PerkinElmer) after an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 28 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, hybridization at 50 °C for 1 min, and polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Fluorescently labeled PCR products were detected using an automated ABI 377 DNA sequencer. Data analyses were performed using ABI GeneScan and Genotyper software for automatic sizing of fragments. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. A probability value < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Whole cell extracts of HeLa (used as control) and leukemia cell lines were prepared from cells in exponential growth phase. In HeLa cells the expected protein bands of 105, 160, 85, and 115 kDa for hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS2, respectively, were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A). The expression of MMR proteins varied among the different cell lines used. The expression of hMSH2 in HEL cells was similar to that of HeLa cells, whereas it was decreased in U937 cell extracts and was detected only after prolonged chemiluminescence exposure (Fig. 1 B). hMSH2 expression level was 8–10-fold lower in U937 cells than in HeLa and HEL cells (Fig. 1 C). Because hMSH2 belongs to a protein complex, the expression of the other partners that participate to the MMR reaction was investigated in these cell lines. We found that the levels of hMSH6 and hPMS2 were also decreased in U937 cells compared with HEL and HeLa cells, whereas hMLH1 expression in U937 cells was comparable with that in HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A–C). We next evaluated the effect of TPA, a PKC activator, in the U937 cell. Treatment with TPA (50–100 nm) of U937 cells resulted in a 5-fold increase of hMSH2 expression after a 24-h time period (Fig. 1 C). The kinetic of TPA effect showed an increase detectable after 1 h of incubation, further increasing by 3-fold after 3 h and reaching a plateau at 24 h that lasted up to 72 h (Fig. 1 D and data not shown). The overexpression of hMSH2 was accompanied by an increase in hMSH6 expression (Fig. 1 C). TPA treatment also increased the expression of hPMS2, albeit at a lesser extent (Fig. 1 C). First, to check whether the effect of TPA in U937 cells was not cell line-specific, we examined hMSH2 protein expression in various AML-derived cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the levels of hMSH2 analyzed by Western blotting were in the same range in HEL, KG1a, UT-7, TF-1, and HeLa cells but were significantly lower in U937 and HL-60 cells. As expected, no hMSH2 expression was found in Jurkat cells that are defective in hMutα (50Levati L. Marra G. Lettieri T. D'Atri S. Vernole P. Tentori L. Lacal P.M. Pagani E. Bonmassar E. Jiricny J. Graziani G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 23: 159-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of hMSH2 observed with U937 cells after TPA treatment was also found in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, treatment of U937 and HL-60 cells with 50 nm TPA resulted in a 3–4-fold PKC stimulation that lasted for several hours (Ref. 43Mansat V. Laurent G. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Jaffrezou J.P.

Open table in a new tab The whole PKC activity was determined after 1 h of TPA treatment (50 nm) as described under “Materials and Methods.” PKC activity is expressed as pmol of 32P/min/106 cells. Each value is the mean of three independent experiments with S.D. Second, we investigated whether TPA treatment could increase hMSH2 expression in cells displaying high basal level of expression. In contrast to U937 and HL-60 cells, the high levels of hMSH2 expression in HeLa and HEL cell lines were not modified after TPA treatment (Fig. 2 B). However, KG1a and TF-1 cells, which display a higher level of hMSH2 expression than U937 and HL-60 cells, also exhibited a 2–5-fold higher basal PKC activity compared with these cells (Table I). Third, TPA can induce various biological effects in addition to PKC activation; therefore, we investigated whether PKC stimulation could play a role in hMSH2 overexpression. Thus, we evaluated the effect of diacylglycerol (DAG), a physiological although less potent PKC agonist (51Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Indeed, a 24-h incubation with DiC8 (25 μg/ml), a cell-permeant DAG analog, increased hMSH2 expression, albeit to a lesser extent than TPA (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, the effect on TPA-induced hMSH2 overexpression in U937 cells of calphostin C and chelerythrine, two PKC inhibitors, was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2 C, calphostin C (100 nm) or chelerythrine (10 μm) significantly inhibited the effect of TPA on hMSH2 expression. We then examined whether hMSH2 content in cells with high level of expression compared with U937 and HL-60 cells could be decreased by treatment with a PKC inhibitor. After chelerythrine treatment of HEL and KG1a cells during 24 h, the expression of hMSH2 and hMSH6 was significantly decreased (Fig. 2 D). Finally, PKC depletion in HEL cells after prolonged exposure (72 h) at high TPA concentration (100 nm) resulted in a 2.5-fold decrease in hMSH2 protein expression (data not shown). Because protein expression and MMR activity were determined with total cell lysates, the increase of hMSH2 content could have been restricted to cytoplasm and consequently would not be directly responsible for changes in MMR activity. Therefore, we carried out confocal analysis to evaluate the influence of PKC stimulation on hMSH2 localization. In U937 cells treated with 50 nm TPA for 24 h, immunostai"

During catalysis, part of the energy is used to translocate Ca2+ across the membrane, and part is dissipated as heat. At 35 °C the heat released during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule varies depending on the formation of a Ca2+ gradient across the membrane. With leaky vesicles (no gradient) the heat released varies between 9 and 12 kcal/mol of ATP cleaved, and with intact vesicles (gradient), the heat released increases to 20–24 kcal/mol of ATP. After Ca2+accumulation, 82% of the Ca2+-ATPase activity is not coupled to Ca2+ transport, and the ratio between Ca2+ transported and ATP cleaved is 0.3. The addition of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) to the medium or decreasing the temperature from 35 to 20 °C abolishes the difference of heat produced during ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of a gradient. This is accompanied by a simultaneous inhibition of the uncoupled ATPase activity and an increase of the Ca2+/ATP ratio from 0.3 to 1.3–1.4.

Vesicles derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit white skeletal muscle retain a membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase, which is able to pump Ca2+ across the vesicle membrane using the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. During Ca2+transport chemical and osmotic energy is interconverted by the ATPase (1.Hasselbach W. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1964; 14: 169-222Google Scholar, 2.Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys.

With leaky vesicles (no gradient), 8–12 kcal are released during the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP. After formation of a Ca2+ gradient (intact vesicles) the heat released increased to the range of 20 to 24 kcal/mol of ATP cleaved. These findings indicate that Ca2+-ATPase is able to handle the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis in such a way as to determine the parcel that is used for Ca2+ accumulation and the fraction that is dissipated as heat.

This was measured using large amounts of vesicles, oxalate, and a small amount of Ca2+. In this condition, practically all of the Ca2+ available in the medium is rapidly stored inside the vesicles as calcium oxalate crystals, which ensures the maintenance of a low lumenal free Ca2+ concentration (100 μm) (1.Hasselbach W.

A stoichiometry of two Ca2+ ions transported for each ATP cleaved was also clearly demonstrated in transient kinetics experiments, where the transport was measured during the first catalytic cycle of the enzyme, i.e. before the lumenal Ca2+ concentration raised to a high level (4.de Meis L.

In conditions similar to those found in the cell, the rate of the uncoupled ATPase activity is 2–8 times faster than the activity coupled to Ca2+ transport (10.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12.Reis M. Farange M. Souza A.C.L. de Meis L. J. Biol.

The uncoupled Ca2+ efflux and uncoupled ATPase activity account for the low Ca2+/ATP stoichiometry measured during transport. Recent reports indicate that the extra amount of heat measured during ATP hydrolysis with Ca2+-loaded vesicles could be derived from the uncoupled ATPase activity (10.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12.Reis M. Farange M. Souza A.C.L. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42793-42800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this report, we measured the rates of uncoupled Ca2+efflux and uncoupled ATPase activity and heat production at 20 °C and at 35 °C in the presence and absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. The aim was to establish whether or not there is a correlation between the uncoupled activities of the Ca2+-ATPase and the differences of heat production measured in the presence and absence of a Ca2+ gradient. In the discussion, the relevance of these data to thermogenesis is debated. These were derived from the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit hindleg white skeletal muscle and were prepared as previously described (22.Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The efflux of Ca2+ measured with these vesicles was not altered by ryanodine, indicating that they did not contain significant amounts of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The vesicles also did not exhibit the phenomenon of Ca2+-induced Ca2+release found in the heavy fraction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This was measured by the filtration method (23.Chiesi M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 45Ca uptake, trace amounts of45Ca were included in the assay medium. The reaction was arrested by filtering samples of the assay medium in Millipore filters. After filtration, the filters were washed five times with 5 ml of 3 mm La(NO3)3, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. For the Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange the assay medium was divided in two samples. Trace amounts of 45Ca2+ were added to only one of the samples, and the reaction was started by the simultaneous addition of vesicles to the two media. The sample containing the radioactive Ca2+ was used to determine the incubation time where the vesicles were filled and the steady state of45Ca2+ uptake was reached. The rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange was measured after that steady state was reached by adding a trace amount of 45Ca2+ to the second sample containing vesicles loaded with non-radioactive Ca2+. The exchange of the radioactive Ca2+ from the medium with the non-radioactive Ca2+ contained inside the vesicles was measured by filtering samples of the assay medium in Millipore filters at different intervals after the addition of45Ca2+. These were assayed using either [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi as previously described (24.de Meis L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These were measured using an OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA) (7.de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8.de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1738-C1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Mitidieri F. de Meis L. J. Biol.

The calorimeter cell (1.5 ml) was filled with reaction medium, and the reference cell was filled with Milli-Q water. After equilibration at the desired temperature, the reaction was started by injecting vesicles into the reaction cell, and the heat change during ATP hydrolysis was recorded for 20–40 min. The volume of vesicle suspension injected in the cell varied between 0.02 and 0.03 ml. The heat change measured during the initial 2 min after vesicle injection was discarded to avoid artifacts such as the heat derived from the dilution of the loaded vesicles into the reaction medium and the binding of ions to the Ca2+-ATPase. The duration of these events is less than 1 min. The calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH cal) was calculated by dividing the amount of heat released by the amount of ATP hydrolyzed. The units used were moles for substrate hydrolyzed and kcal for the heat released. A negative value indicates that the reaction is exothermic, and a positive value indicates that it is endothermic. In a typical experiment the assay medium was divided in five samples, which were used for the simultaneous measurement of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange, substrate hydrolysis, ATP synthesis, and heat release. The syringe of the calorimeter was filled with the vesicles, and the temperature difference between the syringe and the reaction cell of the calorimeter was allowed to equilibrate, a process that usually took between 8 and 12 min. After equilibration, the reaction was started by injecting the vesicles into the reaction cell. During equilibration, the vesicles used for measurements of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange, ATP hydrolysis, and ATP synthesis were kept at the same temperature, for the same length of time, and the same protein dilution as the vesicles kept in the calorimeter syringe. The different reactions were started simultaneously. NaN3, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, was added to the assay medium to avoid interference from possible contamination of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with this enzyme. Both the initial velocities of Ca2+ uptake and the amount of Ca2+ retained by the vesicles were found to vary depending on the conditions used (Figs.2 and 3). The Ca2+ concentration in the lumen of intact vesicles reaches the millimolar range a few seconds after the transport is initiated (2.Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4.de Meis L. Bittar E.

In the control experiment at 35 °C a small fraction of the ATP cleaved is synthesized back by the ATPase (Fig. 2 and Table I). At this same temperature, the addition of Me2SO promoted both a decrease of ATP hydrolysis and a large increase of ATP synthesis rates. As a result, about 30% of the ATP cleaved during transport is synthesized back. On the other hand, there was practically no ATP synthesis at 20 °C (Table I).Figure 3Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange (A) and ATP hydrolysis (B) measured at 20 °C.

In the table, n refers to the number of experiments, and the values are means ± S.E. When the vesicles are still being filled the rate of Ca2+uptake measured represents a balance between the Ca2+pumped inside the vesicles by the ATPase and the rate of Ca2+ that leaves the vesicles driven by the gradient formed across the membrane. During the initial minutes of incubation these two rates are different and cannot be measured separately. Thus, the stoichiometry between the fluxes of Ca2+ through the membrane and the rates of either ATP cleavage or ATP synthesis cannot be evaluated with precision. After the steady state is reached, the rate of efflux is the same as that of Ca2+ uptake, and by measuring the rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange it is possible to determine the value of the two rates. The exchange represents the fraction of Ca2+ that leaves the vesicles and is pumped back inside the vesicles by the ATPase. At 35 °C, the rate of exchange measured in the presence of Me2SO was faster than that measured in totally aqueous medium (Fig. 2 A and Table I). On the other hand, lowering the temperature from 35 to 20 °C promoted a significant decrease of the exchange rate (Table I). Knowing the rates of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange and the rates of ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis at steady state it was possible to estimate the following values. (i) The net ATP hydrolysis, which represents the true amount of ATP cleaved to maintain the Ca2+ gradient formed across the vesicle membrane during steady state, was calculated by subtracting the rate of ATP synthesis from the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Table I). (ii) The ratio between the rates of Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis was calculated by dividing the rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange by the rate of net ATP hydrolysis at steady state (Table I).

We now show that at steady state the ratio Ca2+/ATP increases from 0.3 to 1.4 and 1.3 when either the temperature is decreased to 20 °C or when Me2SO is added to the medium, respectively. (iii) The rates of coupled and uncoupled Ca2+ efflux; in different laboratories it has been shown that during coupled efflux (reactions 5 to 1 flowing backwards), the release of two Ca2+ ions from the vesicles drives the synthesis of one ATP molecule (2.Hasselbach W.

The coupled Ca2+ efflux was therefore calculated by multiplying the rate of ATP synthesis by 2, and the difference between the rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange, and the coupled Ca2+ efflux represents the uncoupled Ca2+efflux (reactions 7–9 in Fig. 1). The coupled efflux increased 6-fold after the addition of Me2SO and was abolished at 20 °C (Table II). On the other hand, the uncoupled Ca2+ efflux was decreased 2-fold after the addition of Me2SO and 3-fold at 20 °C. (iv) The rates of ATP hydrolysis coupled and uncoupled to the translocation of Ca2+, for the calculations of which we used the values of net ATP hydrolysis and the stoichiometry of two Ca2+ ions pumped for each ATP molecule cleaved. Thus, the rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange shown in Table I divided by 2 gives the rate of coupled ATP hydrolysis, i.e. the ATP cleaved to pump back the Ca2+ that leaves the vesicles during the exchange (reactions 1–5 in Fig. 1). The difference between the total net ATP hydrolysis and the coupled ATP hydrolysis gives the value of the uncoupled ATPase activity (reactions 2 and 10 in Fig. 1). At 35 °C the rate of the uncoupled ATPase activity was 4.6 times faster than the ATPase activity coupled to Ca2+ transport. Similar values have been found in previous reports (10.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12.Reis M. Farange M. Souza A.C.L. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42793-42800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We now show that there is a substantial decrease of both the uncoupled ATPase activity and the ratio between the uncoupled and coupled ATPase activity when the temperature is decreased from 35 °C to 20 °C or when Me2SO is added to the medium (Table II).Table IIRates of coupled and uncoupled ATPase activity and Ca2+ effluxConditionsnCa2+effluxNet Ca2+-ATPaseRatio uncoupled/coupledCoupled (a)Uncoupled (b)Coupled (c)Uncoupled (d)Efflux (b/a)ATPase (d/c)35 °C759 ± 5390 ± 57249 ± 341,137 ± 1316.64.635 °C, 20% Me2SO (v/v)10352 ± 49210 ± 58280 ± 20169 ± 400.60.620 °C73 ± 1126 ± 464 ± 235 ± 8.20.5Experimental values for calculation of coupled and uncoupled rates were from Table I.

In these experiments the rate of heat release and substrate hydrolysis were measured simultaneously in leaky vesicles (no gradient) and intact vesicles (gradient). For intact vesicles, the values of hydrolysis were corrected for the ATP synthesized back at the different incubation intervals (net hydrolysis). Within the Ca2+ concentrations range used, there was no ATP synthesis when leaky vesicles were used (2.Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4.de Meis L. Bittar E.

With intact vesicles (gradient) the rate of heat production during ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport at 35 °C was several times faster than that measured either at 20 °C or in the presence of Me2SO. The amount of heat released in the presence and absence of a Ca2+ gradient was proportional to the amount of ATP hydrolyzed, both during the initial incubation intervals of Ca2+ uptake, and after that the steady state was reached. This could be visualized by plotting the heat release as a function of the amount of ATP hydrolyzed (Figs.4 B and 5) or calculating the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH cal) of ATP hydrolysis (Table III). In earlier reports (7.de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8.de Meis L. Am. J.

This was confirmed in Figs. 4 B and5 A and Table III using the same conditions as those used for the measurement of coupled and uncoupled Ca2+ efflux and ATP hydrolysis (Table II). The difference between the ΔH cal of ATP hydrolysis measured in the presence and in the absence of gradient was no longer observed when the temperature was lowered to 20 °C or when Me2SO was added to the medium (Table III). In addition to abolish the difference of ΔH cal, these conditions also promoted a significant decrease of the uncoupled ATPase activity (Table II), thus suggesting that the uncoupled ATPase activity indeed contribute to the extra amount of heat produced when ATP is cleaved by the Ca2+-loaded vesicles. In a previous report (10.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27.de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) the heat produced during the unidirectional Ca2+movement from the vesicle lumen to the medium was measured by diluting vesicles previously loaded with Ca2+ in efflux media containing ADP, Pi, Mg2+, or K+. These experiments revealed that the Ca2+-ATPase can function at least in two different forms: (i) it absorbs heat from the medium when the efflux is coupled to ATP synthesis (ΔH cal +5.7 kcal/mol of Ca2+released); (ii) it converts the energy derived from the gradient into heat when Mg2+ is removed from the medium and the synthesis of ATP is impaired (ΔH cal −14.9 kcal/mol of Ca2+ released). Knowing the ΔH calvalues for the coupled and uncoupled Ca2+ efflux, it was possible to estimate the relative contribution of the efflux and of the substrate hydrolysis to the heat produced during steady state (Table IV). The values obtained clearly indicate that at 35 °C, both in the presence and absence of Me2SO, most of the heat produced was derived from the ATPase activity. At 20 °C the amount of heat produced was small, and it was not possible to distinguish whether the main source of heat production was the uncoupled efflux or the ATPase activity.Figure 5Heat released during ATP hydrolysis in the presence (●) and absence (○) of a Ca 2+ gradient. In A, the assay medium and experimental conditions were as in Fig. 2 at 35 °C and in B as in Fig. 3 at 20 °C.

The heat derived from the ATPase was calculated by subtracting the heat derived from the total Ca2+ efflux from the heat measured. In the two conditions there was an increase of the Ca2+/ATP ratio from 0.3 to 1.3 and 1.4 (Table I). This was promoted by a decrease of both the uncoupled Ca2+ efflux and uncoupled ATPase activity (Table II). From the two activities, the decrease of the uncoupled ATPase (7- and 32-fold) was more pronounced than that of the uncoupled efflux (2- and 3-fold). In parallel to the decrease of the uncoupled routes there was a decrease of the heat produced during ATP hydrolysis by Ca2+-loaded vesicles (Table III). These observations support the proposal that the ramifications of the catalytic cycle are thermogenic routes that lead to an increase of the caloric yield of ATP hydrolysis, and the values of Table IV show that the uncoupled ATPase is the route that most contributes to the increase in the caloric yield of ATP hydrolysis noted when the vesicles accumulate Ca2+. Although Me2SO increased the rate of exchange (Table I), most of the Ca2+ leaving the vesicles was coupled to the synthesis of ATP. An interesting new finding was that Me2SO promoted a significant decrease of the ratio between the rate of ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis (Table I). This ratio gives a measure of the degree of energy conservation of the system (3.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4.de Meis L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The more that ATP is synthesized, the smaller the ratio between the rates of hydrolysis and synthesis and the more energy is conserved by the system,i.e. the steady state can be conserved for a longer period of time because the net decline of the ATP concentration in the medium proceeds at a slower rate. Earlier reports (3.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4.de Meis L. Bittar E.

Physiol. 1985; 47: 573-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that during catalysis binding energy and chemical energy are interconverted by the Ca2+-ATPase. With leaky vesicles, the low Ca2+ concentration (10 μm) available on the two sides of the membrane is not sufficient to permit a significant binding of Ca2+ to the enzyme forms E 2-P and E 2, and as a result reactions 3 and 4 are irreversible, the catalytic cycle flows continuously forward without branching, two Ca2+ ions are transported across the membrane, and the cleavage of each ATP molecule is completed with the hydrolysis of the low energy phosphoenzyme E 2-P (2.Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3.de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev.

Thus, during catalysis, a part of the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is used to transport Ca2+ across the membrane (work), and a part is dissipated as heat. This sequence is altered after formation of the gradient. The high intravesicular Ca2+ concentration leads to the reversal of reactions 4 and 3 and the accumulation and hydrolysis of the high energy phosphoenzyme 2Ca:E 1∼P (19.Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20.Fortea M.I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consequently, the cleavage of ATP is no longer coupled to the sequential binding and dissociation of Ca2+ from the enzyme, there is no conversion of chemical energy into work, and more energy is available to be converted into heat. Recently Sumbilla et al. (28.Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Hammerschmidt T. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13900-13906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) observed that the Ca2+/ATP coupling ratio is improved by the reduction of nucleotide concentration in the presence of the ATP regenerating system and/or complexation of lumenal Ca2+ with phosphate or oxalate. In this work (28.Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Hammerschmidt T. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13900-13906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the authors determine the kinetic constant of the catalytic cycle partial reactions. The general interest in heat production and thermogenesis has increased during the past decade due to its implications in health and disease. Alterations of thermogenesis are noted in several diseases, such as obesity and thyroid-hormone alterations. Different studies indicate that the hydrolysis of ATP by the Ca2+-ATPase found in muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum is one of the heat sources contributing to the thermogenesis of animals lacking brown adipose tissue (29.Chinet A.E. Decrouy A. Even P.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 455: 663-678Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30.Block B.A. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42793-42800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggest that the uncoupled ATPase activity may represent an important route of heat production that contributes to the cell thermogenesis. In intact vesicles, the rate of the uncoupled ATPase activity is 4.6 times faster than the coupled ATPase,i.e. 82% of the total ATP cleaved by Ca2+-loaded vesicles is processed through the route that leads to a higher heat production (reaction 10). The uncoupled Ca2+ efflux also contributes with a small, but significant heat production. Table IV shows that from the total heat released during transport, 28.9% is derived from Ca2+ efflux and the remaining 71.1% from the ATPase activity. The heat produced in the cell is ultimately related to the turnover of ATP (32.Silva J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Heat is produced during mitochondria respiration. Thus, in the living cell the Ca2+-ATPase would account for two sources of heat: (i) the heat produced during ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ efflux and (ii) the heat derived from the increase of mitochondria activity promoted by the raise in ADP concentration generated by the ATPase activity.

To characterize apical sorting determinants within the N-terminal segment of enteropeptidase, we employed a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter (18Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar) in transfected MDCK cell lines expressing various chimeric enteropeptidase-GFP proteins. The results demonstrate that either of two short O-glycosylated mucin-like repeats of enteropeptidase can confer apical targeting on a heterologous protein. However, O-linked oligosaccharides are not sufficient for apical targeting, and some apical targeting activity is retained by a peptide that is not glycosylated. The apical targeting function also does not appear to involve stable interaction with lipid rafts. Plasmids pSMAB(His)6-GFP and pS(His)6-gGFP were derived from pdLin-BEK, which encodes the human prothrombin signal peptide and His6 tag from pHL-BEK (19Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) linked to the codon for the Ala-166 of plasmid pBEK (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A fragment (SMAB) encoding the human prothrombin signal peptide (S) plus His6tag linked to two mucin-like repeats (MAB) (amino acids 166–192) of bovine enteropeptidase (20Kitamoto Y. Yuan X., Wu, Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was made by PCR (GeneAmp reagents, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with N-terminal primer (5′-gacagctcgagatggcgccacgtc-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and C-terminal primer (5′-ccgtggatcccgtggggttgccag-3′ (BamHI site underlined). Fragment S(His)6 encoding the prothrombin signal peptide and His6 tag without mucin-like repeats was generated by PCR with the same N-terminal primer and a different C-terminal primer (5′-cggtggatcccggctgctgtgatgatg-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The PCR fragments SMAB(His)6 and S(His)6 were digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into the same sites of vector pEGFPN1 (GenBankTM accession numberU55762, CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) to generate pSMAB(His)6-GFP and pS(His)6-gGFP, respectively. A fragment encoding the prothrombin signal peptide (S) was generated from template pS(His)6-gGFP with primers 5′-gacagctcgagatggggtcaaag-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and 5′-caggatcctgcctgtgcacaaggc-3′ (BamHI site underlined), digested with XhoI andBamHI, and ligated into pEGFPN1 to generate pS-GFP. A fragment encoding mucin repeats (MAB) was made similarly from template pSMAB(His)6-GFP with primers 5′-tagggatccagcctctttggagaat-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-gctcctcgcccttgctcacca-3′. The fragment (MAB) was digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pS-GFP to create plasmid pSMAB-GFP. Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized encoding mucin-like repeat A (MA) and repeat B (MB). The MA oligonucleotides were 5′-ttccgggatccagcctctttggagaatttctctacgataagtcctgcaacaacgtcacgggatccaccg-3′ and 5′-cggtggatcccgtgacgttgttgcaggacttatcgtagagaaattctccaaagaggctggatcccggaa-3′ (BamHI sites underlined). Oligonucleotides encoding MB were 5′-ttccgggatccagaaaagctaacaaccagcattcctctggcaaccccacgggatccaccg-3′ and 5′-cggtggatcccgtggggttgccagaggaatgctggttgttagcttttctggatcccggaa-3′ (BamHI sites underlined). After annealing, the double-stranded fragments were digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pS-GFP to give pSMA-GFP and pSMB-GFP, respectively. Point or clustered mutations were generated with the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using pSMA-GFP or pSMB-GFP as the template and an oligonucleotide primer that contains the desired mutation. All product plasmids were sequenced (BigDye cycle DNA sequencing kit, PE Applied Science, Foster, CA) to confirm the accuracy of the construction. MDCK II cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as described (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells growing in 6-well tissue culture plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 5 μg of plasmid DNAs premixed (1:6 w/v) with 30 μl of PerFect lipid (pfx-2, Invitrogen) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 5 h, fetal bovine serum was added to 10%. After an additional 18 h, cultures were split 1:50 and cultured in 48-well plates for selection in 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Positive clones were identified by fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (MMS-118P, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA). MDCK cells expressing various chimeric proteins were cultured on Transwell filters (pore size 0.4 μm; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) until a tight monolayer was formed according to transmembrane resistance (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times on both sides of the membrane with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and cultured with 2 ml of serum-free medium (OPTI-MEM, Invitrogen) added to both apical and basolateral compartments. After 24 h, medium was collected from the apical and basolateral chambers, and 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, from Sigma) was added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration (Centricon-10; Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5–15% Tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions and transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (pore size 0.45 μm, Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000 dilution in 2% nonfat milk in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature overnight. After washing, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution in 2% nonfat dry milk in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) at room temperature for 2 h. Bound antibody was detected with the chemiluminescent ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and XAR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Films were exposed for several different times to obtain density signals within the linear response range. After optical scanning, signals were quantitated with NIH Image 1.6.1 (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Glycosidases were obtained from Oxford Glycosciences (Bedford, MA). Samples of concentrated conditioned medium (40 μl) were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in 20 mm sodium citrate phosphate, pH 5.5, 0.2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol and cooled to room temperature. Detergent Nonidet P-40 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 2%, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h without or with 1 milliunit/microliter Streptomyces plicatus endoglycosidase H. Reactions with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were prepared similarly except that the buffer was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% SDS, and the amount of added enzyme was 0.5 unit. To analyze proteins forO-glycosylation, samples of concentrated conditioned media (40 μl) were digested with Arthrobacter ureafaciensneuraminidase (0.5 milliunit/microliter) at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, followed by digestion withO-glycanase (0.05 milliunit/microliter) in 100 mm sodium citrate phosphate, pH 6.0, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 16 h. Digested samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with monoclonal anti-GFP IgG as described above. Detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched raft domains were prepared by cell lysis in ice-cold Triton X-100 (for 10 min without agitation) and then sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteins in the fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min, and pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 0.2n NaOH. Samples (20 μl) of trichloroacetic acid-concentrated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with either monoclonal anti-GFP IgG (1:10,000) or monoclonal anti-caveolin IgG (1:10,000; C37120, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) as described above. Previous studies suggested that apical sorting of enteropeptidase in MDCK cells depends on a signal near the N terminus, between amino acid residues 50–197 (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This juxtamembrane region contains four potential N-glycosylation sites and a mucin domain consisting of two tandem O-glycosylated Ser/Thr-rich repeats (Fig. 1 A) (20Kitamoto Y. Yuan X., Wu, Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Yuan X. Zheng X., Lu, D. Rubin D.C. Pung C.Y. Sadler J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G342-349PubMed Google Scholar). Potential targeting signals within these mucin repeats were characterized by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter (Fig. 1 B) (18Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar). Control constructs (GFP and His6-gGFP) were secreted randomly (Fig.2 and TableI). Constructs with both mucin repeats (MAB-GFP and His6-MABGFP) were secreted apically (Fig. 2 A and Table I), indicating that the enteropeptidase mucin domain can direct apical targeting of a heterologous protein.Figure 2Targeting and glycosylation of chimeric proteins. A, transfected MDCK cell lines expressing the indicated proteins were grown on Transwell filters, and samples from the apical (Ap) and basolateral (Bl) compartments were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mass of marker proteins (kDa) is indicated at the left.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids were constructed (see Fig. 1) expressing the indicated amino acid sequences inserted between the signal peptide and GFP, and the polarity of protein secretion was assessed in transfected MDCK cells. Ala residues replacing Ser or Thr in wild type mucin-like repeats are in boldface. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Digestions with neuraminidase and O-glycanase showed that the mucin repeats were extensively O-glycosylated (Fig.2 B). Secreted MAB-GFP and His6MAB-GFP had apparent masses of 53 and 56 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and7). Enzymatic removal of O-linked oligosaccharides reduced the apparent mass of each protein to 34 and 36 kDa (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 8), and these values are similar to the calculated masses of 34.5 and 36.6 kDa, respectively, for the polypeptides alone. The specificity of these glycosidases suggests that the oligosaccharide structures consist almost exclusively of monosialylated or disialylated structures, which are related to Siaα2–3Galβ1–3(Siaα2–6)GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr (22Umemoto J. Bhavanandan V.P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8609-8614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mucin repeat A contains a potential N-glycosylation site (Asn-Phe-Ser), further digestion with N-glycanase or endoglycosidase H did not affect the mass of MAB-GFP and His6-MABGFP, indicating that this site is not utilized (data not shown). As expected, GFP (27.5 kDa) was not glycosylated (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). However, His6-gGFP was O-glycosylated, presumably on one or more of the Ser/Thr residues flanking the His6 tag sequence. The removal of O-linked oligosaccharides reduced the apparent mass from 33–37 to 30 kDa (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4), which is similar to the calculated mass of 29.6 kDa for the polypeptide alone. Despite this O-glycosylation, His6-gGFP was secreted randomly (Table I). The number of mucin repeats in enteropeptidase varies considerably, with one repeat in human, two in bovine and porcine, three in rat, and four in mouse enteropeptidase (21Yuan X. Zheng X., Lu, D. Rubin D.C. Pung C.Y. Sadler J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G342-349PubMed Google Scholar). Such heterogeneity suggests that targeting signals could reside in single mucin repeats. Therefore, the behavior of chimeric proteins containing mucin repeat A or B was examined. When stably expressed in MDCK cells, constructs containing either mucin repeat were secreted apically (Fig.3 A and Table I), indicating that both repeats possess functional targeting signals. Glycosidase digestions demonstrated that each mucin repeat wasO-glycosylated (Fig. 3 B) and notN-glycosylated (data not shown). The enteropeptidase mucin repeats contain 11 Ser/Thr residues that could beO-glycosylated (Fig. 1 A) (20Kitamoto Y. Yuan X., Wu, Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Replacement of all Ser/Thr residues by alanine abolished the targeting activity of mucin repeat A, whether present in one or three copies (Fig.4 and Table I). Mucin repeat B had reduced but significant apical targeting activity after all Ser/Thr residues were mutated, suggesting that features of the amino acid sequence may contribute to targeting (Fig. 4 and Table I). Glycosidase digestions confirmed that none of these constructs hadN-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides (data not shown). The role of O-linked glycosylation was investigated further by restoring selected Ser/Thr residues, singly or in clusters. For mucin repeat A, all constructs that contained any Ser/Thr residues were O-glycosylated and constructs MAS172A/T173A/S175A-GFP and MAT173A-GFP lost apical targeting activity (Fig. 5 and Table I). These data suggest that O-glycosylation is not sufficient for apical targeting and that a central cluster of Ser/Thr residues may be important for apical targeting of MA-GFP. As observed for mucin repeat A, all mucin repeat B constructs that contained Ser/Thr residues wereO-glycosylated, including MB-T184A/T185A/S186A-GFP, which has only one Thr residue (Fig. 6). Mutation of Thr-185 alone randomized the targeting of MB-T185A-GFP, whereas all other mutants tested retained apical targeting similar to that of MB-GFP (Fig. 6 and Table I). Therefore,O-glycans appear not to be required, but the modification of selected Ser/Thr residues can inhibit or potentiate the apical targeting of MB-GFP.Figure 6Mutation of selected Ser/Thr residues in mucin repeat B. The amino acid sequence inserted before GFP is given in Table I for the indicated constructs. The polarity of protein secretion (Panel A) and sensitivity to digestion with neuraminidase and O-glycanase (Panel B) were assessed as described in the Fig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, have been proposed to participate in the delivery of many apically sorted proteins (23Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar), but enteropeptidase appears to be an exception. Bovine enteropeptidase, a type II transmembrane protein, was targeted to the apical membrane of transfected MDCK cells, but association with lipid rafts could not be demonstrated (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for secreted MAB-GFP (Fig.7), which contains a subset of the apical targeting signals found in full-length enteropeptidase. Triton X-100 lysates were prepared from MDCK cells expressing GFP and MAB-GFP, and the extracts were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Caveolin, a marker for lipid rafts, was recovered in low-density fractions 4–5 near the top of the gradient (Fig. 7). In contrast, GFP (Fig. 7 A) and MAB-GFP (Fig. 7 B) were recovered in denser fractions at the bottom of the gradient. Therefore, MAB-GFP is secreted apically but does not appear to associate intracellularly with lipid rafts. The results presented here show that small mucin-like peptides of 12–15 amino acid residues, derived from bovine enteropeptidase, can direct the apical secretion of GFP. O-glycosylation contributes to the efficiency of apical targeting, but no specificO-glycan appears to be required. For mucin repeat B, some apical targeting activity persists after all glycosylation sites are eliminated by mutagenesis (Table I). Several O-glycosylated peptides have no targeting activity in this system, indicating that glycosylation alone is not sufficient. Some apical membrane and secreted proteins associate with lipid rafts, but this is not the case for transmembrane or soluble variants of enteropeptidase (2Zheng X., Lu, D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) Apically secreted mucin-GFP chimeric proteins also did not associate with rafts (Fig. 7). Therefore, enteropeptidase mucin-like domains contain relatively compact apical targeting signals that depend on bothO-glycosylation and amino acid sequence context but appear to function independent of lipid rafts. This appears to be the first example of an O-glycosylated peptide that can confer apical targeting on a randomly sorted heterologous protein. Previous studies have implicated O-glycans in the apical targeting of several proteins, although the evidence is indirect and mixed. Sucrase-isomaltase (12Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the neurotrophin receptor (16Yeaman C., Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L., Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) are membrane proteins with O-glycosylated stalk regions adjacent to their transmembrane domains. Both are targeted to the apical surface of MDCK cells, and deletion of their stalk domains abolishes apical targeting (12Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Yeaman C., Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L., Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These data suggest that O-glycosylation mediates apical targeting, but other studies suggest that sorting signals reside elsewhere. Replacement of the N-terminal transmembrane domain with a cleaved signal peptide causes the random secretion of sucrase-isomaltase despite the presence of theO-glycosylated stalk, suggesting that membrane association contributes to targeting and the stalk region is not sufficient (12Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The replacement of Gln-117 by Arg, at a location near the N terminus of the isomaltase domain, causes random delivery to the apical and basolateral membranes of MDCK cells and suggests that features of sucrase-isomaltase distinct from its stalk region are necessary for targeting (24Spodsberg N. Jacob R. Alfalah M. Zimmer K.P. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23506-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, O-glycosylation does not correlate with the apical targeting of aminopeptidase N and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, which are apical membrane proteins withO-glycosylated stalk regions near their transmembrane domains. Deletion of these stalk regions does not affect their apical targeting in MDCK cells (25Vogel L.K. Noren O. Sjostrom H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Panzer P. Preuss U. Joberty G. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13861-13969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These various studies indicate that O-glycosylation can contribute to apical targeting but is not sufficient and sometimes is not necessary. Enteropeptidase mucin-like domains exhibit similar properties, in that their apical targeting activity is diminished by mutagenesis of only certain O-glycosylated residues (e.g. Thr-173 or Thr-185, Table I). Such residues might bear oligosaccharides that are particularly potent targeting signals, possibly disialylated species. Clustered O-linked oligosaccharides might be required for targeting, and disruption of a central member of the cluster could be sufficient to impair targeting. Although the accumulating data do not exclude a direct targeting function for O-glycans, other models appear to be equally plausible. For example, O-glycans could play an indirect role, supporting a primary targeting signal that resides elsewhere in the protein (27Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Alternatively, features of protein and oligosaccharide structure could collaborate to form a complete targeting signal that contains both carbohydrate and peptide determinants, in which case these structures could be spatially close together. Any of these models would be compatible with the observation that short O-glycosylated peptides can target GFP for apical secretion. The association of membrane proteins with lipid rafts often correlates with their delivery to apical cell surfaces but, as noted for the proposed relationship between O-glycosylation and targeting, many exceptions are known. Sucrose-isomaltase, aminopeptidase N, aminopeptidase A, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV associate mainly with lipid rafts (12Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the ectodomains of placental alkaline phosphatase and the neurotrophin receptor have not (33Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542sCrossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mucin-like domains of enteropeptidase direct apical secretion of GFP in the absence of a demonstrable association with lipid rafts (Fig. 7). These results indicate that stable binding to lipid rafts is not a requirement for apical protein sorting. Weaker associations that are not preserved during the isolation of rafts might contribute to targeting, and different experimental approaches would be required to identify them. Apical targeting can occur with or without stable raft association, glycosylation, or membrane anchoring. However, the apical targeting of specific proteins has been found to depend on one or more of these particular features. This heterogeneity may reflect the existence of multiple apical sorting pathways that employ distinct signals. Alternatively, the apparent diversity of signals could reflect an indirect role of various protein structures, such as oligosaccharides, in the stabilization of a single class of sorting determinant that could be protein-based (27Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These classes of mechanism need not be mutually exclusive. Studies of the relatively simple targeting signals present in enteropeptidase mucin-like domains may facilitate the evaluation of these models."
https://openalex.org/W1999753882,"To gain insight into the mechanism by which the αMI-domain of integrin αMβ2 interacts with multiple and unrelated ligands, the identity of the neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) recognition site was sought. A systematic strategy in which individual amino acid residues within three previously implicated segments were changed to those in the αLI-domain, which is structurally very similar but does not bind NIF, was implemented. The capacity of the resulting mutants, expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, to recognize NIF was assessed. These analyses ultimately identified Asp149, Arg151, Gly207, Tyr252, and Glu258 as critical for NIF binding. Cation binding, a function of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, was assessed by terbium luminescence to evaluate conformational perturbations induced by the mutations. All five mutants bound terbium with unaltered affinities. When the five residues were inserted into the αLI-domain, the chimera bound NIF with high affinity. Another ligand of αMβ2, C3bi, which is known to use the same segments of the αMI-domain in engaging the receptor, failed to bind to the chimeric αLI-domain. Thus, the αMI-domain appears to present a mosaic of exposed amino acids within surface loops on its MIDAS face, and different ligands interact with different residues to attain high affinity binding. To gain insight into the mechanism by which the αMI-domain of integrin αMβ2 interacts with multiple and unrelated ligands, the identity of the neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) recognition site was sought. A systematic strategy in which individual amino acid residues within three previously implicated segments were changed to those in the αLI-domain, which is structurally very similar but does not bind NIF, was implemented. The capacity of the resulting mutants, expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, to recognize NIF was assessed. These analyses ultimately identified Asp149, Arg151, Gly207, Tyr252, and Glu258 as critical for NIF binding.

Each α and β subunit is composed of a short cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain (several hundred amino acids) to which numerous ligands bind. αMβ2 is a member of the β2integrin subfamily, which also includes αLβ2, αXβ2, and αDβ2. These integrins share a common β subunit (CD18) of 95 kDa, which is noncovalently linked to distinct but homologous ∼150-kDa α subunits (8Springer T.A. Scand. J.

The molecular mechanism by which αMβ2 can interact with so many structurally unrelated ligands and yet exhibit high affinity for each is unknown.

Integrin β subunits, including β2, may also contain an I-like domain (40Leitinger B. Hogg N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 614-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The αMI-domain and αLI-domain were the first of several I-domains to have their three-dimensional structures solved by x-ray crystallography (41Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 42Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). They are all similar, being composed of six or seven α-helices and five β-sheets connected by flexible loops. A cation-binding site is formed at the vertex of the β-sheets, and the bound cation is coordinated in a MIDAS motif (41Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Point mutations at residues involved in coordination of cation within the αMI-domain destroy C3bi binding to the αMβ2 receptor (34Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Using blocking monoclonal antibodies, which map to the I-domain or recombinant αMI-domains, the MIDAS face of the αMI-domain has been implicated in the binding of ICAM-1 and fibrinogen (36Diamond M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the αMI-domain can fold and function as an independent structural unit, capable of interacting with many different proteins. Nevertheless, the ligand binding function of αMβ2 is not merely a property of its I-domain. The β2 subunit and the EF-hand-like cation binding domain adjacent to the I-domain in the α subunit also may contribute to ligand recognition (47Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23729-23736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NIF was originally identified as an activity within the extracts of canine hookworms that inhibited many neutrophil functions, such as adhesion to endothelial cells and the respiratory burst (21Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y., De Meutter J. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These effects arose from its specific binding to αMβ2 but not to other β2integrins. Subsequently, it was shown that NIF completely blocked αMβ2-mediated binding of C3bi (38Ueda T. Rieu P. Brayer J. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10680-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and ICAM-1 (22Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and partially blocked fibrinogen binding (37Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to αMβ2-bearing cells. As an antagonist, NIF has been shown effective in attenuating the deleterious effects of excessive neutrophil activation, such as tissue damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury in an animal model (48Barnard J.W. Biro M.G. Lo S.K. Ohno S. Carozza M.A. Moyle M. Soule H.R. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Bauer C. Siaplaouras S. Soule H.R. Moyle M. Marzi I. Shock. 1995; 4: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and, hence, it is a potential anti-inflammatory drug. Three specific segments, Pro147–Arg152, Pro201–Lys217, and Asp248–Arg261, on the face of the αMI-domain containing the MIDAS were implicated in NIF binding by a homologous scanning mutagenesis approach (50Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this approach, small structural units (helices, β-sheets, and loops) in the αMI-domain were replaced by the homologous sequences from the αLI-domain, and the segments noted above were identified as being necessary for NIF binding. In the present report, we have sought to precisely define the amino acids within these segments that are required for high affinity recognition of NIF by αMI-domain, thereby defining the molecular basis for binding of this model ligand to αMβ2. Ultimately, five individual amino acid residues are identified within the αMI-domain as being critical to NIF binding. The placement of these five residues and our knowledge of the contact sites for other residues in the αMI-domain support a new molecular explanation for the capacity of this integrin to recognize multiple ligands. NIF was kindly provided by Corvas International (San Diego, CA). The NIF used in this study was a recombinant protein expressed in Pichia pastoris and was purified to homogeneity as described Muchowski et al. (37Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 44, IB4, and CBL 189 were obtained from Sigma, the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. The cDNAs of αMI-domain (675 nucleotides, Arg115–Ser340) and αLI-domain (630 nucleotides, Pro120–Ser330) were cloned and inserted into the pGEX-5X-3 expression vector (37Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All wild-type and mutant I-domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins. Mutations were created in these I-domains by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The selective introduction of the desired mutations into the I-domains was confirmed by DNA sequence analyses. I-domain expression plasmids were used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells (BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene). One liter of L broth (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA), containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma), was inoculated with 1 ml of an overnight culture of transformed E. coli, and cells were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until an absorbance of 0.6–1 OD at 600 nm was attained. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Amersham Biosciences). Four hours after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (PBS containing 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem) and 50 μg/ml leupeptin (Calbiochem)). Cells were disrupted with four 30-s cycles at 70 watts in a Branson Ultrasonics power sonicator. Insoluble cellular membranes were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-I-domain fusion proteins were present in the supernatant and were purified by adsorption onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and elution with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm glutathione, 2.5 mmCaCl2). Such preparations of the fusion proteins were ∼90% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Concentrations of purified proteins were determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) and by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. NIF (100 μg) was radiolabeled with 0.7–1.0 mCi of Na125I (AmershamBiosciences) using the IODO-BEADS iodination reagent from Pierce. The reaction mix was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. Radiolabeled protein was separated from free iodine by gel filtration through a PD10-DG column (Bio-Rad) using PBS containing 1% BSA (Calbiochem) as the elution buffer. The specific activity of radiolabeled protein was ∼12 μCi/μg. To assess NIF binding to the recombinant I-domains,125I-NIF (from 66 pm to 330 nm) was mixed with 1 μg of αMI-domain (or αLI-domain) fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm Ca2+in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated overnight with agitation at 4 °C. The resin then was washed three times with TBS, and bound 125I-NIF was measured with a γ counter. Based upon the previous evidence that NIF binds to a single high affinity binding site in the αMI-domain, NIF titration data were fit to a single site binding model using the following equation: [NIF]bound = Bmax × [NIF]/(Kd + [NIF]), where Bmax represents the maximal binding and Kd is its dissociation constant, using the SigmaPlot program (Jandel Co., San Rafael, CA). Kd values in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III are presented as means ± S.D. For selected experiments, the I-domain was cleaved from its GST fusion partner by incubation of the recombinant protein adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B with factor Xa (10 μg/ml factor Xa per 200 μg/ml I-domain) overnight at room temperature with agitation. The cleaved αMI-domain was recovered by washing the resin with 3 column volumes of TBS, and the eluate was concentrated by centrifugation through a Millipore membrane. For solid phase binding assays with the isolated αMI-domain, 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with the αMI-domain at 50 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C and postcoated with 3% BSA. 125I-NIF was added, and binding was measured as described above. C3bi binding was performed as described by Bilsland et al. (51Bilsland C.A. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar) with certain modifications. Sheep erythrocytes (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO) at 7 × 108 were washed twice in HBSS, containing 5 mm HEPES and 1 mm Mg2+, and treated with anti-sheep erythrocyte IgM antibody M1/87 (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co., Westbury, NY) and human C5-deficient serum (Sigma). The coated erythrocytes were surface-labeled with biotin using 1 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) at 37 °C for 20 min. The biotinylated cells were resuspended in 0.9 ml of HBSS with 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm Ca2+, and 1 mm Mg2+; mixed with 100 μl of C5-deficient serum; and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After washing twice, the resulting erythrocytes were resuspended in 2 ml of the above solution, and the cells were disrupted in a sonicator (Branson Ultrasonics, VWR Scientific) with one 3-s cycle at 70 watts. The insoluble cellular material recovered by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C was used as a C3bi source. To test the interaction of the wild-type αM, αL, and chimeric I-domains with C3bi, 96-well plates (Immulon 4BX; Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) were coated with the I-domains at 50 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C and postcoated with 2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times, the C3bi in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2, was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times, the bound C3bi was detected using avidin-alkaline phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. As a control, the background reaction on BSA-coated wells was subtracted. Tb3+luminescence experiments were performed as previously described (52Cierniewski C.S. Haas T.A. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12238-12246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength used was 285 nm, and Tb3+emission was measured at 545 nm. Emission spectra were corrected for the blank contribution, and the instrument response and normalized to an absorbance of 0.100 at 285 nm in a quartz cell of 0.5- or 1-cm path length. All measurements were made in an FP-777 spectrofluorometer (Jaco, Hauppauge, NY). Gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 8% acrylamide gels. Proteins were detected in the gels by staining with 0.04% Coomassie G-250 (Bio-Rad). The model building of the αMI-domain based upon its crystal structure (54Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank code 1JLM, was carried out using InsightII (MSI, San Diego, CA) using the program defaults, unless otherwise stated, on a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station. The charges on the amino acids of αMI-domain were adjusted to pH 7.2. The I-domain was then soaked with five layers of water, and the minimized energy conformation was obtained by gradually annealing the protein water as previously described (55Bjornholm B. Jorgensen F.S. Schwartz T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The resulting minimized structure was then subjected to a series of molecular dynamic simulations and energy minimizations, referred to as the molecular simulation procedure. Docking was performed manually with a distance cut-off of 15 Å using MSI's docking program. Final van der Waals and electrostatic energies of interaction were obtained using a distance cut-off of 100 Å. Previous studies have established that the αMI-domain is sufficient to account for the high affinity and specific binding of NIF to integrin αMβ2 (21Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, based upon a homolog mutagenesis strategy, in which homologous small structural elements, α-helixes, β-sheets, and connecting loops of the αMI-domain were swapped into the αLI-domain, three segments, corresponding to connecting loops on the cation-binding MIDAS face of the I-domain were specifically implicated in NIF recognition by αMβ2 (50Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These segments were Pro147–Arg152, Pro201–Lys217, or Asp248–Arg261 (numbering based on the amino acid sequence of intact αM; Pro201–Lys217 actually consisted of two contiguous segments, Pro201–Gly207 and Arg208–Lys217, but are combined for simplicity). Based upon these results, we sought to localize the specific amino acid residues within these segments of the αMI-domain that are required for the high affinity recognition of NIF, thereby providing a molecular basis for recognition of this by αMβ2. To begin this analysis, wild-type αMI-domain (Arg115–Ser340), wild-type αLI-domain (Pro120–Ser330), and the three homolog scanning mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were purified from the bacterial lysates on glutathione-Sepharose. The purified I-domains migrated as major bands of ∼48 and ∼52 kDa for αLI-domain and αMI-domain, respectively, when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2), consistent with their predicted molecular weights. The three homolog scanning mutants also migrated as single bands on the gels (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5). A facile binding assay for quantifying NIF binding to the recombinant I-domains was developed by measuring the binding of125I-NIF to the recombinant I-domains captured onto glutathione-Sepharose. 1 mm Ca2+ was used as the cation. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the beads were washed by centrifugation and counted. As shown in Fig. 2A, 125I-NIF exhibited minimal reaction with glutathione-Sepharose. Minimal reaction also was observed between the αLI-domain fusion protein and radiolabeled NIF (Fig. 2A). With the αMI-domain, binding was observed, which was dependent on the concentration of 125I-NIF added; 50% saturation was attained at 170 pm added. The Kd of the interaction of 125I-NIF with the αMI-domain GST fusion protein was estimated from a Scatchard plot to be 5 nm, consistent with the reported Kd of NIF for the αMI-domain (22Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and for intact αMβ2 (50Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A similar interaction of125I-NIF with the αMI-domain that was cleaved from the GST fusion protein and immobilized directly to the microtiter plates was also observed (see Fig. 2A). The Kd of this interaction was estimated to be 4 nm, indicating that the GST fusion partner did not influence NIF binding to the αMI-domain. The specificity of the interaction of radiolabeled NIF with the αMI-domain was indicated by the ability of nonlabeled NIF and EDTA to block binding (Fig. 2B). The inhibition produced by unlabeled NIF at 5 nm was 80% and did not increase further when the concentration of unlabeled NIF was increased by 20-fold, indicating that ∼20% of the binding of the radiolabeled ligand was nonspecific. In separate experiments, we found that the capacity of unlabeled NIF to inhibit the binding of12"

Pre-mRNA splicing is the post-transcriptional maturation step that removes nuclear introns from primary transcripts of split genes. Introns are recognized by inspection of conserved sequences that define the sites of cleavage at the 5′ and the 3′ border. These sequences promote the assembly of a large ribonucleoprotein complex, called the spliceosome, that catalyzes the two transesterification steps leading to intron removal and exon joining. Spliceosome assembly is traditionally believed to occur in a temporally ordered and sequential manner, although a more recent view holds that a preformed spliceosomal entity exists independently of the precursor RNA (1Stevens S.W.

One of the first steps is the recognition of the 5′ splice site (5′SS) by the U1 snRNP particle. The 3′ region of the intron is subsequently recognized by a complex formed by the branch point binding protein (yBBP/hSF1) and the associated yMud2p/hU2AF factor that, at least in metazoans, binds to the pyrimidine-rich region downstream of the branch point (5Berglund J.A.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These steps define the first complexes, which can be isolated by biochemical means, called the commitment or E complex (respectively in yeast and metazoans). The first ATP-requiring step is the formation of the pre-spliceosome. In this complex, the U2 snRNP interacts with the branch point sequence by base pairing, thereby replacing the yBBP·Mud2p complex. A number of protein factors, among them two ATPases, Sub2p and Prp5p, are involved in this step (7Kistler A.L. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9O'Day C.L.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After the interaction of the preformed tri-snRNP particle (U4/U6-U5 snRNP) the spliceosome enters a series of structural rearrangements during which the U1 and U4 snRNPs are displaced and the spliceosome is activated (11Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The U6 snRNA is a focal point in these rearrangements: it replaces the U1 snRNA in a mutually exclusive interaction with the 5′ splice site, while base pairing with U4 snRNA is disrupted to allow interaction with the U2 snRNP. Disruption and formation of RNA/RNA, RNA/protein, and protein/protein interactions that are often mutually exclusive is carefully controlled by a family of RNA-dependent ATPases (or RNA helicases) to ensure the folding, positioning, and activation of the catalytic center in a timely fashion (11Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Recognition of the 5′ splice site is paradigmatic in this regard. In yeast, the 5′SS sequence is first recognized by base pairing with the 5′ arm of U1 snRNA. Based on genetic and cross-linking studies, it is believed that U1 snRNP-associated proteins, among them U1Cp, Prp40p, Nam8p, and the Sm complex, stabilize this interaction (12Kao H.Y. Siliciano P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Puig O. Gottschalk A. Fabrizio P. Seraphin B.

Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recently (16Du H. Rosbash M. RNA. 2001; 7: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) it has been shown that the protein component of U1 snRNP can recognize to some extent the 5′ splice site sequence even in the absence of base pairing interaction. The U1 snRNP is displaced from the 5′SS later in the process, allowing base pairing between the U4G5U6 portion of the 5′SS and the U6 snRNA. This step is ATP-dependent and is somehow controlled by the Prp28p DEAD box helicase (17Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism of action of this protein is still unknown. It has been suggested that this transition at the 5′SS is operated by unwinding the U1 snRNA·5′SS duplex (17Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and/or by actively displacing the U1Cp protein (18Chen J.Y. Stands L. Staley J.P. Jackups R.R., Jr. Latus L.J. Chang T.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 227-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that Prp28p somehow favors more directly the association of U6 snRNA. Finally, two additional factors have been shown by genetic and biochemical experiments to interact with the 5′SS region: the U5 snRNA and Prp8p, which interact with the last nucleotides of the 5′ exon and the first nucleotides of the intron (19Siatecka M. Reyes J.L. Konarska M.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Collins C.A. Guthrie C.

Cell. 1992; 68: 743-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The sequence of the 5′ splice site is therefore the result of multiple selective constraints, which is generally difficult to deconvolute. In yeast, the large majority of introns contain the sequence GUAUGU at the 5′ border. This sequence is only partially complementary to the 5′ region of the U1 snRNA, which leads to the formation of a partially base paired RNA duplex in the U1 snRNP·pre-mRNA complex. This duplex contains a non-Watson-Crick interaction between U4of the 5′SS and a pseudo-uridine (Ψ5) of U1 snRNA (26Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This mismatch is absent in higher eucaryotes where the 4th intronic nucleotide is generally an A that can base pair with Ψ5. The conservation of U4 in the yeast 5′SS might be explained by its interaction with the U6 snRNA. However, the presence of Ψ5 in the U1 snRNA (and of the Ψ5-U4 mismatch) remains unexplained. Although it was previously suggested that it might constitute a determinant of stability (27Seraphin B. Rosbash M. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 82: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), this hypothesis was never demonstrated. We provide here evidence that the presence of the mismatch induces a stabilization of the interaction between the U1 snRNP and the 5′SS. Surprisingly we found that the stability of the mismatch-containing complex is comparable to the stability of a complex containing a fully paired U1 snRNA·pre-mRNA duplex. By performing SELEX experiments we also obtained an artificial phylogeny, which allows the isolation of the selective constraint on the 5′SS solely due to U1 snRNP binding. RNA substrates for U1 snRNP binding and immunoprecipitation experiments were synthesized from PCR products carrying a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The full sequence is shown in Fig. 1. Biotinylated BP-U and BP-A RNAs were prepared as described previously (17Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide 5′-U1Ψ was purchased from Dharmacon Research and is identical to the first 11 nt of U1 snRNA. Extracts were prepared with the Umen and Guthrie method (28Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The U170kHA yeast strain was a gift from J. Tang. The nam8Δ,U170kHA strain was obtained from the U170kHA strain by deleting NAM8 with a PCR-based gene disruption method (29Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out essentially as described in Abovitch et al. (30Abovich N. Liao X.C. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5–2 fmol of radioactive RNA were incubated at 25 °C in ATP-depleted extracts or U2 snRNA-inactivated extracts for the times indicated. The 30-μl reactions were diluted into 500 μl of NET100 containing 20 μl of GammaBind Plus beads (Amersham Biosciences) preincubated with anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After extensive washings, the radioactive RNA was recovered by phenol extraction and analyzed by PAGE. Alternatively the amount of complex formed was evaluated by counting the radioactivity associated with the beads. As a control for immunoprecipitation efficiency, U1 snRNA from a fraction of the recovered RNA was primer-extended. This method was very sensitive and reliable, although the absolute amount of immunoprecipitated material depended somewhat on the particular extract preparation. In this respect, comparisons between different RNAs for U1 snRNP binding were always performed in side by side experiments. Complex stability was assessed by adding a 100-fold excess of cold RNA after a 20-min incubation of radioactive RNA in the extract. Aliquots of the reaction were immunoprecipitated at various time points as described. Oligonucleotide 5′-U1Ψ was incubated for 20 min with biotinylated BP-U or BP-A in splicing salts before addition of streptavidin-agarose beads and incubation for 15 min. The retained radioactivity was measured after extensive washings. The starting pool of sequences was constructed by PCR as described previously (31Libri D. Lescure A. Rosbash M. RNA. 2000; 6: 352-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the first SELEX experiment (8N selection) 8 nt were randomized 2 nt downstream of the branch point sequence. The short random window was specifically chosen to preclude selection of an aptamer to one of the U1 snRNP components. In the second experiment (4N + 3N selection), the U1 snRNP canonical binding site (GGUAUGU) was included as a constant region, and 4 nt upstream and 3 nt downstream were the randomized portion. Selection was performed by incubating the pool in the tagged extract for 15 min and immunoprecipitating the complexes as described above. The process was reiterated after reverse transcription-PCR amplification and T7 transcription and stopped when the selected pools bound U1 snRNP better than the BP-U RNA (respectively six and four cycles for the 8N and 4N + 3N selections). The winning pools were cloned and sequenced together with 15 clones derived from the nonselected pools to determine the nucleotide bias. Sequences from the 8N selection were aligned according to two criteria: first, the GGUA motif that was almost universally present (only three sequences did not contain the first G); and second, complementarity to the U1 snRNA 5′ arm was used to align the remaining three sequences (sequences 3, 12, and 19) and to define the register of interaction with the U1 snRNP (and thereby the family assignment based on the identity of the 4th nucleotide). For three sequences (sequences 5, 11, and 16) the pattern of alignment according to the U1 snRNA complementarity is ambiguous, and they could be classified in the Ψ-G family provided that the GGUA pattern is misaligned in these sequences. One likely possibility is that these sequences have evolved a “double” and overlapping U1 snRNA binding site (e.g. in sequence 5, u G1UAG4GUA7 Au and uGU A−2GG1UAA4 u), which is likely to confer a kinetic advantage by lowering the entropic cost for binding. Interestingly six sequences of 32 winners of the 4N + 3N selection have also independently evolved a motif (UGUAin the 4 nt that precede the canonical GGUAUGU) that could allow a double and overlapping U1 snRNP binding site. The expected ΔG for the formation of the RNA duplex with the U1 snRNA arm was calculated with the help of the MFOLD server (bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/∼mfold) using version 3.1 of the MFOLD program and the latest version of the free energy parameters (version 3.0) (32Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 33Xia T. Santa Lucia J., Jr. Burkard M.E. Kierzek R. Schroeder S.J. Jiao X. Cox C.

Algorithms and Thermodynamics for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: A Practical Guide in RNA Biochemistry and Bio/Technology, NATO ASI Series. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 11-43Google Scholar). A free energy term of +4.1 kcal/mol for duplex initiation and a penalty of +0.45 kcal/mol for terminal AU base pairs have been included in the calculation (33Xia T. Santa Lucia J., Jr. Burkard M.E. Kierzek R. Schroeder S.J. Jiao X. Cox C. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14719-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In the absence of measured free energy parameters, the contribution of the Ψ-U noncanonical pair has been approximated as a U-U mismatch. Kd values have been calculated with the equation: Kd = exp(ΔG/RT), where R is the gas constant (1.987 cal K−1 mol−1) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. A χ2 test (3 degrees of freedom) was used to assess the statistical significance of base conservation in the 4N + 3N selection experiment. The composition of the initial pool was estimated from sequencing 15 randomly chosen unselected clones (A: 0.2; C: 0.15; U: 0.35; G: 0.30). Conservations significantly different from the composition of the initial pool (p < 0.001) are shown in uppercase and underlined in the consensus. We have previously demonstrated using in vivo randomization-selection experiments (31Libri D. Lescure A. Rosbash M. RNA. 2000; 6: 352-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) that a sequence identical to the intronic portion of a 5′ splice site can act as a splicing enhancer in yeast when located immediately downstream of the branch point sequence. Our experiments also suggested that U1 snRNP was the mediator of this enhancer effect. The conservation in our selected sequences of a U at position 4 was, however, somewhat surprising. The presence of this nucleotide decreases complementarity of the enhancer sequence with the U1 snRNA. Even more puzzling was the observation that substitution of an A for U4 (GUAaGU), which promotes uninterrupted base pairing with the 5′ arm of U1, led to almost complete loss of splicing enhancement (31Libri D. Lescure A. Rosbash M. RNA. 2000; 6: 352-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These experiments suggested that the presence of the Ψ-U noncanonical interaction might somehow favor the interaction of U1 snRNP with the enhancer sequence (and as a consequence, with the bona fide 5′SS). To test this hypothesis, we set up in vitro pull-down experiments with a variety of small 54-nt synthetic RNAs containing the relevant region. Splicing extracts were prepared from yeast strains containing a HA-tagged form of the U1 snRNP-associated U170K (or Prp40p, data not shown) protein. The substrate RNA, containing a branch point sequence, the wild type or a mutated enhancer sequence, and the 3′ end of the RP51B intron (Fig. 1 A) were incubated in the tagged or control untagged extract, and the U1 snRNP-containing complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. The radioactive RNA that co-immunoprecipitates with the U1 snRNP complex was extracted and analyzed by denaturing PAGE. An aliquot of the purified RNA was primer-extended with an oligonucleotide complementary to U1 snRNA to ensure that immunoprecipitation was equally effective in all cases. Besides the selected sequence (BP-UGUAUGU), we used a U−1G mutant (BP-gGUAUGU), a U4A mutant (BP-UGUAaGU), and a U−1G,U4A mutant (BP-gGUAaGU). All these mutations were expected to increase the complementarity between U1 snRNA and the tested RNA sequences. Surprisingly, while the U−1G mutation led to the expected increase in the amount of complex formed (Fig. 2 A, compare lane 3 with 5 and lane 7 with 9), the mutants that restore base pairing at the “mismatched” position (BP-uGUAaGU, lane 9, and BP-GGUAaGU, lane 7) interacted less efficiently with U1 snRNP than the corresponding sequences that retain the mismatch (respectively BP-uGUAUGU, lane 3, and BP-GGUAUGU, lane 5). U1 snRNP interacted with the tested RNAs via its 5′ arm since formation of the complex was specifically outcompeted by an excess of a complementary 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B). Depletion of U2 snRNP (Fig. 2 B) or incubation in the presence of ATP (data not shown) had no significant effect on the relative efficiency of complex formation. Since the tested sequences are virtually identical to bona fide 5′ splice sites (with or without the U-Ψ mismatch), these experiments suggest the surprising conclusion that conservation of U at the fourth position of introns and of a Ψ at the fifth position of U1 snRNA is at least partially linked to the formation or stability of the U1 snRNP·pre-mRNA complex. To investigate more closely the stabilizing role of the Ψ-U mismatch, we decided to pursue this work with the two substrates that gave the highest amount of complex, notably BP-gGUAUGU (hereafter called BP-U) and BP-gGUAaGU (BP-A), containing, respectively, a U and an A at the fourth position. To estimate the amount of complex formed in the various conditions described below, we simply measured the amount of radioactive RNA retained on the beads with the U1 snRNP after incubation in extract, immunoprecipitation, and extensive washings. As before, the appropriate controls were performed with nontagged extracts and with primer extension to verify that equivalent amounts of U1 snRNA were retained on the beads. Finally, an aliquot of RNA-containing supernatant was analyzed by denaturing PAGE to ensure that the stability of BP-A and BP-U RNAs in the extract was equivalent (data not shown). Since the absolute amount of complex formation was somewhat dependent on different extracts preparations, comparisons between different RNAs was always performed in side by side experiments. Formation of the complex with U1 snRNP might occur faster for BP-U than for BP-A. Alternatively, the former complex might be intrinsically more stable than the latter. In a first attempt to answer this question, we analyzed the time course of complex formation for both substrates. At early time points both complexes were formed at equivalent rates, although in some experiments BP-A complex formation was faster (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). At later time points BP-U reproducibly formed more complex than BP-A, confirming the data shown in Fig. 2. We reasoned that the presence of a branch point sequence upstream of the U1 snRNP binding site might somehow affect complex formation or stability. This sequence is a binding site for the BBPp-Mud2p heterodimer (5Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Berglund J.A. Abovich N. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar): the interaction of these proteins 2 nucleotides upstream of the U1 snRNP interaction site might either favor or hinder formation of the complex. In both cases, this might affect to different extents a mismatched and a fully paired U1 snRNA·RNA complex. We then constructed two additional variants of the BP-U and BP-A RNAs in which the branch point sequence was mutated (UACUAAC to UACUggC, constructs GG-U and GG-A) or deleted (Δbp-U and Δbp-A). Mutation of the two As is known to affect binding of BBPp to the branch point (5Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Since the results were identical for the mutation and deletion of the branch point sequence we will only discuss the experiments performed with the former constructs. The four RNAs (BP-A, BP-U, GG-A, and GG-U) were incubated in parallel experiments with tagged and nontagged extracts and were immunoprecipitated as described above (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly mutation of the BP sequence led to an increase in the amount of complex formed (compare constructs GG with constructs BP), suggesting that the branch point sequence located upstream of the 5′ splice site sequence is a destabilizing factor. Most importantly, and surprisingly, this destabilizing effect was stronger when the complex relied on a fully paired U1 snRNA/5′splice site interaction than when the RNA/RNA interaction contained a Ψ-U mismatch. GG-A formed the highest amount of complex, but this amount was strongly reduced in the presence of a nonmutated branch point sequence (construct BP-A); on the contrary, GG-U and BP-U formed roughly the same amount of complex, leading to the observed order GG-A > GG-U ≥ BP-U > BP-A. Whatever the mechanistic reasons for the destabilizing effect of the branch point might be, the outcome of these experiments is compatible with a simple model: once formed, the U1·RNA complex is stabilized depending on the presence of the Ψ-U mismatch in the duplex. The mismatch containing the U1·RNA complex would then be more resistant to the challenging effect of the destabilizing BP sequence. One important implication of this hypothesis is that the higher amount of complex formed with a fully paired BP-less sequence (GG-A) should be less stable than the corresponding, mismatch-containing GG-U·U1 snRNP complex. To address this question we performed the following experiments. We incubated in parallel reactions radiolabeled GG-A and GG-U with U1-tagged extracts for 20 min to allow formation of the U1 snRNP complex. We then added a large excess of cold competitor RNA to isolate the radioactive complex and immunoprecipitated aliquots of the reactions over time to measure the decay rates of the radioactive complexes. We used cold GG-A, cold GG-U, and an equimolar mixture of the two: since the results were identical in the three cases, we only show results obtained with the latter experiment. As shown in Fig. 4, the amount of radioactive complex retained on the beads decreased faster for the fully paired GG-A·U1 snRNP complex than for GG-U·U1 snRNP, which is consistent with the latter being more stable than the former. In a second experiment, we measured differences in the decay rates of the two purified complexes in the absence of challenging cold competitor by repeatedly washing the beads and measuring the retained radioactivity over time. Although the U1 snRNP·RNA complex decayed more slowly in these conditions, the dissociation rate was again faster for GG-A than for GG-U (data not shown). These experiments strongly suggest that the Ψ-U mismatch plays a role in the stability of the U1 snRNP·5′SS complex. The above experiments suggest that in the presence of a fully paired interaction, a higher amount of complex can be formed (GG-A versus GG-U) that is more “vulnerable” to destabilization and generally less stable. This model predicts that strengthening the U1 snRNP·BP-A interaction should allow the complex to counteract the destabilization due to the branch point sequence. In this case, it is expected that even in the presence of a BP sequence, a hyperstabilized fully paired duplex allows more complex formation than a mismatch-containing counterpart. We than constructed BP-A*, in which an additional base pair was added at position +7 of the donor site, and compared this sequence with BP-U* (which is identical but contains the mismatched position) in our U1 snRNP binding assay (these sequences are identical to the selected sequences 1 and 15, see below). As shown in Fig. 5 A, and consistent with expectations, a higher amount of U1 snRNP-containing complex was formed with BP-A* than with BP-U*. It is possible that the stabilizing nature of the Ψ-U mismatch is linked to the presence of a protein that recognizes the unpaired region of the RNA/RNA interaction. A number of proteins, among them Nam8p, Prp40p, U1Cp, and SmD3p, have been directly involved in the stabilization of the U1 snRNA/pre-mRNA interaction (12Kao H.Y. Siliciano P.G. Mol. Cell.

Our attempts to repeat our in vitro U1 snRNP binding experiments in a U1Cp genetically depleted or heat-inactivated U1Cp thermosensitive strains failed because of the very low amount of complexes formed in these conditions (data not shown).

The protein it encodes is a member of a large family of nuclear proteins harboring a 79-amino acid motif known as a high mobility group (HMG) box (3Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). HMG box-containing proteins can be classified into two major groups based on the degree of sequence specificity in DNA binding and the number of HMG boxes within a protein. One group includes UBF, HMG-1 and MT-TF1, which have multiple HMG boxes and recognize DNA with low or no specificity. The other group includes transcriptional regulators such as LEF-1 and Sox (SRY-box related) proteins, including SRY, that possess a single HMG box and show sequence-specific DNA binding. Thus, the SRY protein is a DNA-binding protein that recognizes certain AT-rich sequences (4Harley V.R. Jackson D.I. Hextall P.J. Hawkins J.R. Berkovitz G.D. Sockanathan S. Lovell-Badge R.

The strong bending of DNA together with the lack of a potential trans-regulation domain in human SRY has led to the suggestion that the protein may modulate transcription by acting architecturally in the assembly of a nucleoprotein complex (9Pontiggia A.

A number of studies of the interactions between SRY and duplex DNA, all using mobility shift assays, have been published (8Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) examined SRY-DNA interactions, but their study was restricted to a construct containing only the HMG box. Similar studies using wild-type and mutant SRY isolated from complete gonadal dysgenesis have been performed but were still restricted to the SRY HMG box (9Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, domains of SRY distinct from the HMG box have been implicated in the modulation of DNA binding properties (16Desclozeaux M. Poulat F. de Santa Barbara P. Soullier S. Jay P. Berta P. Boizet-Bonhoure B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Trimmer et al. (15Trimmer E.E. Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have reported studies of full-length human SRY and human SRY-HMG box domain interactions with a 20-bp DNA oligonucleotide. Their results suggested that the affinities of both constructs were in the nanomolar range but also pointed out sharp binding transitions and higher order complexes with multiples sites on the probes that precluded of a thermodynamic analysis with confidence. The gel mobility shift method provides interesting information concerning the number of stoichiometric complexes formed but suffers from its nonequilibrium nature and the relatively large signal to noise ratio inherent in the titration curves derived from quantification of the bands. The quality of such data is usually insufficient for determination of the presence and degree of cooperativity in binding. In the present work, we have used a fluorescence-based binding assay to quantitatively characterize the interaction between full-length bacterial-expressed human SRY and its target DNA. Our equilibrium assays are based on the observations of changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of a fluorescein-labeled DNA target upon binding by the protein. Because rotational diffusion of the free oligonucleotide is quite rapid, the anisotropy of the fluorescent dye covalently bound to the oligonucleotide is quite low, i.e. little orientation of the polarized exciting light is retained in the emission. However, because binding by the protein significantly slows the rotational diffusion of the oligonucleotide, much more of the exciting light polarization is retained in the emission. These experiments can be performed with very low concentrations of target DNA and provide data of very high precision and reproducibility (17Grillo A.O. Brown M.P. Royer C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Boyer M. Poujol N. Margeat E. Royer C.A.

Biol. 2001; 306: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, they can be used to quantitatively characterize the affinity, cooperativity, and, eventually, the kinetics of biomolecular interactions. To gain further insight into the molecular basis for SRY function, we performed binding experiments with a rare SRY mutant, identified in partial rather than complete gonadal dysgenesis, that may present more subtle biochemical consequences and thus be more difficult to reveal. Only three SRY mutations have been reported to date with this partial clinical presentation, and all of them were located outside the HMG box (20Brown S., Yu, C. Lanzano P. Heller D. Thomas L.

In contrast, the fourth such mutation (Y129N) examined here is located at the C-terminal end of the HMG box. We have used this anisotropy-based assay to evaluate the affinity, specificity, and cooperativity of the interaction between the full-length wild-type and mutant human SRY with the consensus target DNA at various salt concentrations. We also addressed the DNA bending properties of both full-length human SRYs in solution by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). His-tagged proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) under denaturing conditions. DNA encoding for the full-length SRY protein was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from a fertile subject and from the patient presenting with the Y129N substitution. For this purpose, the oligonucleotides SRYs (5′-TCACGGATCCATGCAATCATATGCTTCTG-3′) and SRYas (5′-CTAATTAAGCTTCAGCTTTGTCCAGTGGC-3′) were purchased from Genosys (Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Reaction products and expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) were cleaved with BamHI and Hin dIII, purified, ligated, and cloned into E. coli XL1. The resulting plasmids pQE30-SRYWT and pQE30-SRYY129N were checked by sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into E. coli SG13009-rep4 (Qiagen). The cells were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml neomycin at 37 °C and induced at an A600 of 0.7 with 0.5 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 2h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed under denaturing conditions (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The cell lysates were passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), and the SRY proteins were eluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations (6 m urea, 20 mm bis-Tris-HCl, pH 5.0, 200 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The unfolded protein was subject to a concentration under nitrogen (Amicon, YM10) and then added dropwise to the renaturing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) at 0 °C on ice. The folded proteins were then loaded on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex 75 size exclusion column (AKTA prime; Amersham Biosciences). The proteins eluted at the expected monomer molecular mass were homogeneous by Coomassie Blue staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and their respective concentrations were calculated by using the extinction coefficient (34640 m −1 cm−1 at 280 nm). Oligonucleotides were purchased in HPLC-purified form from Genset S.A. (Paris, France). The fluorescein and rhodamine X labels were incorporated by the supplier using phosphoramidite chemistry, and all the free probe was thus eliminated in the synthesizer and subsequent HPLC purification. The labeling ratios for the oligonucleotides were 60% and 99% for fluorescein- and rhodamine X-labeled oligonucleotides, respectively. The sense and antisense strands were annealed by heating a 1:1 molar ratio of unlabeled antisense with fluorescein-labeled sense strands to 85 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling them in a thermocycler (Gen-amp 2400; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), resulting in a duplex probe used for the anisotropy assays (F-SRBE). A double-labeled duplex probe (F-SRBE-R) intended for FRET was similarly prepared, except that the antisense strand was rhodamine X-labeled. The 23-bp probe referred to here as SRBE has the sequence given below for the sense strand : 5′-CCCTGCAGGTAACAATGTCGGCT-3′. Binding assays were performed using a Beacon 2000 polarization instrument (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) regulated at 4 °C. Each point in the titration curves was obtained by starting with 200 μl of a concentrated solution of SRY and 5 nm F-SRBE. Aliquots of 40 μl were successively removed from the starter solution and replaced by 40 μl containing 5 nm F-SRBE. The buffer solution was 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5 (TEGD buffer) and contained the indicated concentration of KCl. Tubes were equilibrated at 4 °C for 5 min before measurement, and the anisotropy was measured successively until stabilized. The reported values are the average of five to seven measurements after stabilization. Anisotropy is calculated as the ratio of the difference between vertical and horizontal emission intensities (I// and I⊥) normalized to the total intensity: A = (I// − I⊥)/(I// + 2I⊥) Time-resolved fluorescence experiments were performed in the frequency domain using ISS frequency domain acquisition electronics (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). The excitation light was at 450 nm from the frequency doubled mode-locked output of a Spectra Physics Tsunami Titanium-Saphir laser excited with the light of a Millenia X diode-pumped laser. Pulse width was 2 ps at 4 MHz, and the frequency response was measured at harmonic frequencies from 4 to 200 MHz. Emission was measured at 530 nm with a bandpass filter. For FRET, we used a DNA probe containing a fluorescent donor (fluorescein) at the 5′ end of one strand and an acceptor (rhodamine X) at the 5′ end of the other strand. Labeled DNA concentration was 50 nm. The labeling ratio for acceptor was 99%. The labeling ratio for donor was lower (near 60%), but these unlabeled molecules were invisible when monitoring donor quenching. Bending is detected as enhanced FRET efficiency due to a decrease in end-to-end distance. FRET efficiency was calculated from donor intensity in the absence and presence of acceptor (ID and IDA) as E (E = 1 − (IDA/ID)) and D-A distances (R) were calculated from E using a Ro value for this D-A pair of 55 Å, E = Ro6/(Ro6 + R6) where Ro is the characteristic transfer distance. Fits of the frequency response curves in terms of an energy transfer model with a Gaussian distance distribution were carried out using the Globals Unlimited Program (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, Urbana, IL). The His-tagged full-length human SRYWT and SRYY129Nproteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions, followed by renaturation and size exclusion chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In comparison with molecular mass standards and other proteins prepared in the laboratory, SRYs eluted as a peak centered at a molecular mass of 22–25 kDa. The molecular mass calculated from the sequence of the gene expressed in E. coli is 25.7 kDa. It therefore appears that full-length SRY is a monomer in solution in the 1–10 μmconcentration range under our purification conditions. The resulting protein is homogeneous by Coomassie Blue staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Typically, 2 liters of SRY culture yielded 2 ml of a 4 to 8 × 10−6 m solution of pure, native full-length SRY. The target oligonucleotide used was 23 bp in length and derived from the CD3ε gene enhancer, except that it bears the sequence TAACAATG, which allows for 2-fold better binding of SRY HMG box (9Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 a shows a representative (one of four) anisotropy-based binding isotherm of the 5′-fluorescein-labeled SRY-responsive binding element (F-SRBE) at 2 nm with purified full-length SRYWT at 4 °C in the presence of 50 mm KCl in the TEGD buffer. No change in fluorescence intensity accompanied the increase in anisotropy, and lifetime measurements on the free and bound fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide revealed an identical 4.2-ns decay. The anisotropy signal thus directly represents a molar quantity. The anisotropy profile for SRY binding to F-SRBE is characterized by an initial plateau for the unbound DNA, followed by a very cooperative anisotropy increase (<1 log unit) as SRY complexes with the fluorescein-labeled DNA and concluded by a long plateau for saturated binding. Under these equilibrium conditions (target [DNA] < C1/2) the apparent midpoint of binding C1/2 was near 12 nm, in agreement with Trimmer et al. (15Trimmer E.E. Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As noted, the anisotropy profile presented a sharp increase in the anisotropy from the initial to saturating plateau between 4 and 30 nmSRYWT, revealing a very large degree of cooperativity. Simple binding of one protein molecule to the DNA would occur over a range of 1.908 log units. Such a high degree of cooperativity rules out simple monomer binding to the target DNA oligonucleotide and demonstrates the existence of an oligomeric SRY-DNA complex. The large shift in the anisotropy values from the initial (95 × 10−3) to the saturating plateau (225 × 10−3), hardly compatible with a monomer binding to DNA, supports this conclusion. We therefore attempted to define the stoichiometry of the complex observed at the saturating plateau. Unlabeled SRBE at a concentration of 45 nm was added to 5 nm labeled F-SRBE (total SRBE, 50 nm) and titrated by SRYWT. At 50 nm SRBE, the oligonucleotide concentration is 5-fold greater than the apparent binding midpoint in Fig. 1 a, thus assuring stoichiometric binding conditions. In the resultant stoichiometric profile (Fig. 1 b), the anisotropy value is observed to continue to increase well beyond a ratio of 1 SRYWT monomer/SRBE molecule, supporting the hypothesis that the complex stoichiometry is not 1:1. In fact, the saturating plateau was reached for a concentration between 295 and 364 nmSRYWT, corresponding to a stoichiometry between 6 and 7 SRYWT molecules/SRBE oligonucleotide. To examine the specificity of the binding, the SRYWT-F-SRBE complex was competed with an excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides (either specific (SRBE) or nonspecific (DR5)). The latter is a 37-bp double-stranded DNA used in the laboratory that bears recognition sequences for the retinoid X receptor-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer and is devoid of any specific binding site for SRY. As observed in Fig. 2 a, an 8- and a 40-fold excess of unlabeled SRBE induced shifts in the titration curves to higher concentrations for the C1/2 (70 and 200 nm, respectively) in the presence of 50 mm KCl. These results (7- and 40-fold displacement of the C1/2 by an 8- and a 40-fold excess of unlabeled specific DNA, respectively) clearly demonstrate the equilibrium status of the interaction between SRYWT and its target DNA under our experimental conditions. Surprisingly, in very similar experiments, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled nonspecific DR5 duplex DNA (Fig. 2 c) resulted in a large shift to a higher concentration of anisotropy increase (C1/2 = 200 nm), revealing a relatively low specificity of the interaction between SRYWT and its target DNA under these low salt conditions. The specificity of the SRYWT binding to F-SRBE was next examined in the fluorescence anisotropy assays by using incremental increases in the buffer salt concentration. Increasing salt concentration usually reduces nonspecific protein-DNA affinity more strongly than specific affinity by competing for interaction with the negatively charged phosphate backbone (18Boyer M.

Increasing salt concentration in the absence of competitor DNA (Fig. 2 b) yielded profiles exhibiting the same saturating plateau, consistent with a complex of identical stoichiometry, but the apparent affinities decreased. At 50 mm KCl, for example, the C1/2 is 12 nm, whereas at 150 mm KCl, it is ∼40 and ∼400 nm at 250 mm KCl. As can be seen in Fig. 2 b, we note a loss of cooperativity at higher salt concentrations that may arise from a salt effect on protein-protein affinity. A striking effect of increasing the salt concentration on the complex specificity can be seen in Fig. 2 c. Closed triangles correspond to the binding of SRYWT to 5 nm F-SRBE in the presence of 250 mm KCl, and the open triangles correspond to the same profile in the presence of 50 nm (a 10-fold molar excess) unlabeled nonspecific target DR5. At this salt concentration, we did not observe the large shift of the binding profile to higher concentration observed with DR5 at 50 mm KCl (closed and open squares). Thus, although SRYWT binds to its target DNA with low specificity at low salt concentrations, presumably due to substantial electrostatic contacts between the positively charged SRYWT and negatively charged DNA, the interaction is of lower overall affinity but becomes much more specific at higher salt concentration. Protein-directed DNA bending is proposed to facilitate the assembly of DNA-multiprotein preinitiation complexes giving rise to architectural gene regulation. Such behavior is believed to be a crucial property of SRY (9Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Therefore, the complex we observed should bend the target DNA. We have evaluated full-length SRYWT-induced DNA bending by FRET. This technique employs the SRBE probe containing a fluorescent donor (fluorescein) at the 5′ end of the sense strand and an acceptor (rhodamine X) at the 5′ end of the antisense strand. In the absence of protein, for this oligonucleotide, the distance separating the donor-acceptor pair is ∼88 Å. Bending is detected as enhanced FRET efficiency due to decreased end-to-end distance. We have analyzed DNA bending by FRET using increasing amounts of full-length SRYWT, and thus we have established a titration profile of the DNA bending property. Because the saturating anisotropy plateau was identical at all salt concentrations tested, the stoichiometry and nature of the complex are assumed to be similar. We thus evaluated the DNA bending properties of SRYWT at the salt concentration (50 mm KCl) that allowed complete saturation of 50 nm SRBE by SRYWT compatible with our available concentrations of protein. Increasing concentrations of SRYWT ranging from 0 to 800 nm (Fig. 3 a) resulted in a decreased intensity of the donor emission (excited at 450 nm), indicating that FRET occurred upon formation of the SRYWT-SRBE complex. We ascribe this result to protein-induced bending of target DNA. To verify the energy transfer, lifetime measurements on the donor fluorescence were carried out at several concentrations of SRYWT. Binding of SRYWT to the double-labeled F-SRBE-R caused marked changes to the donor fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 4 a). In the free DNA, the mean lifetime of the donor in absence of acceptor (F-SRBE) was 4.2 ns and was unchanged upon protein binding. The presence of the acceptor (F-SRBE-R) did not lead to a reduction in the donor's mean lifetime for the free DNA, consistent with the distance of separation in the linear oligonucleotide. The addition of increasing amounts of SRYWT to the double-labeled target led to complex decay and a progressive shortening of the amplitude-weighted average lifetime (3.25 and 2.44 ns, respectively, at 50 and 100 nm[SRYWT]) before reaching a plateau (0.90 ns for 200 nm [SRYWT]; Fig. 4 b). The fluorescence mean lifetime values were used to calculate FRET efficiency (E) and the distance R between the dyes (Table I). It can be seen from Figs. 3 and 4that for a 1:1 stoichiometry (50 nm both F-SRBE-R and SRYWT), very little FRET occurs, and thus maximal DNA bending was not achieved. Saturation of the FRET signal and thus the protein-induced DNA bending occur near a ratio of 4 SRY/DNA, indicative of the existence of a multiprotein complex on DNA. It is noteworthy that the FRET experiment also revealed DNA bending at elevated salt concentration, as seen in Fig. 3 b, but according to the loss of affinity observed in the presence of 250 mm KCl, the titration was not complete, and the maximal DNA bending could not be achieved at high salt concentration.Table IEnergy transfer parameters for SRY/F-SRBE-RProteinConcentrationR1-aParameters recovered from the analysis of the lifetime data using a model that included the average distance between donor and acceptor and the width of a Gaussian distribution.Width1-aParameters recovered f"
