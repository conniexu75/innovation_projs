https://openalex.org/W2066441904,"Extracts containing wild-type or mutant human estrogen receptor (ER) have been used to study the binding of ER to its responsive element (ERE). Estradiol (E2) or the antiestrogen hydroxytamoxifen is required for ER binding as assayed by gel retardation. The DNA binding domain (DBD) encompasses the highly conserved region C. Both intact ER-E2 complexes and ER mutants truncated for the hormone binding domain (HBD) bind as dimers to an ERE. However, an HBD-truncated ER binds less tightly to an ERE than an intact ER-E2 complex. The DBD and HBD contain a constitutive and a stronger ER-induced dimerization function, respectively. Thus, in addition to inducing the activation function associated with the HBD, estrogen plays a crucial role in the formation of stable ER dimers that bind tightly to ERE."
https://openalex.org/W2071525868,"A steroid hormone responsive element (GRE/PRE), sufficient to confer glucocorticoid and progesterone inducibility when linked to a reporter gene, was used in band-shift assays to examine its molecular interactions with steroid hormone receptors. Both progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors bound directly and specifically to the GRE/PRE. The purine contact sites for both form A and form B chicken progesterone receptor, as well as those for rat glucocorticoid receptor, are identical. A peptide fragment produced in bacteria that primarily contain the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor binds first to the TGTTCT half-site of the GRE/PRE, and a second molecule binds subsequently to the TGTACA (half-site) of the GRE/PRE in a cooperative manner. Utilizing the peptide fragment and the protein A-linked fragment, we demonstrated that the receptor interacts with its cognate enhancer as a dimer."
https://openalex.org/W2160393299,"The Holliday (four-way) junction is a critical intermediate in homologous genetic recombination. We have studied the structure of a series of four-way junctions, constructed by hybridization of four 80 nucleotide synthetic oligonucleotides. These molecules migrate anomalously slowly in gel electrophoresis. Each arm of any junction could be selectively shortened by cleavage at a unique restriction site, and we have studied the relative gel mobilities of species in which two arms were cleaved. The pattern of fragments observed argues strongly for a structure with two-fold symmetry, based on an X shape, the long arms of which are made from pairwise colinear association of helical arms. The choice of partners is governed by the base sequence at the junction, allowing a potential isomerization between equivalent structural forms. Resolvase enzymes can distinguish between these structures, and the resolution products are determined by the structure adopted, i.e., by the sequence at the junction. In the absence of cations, the helical arms of the junction are fully extended in a square configuration, and unstacking results in junction thymines becoming reactive to osmium tetroxide."
https://openalex.org/W2088091759,"Pre-B and pre-T cell lines from mutant mice with severe combined immune deficiency (scid mice) were transfected with plasmids that contained recombination signal sequences of antigen receptor gene elements (V, D, and J). Recovered plasmids were tested for possible recombination of signal sequences and/or the adjacent (coding) sequences. Signal ends were joined, but recombination was abnormal in that half of the recombinants had lost nucleotides from one or both signals. Coding ends were not joined at all in either deletional or inversional V(D)J recombination reactions. However, coding ends were able to participate in alternative reactions. The failure of coding joint formation in scid pre-B and pre-T cells appears sufficient to explain the absence of immunoglobulin or T cell receptor production in scid mice."
https://openalex.org/W2001949677,"We assessed the alterations of viral gene expression occurring during persistent infections by cloning full-length transcripts of measles virus (MV) genes from brain autopsies of two subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients and one measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) patient. The suquence of these MV genes revealed that, most likely, almost 2% of the nucleotides were mutated during persistence, and 35% of these differences resulted in amino acid changes. One of these nucleotide substitutions and one deletion resulted in alteration of the reading frames of two fusion genes, as confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs. One cluster of mutations was exceptional; in the matrix gene of the MIBE case, 50% of the U residues were changed to C, which might result from a highly biased copying event exclusively affecting this gene. We propose that the cluster of mutations in the MIBE case, and other combinations of mutations in other cases, favored propagation of MV infections in brain cells by conferring a selective advantage to the mutated genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2084364631,"A chicken erythroid cell-specific enhancer is located in the intergenic region between the adult beta- and embryonic epsilon-globin genes. In this paper we show that the beta-globin enhancer stimulates transcription of both genes. epsilon-Globin is, however, inappropriately regulated since it is expressed in both embryonic and adult red blood cells. Appropriate stage-specific regulation is observed for both genes when they are present on one plasmid. By analysis of deletion and substitution mutants, we conclude that beta-globin tissue- and developmental stage-specific regulation is mediated by interaction of the beta-globin enhancer with a positive regulatory element within the adult beta-globin promoter, the developmental stage selector element (SSE)."
https://openalex.org/W2020501605,"Genetic mosaic studies indicate that environmental cues play a critical role in photoreceptor cell (R-cell) development in the Drosophila compound eye. Recent analysis of the sevenless gene suggests that its product, a cell surface protein containing a putative intracellular domain homologous to tyrosine kinases, is a receptor for a signal specifying an R7-specific pathway of cellular development. We report the identification of a second genetic locus, bride of sevenless (boss) required for the development of R7. Genetic mosaic analysis demonstrates that boss expression is required in the R8 cell for a neighboring cell to become R7. However, the development of R1–R6 and R8 is boss-independent. These data indicate a central role for R8 in directing ommatidial assembly and are consistent with boss encoding the ligand recognized by the sevenless receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1560201422,"Type beta transforming growth factor (TGF beta) was shown to regulate the production of several extracellular matrix proteins. Osteopontin (OP) is a recently discovered bone matrix protein which was shown to promote the attachment of osteoblastic rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells to their substrate. We examined the effects of TGF beta on OP production and OP mRNA in ROS 17/2.8 cells. Four-day treatment with 4 ng/ml TGF beta 1 increased substantially the level of osteopontin in the cell culture media, as estimated by immunoblotting. Metabolic labeling showed that this effect was associated with a 3-4-fold increase in OP biosynthesis. TGF beta 1 also increased, in a dose-dependent manner starting at 0.4 ng/ml, the steady-state level of OP mRNA. The increase in OP mRNA was first detected 48 h after the addition of TGF beta 1 and lasted at least until 120 h. The half-life of OP mRNA, estimated in the presence of 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, was about 10 h and was not altered by TGF beta 1. On the other hand, the increase in OP mRNA was blocked by actinomycin D. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that TGF beta 1 increased the rate of transcription of the OP gene. Examination of hormonal interactions showed that TGF beta 1 opposed or compensated for the reduction in OP mRNA produced by dexamethasone and that TGF beta 1 did not further augment OP mRNA levels which had been increased by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment. TGF beta 2 had similar effects on OP gene expression as TGF beta 1. In conclusion, TGF beta promotes the production of osteopontin in the osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells through a pathway which is at least in part mediated by transcriptional events."
https://openalex.org/W2099260418,"The mouse sex-limited protein (Slp) gene is dependent on androgen for expression, unlike its homologous neighbor, which encodes the fourth component of complement (C4). We have found that the extensive identity of Slp and C4 is disrupted by an endogenous provirus inserted 2 kb upstream of Slp. The 5' LTR of this element corresponds to the previously characterized hormone-responsive enhancer associated with Slp regulation, leading to the conclusion that the provirus has conferred androgen response on the adjacent Slp gene. The provirus is extremely old, based on LTR sequence divergence, the accumulation of mutations in former retroviral-like coding regions, and its stability within the mouse genome. The association of this transposable element with Slp regulation thus provides a long-sought example of an insertional mutation that has been maintained in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1605748290,"Biochemical characteristics of three rat brain protein kinase C isozymes, types I, II, and III, were compared with respect to their protein kinase and phorbol ester-binding activities. All three isozymes appeared to be alike in their phorbol ester-binding activities as evidenced by their similar Kd for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and requirements for Ca2+ and phospholipids. However, differences with respect to the effector-mediated stimulation of protein kinase activity were detectable among these isozymes. The type I enzyme could be stimulated by cardiolipin to a greater extent than those of the type II and III enzymes. In the presence of cardiolipin, the concentrations of dioleoylglycerol or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate required for half-maximal activation (A1/2) of the type I enzyme were nearly an order of magnitude lower than those for the type II and III enzymes. In the presence of phosphatidylserine, differences in the A1/2 of dioleoylglycerol and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate for the three isozymes of protein kinase C were less significant than those measured in the presence of cardiolipin. Nevertheless, the A1/2 of these two activators for the type I enzyme were lower than those for the type II and III enzymes. At high levels of phosphatidylserine (greater than 15 mol %), binding of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to the type I enzyme evoked a corresponding stimulation of the kinase activity, whereas binding of this phorbol ester to the type II and III enzymes produced a lesser degree of kinase stimulation. For all three isozymes, the concentrations of phosphatidylserine required for half-maximum [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding were almost an order of magnitude less than those for kinase stimulation. Consequently, neither isozyme exhibited a significant kinase activity at lower levels of phosphatidylserine (less than 5 mol %) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (50 nM), a condition sufficient to promote near maximal phorbol ester binding. In addition to their different responses to the various activators, the three protein kinase C isozymes also have different Km values for protein substrates. The type I enzyme appeared to have lower Km values for histone IIIS, myelin basic protein, poly(lysine, serine) (3:1) polymer, and protamine than those for the type II and III enzymes. These results documented that the three protein kinase C isozymes were distinguishable in their biochemical properties. In particular, the type I enzyme, which is a brain-specific isozyme, is distinct from the type II and III enzymes, both have a widespread distribution among different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2160591054,"Loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene xol-1 cause the feminization and death of XO animals (normally males) by shifting the sex determination and dosage compensation pathways toward their hermaphrodite modes. XO-specific lethality most likely results from the reduction in X chromosome expression caused by xol-1 mutations. Mutations in genes required for the hermaphrodite mode of dosage compensation suppress lethality but not feminization, and restore X chromosome expression to nearly wild-type levels. Mutations in genes that control the hermaphrodite modes of both sex determination and dosage compensation fully suppress both defects. These interactions suggest that xol-1 is the earliest-acting gene in the known hierarchy controlling the male/hermaphrodite decision and is perhaps the gene nearest the primary sex-determining signal. We propose that the wild-type xol-1 gene product promotes male development by ensuring that genes (or gene products) directing hermaphrodite sex determination and dosage compensation are inactive in XO animals. Interestingly, in addition to feminizing XO animals, xol-1 mutations further masculinize XX animals already partially masculinized."
https://openalex.org/W2164014307,"Monochlorobimane (syn-(ClCH2, CH3)-1,5-diazabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octa-3,6-dione-2,8-dione; mBCl) forms a fluorescent adduct with glutathione (GSH), which has been used as a basis for flow cytometric analysis. While mBCl will react nonspecifically with many different thiols, preferential derivatization of GSH can be achieved by using a low concentration of mBCl, since the reaction with GSH is catalyzed by GSH S-transferase, and the nonenzymatic reaction is very slow (k = 3.3 x 10(-1) M-1 s-1 at 37 degrees C, pH 7.5). The rate of derivatization of cellular GSH can be 1000 times greater than predicted from the nonenzymatic reaction rate, although this factor can vary among cell lines. GSH values obtained by flow cytometry (FCM) agree well with those obtained by an enzymatic assay, over a wide range of GSH values, for EMT6/SF cells treated with L-buthionine sulfoximine to vary GSH content. FCM analysis of the GSH content of cells obtained by disaggregation of EMT6/SF tumors, grown in BALB/c mice, revealed a wide variation in single-cell GSH content. The data suggest that there are distinct subpopulations within these tumors, which can be partially characterized by GSH content, but may also have other distinguishing characteristics, such as enhanced sensitivity or resistance to cytotoxic agents. Heterogeneity in single-cell GSH content was also observed by FCM analysis of cells obtained by disaggregation of a biopsy of a human renal cell carcinoma. This result points to the potential value of FCM analysis of GSH in the identification and characterization of human tumor subpopulations which may be of clinical significance in the treatment of cancer by radiation or chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1504339807,"Lipopolysaccharide affects a variety of eukaryotic cells and mammalian organisms. These actions are involved in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative septicemia. Many of the actions of lipopolysaccharide are believed to be caused by its active moiety, lipid A. Our laboratory has previously identified a bioactive lipid A precursor, termed lipid IVA (Raetz, C. R. H., Purcell, S., Meyer, M. V., Qureshi, N., and Takayama, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 16080-16888), which can be labeled with 32P of high specific activity and purified. In this work we have used the labeled probe, 4'-32P-lipid IVA, to develop a novel assay for the specific binding of lipid IVA to whole cells. We have also demonstrated its use in a ligand blotting assay of immobilized cellular proteins. Using the whole cell assay, we show that 4'-32P-lipid IVA specifically binds to RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cultured cells. The binding is saturable, is inhibited with excess unlabeled lipid IVA, and is proteinase K-sensitive. It displays cellular and pharmacological specificity. Using the ligand blotting assay, we show that several RAW 264.7 cell proteins can bind 4'-32P-lipid IVA. The two principal binding proteins have Mr values of 31 and 95 kDa, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractionation studies indicate that the 31-kDa protein is enriched in the nuclear fraction and may be a histone, whereas the 95-kDa protein is enriched in the membrane fraction. The binding assays that we have developed should lead to a clearer understanding of lipid A/animal cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1565313767,"A wide range of values has been reported for the subunit and molecular weights of smooth muscle caldesmon. There have also been conflicting reports concerning whether caldesmon is a monomer or dimer. We attempted to resolve these uncertainties by determining the molecular weight of chicken gizzard smooth muscle caldesmon using the technique of sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Unlike previous methods that have been used to estimate the molecular weight of caldesmon, the molecular weight determined by equilibrium sedimentation does not depend upon assumptions about the shape of the molecule. We concluded that caldesmon in solution is monomeric with a molecular mass of 93 +/- 4 kDa, a value that is much less than those previously reported in the literature. This new value, in conjunction with sedimentation velocity experiments, led to the conclusion that caldesmon is a highly asymmetric molecule with an apparent length of 740 A in solution. The mass of a cyanogen bromide fragment, with an apparent mass of 37 kDa from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was determined to be 25.1 +/- 0.6 kDa using sedimentation equilibrium. These results imply that the reported molecular weights of other fragment(s) of caldesmon have also been overestimated. We have determined an optical extinction coefficient for caldesmon (E1%(280 nm) = 3.3) by determining its concentration from its refractive index which was measured in the analytical ultracentrifuge. From the above values of the molecular weight and the extinction coefficient, we redetermined that the caldesmon molecule has two cysteines and recalculated the stoichiometric molar ratio of actin/tropomyosin/caldesmon in the smooth muscle thin filament to be 28:4:1."
https://openalex.org/W2128277573,"Growth hormone (GH) expression in pituitary-derived cells has been attributed to the presence of a positive trans-activator, GHF-1, which binds to two sites on the GH promoter. Somatic cell hybridization of non-GH-expressing L cells with pituitary-derived GH3 cells usually results in extinction of GH production. While previous studies showed that extinction occurs at the level of GH transcription, the exact mechanism remained elusive. We therefore characterized two parental cell lines and three hybrids, two of which extinguish GH expression and one in which GH is reexpressed after loss of mouse chromosomal material. Using in vivo transfections, in vitro transcription, DNAase I footprints, and immunoblotting experiments, no evidence for a direct repressor of GH transcription was found. Rather, extinction of GH expression in fibroblast ⇔mes; pituitary hybrids was accompanied by loss of GHF-1 protein and mRNA expression, suggesting that extinction occurs by repression of this trans-activator."
https://openalex.org/W1502793762,"Smooth muscle cells grown in culture may provide a model system for studying the Ca2+ dependence of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Tracheal smooth muscle cells in culture had 60% of the myosin content of tracheal tissue. Western analysis with appropriate antibodies demonstrated one 20-kDa light chain and the presence of a 150-kDa myosin light chain kinase in both tracheal smooth muscle tissue and cells. Moreover, tracheal cells contained 74% of the myosin light chain kinase activity measured in tissue. Similar types of analyses of nonmuscle cells showed a much lower myosin and myosin light chain kinase content. Carbachol (10 microM) or ionomycin (10 microM) stimulation of fura-2-containing cells resulted in a rapid increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and in the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Maximal increases in Ca2+ concentrations were greater with ionomycin than with carbachol (4400 versus 492 nM). Light chain phosphorylation increased after the Ca2+ concentration exceeded 200 nM from control values of 165 nM. Half-maximal phosphorylation (33%) occurred at 260 nM Ca2+. There was a similar relationship between free cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation in carbachol- and ionomycin-stimulated cells. This relationship had a Hill coefficient of 2.7. These observations indicate that small changes in Ca2+ concentrations stimulate myosin light chain phosphorylation and thus presumably contraction in smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567493055,"Abstract Ornithine-delta-aminotransferase (OAT) is a nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial matrix enzyme which, in rat, is expressed as basal levels in most tissues but is induced in liver by high dietary protein and in kidney by estrogen and thyroxine administration. In man, the hereditary deficiency of OAT results in ornithine accumulation and the blinding disease gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina. We cloned near full length rat and human liver OAT cDNAs and demonstrated OAT expression in a variety of tissues from each species. We mapped the human OAT structural gene to chromosome 10, cloned 40 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA containing the complete OAT structural gene, and determined its organization. It is 21 kilobase pairs in length, and contains 11 exons. Exon 2 has been absent from all cDNAs studied and was detected by homology to X-linked processed OAT pseudogenes. The 5'-flanking region of the OAT gene has features of housekeeping genes (GC enrichment and three Sp1 binding consensus sequences) and tissue-specific, inducible genes (TATA box-like element and two CCAAT boxes). A 22-base pair region of partial dyad symmetry containing homology to estrogen responsive elements overlaps the OAT transcription site. Another 5' sequence, GTATCCTGCCCTC, is homologous to sequences in the promoter regions of the genes of three urea cycle enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1970131453,The mouse t complex responder (Tcr) locus plays a central haploid-specific role in the transmission ratio distortion phenotype expressed during germ cell differentiation in t-carrying males. The accumulated data map Tcr to a region of less than 500 kb. Over 400 kb of this region has been cloned and consists entirely of sequences associated with a clustered family of large cross-hybridizing elements of 30 kb to 70 kb in size. We have characterized a gene family within this region that is expressed uniquely in male germ cells with a complex pattern of RNA processing. Antibodies produced against a product of the putative open reading frame recognize a testes-specific polypeptide. Genetic data support the hypothesis that this polypeptide(s) functions to effect the Tcr phenotype.
https://openalex.org/W1495349070,"Upon stimulation, the gastric parietal cell secretes a large quantity of isotonic HCl across its apical membrane which must be accompanied by the generation of base in the cytosol. The ability of this cell type to regulate cytosolic pH (pHi) was examined as a function of stimulation of acid secretion by histamine or forskolin. The pHi was estimated from the change of fluorescence of the trapped dye, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-bis-carboxyethylcarbo xy fluorescein in a purified cell suspension of rabbit parietal cells. Stimulation of the cell suspension raised pHi by an average of 0.13 +/- 0.038 pH units. The H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, SCH28080 (2-methyl-8-[phenyl-methoxy]-imidazo-(1,2)-pyridine-3-acetonitrile) had only a small effect on the increase of pHi, therefore, was largely independent of H+,K+-ATPase activity. In Na+-free medium, where Na+/H+ exchange would be absent, the rise of pHi was only 0.03 pH units. This increase was blocked by SCH28080, showing that this small increment was the result of acid secretion. In Na+-containing medium, 90% of the increase was inhibited by an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, dimethyl amiloride (DMA). This compound also blocked changes in pHi due to changes in extracellular Na+. Accordingly, most of the change in pHi upon stimulation of acid secretion by histamine and forskolin is due to activation of Na+/H+ exchange in the parietal cell basal-lateral membrane. The addition of DMA to stimulated, but not resting cells, gave a rapid acidification that was blocked by inhibition of anion exchange by 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), showing that anion exchange was also activated by stimulation. In single cell recording, canalicular and cytosolic pH were monitored simultaneously using 9-amino acridine and dimethyl carboxyfluorescein, respectively. Cytosolic alkalinization correlated with acid accumulation in the secretory canaliculus until a set point was reached. Thereafter, acidification continued without further change in pHi. To determine the role of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- exchange in acid secretion, Cl(-)-depleted cells were suspended in medium containing 40 mM Cl-. DMA and DIDS each blocked acid secretion by about 40%, but in combination, acid secretion was blocked by more than 90%. Thus, basal-lateral Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities are necessary for acid secretion across the apical membrane of the parietal cell."
https://openalex.org/W1579116665,"Abstract Human thyroglobulin glycopeptides representing the multiple asparagine-linked complex (unit B) carbohydrate units of this protein were found to contain substantial amounts of sulfate (ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mol/mol of oligosaccharide); this substituent was shown to occur primarily in the form of terminal beta-linked Gal-3-SO4 residues which represent novel capping groups occurring alternatively to sialic acid and in comparable amounts. Upon hydrazine/nitrous acid fragmentation and radiolabeling with NaB3H4, all human unit B DEAE-resolved glycopeptide fractions yielded an acidic disaccharide which was characterized as Gal-3-SO4 beta 1----4-anhydromannitol. Studies on glycopeptides modified by desialylation, desulfation, and beta-galactosidase treatment indicated that the majority (approximately 70%) of the complex carbohydrate units contain sulfate groups and that Gal-3-SO4 and sialic acid residues can coexist in terminal positions on the same N-linked oligosaccharide. In addition to Gal-3-SO4, the most acidic unit B variants were found to contain GlcNAc-6-SO4 which was recovered as Gal beta 1----4-anhydromannitol-6-SO4 after hydrazine/nitrous acid treatment and NaB3H4 reduction. On the basis of chromatography on immobilized concanavalin A, it was determined that whereas the Gal-3-SO4 groups occur on biantennary as well as more highly branched carbohydrate units, GlcNAc-6-SO4 is exclusively present in the latter oligosaccharides. In contrast to the N-linked carbohydrate units, the previously described O-linked glycosaminoglycan chain of human thyroglobulin yielded GlcA beta 1----3-anhydrotalitol-6-SO4 upon hydrazine/nitrous acid/NaB3H4 treatment, indicating that it is a chrondroitin 6-sulfate-like polymer. The distribution of sulfate in the complex oligosaccharides of calf thyroglobulin was quite different from that in the human protein; sulfate was not detectable in most of the glycopeptides and was sequestered in a single multibranched complex-type glycopeptide fraction (1.6 mol of sulfate/mol of oligosaccharide) which contained about equal amounts of Gal-3-SO4 and GlcNAc-6-SO4. The difference in galactose sulfation between human and calf thyroglobulins may be related to the substitution in the latter protein of some of the galactose residues by alpha-D-Gal capping groups."

https://openalex.org/W1780877682,"Enzymatic and nonenzymatic mixed-function oxidase systems have been shown to generate an oxidant that catalyzes the inactivation of glutamine synthetase and other metabolic enzymes. Recent studies have shown that microsomes isolated from rats chronically fed ethanol generate reactive oxygen intermediates at elevated rates compared with controls. Microsomes from rats fed ethanol were found to be more effective than control microsomes in catalyzing the inactivation of enzymes added to the incubation system. The enzymes studied were alcohol dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase. The inactivation process by both types of microsomal preparations was sensitive to catalase and glutathione plus glutathione peroxidase, but was not affected by superoxide dismutase or hydroxyl radical scavengers. Iron was required for the inactivation of the added enzymes; microsomes from the rats fed ethanol remained more effective than control microsomes in catalyzing the inactivation of enzymes in the absence or presence of several ferric complexes. The inactivation of enzymes was enhanced by the addition of menadione or paraquat to the microsomes, and rates of inactivation were higher with the microsomes from the ethanol-fed rats. The enhanced generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and increased inactivation of enzymes by microsomes may contribute toward the hepatotoxic effects associated with ethanol consumption.—Dicker, E.; Cederbaum, A. I. Increased oxygen radical-dependent inactivation of metabolic enzymes by liver microsomes after chronic ethanol consumption. FASEB J. 2: 2901-2906; 1988."
https://openalex.org/W1537586088,"The aerobic oxidation of indole-3-acetic acid catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase produces 1268 nm emission characteristic of singlet oxygen. Lactoperoxidase also oxidizes indole-3-acetic acid to produce singlet oxygen, but in contrast to horseradish peroxidase, this enzyme system requires hydrogen peroxide. In both of these systems, the intensity of the 1268 nm emission is small due to quenching of the singlet oxygen by indole-3-acetic acid and by reaction products derived from indole-3-acetic acid. The biomolecular reaction of peroxyl radicals via a Russell mechanism is a plausible mechanism for the singlet oxygen generation in these systems. Under typical conditions of p2H 4.0, 1 microM horseradish peroxidase, 1 mM indole-3-acetic acid, and 240 microM oxygen, the singlet oxygen yield was 15 +/- 1 microM or 13% of the amount predicted by the Russell mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1588013866,"Two proteins isolated from Paracoccus denitrificans, the copper-containing electron carrier amicyanin and the pyrroloquinoline quinone-containing enzyme methylamine dehydrogenase, have been shown to form a complex. Complex formation between methylamine dehydrogenase and either oxidized or reduced amicyanin resulted in alterations in the absorbance spectrum of the pyrroloquinoline quinone prosthetic group of methylamine dehydrogenase. Binding of amicyanin to the enzyme exhibited positive cooperativity. Complex formation with methylamine dehydrogenase shifted the oxidation-reduction midpoint potential of amicyanin by 73 mV, from +294 to +221 mV, making electron transfer from amicyanin to cytochrome c551 (Em = +190 mV) thermodynamically possible."
https://openalex.org/W22961015,"Chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase can be partially reduced by either xanthine or NADH. Reduction to approximately the 2-electron-reduced level occurs with NADH, and reduction beyond the 2-electron level occurs with xanthine. In both cases, the reaction is triphasic. The first and third phases are dependent on reductant concentration, whereas the second phase is not. Oxidation of fully (6-electron) reduced xanthine dehydrogenase by either urate or NAD is monophasic and dependent on the oxidant concentration. Oxidation stops at about the same level of reduction that was reached by the corresponding reductant. The position of this end point is sensitive to the potential of the reactants but is relatively insensitive to excess concentrations of oxidant or reductant. NADH binding to 2-electron-reduced enzyme is implicated in fixing the end point position in those reactions involving pyridine nucleotides, whereas urate binding is involved in fixing the end point of those reactions involving xanthine and urate."
https://openalex.org/W1532909424,"Data are presented which reveal that ubiquinone (Q)-mediated electron transport is a multicollisional, obstructed, long-range diffusion process, where factors that affect the rate of lateral diffusion also affect the rate of electron transport. Based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements, it was concluded that Q-mediated electron transport occurs by the random collision of redox components which are independent lateral diffusants, each greater than 86% mobile and diffusing in a common pool. The diffusion process of Q-mediated electron transport is 1) multicollisional since the transfers of reducing equivalents between appropriate redox partners occur with less than 100% collision efficiency; 2) obstructed since its maximal rate as well as the rates of diffusion of all redox components involved vary as a function of the membrane protein density; and 3) long-range since the diffusion of all redox components is protein density-dependent, and the diffusion distance required for Q to catalyze the transfer of a reducing equivalent from Complex II to III must be, on average, greater than 37.6 nm. These findings and other theoretical treatments reveal that measurements of short-range diffusion (less than 10 nm), in which collisions between appropriate redox partners do not occur, on average, and which are not affected by membrane protein density, are irrelevant to the collisional process of electron transport. Thus, the data show that the maximum electron transport rate is dependent on both the diffusion rate and the concentration of the redox components. Sucrose was found to inhibit both the mobility of redox components as well as their electron transport rates. Data presented on the relationships between membrane viscosity, rates of lateral and rotational diffusion, and mobile fractions of redox components do not support rotationally immobile aggregates in the functional inner membrane. The high degree of unsaturated phospholipids and the absence of cholesterol in the bilayer of the native inner membrane reflect a requirement for a low resistance to motion of the redox components to compensate for the multicollisional, obstructive nature of their catalytically important collisions in this membrane. These findings support the Random Collision Model of electron transport in which the diffusion and concentration of redox components limit the maximum rate of electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W1601182054,"Methylated DNA-binding protein (MDBP) from human placenta has a high affinity for a site in pBR322 (pB site 1) when that site is methylated at its CpG dinucleotides. Dimethyl sulfate interference analysis and experiments with ligands prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis indicate that 15 contiguous base pairs, 14 of which exhibit hyphenated dyad symmetry, influence MDBP binding to pB site 1. These 14 base pairs, 5'-RTMGYCAMGG(M/T)GAY-3' (M, 5-methylcytosine), suffice for recognition by MDBP as demonstrated with a double-stranded, MpG-containing oligonucleotide used as a free ligand or cloned into M13mp19 and subsequently methylated. Seven single-site mutations at different positions of this 14-base pair region largely eliminated binding, and several others increased binding up to 2-fold when compared to the nonmutant, triply methylated sequence. However, MDBP recognizes a site in hemimethylated M13mp19 replicative form DNA, which was homology to pB site 1 at only 10 of 14 base pairs, and all four of these different base pairs are equivalent to transversions. Based upon the above data, a mixed oligonucleotide probe was constructed that contains variants of pB site 1 which should be recognized by MDBP. This 14-base probe hybridizes under stringent conditions to a number of discrete fragments in restriction digests of human DNA. this suggests that there are multiple pB site 1-related sequences in human DNA that might, when methylated, bind MDBP in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1648904426,"Abstract During heat shock of chicken reticulocytes the synthesis of a single heat shock protein, HSP70, increases greater than 10-fold, while the level of HSP70 mRNA increases less than 2-fold during the same period. Comparison of the in vivo levels of HSP70 and beta-globin synthesis with their mRNA abundance reveals that the translation of HSP70 mRNA is repressed in normal reticulocytes and is activated upon heat shock. In its translationally repressed state HSP70 mRNA is functionally associated with polysomes based on sedimentation analysis of polysomes from untreated or puromycin-treated cells and by analysis of in vitro run-off translation products using isolated polysomes. Treatment of control and heat shocked cells with the initiation inhibitor pactamycin reveals that elongation of the HSP70 nascent peptide is not completely arrested, but is slower in control cells. Furthermore, the inefficient translation of HSP70 mRNA in vivo is not due to the lack of an essential translation factor; HSP70 mRNA is efficiently translated in chicken reticulocyte translation extracts as well as in heterologous rabbit reticulocyte extracts. Our results reveal that a major control point for HSP70 synthesis in reticulocytes is the elongation rate of the HSP70 nascent peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1505275775,"Reduced pyridine nucleotides (PNred) and oxidized flavoproteins (FPox) were measured fluorometrically in the intestinal smooth muscle strip of guinea pig taenia caeci simultaneously with contractile tension. Cytoplasmic free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]cyt) were also measured by a fura-2-Ca2+ fluorescence technique. PNred, FPox, and [Ca2+]cyt increased during spontaneous contraction or upon the addition of high K+ or carbachol and decreased upon the removal of these stimulants. [Ca2+]cyt increased before the increase in muscle tension. PNred increased almost simultaneously with or immediately after the onset of contraction, while FPox increased before the initiation of contraction. Both PNred and FPox decreased a few seconds after the initiation of relaxation. In the K+-depolarized, Ca2+-depleted muscle, graded elevation of external Ca2+ increased PNred, FPox, and muscle tension. The sensitivity to Ca2+ was in the order of FPox greater than PNred greater than muscle tension. Changes in PNred were inhibited when glycolysis was inhibited by substitution of external glucose with oxaloacetate, pyruvate, or beta-hydroxybutylate, but not when oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited by N2 bubbling or by NaCN. In contrast to this, changes in the FPox were inhibited by N2 bubbling or NaCN, but not by the inhibition of glycolysis. These results suggest that an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ activates carbohydrate metabolism and contractile elements independently, resulting in the reduction of cytoplasmic pyridine nucleotides, oxidation of mitochondrial flavoproteins, and development of tension in the intestinal smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1601683150,"We have developed a method for the separation of transcriptionally engaged chromatin from inactive genes as well as from active genes which are not being transcribed. This approach is dependent upon the integrity of the growing transcript and is reflected in a significant decrease in the density of the chromatin during transcription. The decrease in density appears to be due to an association between the growing transcript and a large zone of lower density, possibly the nuclear matrix. These interactions are preserved after fixation of the nuclear material with formaldehyde. Hormonal induction of transcriptional activity causes a shift of the genetic material for the stimulated gene from the high density domain to the low density region. The vast majority of the polymerase II which is engaged with the chromosomal material is also found in this lower density zone. We find that most of the fast form of histone acetylation occurs on those histones which are associated with the active chromatin, further supporting the idea that this modification is involved in some way with the transcriptional process. The merits of this approach are discussed, as are the possibilities for its further exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W1486119789,"Diglyceride analogs were studied with respect to their abilities to activate protein kinase C (Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) in the presence of low calcium and phospholipid. Analogs which lacked either a free hydroxyl group at the 3 position or an ester moiety at the 1 position were without activity. It was concluded that the hydrophilic moieties of the active diglycerides are crucial for activity. However, diglyceride analogs containing additional hydrophilic moieties in one of the acyl side chains did not exhibit enhanced activity when compared to diglycerides containing two fatty acyl groups. Diglyceride analogs with a modified glycerol backbone were also studied. Homologous diglycerides with either one or two methylene groups between the 3-methylene group of the diglyceride and the hydroxyl group possessed markedly reduced activities when compared to the appropriate unmodified diglyceride. Isomers of these homologues which contained either a methyl group at the 1 position, or dimethyl groups incorporated at the 1 and 3 positions, were virtually without activity. Where studied, none of the diglyceride analogs prepared possessed antagonist activity. The results of these experiments are discussed with respect to the extreme specificity observed."
https://openalex.org/W1521646505,"The present study investigates the unique contribution of the NH2-terminal 33 residues of prothrombin, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, to the Ca(II) and phospholipid-binding properties of prothrombin. Two Gla domain peptides, 1-42 and 1-45, produced by chymotryptic cleavage of prothrombin fragment 1 (residues 1-156 of the amino terminus of bovine prothrombin) and isolated by anion-exchange chromatography were utilized to characterize the Gla domain of prothrombin. This investigation utilized several experimental approaches to examine the properties of the Gla domain peptides. These studies were somewhat hampered by the metal ion-induced insolubility of the peptides. However, the 1-45 peptide was specifically radioiodinated, which facilitated the study of this peptide at low concentrations. In contrast to prothrombin fragment 1, the intrinsic fluorescence of both 1-42 and 1-45 was not quenched upon the addition of 1 mM Ca(II) or any concentration of Mg(II). Equilibrium dialysis studies revealed that the 1-42 peptide bound three Ca(II) ions noncooperatively, whereas fragment 1 binds seven Ca(II) ions in a positive cooperative manner. Ca(II)-promoted conformational changes are observed by comparison of electrophoretic mobility changes in the presence of increasing Ca(II) concentrations. Prothrombin, fragment 1, and the Gla domain peptides 1-42 and 1-45 exhibited similar electrophoretic mobility behavior in the presence of Ca(II) ions. The radiolabeled 1-45 peptide was found to comigrate with phospholipid vesicles on gel permeation chromatography in the presence of Ca(II). Fragment 1 was shown to inhibit this Ca(II)-dependent phospholipid binding of 1-45, demonstrating that the 1-45 peptide does possess the necessary phospholipid-binding structure. Furthermore, a metal ion-dependent conformational monoclonal antibody, F9.29, was inhibited from binding fragment 1 by the 1-42 peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2143162730,"A number of gangliosides were isolated from cat and sheep erythrocytes for use in analyzing the specificity of a panel of human anti-heterophile monoclonal antibodies. The structures of these compounds were determined by a combination of different procedures, including sugar analysis, glycosidase treatment, periodate oxidation, TLC immunostaining, methylation analysis, and mass spectrometry. These methods identified the cat erythrocytes gangliosides (C1 and C2) as N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing hematosides; C1 was shown to be NeuGc alpha 2----8NeuGc alpha 2----3Gal beta I----4Glc-Cer [NeuGc)2GD3) and C2 to be NeuAc alpha 2----8NeuGc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4Glc-Cer [NeuAc-NeuGc-)GD3). The two sheep gangliosides (S1 and S2) were found to be novel glycolipids based on the paragloboside sequence; S1 was identified as NeuGc alpha 2----8NeuGc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc-Cer [NeuGc)2-disialylparagloboside) and S2 as NeuAc alpha 2----8NeuGc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc-Cer [NeuAc-NeuGc-)-disialylparagloboside). Structural analysis of these compounds was aided by the use of 252Cf fission fragment ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This method provided easily interpretable spectra on methylated derivatives which were particularly useful in determining the sialic acid composition of the gangliosides and the sequence of their disialosyl side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1557077208,"We have characterized a mutation that produces mild, dominantly inherited osteogenesis imperfecta. Half of the alpha 1 (I) chains of type I collagen synthesized by cells from an affected individual contain a cysteine residue in the 196-residue carboxyl-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide of the triple-helical domain (Steinmann, B., Nicholls, A., and Pope, F. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8958-8964). Unexpectedly, sequence determined from a proteolytic fragment of the alpha 1 (I) chain derived from procollagen molecules synthesized in the presence of both [3H]proline and [35S]cysteine indicated that the cysteine is located at the third residue carboxyl-terminal to the triple-helical domain, normally a glycine. The nucleotide sequence of a fragment amplified from genomic DNA confirmed the location of the cysteine residue and showed that the mutation was a single nucleotide change in one COL1A1 allele. This represents a new class of mutations, point mutations outside the triple-helical domain of the chains of type I collagen, that produce the osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2123732736,"A new methylammonium-resistant mutant strain from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, henceforth termed 2172 (ma-2), has been isolated. This mutant is affected in a single mendelian gene different from and linked to the ma-1 locus which is defective in the methylammonium-resistant mutant 2170. Both mutations in ma-1 (2170) and ma-2 (2172) are linked to the nit-1 gene coding for the nitrate reductase apoenzyme. Mutant 2172 is affected in methylammonium but not in ammonium uptake capacity and shows derepressed nitrate and nitrite reductase activities in media containing nitrate plus methylammonium but not in nitrate plus ammonium media. The following two enzymatic components for the transport of both ammonium and methylammonium in wild-type cells have been identified: component 1, with high Vmax and K values, which is constitutive, and component 2, with low Vmax and K values, which is ammonium-repressible. Mutant 2170 lacks component 1 whereas mutant 2172 lacks component 2 for both methylammonium and ammonium transport. From genetic and kinetic evidences we conclude that in C. reinhardtii two different carriers are responsible for the transport of both ammonium and methylammonium and that methylammonium (ammonium) transport is a reversible process probably inhibited by the intracellular ammonium which, in turn, regulates nitrate and nitrite reductase levels."
https://openalex.org/W1669232021,"The effect of changes in cellular iron metabolism on the surface expression of transferrin receptors (TfR) was examined in primary cultures of hepatocytes from adult rats. Untreated control hepatocytes exhibited a single class of high affinity receptors for transferrin (KD = 40 nM), with approximately 17,000-18,000 receptors per cell. Following 24 h of treatment with the iron chelator, desferrioxamine, or with succinylacetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis, the number of TfR at the cell surface was increased severalfold, with no significant change in receptor affinity (KD) for transferrin. When combined, the enhancing effects of the two agents were additive. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide abolished the increase in TfR expression mediated by either agent. Hemin decreased surface TfR expression and counteracted the enhancing effects of desferrioxamine or succinylacetone on TfR expression. These results indicate that, under the culture conditions employed, 1) iron deficiency induces an increase in surface TfR and 2) modulation of the receptor population is mainly dependent on de novo synthesis of TfR."
https://openalex.org/W1582963243,"The early response to chronic low frequency stimulation is characterized by coordinate changes in fast thin filament and Z-line protein expression prior to the expression of slow contractile proteins. Within the first 3 weeks of intervention there is 1) a transition from expression of the fast troponin (Tn) Ts TnT1f and TnT2f to expression of TnT3f, 2) a parallel change in Z-line protein expression in which alpha-actinin1f/s becomes predominant, and 3) a small but significant increase in the levels of the beta-tropomyosin (Tm) subunit. The timing of these changes coincides with the conversion to thick Z-lines, and the kinetics of changes in fast TnT and alpha-actinin isoforms suggests that the expression of TnT3f with alpha-actinin1f/s and a combination of alpha beta and beta 2-Tm, which we have designated the TnT3f program, is coordinated. Because fast fibers expressing TnT3f with alpha beta and beta 2-Tm, like slow fibers, exhibit a more graded response to calcium (Schachat, F.H., Diamond, M.S., and Brandt, P.W. (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 198, 551-555), this change appears to be an adaptive response, illustrating the contribution of isoform diversity to the physiological plasticity of fast skeletal muscle and indicating that expression of the TnT3f program may be an intermediate phase in the conversion from a fast to a slow molecular phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1559669915,"Binding of 13C-labeled N-acetylgalactosamine (13C-GalNAc) and N-trifluoroacetylgalactosamine (19F-GalNAc) to Artocarpus integrifolia agglutinin has been studied using 13C and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Binding of these saccharides resulted in broadening of the resonances, and no change in chemical shift was observed, suggesting that the alpha- and beta-anomers of 13C-GalNAc and 19F-GalNAc experience a magnetically equivalent environment in the lectin combining site. The alpha- and beta-anomers of 13C-GalNAc and 19F-GalNAc were found to be in slow exchange between free and protein bound states. Binding of 13C-GalNAc was studied as a function of temperature. From the temperature dependence of the line broadening, the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were evaluated. The association rate constants obtained for the alpha-anomers of 13C-GalNAc and 19F-GalNAc (k+1 = 1.01 x 10(5) M-1.s-1 and 0.698 x 10(5) M-1.s-1, respectively) are in close agreement with those obtained for the corresponding beta-anomers (k+1 = 0.95 x 10(5) M-1.s-1 and 0.65 x 10(5) M-1.s-1, respectively), suggesting that the two anomers bind to the lectin by a similar mechanism. In addition these values are several orders of magnitude slower than those obtained for diffusion controlled processes. The dissociation rate constants obtained are 49.9, 56.9, 42, and 43 s-1, respectively, for the alpha- and beta-anomers of 13C-GalNAc and 19F-GalNAc. A two-step mechanism has been proposed for the interaction of 13C-GalNAc and 19F-GalNAc with A. integrifolia lectin in view of the slow association rates and high activation entropies. The thermodynamic parameters obtained for the association and dissociation reactions suggest that the binding process is entropically favored and that there is a small enthalpic contribution."
https://openalex.org/W2167846336,Xenopus oocytes were injected with total mRNA isolated from hearts of 1-day-old chicks. After 5 days of incubation the follicular cell layers were removed and the oocytes were loaded with Na+ by incubation in hypertonic EGTA solution at 37 degrees C. The Na+-loaded oocytes accumulated 45Ca2+ from a Na+-free medium at a 3-18-fold higher rate than noninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with control solution containing no mRNA. Oocytes not subjected to the Na+-loading procedure showed no mRNA-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake. Size fractionation of the mRNA using sucrose density gradient centrifugation under denaturing conditions led to the identification of a 25 S fraction competent for induction of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system.
https://openalex.org/W1507194153,Resonance Raman spectroscopy at ambient temperature and 77 K has been used to probe the structures of the copper sites in Achromobacter cycloclastes nitrite reductase. This enzyme contains three copper ions per protein molecule and has two principal electronic absorption bands with lambda max values of 458 and 585 nm. Comparisons between the resonance Raman spectra of nitrite reductase and blue copper proteins establish that both the 458 and 585 nm bands are associated with Cu(II)-S(Cys) chromophores. A histidine ligand probably is also present. Different sets of vibrational frequencies are observed with 457.9 nm (ambient) or 476.1 nm (77 K) excitation as compared with 590 nm (ambient) or 593 nm (77 K) excitation. Excitation profiles indicate that the 458 and 585 nm absorption bands are associated with separate [Cu(II)-S(Cys)N(His)] sites or with inequivalent and uncoupled cysteine ligands in the same site. The former possibility is considered to be more likely.
https://openalex.org/W1533769453,"Abstract The binding of [3H]ADP and [3H]adenyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate ([3H]AMP-PNP) to rabbit skeletal myofibrils was measured at 25 and 7 degrees C, mu = 0.12 M, using [14C]mannitol as a volume marker. We found that ADP bound to myosin heads in overlap with a binding constant of about 10(4) M-1, similar to the value we previously obtained in vitro with acto.S-1. The binding of AMP-PNP to myosin heads was measured both in and out of overlap. The affinity of AMP-PNP to the heads out of overlap was similar to that obtained in vitro with S-1 alone. The binding of AMP-PNP to the myosin heads in overlap was much weaker. We could fit these data with a binding constant of about 1 x 10(3) M-1, assuming a single population of cross-bridges and 1 mol of AMP-PNP bound per mol of myosin head. This value was reduced by a factor of 2 when we corrected for nonspecific binding. It was also possible to fit the data assuming two equal populations of cross-bridges with one of the populations binding AMP-PNP about 5-fold more strongly than the other population. Therefore, for at least half of the cross-bridges in overlap, the binding of AMP-PNP is almost as weak as the value of 3 x 10(2) M-1 we previously measured for the acto.S-1 complex in vitro (Biosca, J. A., Greene, L. E., and Eisenberg, E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9793-9800)."
https://openalex.org/W1551820041,"Although the sequence and organization of many Bacillus subtilis tRNA genes are known, primary transcripts from these regions have not been previously analyzed. In this paper, S1 nuclease mapping, S1-type mapping, and Northern analyses were applied to the end of the 23 S rRNA, the 5 S rRNA, and the 21 tRNA genes of B. subtilis operon rrnB. Primary transcripts from the 5 S rRNA and tRNA genes up to approximately 600-800 nucleotides long were observed with S1-type mapping. The presence of discrete bands of processing intermediates indicated preferred processing points within the initial transcript. S1 nuclease mapping delineated a start point for transcription between the second and third tRNA genes. The -10 sequence was within the 37-base pair spacer region between tRNA genes, and the -35 sequence was within the structural gene for the upstream tRNA. Precursors from this region were evident during midexponential growth and two sporulation stages. Thus, in addition to promotion from the rRNA promoters, 19 of the 21 downstream tRNA genes are also under the control of an internal tRNA gene promoter. The accompanying paper (Vold, B. S., Green, C. J., Narasimhan, N., Strem, M., and Hansen, J. N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14485-14490) investigates the minor 5 S rRNA and 16 tRNA genes of another rRNA-tRNA gene set and emphasizes unique promoter elements in that system as well as a potentially unique rRNA processing scheme."
https://openalex.org/W1522503124,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the aging effects in phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) may be simulated in vitro by prolonged incubation of the enzyme under nonreducing conditions followed by reduction with excess 2-mercaptoethanol. The simulated-old enzyme thus produced appears to be identical to native old PGK and, like the latter enzyme, may be successfully rejuvenated by an unfolding-refolding procedure. A model for PGK aging was proposed in which initial and reversible oxidation of the enzyme is followed by conformational modifications that persist after the enzyme is re-reduced. The role of specific cysteine oxidation in the initial step of PGK aging was tested in the present study by selectively methylating the fast-reacting cysteine residues in this enzyme, thus blocking the putative oxidation sites, and producing in vitro a young form of PGK that is immune to aging. The methylation was performed by treating the enzyme with excess iodomethane and monitoring the reaction by determining the concentration of unreacted cysteines in the enzyme as a function of time. Unmethylated controls were incubated similarly but in the absence of iodomethane. The methylated as well as control samples of PGK were subsequently incubated under conditions which caused native young PGK to develop the age-related effects and become identical to native old PGK. In contrast, the methylated enzyme remained identical to young PGK. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that cysteine oxidation is an essential step in the aging of rat muscle phosphoglycerate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1528857763,"Incubation of a highly purified bovine spleen protein tyrosine kinase with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mg2+ resulted in a gradual radioactive labeling of the protein kinase (50 kDa) with no change in the protein kinase activity toward angiotensin II. On the other hand, treatment of the protein tyrosine kinase with an immobilized alkaline phosphatase caused essentially complete loss in the kinase activity, which could be restored by incubation of the enzyme with ATP and Mg2+. By using the alkaline phosphatase-treated kinase, time courses of the protein phosphorylation and the enzyme activation were demonstrated to correlate closely. These results indicate that this protein tyrosine kinase relies on autophosphorylation for activity and that the purified enzyme usually exists in a fully phosphorylated state. The radioactive labeling of the purified kinase during incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted from a phosphate exchange reaction: the exchange of [gamma-32P]phosphate of ATP with the protein bound phosphate as previously suggested (Kong, S.K., and Wang, J.H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2597-2603). It could be shown that the autophosphorylation of phosphatase-treated tyrosine kinase was strongly inhibited by the substrate angiotensin II, whereas the exchange reaction carried out with untreated tyrosine kinase was not. Autophosphorylation is suggested to be an intermolecular reaction since its initial rate is proportional to the square of the protein concentration."

The program TFLUX was used to construct models consisting of 17 metabolite pools and 40 reactions (excluding external pools). Net glucose uptake was 10% or less in the two experiments chosen for extensive analysis, and a single steady-state model was adequate to describe the data in both cases. Despite differences in metabolite levels, flux, and labeling kinetics, the models of glucose-perturbed metabolism confirm earlier conclusions regarding metabolic compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1496058486,"We have studied the calcium-binding properties of two high affinity calcium-binding proteins from squid optic lobes: one, squid calmodulin (SCaM), similar to bovine brain calmodulin (BCaM), the other, squid calcium-binding protein (SCaBP), distinct (Head, J.F., Spielberg, S., and Kaminer, B. (1983) Biochem J. 209, 797-802). Equilibrium dialysis measurements on the squid proteins (and BCaM) were made at 100 mM KCl in the presence and absence of 3 mM Mg2+, and at 400 mM KCl in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+, which more closely resembles the conditions in the squid. SCaM, SCaBP, and BCaM each bind a maximum of 4 Ca2+ ions/molecule of protein under the ionic conditions tested. SCaBP has a higher affinity than SCaM or BCaM for Ca2+ at 100 mM KCl in the absence of Mg2+. However, in the presence of Mg2+, half-maximal binding to SCaBP occurs at a similar pCa value to that observed with calmodulin. Increasing the KCl concentration reduces the affinity of all three proteins for Ca2+. UV absorption measurements showed that the binding of 4 Ca2+ ions/molecule is necessary to complete spectral changes in SCaBP, compared to two for the calmodulins. While Ca2+ causes perturbations in aromatic chromophores in SCaM and SCaBP, Mg2+ causes a significant perturbation only in SCaBP. These Mg2+-induced changes differ qualitatively from those induced by Ca2+."

A 17-kilobase pair fragment of cloned normal rat DNA contains the gene for p9Ka, but it also contains the gene for two additional polypeptides of molecular mass 6 kDa that are resolved as two isoelectric focusing variants by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These two isoelectric focusing variants correspond to two abundant polypeptides present in the cultured myoepithelial cells and probably arise from postsynthetic modification of the product of a single gene.
