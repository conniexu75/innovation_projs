https://openalex.org/W2075300416,"Previous studies have demonstrated that allelic deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 occur in over 75% of colorectal carcinomas. Twenty chromosome 17p markers were used to localize the common region of deletion in these tumors to a region contained within bands 17p12 to 17p13.3. This region contains the gene for the transformation-associated protein p53. Southern and Northern blot hybridization experiments provided no evidence for gross alterations of the p53 gene or surrounding sequences. As a more rigorous test of the possibility that p53 was a target of the deletions, the p53 coding regions from two tumors were analyzed; these two tumors, like most colorectal carcinomas, had allelic deletions of chromosome 17p and expressed considerable amounts of p53 messenger RNA from the remaining allele. The remaining p53 allele was mutated in both tumors, with an alanine substituted for valine at codon 143 of one tumor and a histidine substituted for arginine at codon 175 of the second tumor. Both mutations occurred in a highly conserved region of the p53 gene that was previously found to be mutated in murine p53 oncogenes. The data suggest that p53 gene mutations may be involved in colorectal neoplasia, perhaps through inactivation of a tumor suppressor function of the wild-type p53 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2067013502,"A new method has been developed that makes it possible to site-specifically incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins. Synthetic amino acids were incorporated into the enzyme β-lactamase by the use of a chemically acylated suppressor transfer RNA that inserted the amino acid in response to a stop codon substituted for the codon encoding residue of interest. Peptide mapping localized the inserted amino acid to a single peptide, and enough enzyme could be generated for purification to homogeneity. The catalytic properties of several mutants at the conserved Phe66 were characterized. The ability to selectively replace amino acids in a protein with a wide variety of structural and electronic variants should provide a more detailed understanding of protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2111723163,"We describe a general assay designed to detect mutants of yeast that are defective for any of several aspects of telomere function. Using this assay, we have isolated a mutant that displays a progressive decrease in telomere length as well as an increased frequency of chromosome loss. This mutation defines a new gene, designated EST1 (for ever shorter telomeres). Null alleles of EST1 are not immediately inviable; instead, they have a senescence phenotype, due to the gradual loss of sequences essential for telomere function, leading to a progressive decrease in chromosomal stability and subsequent cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2010081701,"THE latent period of AIDS is influenced by factors which activate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in different cell types. Although monocytic cells may provide a reservoir for virus production in vivo1–8, their regulation of HIV transcription has not been defined. We now report that HIV gene expression in the monocyte lineage is regulated by NF-kB, the same transcription factor known to stimulate the HIV enhancer in activated T cells9; however, control of NF-kB and HIV in monocytes differs from that observed in T cells. NF-kB-binding activity appears during the transition from promonocyte to monocyte in U937 cells induced to differentiate in vitro and is present constitutively in mature monocytes and macrophages. In a chronically infected pro-monocytic cell, Ul, differentiation is associated with HIV-1 replication as well as NF-kB binding activity. These findings suggest that NF-kB binding activity is developmentally regulated in the monocyte lineage, and that it provides one signal for HIV activation in these cells."

https://openalex.org/W2153405631,"We designed a strategy to identify splicing factors that act by preventing pre-mRNA transport into the cytoplasm. A yeast synthetic intron was inserted into a lacZ gene so that only the pre-mRNA could be translated to produce beta-galactosidase activity. Deletion of either of the 5' splice junction sequence GUAUGU and the branchpoint sequence UACUAAC resulted in a dramatic increase in pre-mRNA translation, indicating its cytoplasmic localization. In rna6 and rna9 mutant strains assayed at the nonpermissive temperature, splicing inhibition occurred simultaneously with a large increase in pre-mRNA translation. Similarly, a point mutation in U1 snRNA decreased splicing efficiency and increased pre-mRNA translation. From these results, we conclude that early acting factors, probably including U1 snRNA, and the RNA6 and RNA9 gene products, interact in vivo with the 5' splice junction and the branchpoint sequence to commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway, thereby preventing its transport to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1993108804,"Confirmed infection with HTLV-II (human T cell leukemia virus type II) has been described only in rare cases. The major limitation to serological diagnosis of HTLV-II has been the difficulty of distinguishing HTLV-II from HTLV-I (human T cell leukemia virus type I) infection, because of substantial cross-reactivity between the viruses. A sensitive modification of the polymerase chain reaction method was used to provide unambiguous molecular evidence that a significant proportion of intravenous drug abusers are infected with HTLV, and the majority of these individuals are infected with HTLV-II rather than HTLV-I. Of 23 individuals confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis to be infected with HTLV, 21 were identified to be infected with HTLV-II, and 2 were infected with HTLV-I. Molecular identification of an HTLV-II—infected population provides an opportunity to investigate the pathogenicity of HTLV-II in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2158649428,"To investigate the relationship between the degradation rate of a protein in Escherichia coli and its thermal stability in vitro, we constructed a set of variants of the N-terminal domain of lambda repressor with a wide range of melting temperatures. Pulse-chase experiments showed that, within this set, the proteins that are most thermally stable have the longest intracellular half-lives and vice versa. Moreover, second-site mutations which act directly or indirectly to increase the thermodynamic stability of the native N-terminal domain were found to suppress the intracellular degradation of one of the unstable mutants. These data suggest that thermal stability is, indeed, a key determinant of the proteolytic susceptibility of this protein in the cell. It is not the sole determinant, however, as sequences at the extreme C terminus of the N-terminal domain can influence proteolytic sensitivity without affecting the stability of the native structure. We propose that the thermal stability of the N-terminal domain of lambda repressor is an important determinant of its proteolytic sensitivity because degradation proceeds primarily from the unfolded form and that sequence determinants within the unfolded chain influence whether the unfolded protein will be a good substrate for proteolytic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2032318665,"Aspergillus nidulans brlA, abaA, and wetA form a dependent pathway that regulates asexual reproductive development. The order in which these genes are expressed determines the outcome of development. Expression of brlA in vegetative cells leads to activation of abaA and wetA, cessation of vegetative growth, cellular vacuolization, and spore formation. By contrast, expression of abaA in vegetative cells does not result in conidial differentiation but does lead to activation of brlA and wetA, cessation of vegetative growth, and accentuated cellular vacuolization. brlA, abaA, and wetA act individually and together to regulate their own expression and that of numerous other sporulation-specific genes. We propose that the central pathway controlling development is largely autoregulatory. The timing and extent of expression of the regulatory genes and their targets are determined as development proceeds by intrinsically controlled changes in the relative concentrations of regulatory gene products in the various conidiophore cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1550334320,"Abstract The L-A double-stranded RNA virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes its major coat protein (80 kDa) and a minor single-stranded RNA binding protein (180 kDa) that has immunological cross-reactivity with the major coat protein. The sequence of L-A cDNA clones revealed two open reading frames (ORF), ORF1 and ORF2. These two reading frames overlap by 130 base pairs and ORF2 is in the -1 reading frame with respect to ORF1. Although the major coat protein of the viral particles is encoded by ORF1, the 180-kDa protein is derived from the entire double-stranded RNA genome by fusing ORF1 and ORF2, probably by a -1 translational frameshift. Within the overlapping region is a sequence similar to that producing a -1 frameshift by simultaneous slippage in retroviruses. The coding sequence of ORF2 shows a pattern characteristic of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of icosahedral (+)-strand RNA viruses. Thus, the 180-kDa protein is analogous to gag-pol fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1564154324,"Endothelin, a novel peptide isolated from the conditioned medium of endothelial cells, causes a slow, sustained contraction of vascular smooth muscle, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. To determine whether the diacylglycerol/protein kinase C signalling pathway is stimulated by endothelin, we exposed cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells to endothelin and measured diacylglycerol accumulation and protein kinase C-dependent protein phosphorylation. Endothelin stimulated a dose-dependent, biphasic increase in diacylglycerol, which was sustained for at least 20 min. This peptide also induced a prolonged phosphorylation of an acidic protein with a molecular weight of 76,000, which was detectable by 30 s and sustained for at least 20 min. This phosphorylation could be mimicked by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not by ionomycin, and was markedly reduced when protein kinase C was down-regulated by a 24-h pretreatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. These results suggest that endothelin causes a robust stimulation of the diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, and that this mechanism may contribute importantly to the physiologic events stimulated by endothelin in intact blood vessels, including slow, tonic contraction and Ca2+ influx."

https://openalex.org/W1974257082,"DNA fragments containing the silencers that flank the mating type genes at HML alpha are shown to bind specifically to the nuclear scaffold of yeast. The scaffold proteins are solubilized with urea and then renatured to form a soluble extract which allows reconstitution of sequence-specific DNA loops. At the silent mating type locus HML alpha, loops are formed by either silencer-silencer (E-I) interaction or silencer-promoter interactions (E-P and I-P). The nuclear protein RAP-1 fractionates efficiently with the nuclear scaffold, and binds to the E, I, and promoter regions. Affinity purification of RAP-1 and oligonucleotide competition show that RAP-1 is necessary for reconstitution of loops in vitro. These results are consistent with a model in which silencers define a chromatin loop within which occur modifications that maintain the promoter in an inactive state."
https://openalex.org/W1576104289,"EnvZ is a cytoplasmic membrane protein which is involved in osmoregulatory expression of the ompF and ompC genes in Escherichia coli possibly by sensing the environmental osmotic signal. A truncated form of the EnvZ protein (EnvZ*), comprising 82% of EnvZ starting from the C terminus, was purified to homogeneity. The purified EnvZ* was autophosphorylated with ATP. The phosphoryl group on EnvZ* could then be rapidly transferred to OmpR, which is a positive regulator of the ompF and ompC genes and which was proposed to interact with EnvZ in the process of osmoregulation. In the presence of ATP, the phosphorylated OmpR was rapidly dephosphorylated. These results suggest that the transfer of the phosphoryl group between EnvZ and OmpR plays an important role in the signaling pathway in osmoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1493851369,"To gain insight into the mechanism of the antiproliferative effects of heparin on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), the influence of this glycosaminoglycan on cell cycle progression and the expression of the c-fos, c-myc, and c-myb proto-oncogenes and two other growth-regulated genes was examined. SMC, synchronized by a serum-deprivation protocol, enter S phase 12–16 h after serum stimulation. Pretreatment with heparin for 48 h blocked the induction of histone H3 RNA, an S phase-expressed product, and prevented cell replication. Thus, heparin prevents entry of cells into S phase. Conversely, heparin had essentially no effect on changes in expression of the c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes during the G0 to G1 transition. Normal increases in c-fos and c-myc RNA were observed 30 min and 2 h following serum addition, respectively. However, the increase in expression of the mRNA of the c-myb proto-oncogene and the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier protein, 2F1, which begins to occur 8 h following serum addition to SMC, was completely inhibited by heparin. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the products of a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation of RNA isolated at various times confirmed this temporal assessment of the effects of heparin. These results suggest that heparin does not inhibit cell proliferation by blocking the G0 to G1 transition. Rather, heparin may affect a critical event in the mid-G1 phase of the cell cycle which is necessary for subsequent DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1534013912,"Abstract Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictive peptide recently isolated by Yanagisawa, M., Kurihara, H., Kimura, S., Tamobe, Y., Kobayashi, M., Mitsui, Y., Yazaki, Y., Goto, K., and Masaki, T. (1988) Nature 332, 411-415). In order to understand the mechanism of action of endothelin in various cell types we have examined the effects of endothelin on second messenger levels in Rat-1 fibroblasts and A10 smooth muscle cells. Endothelin stimulated a 15-fold increase in the accumulation of inositol trisphosphate in Rat-1 cells, with half-maximal stimulation observed at 0.5 nM endothelin. In the A10 vascular smooth muscle cell line, endothelin stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover more than 3-fold, comparable to the stimulation produced by serum. Concurrent with the increase in inositol phosphate release, endothelin increased diacylglycerol levels by 50% in A10 cells and by more than 3-fold in Rat-1 cells. The increase in diacylglycerol levels in response to endothelin was equal to or greater than the response to serum. Stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover by endothelin did not require the presence of extracellular calcium and was not blocked by treatment with EGTA or cobalt. Furthermore, endothelin did not stimulate Ca2+ uptake by either cell type and actually reduced Ca2+ uptake below control levels with increased duration of preincubation. Endothelin stimulated an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, from 100 to over 750 nM in Rat-1 cells and from 150 to over 350-nM in A10 cells as measured by fura-2 microspectrofluorimetry. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was not inhibited by the presence of EGTA or cobalt. These data indicate that endothelin did not act to open Ca2+ channels in either Rat-1 fibroblasts or A10 smooth muscle cells. Cytoplasmic levels of VL30 RNA, a gene independently induced by protein kinase C and by epidermal growth factor, were increased following endothelin treatment, even in protein kinase C-depleted cells. We conclude that endothelin is a very potent stimulus for phosphatidylinositol turnover, diacylglycerol release, and gene transcription. These data may have wide-ranging implications for a number of disease states."
https://openalex.org/W1510873284,"Abstract The biochemical basis for the inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli by the antibiotic thiolactomycin was investigated. A biochemical assay was developed to measure acetoacetyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase activity, a recently discovered third condensing enzyme from E. coli (Jackowski, S., and Rock, C.O. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7927-7931). In contrast to the other two condensing enzymes in E. coli, acetoacetyl-ACP synthase (synthase III) condensed malonyl-ACP with acetyl-CoA, rather than with acetyl-ACP. The concentration dependence of thiolactomycin inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo was the same as the inhibition of acetoacetyl-ACP synthase activity in vitro indicating that the two phenomena were related. A thiolactomycin-resistant mutant (strain CDM5) was isolated. The specific activity of acetoacetyl-ACP synthase in extracts from this mutant was 10-fold lower than in extracts from its thiolactomycin-sensitive parent resulting in a marked defect in the ability of strain CDM5 to incorporate acetyl-CoA into fatty acids in vitro. The residual acetoacetyl-ACP synthase activity in the resistant strain was refractory to thiolactomycin inhibition. In addition, acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activity in strain CDM5 was resistant to inactivation by thiolactomycin suggesting that the acetoacetyl-ACP synthase also catalyzes this transacylation reaction. These data point to acetoacetyl-ACP synthase as a target for thiolactomycin inhibition of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606815882,"To investigate myeloid cell maturation, we established a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize myeloid cell nuclear antigens. One of these monoclonal antibodies was used to purify a specific protein complex (PC) from a human spleen. This PC, which is present at high levels in peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes, contains a protein that is the cystic fibrosis (CF) antigen. The purified PC was shown to inhibit the activity of casein kinase I and II but not cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, v-abl tyrosine kinase, or insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. The observed Ki values for casein kinases I and II purified from several sources were 1 microM or less. Furthermore, the addition of the purified PC to a nuclear extract from human cells was able to prevent protein kinase-mediated stimulation of RNA polymerase activity. The unique inhibitory character of the PC and its elevated levels in monocytes and granulocytes and of the CF antigen in CF patients implies that this complex may be associated with myeloid cell functions and perhaps with the cause or consequence of the clinical manifestations of CF."
https://openalex.org/W1569124311,"Yeast transcription factor τ interacts with the A and B blocks of the intragenic promoter of tRNA genes. The structure of τ was investigated by identifying the polypeptide chains specifically complexed to the tRNA3Glu gene. Highly purified factor, obtained by an improved purification procedure, contained several polypeptide chains, four of which (Mr = 145,000, 135,000, 100,000 and 65,000) comigrated with τ-DNA complex by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antibodies raised against the 145- and 100-kDa components altered the migration of τ-DNA complexes in band shift assays and inhibited tRNA synthesis in a reconstituted transcription system. These components are immunologically unrelated proteins. By UV cross-linking to 32P-body-labeled tDNA followed by extensive DNase treatment, two polypeptides of the same size (145 and 100 kDa) were found to be radioactively labeled. Factor τ, therefore, appears to be a multisubunit DNA-binding protein with two distinct polypeptides contributing to DNA recognition. Limited proteolysis of τ generated a protease-resistant τB (τB) domain that binds solely to the B block. τB-tDNA complexes were recognized by anti-145 IgG and contained a 120-kDa polypeptide that could originate from the 145-kDa component by proteolysis. These results strongly suggest that the 145-kDa polypeptide belongs to τB and is responsible for B block binding."
https://openalex.org/W1598202930,"Abstract Previous studies in our laboratory led to the elucidation of the covalent structure of a tetraacyldisaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate precursor of lipid A (designated lipid IVA), that accumulates at 42 degrees C in temperature-sensitive mutants defective in 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) biosynthesis (Raetz, C. R. H., Purcell, S., Meyer, M. V., Qureshi, N., and Takayama, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 16080-16088). Using [4'-32P]lipid IVA as the probe, we now demonstrate the existence of cytoplasmic KDO-transferases in Escherichia coli capable of attaching 2 KDO residues, derived from CMP-KDO, to lipid IVA. A partial purification has been developed to obtain a cytoplasmic subfraction that adds these 2 KDO residues with a 90% yield. The product is shown to have the stoichiometry of (KDO)2-IVA by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The partially purified enzyme can utilize alternative lipid-disaccharide cosubstrates bearing five or six fatty acyl chains, but it has an absolute requirement for a monophosphate residue at position 4' of the lipid acceptor. When reincubated with a crude cytoplasmic fraction, a nucleoside triphosphate and Mg2+, (KDO)2-IVA is rapidly metabolized to more polar substances, the identity of which is unknown. The KDO-transferase(s) described in the present study should be very useful for the semisynthetic preparation of complex lipopolysaccharide substructures and analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1606823119,"Abstract Ribosomal tRNA binding studies and functional tests were performed at 6 mM Mg2+ using the mRNA analogue C17AUGA4C17 which contains three unique codons in its central region. The following results were obtained. 1) The relative binding affinities of 20 different deacylated tRNAs to nonprogrammed 70 S ribosomes were assessed and were found to vary substantially. 2) When added as the first tRNA, fMet-tRNA and deacylated tRNAs (but not N-acetylated aminoacyl-tRNAs) can bind to internal codons of the mRNA and are therefore suitable for setting the reading frame via codon-anticodon interaction in the peptidyl-tRNA site (P site). 3) After prefilling the P site with deacylated tRNA, the exit site for deacylated tRNA (E site) can be quantitatively occupied only if the cognate codon is present at that site. 4) The translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the aminoacyl-tRNA site (A site) to the P site is not accompanied by a release of deacylated tRNA. The codon sequence excludes a release and rebinding of deacylated tRNA to the newly exposed A site. Rather, the deacylated tRNA is cotranslocated from the P to the E site where it remains stably bound. 5) After one round of elongation, addition of an A site ligand triggers the dissociation of deacylated tRNA from the E site. Conversely, E site occupation reduces the affinity of the A site for N-acetylated aminoacyl-tRNA. Thus, A and E sites are allosterically linked via negative cooperativity. The results support the allosteric three-site model as an appropriate description of the ribosomal elongation cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2074714376,"The t complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) is a protein of unknown function expressed in large amounts during spermatogenesis. Rat monoclonal antibodies recognizing TCP-1 have been prepared and used to immunoprecipitate and Western blot a 57 kd protein from germ cell and tissue culture cell extracts. In tissue culture cells, indirect immunofluorescent localization of antigen indicated a perinuclear distribution similar to that of the Golgi apparatus. Analysis of the TCP-1 distribution in tissue culture cells showed that the polypeptide was associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of membranes of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The distribution in spermatids suggested that TCP-1 was localized to structures often associated with the developing acrosome. The TCP-1 antigenic epitopes are highly conserved, allowing the protein to be identified in cells across a wide variety of vertebrate species and tissues. These experiments suggest that TCP-1 may be essential for transport of proteins through the exocytic pathway in all cells and required in large amounts for acrosome formation in developing spermatids."
https://openalex.org/W1518634992,"Escherichia coli p-aminobenzoate synthase is composed of two nonidentical subunits encoded by pabA and pabB and has been assumed to be the sole enzyme responsible for p-aminobenzoate biosynthesis from chorismate and glutamine. Plasmids were constructed that overproduce the p-aminobenzoate synthase subunits 250-500-fold. Partial purification of the subunits revealed that they form a diffusible intermediate that is subsequently converted to p-aminobenzoate by a second enzyme (Mr = 49,000) temporarily designated enzyme X."
https://openalex.org/W2167223768,"Abstract Revertants of defective mutants in the Arc repressor of bacteriophage P22 were isolated. Five of the six reverting mutations were frameshifts near the end of the coding sequence which resulted in proteins with C-terminal extensions. Each of the reverting mutations prolong the half-lives in vivo of the proteins in which they reside, yet they do not alter the thermodynamic stability, structure, oligomeric form, or DNA-binding properties of these proteins. Fusion of one of these tails to the C-terminal end of a mutant form of the N-terminal domain of lambda repressor also prevented proteolysis of this protein. These C-terminal sequences may prevent degradation by blocking the recognition of unstable proteins by the proteolytic machinery in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1584515218,"TUF is a yeast regulatory factor that binds to conserved DNA sequence elements involved in gene activation or silencing as well as in telomere function. Using gel electrophoresis analyses, we show here that TUF induces DNA bending at a site located upstream of the recognition sequence (rpg box). Several point mutations in the rpg box reduced TUF binding strength without affecting the extent of bending. Selective proteolysis of TUF.DNA complexes further suggested the existence of two separate protein domains involved in DNA bending and specific DNA recognition. DNA bending may be an important feature of multifunctional factors that could help them to recruit other proteins for the formation of multiprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1544758090,"The cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex is one of two terminal oxidases which are components of the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli. This membrane-bound enzyme catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol and the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water. Enzyme turnover generates proton and voltage gradients across the bilayer. The oxidase is a heterodimer containing 2 mol of protoheme IX and 1 or 2 mol of heme d per mol of complex. To explain the functional properties of the enzyme, a simple model has been proposed in which it is speculated that the heme prosthetic groups define two separate active sites on opposite sides of the membrane at which the oxidation of quinol and the reduction of water, respectively, are catalyzed. This paper represents an initial effort to define the axial ligands of each of the three or four hemes within the amino acid sequence of the oxidase subunits. Each of the 10 histidine residues has been altered by site-directed mutagenesis with the expectation that histidine residues are likely candidates for heme ligands. Eight of the 10 histidine residues are not essential for enzyme activity, and 2 appear to function as heme axial ligands. Histidine 186 in subunit I is required for the cytochrome b558 component of the enzyme. This residue is likely to be located near the periplasmic surface of the membrane. Histidine 19, near the amino terminus of subunit I also appears to be a heme ligand. It is concluded that two of the four or five expected heme axial ligands have been tentatively identified, although further work is required to confirm these conclusions. A minimum of two additional axial ligands must be residues other than histidine."
https://openalex.org/W3122194758,"Augmented by public programs such as Social Security and Medicare, incomes of the elderly in the United States have grown more rapidly during the last several decades than have the incomes of other groups, so that on average the elderly are at least as well off as the nonelderly. Not all elderly, however, have done as well: widows, in particular, have high poverty rates. The economic prospects of the elderly during the next few decades are good because of the large work force from the baby-boom cohort. In the distant future a large fraction of the population will be elderly, which will probably lead to a deterioration in their economic status. Today, the main problems center on the distribution of economic resources among the elderly and on uncertainties such as costs of medical care."

Cross-linking of the 96-kDa CBP was found to occur spontaneously without UV light induction. Based on the ATP/Mg2+ requirements, the three CBPs can be subdivided into two classes: 1) ATP/Mg2+ independent (24- and 150 kDa) and 2) Mg2+ dependent (96 kDa). The co-purification of the 24- and 150-kDa CBPs through several different chromatographic steps is consistent with the existence of a yeast CBP complex, possibly analogous to mammalian eIF-4F."
https://openalex.org/W1536172663,"Yeast aminopeptidase I is a vacuolar enzyme, which catalyzes the removal of amino acids from the NH2 terminus of peptides and proteins (Frey, J., and Rohm, K-H. (1978) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 527, 31-41). A yeast genomic DNA encoding aminopeptidase I was cloned from a yeast EMBL3A library and sequenced. The DNA sequence encodes a precursor protein containing 514 amino acid residues. The mature protein, whose NH2-terminal sequence was confirmed by automated Edman degradation, consists, based only on the DNA sequence, of 469 amino acids. A 45-residue presequence contains positively and negatively charged as well as hydrophobic residues, and its NH2-terminal residues could be arrayed in an amphiphilic alpha-helix. This presequence differs from the signal sequences which direct proteins across bacterial plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticulum or into mitochondria. It remains to be established how this unique presequence targets aminopeptidase I to yeast vacuoles and how this sorting utilizes classical protein secretory pathways. Further, the aminopeptidase I gene, localized previously by genetic mapping to yeast chromosome XI and called the LAP4 gene (Trumbly, R. J., and Bradley, G. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 156, 36-48), was determined by DNA blot analyses to be a single copy gene located on chromosome XI."
https://openalex.org/W1594570947,"A photosystem I (PS-I) preparation from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) containing the reaction center protein P700-chlorophyll a-protein 1 (CP1) and smaller polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 18, 16, 14, 9.5, 9, 4, and 1.5 kDa has been analyzed with respect to subunit stoichiometry. CP1 contains two homologous subunits with approximate masses of 82 kDa. CP1 and the smaller polypeptides were isolated, and the amino acid composition of each component and of the PS-I preparation was determined. Based on the amino acid composition data and the determined ability of each isolated polypeptide to bind Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the PS-I complex is shown to contain 1 mol of each of the homologous 82-kDa polypeptides as well as 1 mol of the 18-, 16-, 9.5-, and 9-kDa polypeptides for each mol of P700. The total polypeptide mass of the PS-I complex is 209 kDa excluding tryptophan and approximately 220 kDa including tryptophan. The two 82-kDa subunits present/P700 provide cysteine residues for binding only one Fe-S center. In conjunction with the earlier reported binding of four iron and four acid-labile sulfides to CP1/P700 (Hoj, P. B., Svendsen, I., Scheller, H. V., and Moller, B. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12676-12684), this demonstrates the center X is a [4Fe-4S] cluster and eliminates the possibility of center X being composed of two [2Fe-2S] clusters."
https://openalex.org/W1514012894,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) have 50% sequence homology and regulate similar cellular functions. Their membrane receptors also share 84% homology in a tyrosine kinase domain essential to transmembrane signaling and may thus share common postreceptor paths. To probe action mechanisms for these related hormones, we examined the receptor and postreceptor overlap of responses stimulated by insulin and IGF-I. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts have few endogenous insulin receptors and are insensitive to insulin; they have IGF-I receptors and are responsive to IGF-I. Stable transfection of these cells with cDNA for the human insulin receptor yielded a cell line (3T3/HIR) expressing greater than 6 x 10(6) receptors/cell that was highly sensitive and responsive to insulin for stimulation of deoxy[14C]glucose uptake and [3H]thymidine incorporation. The cells also showed increased responses to IGF-I, although the sensitivity was less than that for insulin. The receptor specificity of such responses was examined with a monoclonal antibody MA10 that bound to insulin receptors, but elicited no responses. When 3T3/HIR cells were preincubated with MA10, subsequent insulin- or IGF-I-stimulated deoxy[14C]glucose uptake was markedly inhibited. Likewise, the presence of MA10 caused a 10-fold increase in the concentration of insulin needed to stimulate half-maximal incorporation of [3H]thymidine and also led to diminished IGF-I-stimulated responses. These results showed that the transfected human insulin receptors coupled readily with existing effector pathways in the mouse fibroblasts and mediated metabolic and mitogenic responses to both insulin and IGF-I. Such findings indicate that insulin and IGF-I regulate common cellular functions using both overlapping receptor and postreceptor signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1508913819,"Abstract Spingosine, a naturally occurring inhibitor of protein kinase C, has recently been shown to have potent bioregulatory effects on a variety of cellular processes involving signal transduction mechanisms. In the present studies, we have investigated its effects on activation by insulin of hexose transport and glucose oxidation in isolated rat adipocytes. Preincubation of cells with this long-chain base blocked both the marked activation of these processes by insulin and the smaller activation by phorbol myristate acetate. Inhibition of both insulin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation showed the same sphingosine concentration dependence, suggesting a common locus of action. The effectiveness of sphingosine was inversely proportional to the lipid content in the incubation (which was a function of both the age of the animal and the number of cells used) presumably due to dilution of the lipophilic long-chain base into the cellular triglycerides. Sphingosine did not affect either insulin binding to its receptor or the half-maximal concentration of the hormone required to activate hexose transport, but reduced the maximal responses. Thus, the inhibition was at a step distal to the binding of insulin to its receptor. Basal transport activity was not inhibited, suggesting a locus of action prior to the glucose transporter. The inhibitor was also effective when added following activation by insulin of hexose transport and resulted in a rapid reversal of activation (t 1/2 for inhibition was 2-4 min.). Sphingosine and its analogs showed a parallel potency for inhibition both of isolated protein kinase C and of insulin activation in adipocytes, consistent with an essential role for protein kinase C in the activation of hexose transport by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1504629032,"Human tracheobronchial mucin was isolated from lung mucosal gel by chromatography on Sepharose 4B in the presence of dissociating and reducing agents, and its thiol residues were carboxyamidomethylated with iodo[1(-14)C]acetamide. The 14C-carboxyamido-methylated mucin was purified by chromatography on Sepharose 2B. No low molecular weight components were detected by molecular sieve chromatography or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dissociating and reducing agents or by analytical density centrifugation in CsCl/guanidinium chloride. After digestion of the purified 14C-mucin with trypsin-L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, three fractions (TR-1, TR-2, and TR-3) were observed by chromatography on Sepharose 4B. TR-1, a 260-kDa mucin glycopeptide fragment, contained all of the neutral hexose and blood group activity and 20% of the radioactivity in the undigested mucin. TR-1 was refractory to a second incubation with trypsin but could be digested by papain or Pronase to a smaller mucin glycopeptide fraction, as judged by the slight decrease in apparent molecular weight on Sepharose CL-4B. These mucin glycopeptides contained approximately 50% of the radioactivity in the TR-1 fraction, indicating that the glycosylated domains of carboxyamidomethylated tracheobronchial mucin contained thiol residues. The remainder of the radioactivity from papain or Pronase digests of TR-1 eluted, like the TR-3 fractions, in the salt fraction on Sepharose CL-4B. Peptide mapping of the nonglycosylated TR-3 fraction by TLC and high voltage electrophoresis yielded six principal and several less intensely stained ninhydrin reactive components, with the radiolabel concentrated in one of the latter peptides. Peptide purification of the TR-3 fraction by high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase column demonstrated the presence of four major peptides, with TR-3A being the dominant component. The TR-3D peptide contained S-carboxy-aminomethylcysteine and had 69% sequence similarity to the sgs-7 salivary glue protein of Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W1540628749,"Abstract A crude phenolic glycolipid extract from Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was fractionated until homogeneity at the intact level into four phenolic glycolipids called B, B-1, B-2, and B-3 according to their polarity. The apolar one, which is the most abundant was assigned to the well-known mycoside B. The B-2 and B-3 phenolic glycolipids were purified by direct-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 5 micron Spherisorb column but were only recovered in small amounts (3 mg). A linear gradient of 0-20% methanol in chloroform was used. The B-1, B-2, and B-3 glycolipids were subjected to suitable modern analytical techniques selected for their potential to elucidate the structure at the intact level. Desorption chemical ionization-mass spectrometry allowed the molecular mass of B-3 to be determined as 1652 Da for the major homolog establishing the molecular formula as C103H192O14. Thus, the B-3 polar phenolic glycolipid contained two deoxyhexoses, one molecule of phenolphthiocerol esterified by two molecules of mycocerosic acid. Using two-dimensional 1H NMR (correlated chemical shift and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) at the intact level the B-3 oligosaccharide structure was determined as an alpha-L-Rhap-(1----3)-2-O-Me-alpha-L-Rhap. This is the first report of a diglycosylated phenolic glycolipid in a nonpathogenic mycobacteria. The disaccharide unit, the antigenic determinant, appears to be characteristic of M. bovis BCG. This polar glycolipid B-3 and the apolar ones, B-1 and B-2, were reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against serum from rabbit hyperimmunized with M. bovis BCG."
https://openalex.org/W1537786264,"The essential mediatory role of copper and iron in paraquat-induced biological damage has been recently demonstrated. It was postulated that these transition metals undergo cyclic redox reactions and serve as centers for repeated production of hydroxyl radical, which are the ultimate deleterious agents. Additionally, we had presented evidence indicating efficient protection against paraquat toxicity by agents commonly employed (chelators, chemical scavengers, and protecting enzymes). In this study we have used the Escherichia coli model in order to develop a new approach for protection against paraquat-induced metal-mediated cellular injury. It entails the administration of excess zinc (up to 50-fold over copper), which results in an inhibition of the toxic effect of paraquat. Lineweaver-Burk analysis demonstrates the competitive mode of this inhibition. The suggested mechanism involves either the direct displacement of copper by zinc or the formation of a ternary complex, (formula; see text) in which the binding of Cu(II) is weakened by the binding of Zn(II), interfering with the copper-mediated free radicals formation. Thus, use of redox-inactive metals, which possess high similarity of their ligand chemistry to that of iron and copper but are of relative low toxicity by themselves, should be considered for intervention in paraquat toxicity and in other metal-mediated free radical-induced injurious processes."
https://openalex.org/W1544515953,"To explain the different secretion kinetics of lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium discoideum, previous investigators have hypothesized the existence of a heterogeneous population of lysosomes containing either the enzyme acid phosphatase or other hydrolase enzymes. This proposal predicts that at least two targeting mechanisms exist for lysosomal enzymes in this organism. To begin to investigate this possibility, the transport, processing, and targeting of acid phosphatase was studied by using a combination of radiolabel pulse-chase procedures, subcellular fractionations, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Acid phosphatase was initially synthesized in axenically growing cells as a 56-kDa precursor polypeptide that was proteolytically processed after 20 min to a 55-kDa mature protein. This enzyme was rapidly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi complex (halftime of 3 min) as measured by the acquisition of resistance to the enzyme endoglycosidase H. Furthermore, Percoll gradient fractionations indicated that radiolabeled forms of acid phosphatase reached dense lysosomal vesicles at about the same time as final processing was occurring. Proper sorting of acid phosphatase in D. discoideum apparently was not critically dependent on low intravacuolar pH since the addition of ammonium chloride did not stimulate the missorting and secretion of acid phosphatase. These results are very similar to previous observations concerning other Dictyostelium lysosomal enzymes. Consistent with the existence of a heterogeneus population of lysosomes, the percentage of radiolabeled acid phosphatase secreted 4 h into a chase period was 15-fold lower as compared with another lysosomal enzyme, β-glucosidase. However, acid phosphatase, α-mannosidase, and β-glucosidase were all predominantly colocalized as determined by indirect immunofluorescence, which for the first time demonstrates the homogeneous nature of the lysosomal system in D. discoideum. Taken together these results suggest that the processing and transport of acid phosphatase may be similar in nature to the glycosidases. However, the different kinetics of secretion of acid phosphatase versus the colocalized glycosidase enzymes suggests that an undefined mechanism operates to distinguish these classes of enzymes at a step after localization to lysosomes but prior to secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1563180403,"Abstract Treatment of primary cultured adipocytes with 50 ng/ml insulin and 20 mM glucose for 0-6 h resulted in a loss of maximal insulin responsiveness (MIR) which was immediate (no lag period), rapid (t1/2 of 3 h), linear, and extensive (80% of that seen at 24 h), whereas loss of insulin sensitivity from 0-24 h was slow (t1/2 = 8 h), extensive (insulin ED50 of 0.3 and 1.45 ng/ml at 2 and 24 h, respectively), and was preceded by an initial 2-h lag. Recovery of MIR and insulin sensitivity was assessed by inducing desensitization for various times from 2-24 h, removing insulin and glucose, and then measuring MIR and insulin sensitivity over a subsequent 1-6-h period. After 2 h, recovery of MIR in desensitized cells was rapid (251 pmol of glucose/3 min/h), whereas after 24 h, recovery was much slower (35 pmol/3 min/h). In contrast, the opposite trend was seen for recovery of insulin sensitivity: at early times recovery of insulin sensitivity was slow (0.05 ng/ml/h) but was rapid after 24 h (0.12 ng/ml/h). Thus, it appears that MIR and insulin sensitivity can be independently regulated since recovery rates for MIR and insulin sensitivity diverged with the progression of insulin resistance. When the effects of insulin and glucose on recovery were examined, we found that insulin alone was unable to block recovery of MIR or insulin sensitivity. Glucose alone, however, was effective in preventing recovery of insulin sensitivity but not recovery of MIR. In the presence of 20 mM glucose, low doses of insulin (treatment EC50 = 0.22-0.46 ng/ml) effectively prevented recovery of both MIR and insulin sensitivity. De novo protein synthesis apparently is not involved in the development of insulin resistance or the reversal of desensitization since inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide had no effect on the loss of MIR and insulin sensitivity or recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W303312795,"Abstract The Saccharomyces cerevisiae anaerobic gene (ANB1) is negatively regulated both by oxygen and heme. A 299-base pair-long fragment from the 5'-flanking region of the ANB1 gene was found to confer oxygen-mediated negative regulation to an heterologous CYC1-LacZ hybrid gene. Studies with deletions of predefined length in this fragment demonstrated the presence of separate elements that comprise an upstream promoter that is active in the absence or presence of oxygen, and an upstream repressor site (URS) which confers strong repression upon the promoter element when oxygen is present. The promoter element is located 5' to the URS in the ANB1 gene. Mixed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to obtain nucleotide substitutions in the URS which partially or completely inactivated this sequence without affecting the promoter activity. The URS region has three short direct repeats which seem to be important for function, as nucleotide substitutions within the repeats and not outside them, inactivated URS function. A model to explain the negative regulation of the ANB1 gene by oxygen and heme is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2397083695,"Abstract The substitution of alanine for lysine at position 56 of the regulatory polypeptide of aspartate transcarbamoylase affected both homotropic and heterotropic characteristics. In the absence of effectors, the ALAr56-substituted holoenzyme lost the homotropic cooperativity observed for aspartate in the wild-type holoenzyme. Under conditions of allosteric inhibition in the presence of 2mM CTP, the cooperative character of ATCase was restored, and the Hill coefficient increased from 1.0 to 1.7. In contrast to the native enzyme, the altered enzyme did not respond to ATP; however, ATP could still bind to the enzyme as demonstrated by its direct competition with CTP. Furthermore, the recently observed CTP-UTP synergism of the wild-type enzyme was not detectable. The site-directed mutant enzyme could not be activated by low levels of the bisubstrate analogue, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, and the rate of association of pHMB with the cysteine residues located at the interface of the catalytic and regulatory chains was slightly altered. These characteristics suggested that the mutant holoenzyme assumed a relaxed (or abnormal T state) conformation. Thus, this single substitution differentially affected the heterotropic responses to the various allosteric effectors of ATCase and eliminated the homotropic characteristics in response to aspartate in the absence of CTP."
https://openalex.org/W1514621042,"Insulin's rapid action to increase glucose transport is believed to occur primarily through the translocation of glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. To better understand the mechanism involved, we studied the role of protein synthesis in glucose transporter translocation by using the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Isolated rat epididymal adipose cells were incubated in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) for a total of 120 min. Insulin (7 nM) was added to half of the cells from both groups for the final 30 min. Protein synthesis was inhibited by approximately 90%, as measured by [14C]leucine incorporation, in the cells exposed to cycloheximide. The 3-O-methylglucose uptake in intact cells was slightly increased in the basal state with cycloheximide treatment, but the insulin-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose uptake was unchanged by cycloheximide. The distribution of glucose transporters in the different subcellular membrane fractions, as measured by the cytochalasin B binding assay, was unchanged by cycloheximide. These results suggest that insulin's stimulation of glucose transport and translocation of glucose transporters can occur without acute protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1603106610,"Abstract We have used an incomplete factorial design (Carter, C. W., and Carter, C. W., Jr. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12219-12223) to find conditions for growing high quality crystals of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.5). Crystals grow at pH 6.0 in hanging or sitting drops with either 1.6 M ammonium sulfate or 2.4-2.5 M sodium phosphate as precipitant. Both conditions produce crystals with identical morphologies and unit cell constants. The space group is P3(1)21 (or its enantiomorph P3(2)21), and the unit cell constants are a = b = 120.3 A, c = 78.4 A. The asymmetric unit is most reasonably one dimer of 66,000 Mr. The crystal size is very dependent on the supersaturation ratio, S = [initial protein concentration]/[equilibrium protein concentration], exhibiting a maximum at S = 7.7. The largest crystals diffract to at least 2.5 A and have a lifetime of 4 to 5 days in the x-ray beam at room temperature. The enzyme in these crystals is complexed with the transition state analog inhibitor 1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one (5-fluoropyrimidin-2-one riboside). We have collected data from parent crystals and from a heavy atom derivative in which the transition state analog is replaced by the active site directed inhibitor 5-(chloromercuri)cytidine."
https://openalex.org/W1593437937,"Mitochondrial digitonin particles from mouse liver (and also from other tissues) incorporate [3H]myristic acid into a 52-kilodalton (kDa) protein in an energy-dependent manner. The 52-kDa N-myristylated protein is located inside the mitochondrial inner membrane since it is protected against proteolytic degradation in intact mitoplasts. Disruption of mitochondrial inner membrane by sonication results in severalfold higher labeling of the 52-kDa protein, further confirming that the enzyme system for protein fatty acylation as well as the 52-kDa target protein are compartmentalized inside the mitochondrial inner membrane matrix. The results of in vitro labeling of submitochondrial fractions suggest that both the 52-kDa target protein and the enzyme system for fatty acylation are in the matrix fraction, although the N-myristylated protein is found loosely associated with the inner membrane. Finally, immunoprecipitation of cytoplasmic free polysome translation products and in vitro transport of proteins into isolated mitochondria show that the 52-kDa protein is of cytoplasmic translation origin. These results demonstrate that the intramitochondrial N-myristylation of the 52-kDa protein is not translationally linked."
