The flux of oxygen exceeds the diffusive flux by an amount, the facilitated flux, which is constant for a given hemoglobin concentration and is invariant with changing oxygen tension. The facilitated flux is inversely proportional to the length of the diffusion path. Facilitation decreases with increasing molecular size of the oxygen-binding proteins. From this it is concluded that facilitation results from random displacements of oxyhemoglobin molecules. Translational diffusion is considered to make a far larger contribution than rotatory diffusion. Facilitation is proportional to hemoglobin concentration in dilute solutions which approach ideal behavior and declines at greater protein concentration. It persists in very concentrated hemoglobin solutions (34%) in which the hemoglobin molecules are close packed. Facilitation requires no special property of hemoglobin other than reversible oxygen binding since hemerythrin which is not a heme protein facilitates oxygen diffusion. The reactions occurring during facilitated diffusion are shown to be combination and dissociation of hemoglobin and oxygen. Oxygen displacement or transfer reactions are excluded. The rates of chemical reactions may become rate-limiting. The rate-limiting step is a reaction of oxyhemoglobin. Comparison of the rates of facilitation by several hemoglobins suggests that the rate-limiting step is ligand dissociation. Facilitated carbon monoxide diffusion is minute compared to that of oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1965961644,"THE cell membranes of various tumour strains possess large quantities of sialic acid and a strong, negative surface charge1–5. This charge, which is partly due to the ionized carboxyl group of sialic acid2,4,5, may be important in influencing physiological properties such as transport of ions6. Since tumour cells seem to concentrate K+ ions better than normal cells7–9, we have begun to investigate the regulation of K+ fluxes by sialic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1966923120,"IT has previously been demonstrated, in single infections of cattle with 200–1,300 metacercariae, that an increase in the infection level does not alter the percentage of the infection which becomes patent and that a few of the flukes are inhibited in the damaged parenchyma, particularly in the ventral lobe where a preferential migration of the parasite occurs1. In subsequent investigations, parasite-free calves were given single infections of 2,500, 5,000 and 15,000 metacercariae and killed 24–56 weeks post-infection."

This wing shape resembles that of the mutant dumpy. On the other hand, administration of these drugs to the mutant dumpy strain increases wing length, and flies with normal wings are obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2033735083,"BEFORE 105–110 days gestational age (term is about 147 days) it is impossible to obtain independent survival of lambs delivered by Caesarean section, even on ventilation with 100 per cent oxygen1. This estimate of the ultimate limit of viability in sheep agrees well with the histological changes which begin in the lungs at about 90 days gestation2. The lamb is very mature at birth, so there was every reason to suppose that most lambs delivered prematurely would survive. However, 23 Clun-Hampshire lambs survived after being delivered (by Caesarean section under local or epidural anaesthesia) at 142 days gestation or more, whereas 4 of 23 that were delivered at 138–141 days gestation did not survive. The weights of these 4 lambs were 3.3–4.2 kg and they all appeared well developed. But they failed to maintain spontaneous breathing for more than a few minutes after the umbilical cord was tied, in spite of prolonged efforts at resuscitation by positive pressure ventilation with oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1991149993,"CHEMICAL mechanisms for the formation and decomposition of hydroperoxides in oxidizing lipids predict the presence of a wide range of compounds. Of these, three classes of aliphatic aldehydes (n-alkanals, n-alk-2-enals and n-alka-2,4-dienals) have long been isolated and identified and more recently the presence of non-conjugated unsaturated aldehydes (hex-cis-3-enal2 and hept-cis-4-enal3), a vinyl ketone (oct-1-en-3-one4) and its corresponding alcohol (oct-1-en-3-ol5,6) has also been demonstrated. The n-alkan-1-ols, also predicted by the mechanisms, had not hitherto been isolated and identified."
https://openalex.org/W2035524370,"ONE female and two males of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus Hodgson, Viverridae, Carnivora) were investigated. The chromosomes were examined in acetic orcein squash preparations from bone marrow and testis. The chromosome number was found to be 36 in the female and 35 in the two males (Table 1). The female has two X-chromosomes and the male one (Fig. 1). No visible Y-chromosome is present in the male."

(bitter cress or land cress)1. This taint is of considerable concern in Queensland and New Zealand where the weed is widespread during winter; unlike many other fodder or weed taints in milk, it cannot be removed during the manufacture of cream or butter1,2. The taint in milk is characteristically a burning flavour with a sharp odour, while in butter it is a burnt flavour with a burning after-taste."

https://openalex.org/W2092574708,"THE frequency of gene recombination is known to be affected by extrinsic factors or intrinsic ones such as sex. Crossing-over is completely blocked in dipteran males, including those of Drosophila melanogaster, and in silkworm females. It is a puzzling problem why sex should have such an influence on crossing-over. Lack of homology between regions of the X and Y may explain the absence of crossing-over between the sex-chromosomes of the heterogametic sex, but the absence of crossing-over in the autosomes must have a different cause."
https://openalex.org/W2055717822,"FROM July 27 to August 17, 1964, 17 salmon were found dead among about 40 fish impounded at Ceannacroc on the Moriston, a tributary of the River Ness. Eight salmon examined between August 1 and 14 showed typical symptoms of furunculosis, and pure cultures of the causative organism, Bacterium salmonicida, were isolated from the internal organs and muscle. As a serious outbreak of furunculosis had occurred in this impoundment and at another impoundment on the Ness system in 1963, an attempt was made to control the outbreak which seemed to threaten this year."

When poliomyelitis virus (a small, RNA virus) is grown in 20–30 per cent D2O its proliferation is enhanced1–3, whereas simian virus 40 (a DNA virus) does not replicate as well in deuterated medium as it does in protonated medium4. In an attempt to ascertain whether the size of a virus or its nucleic acid composition may be correlated with the D2O effect, we have examined the effects on the replication of western equine encephalitis (WEE), a relatively large, RNA-containing virus."
