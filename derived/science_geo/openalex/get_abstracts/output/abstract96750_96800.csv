https://openalex.org/W2008900071,"The nuclear envelope lamina is a supramolecular protein assembly associated with the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane, which contains three predominant polypeptide components in mammalian cells (lamins A, B and C). We previously demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy that the lamina is reversibly disassembled during cell division, coincident with the disassembly and reconstruction of the mitotic nuclear envelope architecture. In this paper, these immunocytochemical observations are extended with cell fractionation and immunoprecipitation studies performed on synchronized populations of tissue culture cells. With these techniques, we have established that during mitosis, lamina A and C occur in a soluble and nonmembrane-associated state. In contrast, the mitotic lamin B may be associated with membrane fragments derived from the disassembled interphase nuclear envelope. From sedimentation analysis on sucrose gradients, we have determined that all three lamins are monomeric at periods of mitotic lamina disassembly. These results, together with quantitative immunoprecipitation studies, demonstrate that the lamina is reversibly depolymerized during cell division. Attendant with the depolymerized state of the lamina, the mitotic lamins (which are phosphoproteins) have a distinctly more acidic isoelectric point and a substantially higher level of phosphorylation compared to their interphase counterparts. This indicates that reversible enzymatic phosphorylations of the lamins may be involved in modulating the state of polymerization of the lamina and its reversible mitotic disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W1991214910,"A control region that directs accurate initiation of 5S RNA synthesis is located within the middle third of the X. borealis somatic 5S RNA gene. The 5′ boundary of this region is described in the accompanying paper ( Sakonju et al., 1980 Sakonju S. Bogenhagen D.F. Brown D.D. A control region in the center of the 5S RNA gene directs specific initiation of transcription: I. The 5′ border of the region. Cell. 1980; 19: 13-25 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar ) as occurring between residues 50 and 55 of the 120 nucleotide 5S RNA gene. In this paper we delimit the 3′ boundary of this control region between gene residues 80 and 83. The 3′ boundary has been defined by in vitro transcription of a series of deletions of cloned 5S DNA whose endpoints approach and enter the gene from the 3′ side. Since these deletions lack the normal termination site of 5S RNA synthesis, we have developed an assay for accurate initiation of transcription in the absence of correct termination. In vitro transcription in the presence of cordycepin triphosphate (3′ dATP) causes synthesis of a reproducible array of shortened RNA molecules displayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This transcription assay shows that 3′ deletions leaving the first 83 or more 5′ gene residues support accurate initiation of transcription. Larger deletions leaving 80 or fewer gene residues do not support 5S RNA-specific transcription initiation. The gene region from nucleotides 41–87 which contains this control region has been cloned without any additional 5S DNA sequences. This internal gene fragment contains sufficient information to direct specific transcription initiation at a site in the upstream plasmid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W4238388513,"The 5S ribosomal RNA gene of Xenopus contains a region within the gene that directs the initiation of 5S RNA synthesis. This result was obtained by enzymatically deleting a fragment of X. borealis somatic 5S DNA from the 5′ side of the gene and cloning the resultant mutants. These deletion mutants were tested for their ability to support 5S RNA transcription in an oocyte nuclear extract. Mutants lacking the entire 5′ flanking region synthesized 5S RNA or slightly smaller RNAs that were initiated a few nucleotides into the gene. Mutants deleted as far as 50 nucleotides into the gene synthesized discrete RNAs of 116–121 nucleotides. These RNAs were fused transcripts that were initiated in the plasmid vector, transcribed through the remainder of the 5S RNA gene and terminated at the end of the gene. Mutants deleted 55 or more nucleotides into the gene synthesized little or no 5S size RNA. When additional nucleotides were inserted between nucleotides +40 and +41 of the gene, discrete transcripts of approximately 120 nucleotides were synthesized that had initiated within the gene. We conclude that a control region within the gene directs RNA polymerase III to initiate transcription approximately 50 nucleotides upstream from the 5′ border of this region. The 3′ border of the control region resides between gene residues +80 and +83 as determined in work described in the accompanying paper ( Bogenhagen et al., 1980 Bogenhagen D.F. Sakonju S. Brown D.D. A control region in the center of the 5S RNA gene directs specific initiation of transcription: II. The 3′ border of the region. Cell. 1980; 19: 27-35 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar ). When this control region is present, the exact site of initiation is determined by the sequence around the start site."
https://openalex.org/W1564176844,"We have found that addition of a small amount of filamentous muscle actin (F-actin) to a solution of globular actin (G-actin) in a low ionic strength medium resulted in rapid polymerization of the G-actin. This reaction was inhibited by substoichiometric levels of cytochalasins (relative potency: cytochalasin D greater than cytochalasin E approximately equal to cytochalasin B greater than dihydrocytochalasin B). Binding experiments show that F-actin, but not G-actin, contains high affinity binding sites for [3H]cytochalasin B; the number of sites detected was on the order of about one per actin filament (one site/500 actin monomers). This number remained unchanged when the actin (prepared by polymerization-depolymerization cycles) was further purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Competitive displacement experiments showed that the relative affinity of several cytochalasins for these sites corresponds to their relative effectiveness in inhibiting actin polymerization induced by F-actin. These results suggest that actin filaments can accelerate the rate of polymerization of G-actin in low ionic strength medium by providing sites onto which actin monomers can be added, and that cytochalasins inhibit actin filament elongation by binding to high affinity sites located at the polymerization end of the filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1579521718,"Brief, low ionic strength extraction of chicken gizzard at 37 degrees C yields a solution containing a limited number of proteins including alpha-actinin, filamin, actin, desmin, and a 130,000-dalton polypeptide. The proteins are then fractionated by Mg2+- and (NH4)2SO4-induced precipitations and by ion exchange and gel filtration column chromatography to give rise to highly purified preparations of alpha-actinin, filamin, and a 130,000-dalton protein. The alpha-actinin and filamin isolated by this scheme are native based upon their S20,w values and their ability to bind to F-actin. These procedures, with minor modification, can be used for the purification of alpha-actinin from skeletal muscle and non-muscle tissues as well as for the purification of filamin from non-muscle tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2058649879,"Reovirus messenger RNA was modified by reaction with bisulfite (in denaturing conditions) or by incorporation of IMP in place of GMP, thereby irreversibly unfolding the mRNA. Messenger RNA in which the secondary structure was weakened or abolished retained the ability to bind to wheat germ ribosomes, suggesting that conformational features around the AUG codon are not required for ribosome recognition of mRNA. Ribosomes were not able to attach (directly) to spurious internal sites, even in extensively unfolded RNA, indicating that the monocistronic character of eucaryotic messages (in which initiation is limited to a single 5' proximal site) is not simply due to conformational masking of all the internal AUG codons. The secondary structure in eucaryotic messages does contribute to the fidelity of the translation process, however, because when 40S ribosomal subunits were incubated with denatured mRNA they failed to stop at the 5' proximal AUG codon. Extensive migration beyond the 5' region occurred when 40S ribosomes (in the absence of 60S subunits) attached to unfolded mRNA, implying that the secondary structure in native mRNA facilitates correct translation by impeding migration of 40S subunits beyond the 5' proximal initiation region. Secondary structure in mRNA may also modulate the efficiency of translation. Studies with BrUMP-substituted mRNA, in which the secondary structure is enhanced, suggested that the efficiency of mRNA binding to ribosomes decreases as the stability of the secondary structure increases."
https://openalex.org/W2043756613,"After cells were labeled by brief exposure to 3H-methyl-L-methionine, the majority of labeled 5' terminal cap I (m7GpppN1mpN2p) oligonucleotide structures were in nuclear RNA (hnRNA) molecules approximately 750 nucleotides or less in length. After longer label times, the proportion of cap I structures in nuclear molecules longer than mRNA rose to approximately 60% of the total, but approximately 40% of the cap I structures were still in molecules shorter than approximately 750 nucleotides. The cap I structures in both long and short hnRNA chains contained all four 2' methylated nucleotides in the N1 position in about the same proportion as in mRNA. None of the large hnRNA molecules could be demonstrated to contain 5' pppX p termini; the only such terminus in high molecular weight RNA was pppAp which was decreased markedly by low doses of actinomycin and is presumably the terminus of pre-rRNA. These results raise the possibilities that hnRNA chains can initiate with any of the four nucleotides, that capping occurs very close to or at the start of hnRNA chain synthesis and that approximately 40% of the hnRNA chains may be prematurely terminated."
https://openalex.org/W1991335785,"The interaction of Moloney leukemia virus (M-MuLV) with developing post-implantation mouse embryos was studied. First, the frequency at which embryos in utero are infected by transplacental transmission with maternal virus was explored. To exclude milk transmission from the viremic mother, embryos were delivered by cesarean section prior to birth and given to normal foster mothers. None of 72 mice raised this way developed viremia. This indicates that the placenta is an efficient barrier protecting the developing embryo against infection with exogenous retroviruses. To overcome the placental barrier and to introduce virus into embryos at defined stages of differentiation, Moloney leukemia virus was microinjected directly into embryos in utero at day 8 or 9 of gestation. Between 60 and 70% of the injected embryos survived to birth and were tested for viremia at 4 weeks of age. M-MuLVspecific sequences were quantitated in organs of viremic animals derived from midgestation embryos microinjected with virus. Molecular hybridization experiments with nucleic acids extracted from different organs of these animals indicated that every cell type carried M-MuLV-specific DNA sequences and that high concentrations of M-MuLV-specific RNA sequences were present in every organ. In contrast, M-MuLV infection and expression is restricted to lymphatic tissues when animals are exposed to virus after birth or in BALB/Mo mice. These results indicate that the most important parameter determining the “target tropism” of Moloney leukemia virus infection and expression is the stage of embryogenesis and cellular differentiation at which virus infection takes place. In viremic C57BL animals derived from microinoculated embryos, the hair color changed beginning at age 6 weeks. This was not observed in animals exposed to virus after birth. All animals succumbed to MMuLV-induced leukemia at a later age. The results suggest that expression of M-MuLV may also lead to cellular dysfunctions other than leukemic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1483519009,"The transport of neutral amino acids and their interactions for uptake have been studied in skin-derived-diploid human fibroblasts cultured at confluency. Properly timed preincubations in a medium defined in composition and requirements have been adopted to control size of internal amino acid pools and regulatory interferences affecting amino acid transport. L-Proline, L-alanine, and L-leucine were used as natural amino acid substrates. Amino acid uptake and exchange with preaccumulated molecules have been measured under conditions approaching initial entry rates in the absence and in the presence of Na+ and of transport-specific model substrates. Cultured human fibroblasts were found to contain three neutral amino acid transport systems: A, ASC, and L. L-Proline was taken up preferentially by System A. System ASC appeared to mediate the largest fraction of L-Leucine entered the cells mainly by the Na+-independent System L. Preaccumulation of the cells with Site A-reactive amino acids caused trans-inhibition of the activity of System A. The activity of System L was strongly trans-stimulated in cells preloaded with Site L-reactive amino acids. The inward transport of L-alanine was trans-inhibited by internal Site A-reactive amino acids and trans-stimulated by preaccumulated L-alanine exchanging with the external amino acid through the operation of System ASC."
https://openalex.org/W2047971651,"The nucleotide sequence from the 5' terminus inward of one third of mouse alpha- and beta maj-globin messenger RNAs has been established. In addition, using 5' 32P end-labeled mRNAs as substrates and S1 and T1 nucleases as probes for single-stranded regions, the secondary structures of mouse and rabbit alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs have been analyzed. Our results indicate that the AUG initiator codon in both mouse and rabbit beta-globin mRNA is quite susceptible to cleavage with S1 and T1 nucleases, suggesting that it resides in a single-stranded exposed region. In contrast, the initiator AUG in the alpha-globin mRNA of both species is inaccessible to cleavage, indicating that it is either buried by tertiary structure or is base-paired. Since the rate of initiation of protein synthesis with beta-globin mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte is 30--40% faster than for alpha-globin mRNA, these results imply a possible correlation between the differential rates of initiation with these two mRNAs and the accessibility of the respective AUG initiator codons."

https://openalex.org/W1547423230,"Phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3) has been identified in a soluble, delipidated protein fraction isolated from rat liver lysosomes. Lysosomal phospholipase C is active against all phospholipids tested, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. It has an acid pH optimum, does not require divalent cations, and is not inhibited by EDTA. With [1-14C]dioleoylphosphatidylcholine as the substrate, 14C-labeled monoglyceride and diglyceride are the reaction products. Monoglyceride is formed rapidly from diglyceride by a lysosomal acid lipase, although some monoglyceride may be formed directly by phospholipase C hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine. The other product, phosphocholine, has been identified by its behavior during Dowex 1-formate anion exchange chromatography. This appears to be the first demonstration in mammalian systems ofa phospholipase C which is active against all phosphoglycerides."
https://openalex.org/W2046737757,"The macronuclear rRNA genes of Tetrahymena thermophila contain a 0.4 kb intervening sequence. In this paper we present evidence that the excision of the intervening sequence from pre-rRNA occurs in vitro in isolated T. thermophila nuclei. The transcription-processing system includes α-amanitin to inhibit non-rRNA synthesis and aurintricarboxylic acid to inhibit endogenous nucleases. A discrete 0.4 kb RNA comprises up to 6% of the RNA synthesized in this system. Southern hybridization with restriction fragments of the rDNA (rRNA genes) shows that the 0.4 kb RNA contains the intervening sequence. The size of the 0.4 kb RNA, 410–425 nucleotides, is the size predicted if the entire intervening sequence were excised as a single linear molecule. The 0.4 kb RNA accumulates post-transcriptionally and appears to be stable in vitro. T. pigmentosa strain 6UM, whose rDNA has an intervening sequence of the same size and location as that of T. thermophila, also produces a 0.4 kb RNA in vitro; T. pigmentosa strain 8ALP, with no rDNA intervening sequence, produces no such RNA. The measurement of the accumulation of the excised intervening sequence is a convenient assay for the pre-rRNA splicing activity and a means for characterizing some of the details of the reaction. The resistance of the splicing activity to concentrations of aurintricarboxylic acid that inhibit other endogenous nucleases should be useful in assaying the splicing enzyme during purification."
https://openalex.org/W1496359087,"We used phase fluorometry to investigate the wavelength dependence of the fluorescence lifetimes of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA) in solvents of varying viscosity and the lifetimes of tryptophan in human serum albumin, melittin, and liver alcohol dehydrogenase. In highly fluid solvents, and in completely vitrified solvents, the lifetime of NATA was constant across its emission spectrum. In viscous solvents, such as propylene glycol at -9 degrees C, the lifetimes of NATA increased across its emission spectrum, with the values being 3.3, 5.5, and 8.1 ns at 317, 344, and 400 nm, respectively. These wavelength-dependent lifetimes appear to be a result of reorientations of solvent dipoles around the excited state dipole moment of the indole moiety. For the three proteins investigated, the fluorescence lifetimes of tryptophan increased with increasing wavelength in a manner comparable to that observed for NATA in propylene glycol. These observations indicate that these protein matrices can reorientation around their tryptophan residues on the nanosecond timescale, and illustrate the potential of phase fluorometry for quantifying the details of these dipolar relaxation processes."

https://openalex.org/W2084076455,"We have found that Fv-2 on chromosome 9 of the mouse, the locus originally identified as a major determinant of host susceptibility (Fv-2s) or resistance (Fv-2r) to Friend leukemia virus in mice, also functions in uninfected animals, where it determines whether a high (Fv-2s) or low (Fv-2r) proportion of erythropoietic progenitor cells BFU-E are normally engaged in DNA synthesis. Adult mice belonging to five inbred strains of genotype Fv-2rr, two inbred strains and three congenic strains of genotype Fv-2ss, two kinds of F1 hybrid of genotype Fv-2rs, and appropriate controls were given high specific activity 3H--thymidine intravenously for 1 hr and their bone marrow and spleen cells were assayed for surviving BFU-E at 7 days and CFU-E at 2 days in plasma culture. A high proportion of BFU-E in all Fv-2ss and Fv-2rs mice were killed, but all or nearly all of the BFU-E in Fv-2rr mice survived exposure to 3H--thymidine. The allelic difference of Fv-2 had no significant effect on the proportion of other progenitor or stem cells (CFU-E, CFU-C or CFU-S) normally undergoing DNA synthesis in the hemopoietic tissues, or on the hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, hematocrit, total of differential white blood cell counts in the peripheral blood of these animals. While a few or no BFU-E were killed by 3H--thymidine in adult B6 (Fv-2rr) mice, a high proportion of BFU-E were killed by 3H--thymidine in these animals when they were less than 7 weeks old. Bleeding of adult B6 mice or lethal irradiation followed by repopulation by syngeneic bone marrow cells rendered a high proportion of their BFU-E vulnerable to 3H--thymidine. BFU-E of adult B6 mice which in vivo were unaffected by 3H--thymidine were rapidly killed when exposed to 3H--thymidine in vitro. Fv-2 thus seems to act at or near the G1-S or G0-S boundary to influence the rate or probability of transition between the nonDNA-synthesizing and the DNA-synthesizing states of BFU-E. The gene that controls susceptibility or resistance to a murine erythroleukemia virus appears also to be a regulatory gene that controls the proliferative behaviour of normal cells at a specific stage of erythropoietic differentiation."

Transhydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide by NADPH was stimulated severalfold when valinomycin was added to collapse the developing membrane potential. A rapid and extensive quenching of the fluorescence of the pH probe, 9-aminoacridine, under these conditions indicates that transhydrogenation is coupled to the acidification of the vesicle interior. A corresponding uptake of protons from the medium is demonstrated by electrode measurements that indicate 1 or less proton is translocated for each hydride ion equivalent transferred between the substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1968961148,"We present data which map the 5' and 3' ends of transcripts of the natural ovalbumin gene. First, hybridization of radiolabeled 5' and 3' fragments of the gene to oviduct nuclear RNA which had been electrophoresed in agarose gels and transferred to DBM paper localized the 5' and 3' ends of precursor molecules and demonstrated that the largest ovalbumin RNA molecules detectable by this method (approximately 7.8 kb) were similar in size to the ovalbumin natural gene. Second, hybridization of end-labeled probes to oviduct nuclear RNA followed by digestion with S1 nuclease and analysis on polyacrylamide gels mapped more precisely the 5' and 3' ends of the precursor molecules, and these termini were coincident with the beginning and end of the structural sequence of the natural gene. These results suggest that the 7.8 kb precursor is likely to be the primary transcript of the ovalbumin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1586158966,"Chemical modification of antithrombin III, the major plasma protease inhibitor, with the tryptophan reagent dimethy(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl) sulfonium bromide, results in the incorporation of one hydroxynitrobenzyl moiety per molecule of antithrombin III. The derivatized inhibitor does not exhibit the heparin-promoted enhancement in rate of thrombin inactivation which is characteristic of the native molecule. However, the rates of thrombin inactivation in the absence of heparin are identical with native and derivatized inhibitors, indicating that the site of protease . inhibitor complex formation is not altered. Unlike native antithrombin III, the modified inhibitor does not bind to a heparin-agarose affinity column. When the modification reaction was performed with added heparin, the extent of modification was decreased and the heparin-promoted enhancement of thrombin inactivation was preserved. These results indicate that the integrity of a specific tryptophan residue is critical to the binding of heparin to antithrombin III."

The digested nuclei were fractionated by two different methods, and the distribution of histones and high mobility group proteins among the various fractions was quantitated. The results obtained indicate that the linker regions of transcriptionally active nucleosomes are depleted in H1 and enriched in HMG (high mobility group)-T and ubiquitin. The core particles in transcribed regions of the chromatin are depleted in unacetylated H4 and enriched in the highly acetylated forms of H4 and also in the small basic non-histone, H6. Our results also suggest that one-fourth of the total H6 and one-half of the total HMG-T of chromatin are present in a different domain probably comprising nontranscribed regions."
https://openalex.org/W1573475822,"Homogenates prepared from the livers of rats treated for 3 days with the uncoupling agent 2,4-dinitrophenol contained considerably higher cyanide-sensitive superoxide dismutase activity when compared with homogenates of saline-treated animals. The effect was specific for only one form of the enzyme, however. Administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol at a dosage and on a schedule which produced the classic signs of uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation; that is, hyperthermia and weight loss, resulted in &fold increase in the liver mitochondrial, manganese superoxide dismutase but engendered no change in the cyanide-sensitive, cytosolic form of the enzyme. The ADP/O ratio for mitochondria prepared from dinitrophenol-treated animals was 2.0, whereas the ratio for mitochondria of saline-treated animals was 2.8. Hydrogen peroxide generation of mitochondria isolated from dinitrophenoltreated rats was 60 times higher than from mitochondria of saline-treated animals. Work from other laboratories has led to the conclusion that most, if not all, H202 generation from mitochondria reflects the production of the precursor, 0 2 . Although the specific source of 02is unknown, it appears reasonably certain that autoxidation of some reduced component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is responsible. The enhanced oxygen radical generation with concomitant elevation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in livers of dinitrophenol-treated rats parallels the response observed in both neonatal rat pulmonary macrophages exposed to hyperoxia and microorganisms grown in the presence of chemicals which generate 0 2 by autoxidation. That the exposure of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to a variety of conditions in which oxygen radical generation is enhanced is accompanied by an enhancement of superoxide dismutase, the enzyme which catalytically removes the Oz-, implies a fundamental association between the two processes."

The level of cell-associated hyaluronidase remains approximately constant during culture while the enzyme accumulates extracellularly such that within a 48-h incubation period, levels of hyaluronidase in the medium are 2 to 4 times higher than that found associated with the cell layer. The cultures continue to produce hyaluronidase at approximately the same rate and distribution through as many as nine passages. In addition to the chick fibroblasts, a variety of mammalian cells also produce hyaluronidase in culture. Both the cell- and medium-associated forms of the chick fibroblast hyaluronidase are endoglycosidases of estimated molecular weight of 62,000, which preferentially cleave hyaluronate substrate at an acidic pH optimum. Neither the cell-associated nor secreted hyaluronidase are enzymatically active at neutral pH."
https://openalex.org/W1569552095,"The formate-dependent reduction of NADP+ by extracts of Methanococcus vannielii is catalyzed by a coupled system consisting of formate dehydrogenase, a 5-deazaflavin cofactor, and 5-deazaflavin-dependent NADP+ reductase. All three components were purified from crude extracts of M. vannielii. Recombination of these components reconstituted the formate-NADP+ oxidoreductase system. The formate dehydrogenase also can utilize FAD, FMN, and a number of artificial dyes as electron acceptors, but these do not replace the 5-deazaflavin cofactor in the coupled enzyme system. The reduced form of 5-deazaflavin binds readily to the NADP+ reductase apoprotein and is not dissociated by ammonium sulfate treatment at neutral pH under anaerobic conditions. This electron transfer cofactor from M. vannielii is identical in many of its properties to the 5-deazaflavin isolated from other methane-producing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2079977506,"We show in this paper that the monovalent ionophores have a differential effect on the intracellular transport of two glycoproteins of skeletal muscle—an integral membrane protein (the acetylcholine receptor, ACHR) and a secretory protein (the acetylcholinesterase, ACHE). Both of these glycoproteins are found in the Golgi following their synthesis. Yet in the presence of very low concentrations of the monovalent ionophores, nigericin and monensin, ACHR continues to appear and accumulate at a-bungarotoxin-accessible sites at a nearly normal rate and is degraded at a normal rate, while ACHE secretion is substantially inhibited. Under these conditions, ACHE can be visualized associated with intracellular membranous structures that are probably deformed Golgi. These ACHE-enriched membranes have a distinctly different density profile from most of the ACHR-containing membranes of the myotube. Since it has been shown that the monovalent ionophores block the flow of membranes out of the Golgi, our data suggest that there are at least two kinds of mechanisms by which glycoproteins exit from the Golgi—one which is inhibited by the monovalent ionophores and one which is unaffected. We believe our data provide strong evidence that a secretory glycoprotein and an integral membrane glycoprotein are transported through the cell by distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1479892860,"The synthesis of cytochrome P-450 (phenobarbital inducible) and cytochrome P-448 (3-methylcholanthrene inducible) have been studied in rat liver in vivo and in the wheat germ cell-free system using anti-cytochrome P-450 and anti-cytochrome P-448 antibodies. The major mature forms synthesized in vivo correspond to a molecular weight of 47,000 for cytochrome P-450 and 53,000 for cytochrome P-448. Translation of poly(A)-containing RNA from phenobarbital-treated rats in the wheat germ cell-free system reveals that the cell-free product immunoprecipitated with anti-cytochrome P-450 antibody has a molecular weight close to 47,000. In the case of 3-methylcholanthrene, the cell-free product immunoprecipitated with anti-cytochrome P-448 antibody shows a molecular weight around 59,000. Significant conversion of the 59,000 species to the 53,000 species can be demonstrated when the translation is carried out in the presence of microsomal membranes isolated from rat liver. Phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene enhance the translatable messenger RNA contents for cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome P-448, respectively."

The aldehyde dehydrogenase which catalyzes this reaction has been isolated from bovine liver. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using two affinity type columns. Blue dextran and 5'-AMP covalently linked to a Sepharose matrix were used to bind this NAD+-requiring enzyme. Two other aldehyde dehydrogenases with broader specificities were also purified to homogeneity using the same affinity columns. The three enzymes appear to be distinct as they are different with respect to subcellular locations, substrate specificity, behavior on the affinity columns, disulfiram inhibition, and esterase activity. The enzyme with preference for trimethylaminobutyraldehyde as substrate probably functions in carnitine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2052843457,"To understand the mechanism of estrogen-induced activation of the vitellogenin genes in the liver of Xenopus, it is essential to characterize the transcriptional products of these genes. In this paper we describe large nuclear RNAs containing vitellogenin mRNA sequences as revealed by hybridization of cloned vitellogenin cDNAs to nuclear RNA separated on agarose gels. Putative vitellogenin mRNA precursors, which are recovered as poly(A)-containing RNA, have been identified for the four known vitellogenin mRNAs. From electron microscopic analysis of R loops, prepared between enriched mRNA precursors and cDNA specific for the A1 vitellogenin mRNA, we conclude that the precursor molecules contain sequences complementary to vitellogenin mRNA which are interrupted by additional RNA segments probably representing transcribed introns. Within the 3.7 kb of the 3' end of the A1 vitellogenin mRNA we have discovered seven large and at least five small transcribed introns. Some of the R loops have been found to contain only a few transcribed introns, and we assume that they represent processing intermediates. Comparison of these putative intermediates suggests that the splicing order of different introns does not follow a single pathway."

The antiserum precipitates a single Mr = 60,000 polypeptide (TdT-60) from all cell lines and tissues that contain enzymologically demonstrable terminal transferase. This polypeptide is not precipitated from labeled extracts of cells that lack terminal transferase by enzymological criteria. TdT-60 fractionates with terminal transferase during phosphocellulose chromatography and sediments with it in a sucrose gradient. TdT-60 is not detectably processed to lower molecular weight polypeptides, and terminal transferase activity sediments as a Mr = 60,000 activity; thus, we believe it to be the active form of terminal transferase. Using this assay we have demonstrated that terminal transferase is synthesized in both the murine thymus and the bone marrow at a rate proportional to its biochemically measured steady state level. After cortisone treatment of mice, the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide disappears from the thymus and then reappears as the thymus begins to be repopulated."
https://openalex.org/W1584891004,"Antifreeze glycoproteins and glycopeptides that function noncolligatively contribute one-third of the freezing temperature depression in the blood serum of some polar fishes and enable them to survive at low temperature (-1.9 degree C). There are at least eight closely related glycoproteins and glycopeptides ranging in molecular weight from 32,000 to 2,600 and numbered 1 to 8 in order of decreasing size. Under conditions of negligible supercooling, the glycopeptides have weaker antifreeze activity than the glycoproteins (20% on a weight basis, or 5% on a molar basis); in mixtures of both, their activities are additive. When nucleation is initiated in supercooled solutions (-4 to -5 degrees C), the glycopeptides are inactive, while the glycoproteins still show activity; when mixtures of both are nucleated in supercooled solutions, cooperative potentiation occurs, and the full activities of the glycopeptides are found. On nucleation of supercooled solutions of the glycoprotein alone or of the mixtures, the temperature rises above the freezing temperature (overshoots) to an extent dependent upon the extent of supercooling; the temperature of the sample then decreases to form a plateau at the true freezing temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1594115484,"Partially purified thromboxane synthase from human platelets converted prostaglandin G2 to two products. These were transformed to 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and thromboxane B2 by stannous chloride reduction and to 12-keto-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and 15-ketothromboxane B2 by lead tetraacetate dehydration. Trapping with methanol after short incubations of substrate with enzyme and reduction by stannous chloride yielded 11-O-methylthromboxane B2. Based on these results, the enzymatically formed products were identified as 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and 15-hydroperoxythromboxane A2."

https://openalex.org/W1536622584,"O-Alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate is formed enzymatically from acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate and a long chain fatty alcohol. This reaction is accompanied by stereospecific exchange of the pro-R hydrogen of carbon 1 (carbon 1 of all compounds corresponds to carbon 1 of sn-glycerol) of the dihydroxyacetone phosphate moiety with retention of configuration. In the present investigation, data are provided to show that the initial loss of hydrogen from carbon 1 of acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate does not depend on the presence of the fatty alcohol. In addition, the occurrence of a Schiff base between enzyme and acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate, comparable to the fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase reaction, could not be demonstrated. It is concluded that the formation of 1-O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate via the formation of intermediate 1-O-acyl endiol and 1-O-alkyl endiol is a likely mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1492949998,"In cultured skin fibroblasts from normal and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemic subjects, a water-soluble polyoxyethylated derivative of cholesterol suppresses the incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into cholesterol and decreases the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. The effect of this compound on low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated activities (binding, internalization, and degradation of LDL) and on cholesterol ester formation was compared to that of LDL and 25-hydroxycholesterol. In normal fibroblasts preincubated in lipoprotein-deficient serum, LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor activity and increased cholesterol ester formation. In contrast, polyoxyethylated cholesterol stimulated LDL receptor activity, inhibited cholesterol ester formation mediated by LDL and 25-hydroxycholesterol, and inhibited the activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase in cell extracts. Polyoxyethylated cholesterol had no effect on the low level of LDL receptor activity of homozygous hypercholesterolemic fibroblasts but stimulated the half-normal activity of heterozygous cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557071247,"Prolactin mRNA has been isolated using immunochemical techniques. Initial experiments demonstrated that 125I-labeled prolactin antibody was able to bind to pituitary polysomes but not to liver polysomes, suggesting that the binding is specific. Prolactin-synthesizing polysomes were immunoprecipitated by reaction with antiprolactin followed by anti-antibody. Immunoprecipitated polysomal RNA was chromatographed on oligo(dT)-cellulose, and the poly(A) RNA was sedimented through a sucrose gradient. This procedure resulted in a 320-fold purification of prolactin mRNA as determined by translation in a mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate assay. Translation analysis also suggested that the isolated prolactin mRNA is greater than 95% pure. The molecular weight of prolactin mRNA determined by electrophoresis on agarose gels containing 10 mM mercury hydroxide was 350,000. Purified prolactin mRNA was used to synthesize full-length cDNA by means of avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase. Use of this cDNA as a hybridization probe demonstrated that estrogen is able to increase the concentration of prolactin mRNA sequences in the pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W2035673955,"We have studied platelet adhesion to phospholipid model membranes in vitro. Our results showed that films made of egg lecithin, dioleoyllecithin or phosphatidylethanolamine from two different sources (egg yolk and E. coli) are unadhesive for platelets. Platelets adhered to films made of distearoyllecithin, dipalmitoyllecithin and N--stearoylsphingomyelin. According to electron spin resonance measurements, the former lipids were present during incubation with platelet-rich plasma above the phase transition temperature, whereas the latter were present below this temperature. Cross-linking of phosphatidylethanolamine films with glutaraldehyde or egg lecithin, as well as dioleoyllecithin with OsO4, abolishes the phase transition of the lipids in these films, transforming them to the solid state. After such treatment the films become adhesive for platelets. Thus fluid liquid crystalline phospholipid membranes are unadhesive for platelets; solid crystalline (gel) films are adhesive for these cells. We suggest that the fluidity of the plasma membrane has an essential role in making the endothelium unadhesive for platelets in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1547610493,"We have purified the two lectins from lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus) and studied the binding of Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions to each. The 120,000-dalton tetrameric lima bean lectin (LBL4) and the 240,000-dalton octamer (LBL8) were purified by chromatography on Ultrogel and sulfopropyl Sephadex. Using equilibrium dialysis, we have found that demetallized LBL4 (apo-lbl4) will bind either 2 Mn2+ or 4 Ca2+ ions. The Ca2+ binding is strongly cooperative while the Mn2+ binding is not. If apo-LBL4 is presaturated with Mn2+ (Mn2+-LBL4), it will bind only 2 Ca2+ ions in a noncooperative manner. Apo-LBL4 presaturated with Ca2+ (Ca2+-LBL4) does not bind Mn2+. The metal stoichiometry for LBL8 is double that for LBL4 under all of the above conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1494742491,"Abstract Somatomedin C was purified from a Cohn IV fraction of human plasma by acid release followed by dialysis, ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-50 chromatography, and isoelectric focusing between pH 7 to 11. The resulting preparation, which focused at pH 8.6, was essentially free of insulin contamination and appeared homogeneous by acid gel chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The somatomedin C was purified about one-half-million-fold with a yield of 7%. The purified preparation had an apparent molecular weight of 7,400 with no indication of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Its amino acid composition revealed a lysine-rich peptide containing significant amounts of histidine and methionine. No free sulfhydryl was found. It stimulated in vitro cartilage sulfation and DNA synthesis of hypophysectomized rats. In the presence of hypopituitary serum, it increased cartilage sulfation of embryonic chick. Somatomedin C competed potentially with [125I]iodoinsulin for insulin receptors on human placenta cell membranes. [125I]Iodosomatomedin C apparently binds preferentialy to a high affinity placental receptor which is different from the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1590126041,"A toxin, alpha-mambatoxin, was purified from the venom of the green mamba Dendroaspis viridis using the procedures of Shipolini et al. (Shipolini, R. A., Bailey, G. S., Edwardson, J. A., and Banks, E. C. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 40, 337-344). The purified toxin blocks agonist-induced activation of acetylcholine receptors on muscle cells but, like alpha-bungarotoxin, it does not affect agonist-induced activation of receptors on a clonal sympathetic nerve cell line (PC12), an endothelial cell line, cultured chick ciliary ganglion neurons, or frog cardiac ganglion neurons. The toxin does block binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to cultures of muscle and nerve, and iodinated alpha-mambatoxin binds to cultures of muscle and nerve. The alpha-mambatoxin binding component on muscle was identified as acetylcholine receptor on the basis of sedimentation, immunoprecipitation, and rate of degradation. The alpha-mambatoxin binding component on PC12 cells, like the alpha-bungarotoxin binding component on these cells, is not recognized by anti-acetylcholine receptor antisera which do recognize acetylcholine receptor on these cells. The number of alpha-mambatoxin binding sites on both nerve and muscle when assayed in situ is twice that of alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites. However, when muscle cells are solubilized in nonionic detergents and then labeled with toxins, the number of alpha-mambatoxin binding sites is reduced and the two toxins bind in equal molar amounts. Finally, unlike alpha-bungarotoxin, which dissociates from complexes formed with nerve, alpha-mambatoxin forms complexes with nerve which dissociate only very slowly if at all."
https://openalex.org/W1498002492,"An hydroxyindole oxidase has been purified 100-fold from the gill plates of Mytilus edulis. This preparation yields a single band on acrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Metal analysis and spectral data show that both heme iron and copper are present in the purified enzyme in a 1:1 molar ratio. Potassium cyanide, sodium azide, various copper chelators, and carbon monoxide inhibit the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. These inhibition studies, as well as the photoreversibility of the CO inhibition, lend support to the conclusion that metal ions function as necessary cofactors for substrate oxidation. The Mytilus gill enzyme oxidizes a variety of substrates, among them biogenic amines. For all substrates tested, 1 dioxygen molecule is consumed/mol of substrate oxidized. When p-coumaric acid is hydroxylated, caffeic acid is formed in quantitative yield. H2O2 has been identified as a second product of the oxidation reaction. The addition of catalase prior to the onset of reaction is inhibitory while H2O2 or ascorbate activate the enzyme. These findings suggest that the hydroxyindole oxidase may be a monooxygenase which does not require reduced pyridine nucleotide for reductive activation."

https://openalex.org/W1591670267,"Abstract Holloman ((1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2993-3000) reported the isolation from Ustilago maydis of a glycoprotein which prevented the precipitation of nucleic acids in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Two glycoprotein fractions from U. maydis with this nucleic acid-solubilizing activity were isolated in our laboratory using improved purification procedures. The activity was not due to nuclease contamination. The glycoproteins are distinguished by: their ability to bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose; their differential binding to double- and single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, and to ribonucleic acid; their molecular weights (46,000 and 69,000); and the relative amounts present in growing versus nongrowing cells. Both fractions required sulfhydryl-reducing conditions for optimal yields, specific activity, and stability. Nucleic acid binding was cooperative, the minimum number of glycoproteins required to make a native T7 DNA molecule soluble in dilute acid being estimated at 2 and 15, respectively."
