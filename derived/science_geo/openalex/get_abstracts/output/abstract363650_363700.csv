By modulating oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways they could, in principle, contribute to tumorigenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, recurrent genetic and epigenetic alterations of individual miRNAs are found in some tumors. Functional studies are now elucidating the mechanism of action of putative oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs. Sixteen years ago in back-to-back papers in Cell, Ambros, Ruvkun, and their colleagues reported that a small RNA encoded by the lin-4 locus controls the developmental timing of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by modulating the expression of the protein-coding gene lin-14 (Lee et al., 1993Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V. Cell. 1993; 75: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar, Wightman et al., 1993Wightman B. Ha I. Ruvkun G. Cell. 1993; 75: 855-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar). At the time, few would have imagined that this discovery marked the birth of a new and far-reaching field of research. Indeed, it took several more years to appreciate that small RNAs like lin-4 (now termed microRNAs or miRNAs) were not just an interesting peculiarity of the nematode but were an abundant (and pervasive) feature of all Bilateria, including Homo sapiens (reviewed in Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29453) Google Scholar). More recently, biochemical and genetic studies have begun to reveal the physiological functions of individual miRNAs. We now know that miRNAs act by modulating the expression of target genes through sequence complementarity between the so-called “seed” sequence of the miRNA and the “seed-match” present in the target messenger RNA (mRNA). Such binding inhibits the translation and reduces the stability of the mRNA, leading to decreased expression of the target protein. MicroRNAs control a wide array of biological processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. As the deregulation of these very same processes is a hallmark of cancer, there has been speculation that mutations affecting miRNAs or their functional interactions with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes might also contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we summarize recent findings that now strongly support an important role for these tiny RNAs in controlling cell transformation and tumor progression. Because miRNAs act by repressing gene expression through direct base-pairing interactions with their target mRNAs, there are several possible mechanisms through which miRNAs could affect tumorigenesis. Overexpression, amplification, or loss of epigenetic silencing of a gene encoding an miRNA that targets one or more tumor suppressor genes could inhibit the activity of an anti-oncogenic pathway. By contrast, the physical deletion or epigenetic silencing of an miRNA that normally represses expression of one or more oncogenes might lead to increased protein expression and a gain of oncogenic potency. More subtle mutations affecting the sequence of the mature miRNA could reduce or eliminate binding to key targets or even drastically change its specificity, thereby altering the balance of critical growth regulatory proteins. Seed-match sequences of target mRNAs could also be the sites of mutation, rendering them free from the repression of a given miRNA or subject to the effects of another (Table 1).Table 1MicroRNAs and CancerMutation/Epigenetic ChangePredicted Functional ConsequenceExamplesDeletion of miRNADerepression of oncogenemiR-15a-16-1Epigenetic silencing of miRNA locusDerepression of oncogenemiR-29, miR-203Point mutation affecting an miRNA or an miRNA precursorReduced affinity for oncogeneN.E.Increased affinity for tumor suppressor geneN.E.Reduced processing efficiencymiR-15a∼16-1∗Increased processing efficiencyN.E.Genomic amplification or translocation of miRNA locusIncreased repression of tumor suppressor genemiR-17∼92, miR-21Loss of epigenetic silencing of miRNA locusIncreased repression of target tumor suppressor geneN.E.Point mutation in oncogeneDecreased or lost affinity for miRNAN.E.Point mutation in tumor suppressor geneGain or increased affinity for miRNAN.E.Rearrangement of 3′UTR (translocation, deletion)Loss of miRNA-mediated repressionHMGA-2Gain of miRNA-mediated repressionN.E.Shown are potentially oncogenic genetic and epigenetic changes involving miRNAs or their targets.

Although only some of these potential mechanisms have been documented in human cancers, over the past 6 years a veritable flood of reports have linked miRNAs to tumor development in one fashion or another. These range from the identification of genomic and gene expression alterations affecting miRNA genes in human cancers to studies in genetically engineered mouse models of the disease. Taken together, the available data provide a compelling case that alterations in miRNA-mRNA regulation can promote tumor development. As is true for protein-coding genes associated with cancer, the most convincing evidence linking miRNAs to tumorigenesis comes from genetic alterations in cancer cells. Beginning with the work of Carlo Croce and colleagues in 2002, who showed that a pair of neighboring miRNAs are frequently deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there are now additional examples in which miRNA genes are either lost or amplified in tumors (reviewed in Calin and Croce, 2006Calin G.A. Croce C.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6202-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, miRNA expression profiling studies comparing cancer tissue to normal tissue have revealed provocative patterns of miRNA expression (such as the recurrent overexpression or downregulation of individual miRNAs), some of which have been linked to changes in the methylation status of miRNA genes (reviewed in Saito and Jones, 2006Saito Y. Jones P.A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2220-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Functional studies performed in cancer cell lines or mouse models of the disease have provided further support for a direct role of a subset of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis. Similar to the miRNA field as a whole, the discovery of the physiologically relevant targets of these cancer-associated miRNAs is still lagging, but here too, there has been recent progress with interesting candidate targets emerging. MicroRNAs that are amplified or overexpressed in cancer could act as oncogenes, and a number of putative oncogenic miRNAs have been proposed (for a recent review see Medina and Slack, 2008Medina P.P. Slack F.J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). An interesting case is represented by miR-155, which is upregulated in several hematopoietic malignancies and tumors of the breast, lung, and pancreas (reviewed in Kluiver et al., 2006Kluiver J. Kroesen B.J. Poppema S. van den Berg A. Leukemia. 2006; 20: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the primary transcript for miR-155 had been identified well before the discovery of miRNAs, as a common proviral DNA insertion site in lymphomas induced by the avian leukosis virus. The absence of an obvious open reading frame remained a puzzling feature of the BIC oncogene (as it was initially named) even after it was shown that it could cooperate with Myc in inducing hematopoietic tumors. Although the observation that the BIC RNA can form extensive secondary structures (including a 145 base pair stem loop that we now know is the precursor to miR-155) suggested that the RNA itself could be the oncogenic factor (Tam et al., 1997Tam W. Ben-Yehuda D. Hayward W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1490-1502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its mechanism of action remained unclear until the identification of miR-155. The study of genetically engineered mice with gain- and loss-of-function alleles of miR-155 has provided valuable insights into its physiological and oncogenic properties. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in the bone marrow of mice has been reported to induce either polyclonal pre-B cell proliferation followed by full-blown B cell leukemia (Costinean et al., 2006Costinean S. Zanesi N. Pekarsky Y. Tili E. Volinia S. Heerema N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) or myeloproliferation (O'Connell et al., 2008O'Connell R.M. Rao D.S. Chaudhuri A.A. Boldin M.P. Taganov K.D. Nicoll J. Paquette R.L. Baltimore D. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), depending on the system used to drive expression of the transgene. Although miR-155 is dispensable for normal B and T cell development, miR-155-deficient mice have defective B and T cells (Rodriguez et al., 2007Rodriguez A. Vigorito E. Clare S. Warren M.V. Couttet P. Soond D.R. van Dongen S. Grocock R.J. Das P.P. Miska E.A. et al.Science. 2007; 316: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, Thai et al., 2007Thai T.H. Calado D.P. Casola S.

In particular, these mice display a reduced germinal center B cell reaction and defective IgG production in response to immunization with either T cell-dependent or -independent antigens (IgM production is normal). These results suggest an important role for miR-155 in the generation of isotype-switched, high-affinity antibodies. Among the several targets of miR-155 that may mediate its function is the gene encoding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which allows immunoglobulin diversification by promoting somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination in B cells. Two groups have recently demonstrated that mutation of the single miR-155 binding site in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of the AID gene partially phenocopies deletion of miR-155 itself (Dorsett et al., 2008Dorsett Y. McBride K.M. Jankovic M. Gazumyan A. Thai T.H. Robbiani D.F. Di Virgilio M. San-Martin B.R. Heidkamp G.

Papavasiliou F.N. Immunity. 2008; 28: 621-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In both cases, the result is increased levels of AID in germinal center B cells and impaired affinity maturation in response to antigen stimulation, but the phenotypic overlap is only partial. Although class-switch recombination is reduced in mice lacking miR-155 (Thai et al., 2007Thai T.H. Calado D.P. Casola S. Ansel K.M. Xiao C. Xue Y. Murphy A. Frendewey D. Valenzuela D. Kutok J.L. et al.Science. 2007; 316: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, Vigorito et al., 2007Vigorito E. Perks K.L. Abreu-Goodger C. Bunting S. Xiang Z. Kohlhaas S. Das P.P. Miska E.A. Rodriguez A. Bradley A. et al.Immunity. 2007; 27: 847-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), it is increased in mice carrying mutant AID (Dorsett et al., 2008Dorsett Y. McBride K.M. Jankovic M. Gazumyan A. Thai T.H. Robbiani D.F. Di Virgilio M. San-Martin B.R. Heidkamp G. Schwickert T.A. et al.Immunity. 2008; 28: 630-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, Teng et al., 2008Teng G. Hakimpour P. Landgraf P. Rice A. Tuschl T. Casellas R. Papavasiliou F.N. Immunity. 2008; 28: 621-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, although these experiments elegantly demonstrate how loss of miRNA-mediated regulation of a single target gene can have profound physiological effects, they also serve as a reminder that the phenotypic consequences of loss of an miRNA are likely due to the simultaneous deregulation of many target genes. Another notable member of the family of oncogenic miRNAs is the miR-17∼92 cluster (reviewed in Mendell, 2008Mendell J.T. Cell. 2008; 133: 217-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). This cluster, which consists of six miRNAs that are processed from a single primary transcript, was initially linked to cancer based on the observation that it maps to a chromosomal region that is frequently amplified in a subset of human B cell lymphomas (Ota et al., 2004Ota A. Tagawa H. Karnan S. Tsuzuki S. Karpas A. Kira S. Yoshida Y. Seto M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3087-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and overexpressed in a variety of other human cancers. In an important in vivo test of the oncogenic potential of miR-17∼92, He et al., 2005He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar demonstrated that a truncated version of the cluster (lacking the most distal miRNA, miR-92) could cooperate with c-Myc and greatly accelerate tumorigenesis in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma. Although miR-17∼92 deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice overexpressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitor cells develop a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al., 2008Xiao C.C. Srinivasan L. Calado D.P. Patterson H.C. Zhang B.C. Wang J. Henderson J.M. Kutok J.L. Rajewsky K. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice carrying a homozygous deletion of the miR-17∼92 locus exhibit premature death of B cells at the pro-B/pre-B stage resulting in lymphopenia (Ventura et al., 2008Ventura A. Young A.G. Winslow M.M. Lintault L. Meissner A. Erkeland S.J. Newman J. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Stone J.R. et al.Cell. 2008; 132: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Although the full spectrum of genes regulated by the miR-17∼92 cluster is still unknown, one candidate, the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, could be a likely mediator of the B cell phenotype in miR-17∼92 null mice and in miR-17∼92 transgenic mice (Ventura et al., 2008Ventura A. Young A.G. Winslow M.M. Lintault L. Meissner A. Erkeland S.J. Newman J. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Stone J.R. et al.Cell. 2008; 132: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, Xiao et al., 2008Xiao C.C. Srinivasan L. Calado D.P. Patterson H.C. Zhang B.C. Wang J. Henderson J.M. Kutok J.L. Rajewsky K. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Bim is a critical regulator of B cell survival and a potent tumor suppressor gene in the Eμ-Myc model of B cell lymphoma (Egle et al., 2004Egle A. Harris A.W. Bouillet P. Cory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Its 3′UTR contains multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17∼92. Consistent with Bim being a direct target of miR-17∼92, its expression is increased in miR-17∼92 null pre-B cells and reduced in B cells from mice overexpressing miR-17∼92. It is therefore likely that Bim suppression by miR-17∼92 contributes to both the tumor-promoting activity of miR-17∼92 overexpression and its physiological function in regulating normal B cell development. The analysis of mice lacking miR-17∼92 is also shedding light on additional functions of this cluster (Ventura et al., 2008Ventura A. Young A.G. Winslow M.M. Lintault L. Meissner A. Erkeland S.J. Newman J. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Stone J.R. et al.Cell. 2008; 132: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Mice lacking miR-17∼92 are much smaller than their wild-type littermates, have severely hypoplastic lungs, have an incompletely closed interventricular septum, and die within a few minutes after birth. The lung hypoplasia is of particular interest, as miR-17∼92 overexpression, and occasionally amplification of the locus, has been reported in human lung cancers (Hayashita et al., 2005Hayashita Y. Osada H. Tatematsu Y. Yamada H. Yanagisawa K. Tomida S. Yatabe Y. Kawahara K. Sekido Y. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9628-9632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the lung hypoplasia is currently unclear, but reduced cell proliferation may play a role. Consistent with this hypothesis, forced expression of miR-17∼92 under the control of a lung-specific promoter leads to increased proliferation and blocks differentiation of the lung epithelium in vivo (Lu et al., 2007Lu Y. Thomson J.M. Wong H.Y. Hammond S.M. Hogan B.L. Dev. Biol. 2007; 310: 442-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Several miRNAs have been implicated as tumor suppressors based on their physical deletion or reduced expression in human cancer. Beyond these associations, functional studies of a subset of these miRNAs indicate that their overexpression can limit cancer cell growth or induce apoptosis in cell culture or upon transplantation in suitable host animals. This increasingly long list includes at least a dozen miRNAs and miRNA clusters (Medina and Slack, 2008Medina P.P. Slack F.J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but we will discuss only a few representative examples here. The miR-15a∼16-1 cluster of miRNAs has recently emerged as an excellent candidate for the long sought-after tumor suppressor gene on 13q14. This chromosomal region is deleted in the majority of CLLs and in a subset of mantle cell lymphomas and prostate cancers (Calin et al., 2002Calin G.A. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Bichi R. Zupo S. Noch E. Aldler H. Rattan S. Keating M. Rai K. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15524-15529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4216) Google Scholar). There is strong circumstantial evidence that miR-15a∼miR-16-1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor. miR-15a∼16-1 is located in the minimally deleted region in CLL (Calin et al., 2002Calin G.A. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Bichi R. Zupo S. Noch E. Aldler H. Rattan S. Keating M. Rai K. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15524-15529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4216) Google Scholar), and a germline point mutation (a single base change) immediately downstream of the pre-miR-16-1 sequence has been observed in a few CLL patients (Calin et al., 2005Calin G.A. Ferracin M. Cimmino A. Di Leva G. Shimizu M. Wojcik S.E. Iorio M.V. Visone R. Sever N.I. Fabbri M. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). This mutation has been linked to reduced expression of miR-16-1, possibly due to less efficient processing of the precursor RNA, but large-scale studies are needed to determine whether this is indeed a cancer-predisposing mutation. Interestingly, in New Zealand Black mice, a strain that shows a strong predisposition to developing a B cell lymphoproliferative disease reminiscent of human CLL, a similar base change in pre-miR-16-1 is associated with the development of this lymphoproliferative disease (Raveche et al., 2007Raveche E.S. Salerno E. Scaglione B.J. Manohar V. Abbasi F. Lin Y.C. Fredrickson T. Landgraf P. Ramachandra S. Huppi K. et al.Blood. 2007; 109: 5079-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor activity of miR-15a∼16-1 is not limited to B cells. More than 50% of human prostate cancers carry a deletion of 13q14. Accordingly, a recent study has shown that inhibition of miR-15a and miR-16 activity leads to hyperplasia of the prostate in mice and promotes survival, proliferation, and invasion of primary prostate cells in vitro (Bonci et al., 2008Bonci D. Coppola V. Musumeci M. Addario A. Giuffrida R. Memeo L. D'Urso L. Pagliuca A. Biffoni M. Labbaye C. et al.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In the same study, the therapeutic potential of reconstituting expression of this cluster was illustrated by the significant regression of prostate tumor xenografts upon intra-tumoral delivery of miR-15a and miR-16-1. Although the identity of the critical targets of these two miRNAs is still unknown, the list of oncogenes that are directly regulated by miR-15a and miR-16-1 include BCL2, cyclin D1, and WNT3A. Among the most actively studied of the putative tumor suppressor miRNAs are the members of the let-7 family (reviewed in Roush and Slack, 2008Roush S. Slack F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 505-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The human genome contains a dozen let-7 family members, organized in eight different loci (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000002). The first member of the let-7 family was discovered in C. elegans, where it induces cell-cycle exit and terminal differentiation of a particular cell type at the transition from larval to adult life. Consistent with a role in inhibiting tumor development in humans, reduced expression of multiple members of the let-7 family is frequently observed in lung cancers, where they correlate with poor prognosis (Yanaihara et al., 2006Yanaihara N. Caplen N. Bowman E. Seike M. Kumamoto K. Yi M. Stephens R.M. Okamoto A. Yokota J. Tanaka T. et al.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). In addition, various let-7 genes are located at chromosomal sites deleted in a variety of human cancers. Let-7 genes can also be directly repressed by the c-Myc oncoprotein (Chang et al., 2008Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) and their precursor RNAs subjected to inhibition of further processing by lin-28 (Newman et al., 2008Newman M.A. Thomson J.M. Hammond S.M. RNA. 2008; 14: 1539-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Viswanathan et al., 2008Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Functionally, let-7 represses members of the Ras family of oncogenes (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar) as well as the oncogene HMGA2 (Lee and Dutta, 2007Lee Y.S. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, Mayr et al., 2007Mayr C. Hemann M.T. Bartel D.P. Science. 2007; 315: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) and even c-Myc itself (Sampson et al., 2007Sampson V.B. Rong N.H. Han J. Yang Q. Aris V. Soteropoulos P. Petrelli N.J. Dunn S.P. Krueger L.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9762-9770Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In the best example of an oncogenic mutation affecting an miRNA-binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2 oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing overexpression of the oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007Lee Y.S. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, Mayr et al., 2007Mayr C. Hemann M.T. Bartel D.P. Science. 2007; 315: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of let-7 miRNAs can suppress tumor development in mouse models of breast and lung cancer (Kumar et al., 2008Kumar M.S. Erkeland S.J. Pester R.E. Chen C.Y. Ebert M.S. Sharp P.A. Jacks T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3903-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2007Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F. Lieberman J. et al.Cell. 2007; 131: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Mouse knockout studies have not been reported for any let-7 family members, and, given the potential for functional overlap within this family, it may be some time before it is clear whether loss of let-7 in the mouse can promote tumorigenesis. Recent studies have explored the regulation of miRNAs by tumor suppressor genes. These studies have focused on the miRNAs regulated by p53, a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in human cancers (reviewed in He et al., 2007He L. He X. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar and references therein). This approach has lead to the identification of the miR-34 family as an important mediator of p53 activity. This family consists of three highly related miRNAs expressed from two separate loci: miR-34a from chromosome 1p36 and the miR-34b/miR-34c cluster from chromosome 11q23. The transcription of both loci appears to be directly regulated by p53 through binding to conserved sites in the respective promoters. Similar to p53 itself, the expression of miR-34 can induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. Reduced expression of miR-34b/miR-34c has been reported in breast and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, miR-34a is located on 1p36, a region of frequent hemizygous deletion in human neuroblastomas and a variety of other cancers. Interestingly, this region includes another candidate tumor suppressor gene, CDH5, that acts by inducing p53 expression via p19Arf. Thus, a deletion of 1p36 can impair the p53 pathway simultaneously upstream and downstream of p53. In addition to their role in promoting the development of primary tumors, miRNAs have also been implicated in affecting tumor progression, including the lethal metastatic phase of the disease. Several cell biological processes, including those controlling adhesion, migration, and invasion, are involved in allowing primary tumor cells to leave their original locations and to move to another site in the body. Not surprisingly, miRNAs help to regulate these processes, and alterations in miRNA function can influence metastatic potential (reviewed in Ma and Weinberg, 2008Ma L. Weinberg R.A. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 448-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and referenced therein). Among several putative prometastatic miRNAs, miR-10b and miR-373 are of particular interest. The miR-10b miRNA is a direct transcriptional target of Twist1, a known inducer of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic progression. Ectopic expression of miR-10b in nonmetastatic breast cancer cell lines promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10. The miR-373 miRNA was identified in a functional screen for miRNAs that could promote cell migration in vitro (Huang et al., 2008Huang Q. Gumireddy K. Schrier M. le Sage C. Nagel R. Nair S. Egan D.A. Li A. Huang G. Klein-Szanto A.J. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), and its prometastatic potential has been validated in tumor transplantation experiments using breast cancer cells. Of note, miR-373 has been identified as a potential oncogene (together with miR-372) in testicular germ cell tumors (Voorhoeve et al., 2006Voorhoeve P.M. le Sage C. Schrier M. Gillis A.J. Stoop H. Nagel R. Liu Y.P. van Duijse J. Drost J. Griekspoor A. et al.Cell. 2006; 124: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). However, it has been proposed that the prometastatic and oncogenic properties of this miRNA are due to the regulation of different genes (encoding CD44 and LATS2, respectively). Studies of breast cancers have also revealed a series of miRNAs that are both underexpressed in advanced cancers and capable of inhibiting cell migration and metastatic spread. Members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs target the ZEB transcription factors, known inducers of the EMT, and thus reduce cellular migration and invasiveness (Gregory et al., 2008Gregory P.A. Bert A.G. Paterson E.L. Barry S.C. Tsykin A. Farshid G. Vadas M.A. Khew-Goodall Y. Goodall G.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (3155) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2008Park S.M. Gaur A.B. Lengyel E. Peter M.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Based on their differential expression in nonmetastatic versus metastatic breast cancer cell lines, miR-126, miR-206, and miR-335 were also proposed to be inhibitors of tumor progression (Tavazoie et al., 2008Tavazoie S.F. Alarcon C. Oskarsson T. Padua D. Wang Q. Bos P.D. Gerald W.L. Massague J. Nature. 2008; 451: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of these miRNAs can inhibit metastasis in a cell transplantation model, and reduced expression of miR-126 and miR-335 correlates with poor metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients (Tavazoie et al., 2008Tavazoie S.F. Alarcon C. Oskarsson T. Padua D. Wang Q. Bos P.D. Gerald W.L. Massague J. Nature. 2008; 451: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). We have focused on the role of specific miRNAs in tumorigenesis, an already extensive and rapidly expanding list. However, recent work has also revealed intriguing changes in the global state of miRNA expression in cancer. Specifically, miRNA expression profiling experiments have demonstrated that most (although not all) miRNAs are underexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E.A. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (8201) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that this phenomenon reflects the less differentiated states of the tumor cells or their higher proliferation rates, one alternative explanation is that reduced miRNA levels are selected during tumorigenesis because this itself provides some proliferative or survival advantage. These two possibilities are not necessarily mutually exclusive and indeed there is experimental evidence for both. For example, a significant increase in miRNA levels is observed upon induction of differentiation of the cancer cell line HL60 (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E.A. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (8201) Google Scholar), consistent with the ability of miRNAs to reinforce transcriptional programs and to help maintain the differentiated state. On the other hand, work with experimental models of lung cancer has shown that genetic or RNAi-based inhibition of miRNA biogenesis can promote tumor formation and progression (Kumar et al., 2007Kumar M.S. Lu J. Mercer K.L. Golub T.R. Jacks T. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Finally, widespread transcriptional silencing of miRNAs by c-Myc (Chang et al., 2008Chang T.C. Yu D. Lee Y.S. Wentzel E.A. Arking D.E. West K.M. Dang C.V. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Mendell J.T. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) has been reported, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed global downregulation of miRNAs in transformed cells. Independent of the functional consequences of miRNA expression patterns in cancer, miRNA profiles have value as diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease. For example, it is sometimes impossible to determine the tissue of origin of a metastatic tumor in patients with unknown primary tumors. Because many miRNAs display exquisite tissue specificity, miRNA profiling of these lesions might prove useful. The initial findings are encouraging, as it appears that miRNA-based classification is more efficient at identifying the tissue of origin of poorly differentiated cancers than is mRNA profiling (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E.A. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (8201) Google Scholar, Rosenfeld et al., 2008Rosenfeld N. Aharonov R. Meiri E. Rosenwald S. Spector Y. Zepeniuk M. Benjamin H. Shabes N. Tabak S. Levy A. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). MicroRNA profiling of human cancer might guide the choice of the best treatment strategy by providing prognostic information. Indeed, in the two most common forms of non-small cell lung cancers (adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas), high expression of miR-155 and low expression of let-7 correlate with poor prognosis (Yanaihara et al., 2006Yanaihara N. Caplen N. Bowman E. Seike M. Kumamoto K. Yi M. Stephens R.M. Okamoto A. Yokota J. Tanaka T. et al.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Similarly, in colon cancers, elevated expression of miR-21 is associated with poor survival (Schetter et al., 2008Schetter A.J. Leung S.Y. Sohn J.J. Zanetti K.A. Bowman E.D. Yanaihara N. Yuen S.T. Chan T.L. Kwong D.L. Au G.K. et al.JAMA. 2008; 299: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar), whereas in chronic lymphocytic leukemias an miRNA “signature” composed of 13 miRNAs is associated with disease progression (Calin et al., 2005Calin G.A. Ferracin M. Cimmino A. Di Leva G. Shimizu M. Wojcik S.E. Iorio M.V. Visone R. Sever N.I. Fabbri M. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). The results of these and other related reports are promising, but larger-scale studies will be required to validate the usefulness of miRNA profiling in a clinical setting. Despite remarkable recent progress, the field of miRNAs and cancer is still in its infancy and many important questions remain to be addressed. Much of the evidence for the existence of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs would be best characterized as “guilt by association.” With the exception of miR-155, which, as discussed above, can induce the formation of B cell leukemia when ectopically expressed in mice, to date none of the putative oncogenic miRNAs have been shown to be sufficient to initiate neoplastic transformation on their own. Likewise, whereas many miRNAs may act as tumor suppressors based on their recurrent deletion or silencing in human cancers or on their growth suppressive properties in cell-based experiments, none has been subjected to germline loss-of-function analysis in mouse models. This absence of evidence should not be construed as evidence of absence, as it likely reflects the youth of the field as well as the complexity of gene targeting experiments involving multiple, functionally related genes. Similarly, although the identification and validation of miRNA targets proceeds at an increasing pace, we still know very little about the cellular circuits controlled by miRNAs in general and by cancer-associated miRNAs in particular. One should resist the temptation to expect that one or a few target mRNAs can fully explain the biological properties of a particular miRNA or, even less so, of an miRNA cluster. More likely, their effects will be found to be the net result of the complex modulation of multiple targets belonging to multiple pathways. A clearer picture of the role of miRNAs in human cancer will likely emerge as the efforts to resequence the cancer genome reveal the true frequency of mutations in miRNAs and in their target sequences in protein-coding genes (although the latter will require specific analysis of the 3′UTR regions). At the same time, more sophisticated in vivo models will likely help determine the oncogenic and tumor suppressor potential of individual miRNAs and miRNA families. Also, improved experimental and computational methods to identify miRNA targets will provide a more comprehensive understanding of their mechanism of action and of the pathways that they modulate. It is difficult to overestimate the potential impact of these findings. As increasingly effective pharmacological means to modulate miRNA activities are currently being developed (Elmen et al., 2008Elmen J. Lindow M. Schutz S. Lawrence M. Petri A. Obad S. Lindholm M. Hedtjarn M. Hansen H.F. Berger U. et al.Nature. 2008; 452: 896-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar), identifying miRNAs that are essential for tumor maintenance or for metastasis might provide exciting new therapeutic opportunities. What began 16 years ago as a peculiar discovery in the simple worm has already had a major impact on our understanding of gene regulation. Although not yet a hallmark of cancer, alterations in miRNA function and regulation have rapidly emerged as important players in cancer pathogenesis. Before long, they might influence how the disease is treated as well."

However, the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ is not activated until the cells synchronously reenter S phase during the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) phase of differentiation. In this period, C/EBPβ is sequentially phosphorylated by MAPK and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, inducing C/EBPβ DNA binding activity and transcription of its target genes. Because the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ is further enhanced by oxidation in vitro, we investigated how redox state affects C/EBPβ DNA binding and MCE during adipogenesis. When 3T3-L1 cells were treated with H2O2 and hormonal stimuli, differentiation was accelerated with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Interestingly, cell cycle progression (S to G2/M phase) was markedly enhanced by H2O2, whereas antioxidants caused an S phase arrest during the MCE. H2O2 treatment resulted in the early appearance of a punctate pattern observed by immunofluorescent staining of C/EBPβ, which is a hallmark for C/EBPβ binding to regulatory elements, whereas a short antioxidant treatment rapidly dispersed the centromeric localization of C/EBPβ.

Adipocyte differentiation involves an elaborate network of transcription factors that regulate the expression of numerous genes responsible for the phenotype of mature adipocytes (1MacDougald O.A.

Most of our knowledge about transcriptional regulation in adipocytes comes from studies using the murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model. The differentiation of growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes is induced by hormonal stimuli, which immediately causes the expression of C/EBPβ (5Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2231-2241Google Scholar, 6Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 850-855Google Scholar-7Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 5367-5370Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is thought to initiate mitotic clonal expansion of the preadipocytes and to later coordinate the transcription network by turning on two principal adipogenic factors, C/EBPα and PPARγ (1MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1995; 64: 345-373Google Scholar, 8Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 2593-2597Google Scholar). Although the expression of C/EBPβ reaches its maximal level within 4 h of induction, the binding of C/EBPβ to DNA and the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ are only observed after a long lag period (4Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 266: 677-683Google Scholar, 5Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2231-2241Google Scholar). During this period, cells synchronously enter the cell cycle (6Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 850-855Google Scholar, 9Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 44-49Google Scholar), which is accompanied by the nuclear localization of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (10Tang Q.Q. Gronborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 9766-9771Google Scholar). A recent investigation has revealed that phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by nuclear GSK3β enhances its DNA binding activity (10Tang Q.Q. Gronborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 9766-9771Google Scholar). Thr188 of C/EBPβ is phosphorylated by MAPK immediately after its expression is induced and then later by GSK3β on Ser184 or Thr179. The priming phosphorylation of C/EBPβ-Thr188 is maintained throughout S phase and mitotic clonal expansion through the activity of Cdk2-cyclin A after MAPK activity is down-regulated (11Li X. Kim J.W. Gronborg M. Urlaub H. Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 11597-11602Google Scholar). Because the translocation of GSK3β into the nucleus is observed 12–14 h after induction, it has been suggested that the dual phosphorylation of C/EBPβ is associated with the activation of its DNA binding function. This finding has been confirmed in our experiment using highly purified recombinant C/EBPβ (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar). In that study, when recombinant C/EBPβ protein was exposed to mild oxidizing conditions, only doubly phosphorylated C/EBPβ had enhanced DNA binding activity. This suggests that the dual phosphorylation of C/EBPβ leads to a conformational change that facilitates dimerization through its C-terminal leucine zipper domain, rendering the basic DNA-binding region of C/EBPβ accessible to the C/EBP regulatory element on C/EBPα or PPARγ. In this scenario, under oxidizing conditions the monomer-dimer equilibrium of dual phosphorylated C/EBPβ would be shifted toward dimer formation and the binding of the regulatory element to confer the proper level of transcriptional activation (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms by which redox state actively regulates cellular metabolism are not clear, several reports have proposed that oxidative stress is an important element in metabolic diseases. For example, in obesity, fat accumulation is correlated with systemic oxidative stress in humans and mice (13Furukawa S. Fujita T. Shimabukuro M. Iwaki M. Yamada Y. Nakajima Y. Nakayama O. Makishima M. Matsuda M. Shimomura I. J. Clin. Invest... 2004; 114: 1752-1761Google Scholar). Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases selectively in the adipose tissue of obese mice, accompanied by increased expression of NADPH oxidase and decreased expression of antioxidative enzymes. In addition, increased ROS levels are reported to be an important trigger for insulin resistance (14Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Nature.. 2006; 440: 944-948Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has been shown that oxidative stress impairs glucose uptake in mature adipocytes (15Rudich A. Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Hemi R. Kanety H. Bashan N. Diabetes.. 1998; 47: 1562-1569Google Scholar) and decreases insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (16Matsuoka T. Kajimoto Y. Watada H. Kaneto H. Kishimoto M. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. J. Clin. Invest... 1997; 99: 144-150Google Scholar). ROS generation during adipogenesis has also been observed, and it has been proposed that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I are active stimulators of NADPH-dependent hydrogen peroxide generation (17Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J... 1995; 307: 549-556Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms by which ROS affect adipocyte differentiation have not been elucidated. In this study, we showed how redox state affects mitotic clonal expansion during adipocyte differentiation. H2O2 treatment in conjunction with hormonal stimulation of 3T3-L1 cells caused accelerated cell cycle progression (S to G2/M phase) and the early appearance of punctate patterns observed from the immunofluorescent staining of C/EBPβ. On the other hand, short antioxidant treatment (4 h) rapidly dispersed the centromeric localization of C/EBPβ and arrested the mitotic clonal expansion phase, indicating that ROS production is crucial for the mitotic clonal expansion of preadipocytes. Our findings indicate that, in addition to the dual phosphorylation of C/EBPβ, redox-induced DNA-binding of C/EBPβ is required for the mitotic clonal expansion and terminal differentiation of adipocytes. Cell Culture and Induction of Differentiation—3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. To induce differentiation, 2-day postconfluent 3T3-L1 cells (designated day 0) were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. For 3T3-F442A cells, differentiation was induced by 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin for 2 days. Cells were then fed DMEM containing 10% FBS and insulin for another 2 days, after which they were fed DMEM containing 10% FBS. In some experiments, H2O2 (50 or 100 μm), N-acetyl cysteine (10 mm), genistein (50 μm), or resveratrol (50 μm) was added at the time of differentiation induction and maintained for 2 days unless otherwise stated. Cell numbers were determined on day 2, and oil red O staining (18Zhang J.W. Tang Q.Q. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 43-47Google Scholar) was performed on day 8. Western Blotting—At each time indicated, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then scraped into lysis buffer containing 1% SDS and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Lysates were boiled for 10 min and verified by centrifugation, and then equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to C/EBPβ (5Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2231-2241Google Scholar), PPARγ, cyclin A, or SIRT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated with DMEM containing 10% calf serum at a density of 6 × 105 cells/dish in 60-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, medium was changed to OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen), and the cells (about 70% confluent) were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAi/MAX reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The next day, medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% calf serum for 24 h before the induction of differentiation. The modified synthetic CEBPβ siRNA (stealth siRNA) and SIRT1 siRNA were from Invitrogen. The sequences are as follows: siCEBPβ,5′-AGUAG AAGUU GGCCA CUUCC AUGGG-3′; siSIRT1, 5′-GAUGA AGUUG ACCUC CUCAT T-3′. FACS Analysis—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate, as described above. At the times indicated, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed with 90% cold methanol. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated in the dark for 30 min with propidium iodide staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A in PBS. Labeled cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence was measured at 650 nm for propidium iodide, and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience). Immunohistochemistry—3T3-L1 cells were differentiated on coverslips in 6-well plates at the same density as usual, as described above. At the times indicated, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice, and then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Cells were then incubated in blocking solution containing C/EBPβ antibody (5Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2231-2241Google Scholar) (1:250 dilution) for 1 h, followed by secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate) for 1 h. The cells were mounted in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analysis was performed following the protocol of the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against C/EBPβ for 4 h and then collected with protein A-agarose for 3 h. The beads were washed, and chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads. After reversal of the cross-linking, DNA was purified, and input control or ChIP samples were used as a template in PCR using the following primers to amplify the PPARγ2 promoter containing the C/EBP binding site: sense, 5′-TGCTA TCCAA ATTCT ATAAA-3′, antisense 5′-ATTTA AATTT TACTA GCCTT-3′. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Oxidation of Recombinant C/EBPβ, EMSA, and Nonreducing SDS-PAGE—Recombinant C/EBPβ protein was prepared and phosphorylated by MAPK and GSK3β, as described (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar). For phosphorylation, 500 ng of recombinant protein was incubated with activated MAPK (Calbiochem) and GSK3β (Upstate Biotechnology) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT at 30 °C for 30 min. After phosphorylation, C/EBPβ was treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for 30 min, followed by 20 mm iodoacetamide. Samples (40 ng of protein) were run in 10% NuPAGE (Invitrogen) without reducing agent, transferred, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-C/EBPβ antibody. EMSA was performed, essentially as described (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar). In oxidation-induced binding experiments, DTT was omitted unless indicated. The C/EBP-binding sequence in the C/EBPα promoter is 5′-GGCGT TGCGC CACGA TCTCT CT-3′. Measurement of ROS—ROS were detected with the peroxide-sensitive fluorophore 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Invitrogen). At the times indicated, DCF-DA dissolved in DMSO was added to cells at 10 μm (final concentration). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C under an atmosphere including 5% CO2, 3T3-L1 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. Cells were analyzed by the FAC-SCalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). A 488-nm argon laser beam was used for excitation. The arithmetic mean fluorescence channel was derived by CellQuest software. ROS Accelerates the Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—Postconfluent, growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate by hormonal stimulation. To investigate whether ROS affects adipocyte differentiation, H2O2 was added for the first 2 days (day 0 to day 2) of the standard differentiation protocol. As shown in Fig. 1A, 2-day H2O2 treatment caused enhanced differentiation, as detected by oil red O staining, which is correlated with PPARγ expression. The H2O2 effect was more pronounced when a partial hormonal stimulus (by removing insulin from the standard regimen) was used. The 3T3-L1 cell differentiation was diminished to ∼50% of control levels in the absence of insulin, whereas the addition of H2O2 markedly enhanced the differentiation (Fig. 1B) even in the absence of insulin. The effect of H2O2 treatment was strongly reproducible, dose-dependent, and observed only in differentiating preadipocytes, whereas preconfluent proliferating cells did not survive the relatively high concentration (100 μm) of H2O2 (not shown). When differentiating preadipocytes were exposed to antioxidants, such as genistein or resveratrol, PPARγ expression was nearly abolished, and cells did not differentiate, as shown by oil red O staining (Fig. 1A). Treatment with the general antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) had the same effect on oil red O staining (Fig. 1C). In an attempt to identify the mechanism by which H2O2 affects 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, we first investigated the expression of C/EBPβ, a key regulator of C/EBPα and PPARγ expression. Although PPARγ expression and lipid accumulation were affected by H2O2 or antioxidant treatment, the expression of C/EBPβ was essentially unchanged (Fig. 1D). It had been previously shown that mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from C/EBPβ(-/-) mice undergo neither clonal amplification nor terminal differentiation, indicating that C/EBPβ is required for mitotic clonal expansion (6Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 850-855Google Scholar). Consistently, RNA interference of C/EBPβ expression prevented the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1E). Importantly, H2O2 treatment did not result in any significant differentiation when the expression of C/EBPβ was reduced by siRNA (Fig. 1E), confirming that C/EBPβ is absolutely required for adipogenesis and also suggesting that the ROS-dependent effect requires the presence of C/EBPβ protein. We also attempted to confirm these findings with the other preadipocyte precursor cell line, 3T3-F442A. This cell line is reported to undergo clonal expansion accompanied by DNA synthesis and increased cell numbers (19Amri E.Z. Dani C. Doglio A. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1986; 137: 903-910Google Scholar, 20Castro-Munozledo F. Beltran-Langarica A. Kuri-Harcuch W. Exp. Cell Res... 2003; 284: 163-172Google Scholar), which means that the differentiation of 3T3-F442A would be also affected by ROS. A similar result was observed with 3T3-F442A (Fig. 1F), indicating that the ROS effect is not confined to 3T3-L1 cells. These findings indicate that ROS may accelerate the differentiation process by enhancing the activation of C/EBPβ. ROS Facilitates Cell Cycle Progression into G2/M Phase during Mitotic Clonal Expansion—Next, we examined how cell cycle events during mitotic clonal expansion are affected by ROS production. Upon hormonal stimulation, growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells synchronously reenter the cell cycle, resulting in the detection of dividing cells (G2/M) by FACS analysis after ∼24 h of induction (Fig. 2A). After exiting M phase, these cells either undergo a second round of division or begin the terminal differentiation process; therefore, induced cells are no longer synchronous beyond 24 h of hormone stimulation (1MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1995; 64: 345-373Google Scholar). Interestingly, H2O2 treatment caused an increase in the G2/M population during adipocyte differentiation, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In contrast, genistein or resveratrol treatment significantly delayed the progression of the cell cycle, suggesting that ROS production is required for clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Importantly, preadipocytes treated with antioxidants were still in S phase after 24 h (Fig. 2B), indicating that ROS production is specifically required for progression of these cells from S to G2/M. Consistently, short term antioxidant treatment after 16 h of induction (after cells have already entered S phase) completely blocked the progression of cells into G2/M phase by 24 h (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that ROS production is critical for the S to G2/M transition during the mitotic clonal expansion of the adipocyte differentiation process. Arresting or delaying cell cycle progression resulted in decreased cell numbers at 2 days of induction compared with control group (Fig. 3A). The cell cycle delay was also confirmed by assaying the expression of cyclin A, as shown in Fig. 3B. We also determined that expression of MAPK-p, MAPK, GSK3β, p27, p21, cyclin E, and Cdk2 were not significantly changed by these treatments (data not shown). It should be noted that although it resulted in accelerated cell cycle progression, H2O2 treatment did not lead to an increase in cell number after clonal amplification, suggesting that there may be spatial constraints regulating the termination of clonal expansion. Nevertheless, our observations during the first 24-h period of mitotic clonal expansion, during which cells are highly synchronous, indicate that ROS production is important for the progression of mitotic clonal expansion during adipocyte differentiation.FIGURE 3Effects of ROS on cell number and expression of cyclin A during MCE. A, on day 2 of differentiation, cells were trypsinized and subjected to cell counting. Cells were treated with H2O2 (100 μm), resveratrol (50 μm), or genistein (50 μm) for 48 or 32 h, as indicated. B, cell lysates were prepared at the times indicated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (IB) to measure the expression of cyclin A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ROS Production Is Associated with the Activation of C/EBPβ—Previous investigations have shown that C/EBPβ is required first for initiating mitotic clonal expansion and later for activating the expression of pleiotropic transcription factor, C/EBPα, and PPARγ (6Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 850-855Google Scholar). Despite the early appearance of C/EBPβ protein after the induction of differentiation, it does not bind to target sites on DNA until cells enter S phase. As C/EBPβ acquires its DNA binding activity, it becomes localized to centromeres, resulting in a characteristic ""punctate"" pattern in immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 4A) (5Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2231-2241Google Scholar). This pattern is observed from 12 to 16 h postinduction (i.e. S phase) when C/EBPβ is subjected to a second phosphorylation event by nuclear GSK3β (10Tang Q.Q. Gronborg M. Huang H. Kim J.W. Otto T.C. Pandey A. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 9766-9771Google Scholar). Since we have previously reported that the binding activity of C/EBPβ is further enhanced in an oxidative environment, in vitro (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar), we assumed that C/EBPβ binding to centromeres would be altered by changes in ROS production during adipogenesis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the immunofluorescent staining pattern of C/EBPβ remained diffuse at the 16 h time point when differentiating cells were treated with resveratrol. The same effect was observed when the general antioxidant NAC was used (Fig. 4B). More importantly, the addition of resveratrol or NAC after 14 h, at which time C/EBPβ is already localized to centromeres, rapidly converted the normal punctate pattern to a diffuse nuclear staining pattern (Fig. 4, A and B). This indicates that in the presence of appropriate oxidative stress, the equilibrium of C/EBPβ binding is shifted toward tight DNA binding, giving rise to a punctate pattern. In other words, when oxidative stress is removed with antioxidants, C/EBPβ does not readily bind to DNA despite having been activated by dual phosphorylation. To verify the ROS effect directly, we performed immunofluorescent stainings of C/EBPβ after the addition of H2O2 in 2-h time intervals between 10 and 16 h postinduction. In the standard differentiation protocol, cells began to have punctate patterns of C/EBPβ between 14 and 16 h postinduction, whereas H2O2 treatment caused the early appearance of the punctate pattern at around 12 h (Fig. 4C). This strongly suggests that in the presence of proper ROS production, after dual phosphorylation, C/EBPβ protein binds to DNA well enough to allow its centromeric localization. C/EBPβ is responsible both for mitotic clonal expansion and the activation of the promoters of specific genes, such as C/EBPα and PPARγ. To assay C/EBPβ binding to specific promoters, we next performed the ChIP assays in the absence or presence of H2O2 treatment. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, H2O2 treatment caused increased binding of C/EBPβ to the PPARγ2 promoter (1.5- and 2.9-fold at day 1 and 2, respectively), whereas resveratrol treatment decreased C/EBPβ binding, demonstrating that C/EBPβ binding to its target sites is enhanced by ROS production. The enhanced DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ in response to H2O2 treatment was also assessed in vitro in EMSAs using recombinant C/EBPβ protein. We had previously produced highly purified recombinant C/EBPβ protein using the GST fusion method and ion exchange chromatography and had confirmed the dual phosphorylation of the recombinant C/EBPβ protein by MAPK and GSK3β (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar). As had previously been shown using oxidized glutathione (12Kim J.W. Tang Q.Q. Li X. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 1800-1804Google Scholar), H2O2 treatment caused the dimerization of dually phosphorylated recombinant C/EBPβ protein, as detected by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. H2O2 treatment also resulted in increased C/EBPβ DNA binding activity in the EMSAs (Fig. 5B). These results provide evidence that C/EBPβ binding to its regulatory element is enhanced by ROS, which might occur during normal differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, in vivo. ROS Production Is Increased during Mitotic Clonal Expansion—Because oxidative stress has been highlighted in many pathologic conditions, there have been several attempts to measure ROS production in mature adipocytes (13Furukawa S. Fujita T. Shimabukuro M. Iwaki M. Yamada Y. Nakajima Y. Nakayama O. Makishima M. Matsuda M. Shimomura I. J. Clin. Invest... 2004; 114: 1752-1761Google Scholar, 17Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J... 1995; 307: 549-556Google Scholar). However, ROS production has not specifically been measured during the mitotic clonal expansion of differentiating adipocytes. The results shown above suggest that ROS are required for the proper differentiation of preadipocytes and predict that ROS production should be a normal part of the differentiation program. Since the FACS data showed that the ROS effect was particularly important between 12 and 24 h after induction (Fig. 2), we measured intracellular ROS levels with DCF-DA using the FACSCalibur flow cytometry system during this time window. As shown in Fig. 6A, ROS production was significantly elevated during mitotic clonal expansion in adipogenesis. Also, intracellular ROS was suppressed by the addition of antioxidants, such as genistein, resveratrol (Fig. 6A), or NAC (data not shown). It is noteworthy that ROS production peaks during the 12–16 h period, then decreases. We also observed that ROS production increases in almost a linear fashion between 0 and 12 h (data not shown), suggesting that ROS production is a direct response to hormonal stimulation and reaches a threshold, after which C/EBPβ binds to DNA effectively. We next examined which component of the standard hormonal regimen for differentiation is responsible for elevating ROS levels. As shown in Fig. 6B, although it appears that all of the components (IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin) are required for full elevation of ROS in adipocytes, insulin may be particularly important. Affect of Resveratrol on Mitotic Clonal Expansion Is Independent of the SIRT Pathway—The results illustrated in Fig. 2C show that resveratrol blocked cell cycle progression of induced preadipocytes at the S to G2/M transition. Apart from its antioxidant activity, resveratrol has been implicated as a SIRT1 activator in regulating glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and the longevity of organisms (21Lagouge M. Argmann C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Meziane H. Lerin C. Daussin F. Messadeq N. Milne J. Lambert P. Elliott P. Geny B. Laakso M. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Cell.. 2006; 127: 1109-1122Google Scholar, 22Baur J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2040095760,"Integrin activation, the rapid conversion of integrin adhesion receptors from low to high affinity, occurs in response to intracellular signals that act on the short cytoplasmic tails of integrin β subunits. Talin binding to integrin β tails provides one key activation signal, but additional factors are likely to cooperate with talin to regulate integrin activation. The integrin β tail-binding proteins kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 were recently identified as integrin co-activators. Here we report an analysis of kindlin-1 and kindlin-2 interactions with β1 and β3 integrin tails and describe the effect of kindlin expression on integrin activation. We demonstrate a direct interaction of kindlin-1 and -2 with recombinant integrin β tails in pulldown binding assays. Our mutational analysis shows that the second conserved N<i>XX</i>Y motif (Tyr<sup>795</sup>), a preceding threonine-containing region (Thr<sup>788</sup> and Thr<sup>789</sup>) of the integrin β1A tail, and a conserved tryptophan in the F3 subdomain of the kindlin FERM domain (kindlin-1 Trp<sup>612</sup> and kindlin-2 Trp<sup>615</sup>) are required for direct kindlin-integrin interactions. Similar interactions were observed for integrin β3 tails. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting we further show that transient expression of kindlin-1 or -2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibits the activation of endogenous α5β1 or stably expressed αIIbβ3 integrins. This inhibition is not dependent on direct kindlin-integrin interactions because mutant kindlins exhibiting impaired integrin binding activity effectively inhibit integrin activation. Consistent with previous reports, we find that when co-expressed with the talin head, kindlin-1 or -2 can activate αIIbβ3. This effect is dependent on an intact integrin-binding site in kindlin. Notably however, even when co-expressed with activating levels of talin head, neither kindlin-1 or -2 can cooperate with talin to activate β1 integrins; instead they strongly inhibit talin-mediated activation. We suggest that kindlins are adaptor proteins that regulate integrin activation, that kindlin expression levels determine their effects, and that kindlins may exert integrin-specific effects."

Epigenetic regulation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 has previously been described in cell and animal models, and despite emerging evidence for a critical role of epigenetics in placentation generally, little is known about the regulation of enzymes modulating vitamin D homeostasis at the fetomaternal interface. In this study, we investigated the methylation status of genes regulating vitamin D bioavailability and activity in the placenta. No methylation of the VDR (vitamin D receptor) and CYP27B1 genes was found in any placental tissues. In contrast, the CYP24A1 gene is methylated in human placenta, purified cytotrophoblasts, and primary and cultured chorionic villus sampling tissue. No methylation was detected in any somatic human tissue tested. Methylation was also evident in marmoset and mouse placental tissue. All three genes were hypermethylated in choriocarcinoma cell lines, highlighting the role of vitamin D deregulation in this cancer. Gene expression analysis confirmed a reduced capacity for CYP24A1 induction with promoter methylation in primary cells and in vitro reporter analysis demonstrated that promoter methylation directly down-regulates basal promoter activity and abolishes vitamin D-mediated feedback activation.

In eutherian mammals, proper fetal growth and development are dependent on the formation and function of the placenta. In combination with the maternal decidua, cells of the placenta (primarily trophoblasts) regulate the exchange of nutrients, growth factors, oxygen, and waste between maternal and fetal circulations. The placenta also protects the developing pregnancy from the maternal immune system (1von Rango U. Immunol. Lett. 2008; 115: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Although mammalian placentas share a basic common function in modulating exchange at the fetomaternal interface, it is clear that the human placenta is unique in structure and function (2Carter A.M. Placenta. 2007; 28: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Animal models may therefore be of limited value in fully dissecting processes underlying certain aspects of human pathologies, such as pre-eclampsia and gestational trophoblastic disease (3Soundararajan R. Rao A.J. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2004; 2: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). An examination of human placentation is therefore critical in understanding its unique function and potential role in disease.The biologically active form of vitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D) 4The abbreviations used are: 1,25-(OH)2D, biologically active form of vitamin D; 25-(OH)2D, immediate precursor of 1,25-(OH)2D; CVS, chorionic villus sampling; CCA, choriocarcinoma; En, embryonic day n.4The abbreviations used are: 1,25-(OH)2D, biologically active form of vitamin D; 25-(OH)2D, immediate precursor of 1,25-(OH)2D; CVS, chorionic villus sampling; CCA, choriocarcinoma; En, embryonic day n. is a potent secosteroid hormone.

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to several adverse pregnancy outcomes, including those associated with placental insufficiency (including pre-eclampsia) (10Bodnar L.M. Catov J.M. Simhan H.N.

Kronenberg H.M. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 832-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and it is clear that a large proportion of maternal circulating 1,25-(OH)2D is derived from decidua and placental cells (13Delvin E.E. Arabian A. Glorieux F.H. Mamer O.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1985; 60: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). There is inconsistent evidence regarding transplacental transfer of 1,25-(OH)2D from mother to fetus (14Delvin E.E. Glorieux F.H. Salle B.L. David L. Varenne J.P. Arch. Dis.

Nutr. 2000; 71: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), but it is clear that the immediate precursor, 25-(OH)2D, crosses from maternal to fetal circulations (16Ron M. Levitz M. Chuba J. Dancis J. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1984; 148: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At birth, fetal and maternal levels of 25-(OH)2D are comparable, and indirect measures suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D may also be correlated (17Tsang R.C. Greer F. Steichen J.J. Clin. Perinatol. 1981; 8: 287-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Several components of the vitamin D pathway are strongly expressed in human uterine decidua and placental tissues from early pregnancy (18Barrera D.

VDR (vitamin D receptor)-bound 1,25-(OH)2D regulates key target genes associated with implantation and trophoblast functioning (including specific cytokines and homeobox genes (18Barrera D. Avila E.

Avila E. Hernandez G. Mendez I. Gonzalez L. Halhali A. Larrea F. Morales A. Diaz L. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2008; 6: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A supportive role of vitamin D in placental function is also evident by its influence on human placental lactogen, estradiol, and progesterone gene transcription (21Barrera D. Avila E. Hernandez G. Halhali A. Biruete B. Larrea F. Diaz L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Stephanou A. Ross R. Handwerger S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2651-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, vitamin D, in the form of 1,25-(OH)2D can function as an intracrine regulator of antibacterial responses in human trophoblasts that may lead to a novel mode of activation of innate immune responses in the placenta (23Liu N. Kaplan A.T. Low J. Nguyen L. Liu G.Y. Equils O. Hewison M. Biol. Reprod. 2009; 80: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Given its potent immunosuppressive effects, 1,25-(OH)2D may also play a role in implantation tolerance (19Evans K.N. Bulmer J.N. Kilby M.D. Hewison M. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2004; 11: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The vitamin D metabolic pathway involves multiple enzymatic reactions, each of which is a potential target for epigenetic regulation. The CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase) gene product, 1α-hydroxylase, is directly responsible for the production of 1,25-(OH)2D from 25-(OH)2D. Largely expressed in the kidney, it is also expressed in decidual cells and the placenta (24Evans K.N. Nguyen L. Chan J. Innes B.A. Bulmer J.N. Kilby M.D. Hewison M. Biol. Reprod. 2006; 75: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In contrast, 1,25-(OH)2D-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase), encoded by the CYP24A1 (vitamin D 24-hydroxylase) gene, plays a pivotal role in the attenuation of vitamin D responsiveness by catalyzing synthesis of less active metabolites from both 1,25-(OH)2D and 25-(OH)2D (25Kumar R. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 478-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Lohnes D. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14394-14401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Makin G.

The CYP24A1 gene is up-regulated in several cancer cell types, where it attenuates vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition (29Albertson D.G. Ylstra B. Segraves R. Collins C. Dairkee S.H. Kowbel D. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). However, other cancers appear to show decreased activity of this gene (4Anderson M.G. Nakane M. Ruan X. Kroeger P.E. Wu-Wong J.R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2006; 57: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a lack of expression of CYP24A1 has been directly associated with DNA methylation of the upstream promoter and first exon regions in tumor-derived endothelial cells in mice and rat osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells (30Chung I.

General disruption of DNA methylation using drug treatment has been shown to disrupt placental development and also inhibit invasiveness in trophoblast cell models (32Rahnama F. Shafiei F.

This is likely to play a role in many aspects of placental functioning.Very little is known about the epigenetic regulation of enzymes modulating vitamin D homeostasis at the fetomaternal interface. Given the likely importance of 1,25-(OH)2Din proper placental development and functioning, fetal development, and the modulation of maternal immune response to the developing fetus, we investigated epigenetic regulation of vitamin D metabolism in human placental tissue in general and in specific cell subtypes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Isolation—Tissues were collected for research purposes with approval from the Human Research Ethics Committees at the Royal Women's Hospital (03/51), Mercy Hospital for Women (R07/15), and Monash Medical Centre (07084C). For human placental tissue sampling, a core of full-thickness tissue was isolated from two randomly chosen sites. Tissue sections from other species were washed briefly in saline before processing by maceration with a scalpel blade prior to immediate DNA isolation. CVS samples were collected and processed as previously described (37Wong N.C. Novakovic B. Weinrich B. Dewi C. Andronikos R. Sibson M. Macrae F. Morley R. Pertile M.D. Craig J.M. Saffery R.

Cells were fixed in ethanol, rehydrated, and treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Cells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with nonimmune block for 30 min. Primary antibody was applied and incubated at 48 °C for 16 h followed by biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 30 min and then streptavidinbiotin-peroxidase complex ABC (DakoCytomation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peroxidase activity was visualized by application of diaminobenzidine substrate (DakoCytomation) for 3–5 min. Cells were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma), air-dried, and mounted. Only cell preparations in which 95% of the cells were positive for cytokeratin-7 were used for subsequent experiments.For CVS samples (8–10 weeks of gestation), contaminating maternal blood and decidua were removed, and ∼5–10 mg of cleaned villi was separated from the diagnostic sample, washed in isotonic saline, pelleted by centrifugation, and stored at –20 °C until DNA extraction and bisulfite modification. A cell culture from each villi sample was established by finely macerating the villi and resuspending in 1.0 ml of 0.25% trypsin with incubation of the suspension at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were then resuspended in 7 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (SAFC Biosciences), pelleted at 560 × g, and resuspended in a small volume of AmnioMAX medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. The cell suspension was then inoculated onto glass coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes with subsequent incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in humidified air. Wells were then flooded with 2 ml of AmnioMAX medium the following day and were grown to around 95% confluence, trypsinized, pelleted, and stored at –20 °C until DNA extraction and bisulfite modification. Cultured cells were isolated following 14–18 days in culture with a maximum of three passages.Cell Culturing and Transfection—JEG-3 cells (HTB-36 (40Kohler P.O. Bridson W.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Cells were grown for a minimal number of passages (<8) and were split (1:5–1:8) prior to confluence and harvesting of genomic DNA or transfection analysis.For transfection experiments, a total of 8 × 103 JAR or HIPEC65 cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection in each well of a 96-well plate (96F Nunclon Delta white microwell). Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen). Luciferase and Renilla activity was measured 24 h post-transfection using the DualGLO assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) on a FluorSTAR Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). For vitamin D induction experiments, cells were treated with 10 or 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2D (Sigma) 12 h post-transfection, with luciferase activity monitored after overnight incubation. Endometrial stromal cells and decidua were isolated as previously described (44Dimitriadis E. Robb L. Salamonsen L.A. Mol. Hum.

Mouse primers were mF1 (5′-TGTTTAGTAGTGGTTAGTTGGTGGG) and mR1 (5′-ACATCCCTAAACATCTACCTCTTCC). Amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 56 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s × 40 cycles, 72 °C for 7 min.

The SalI-digested amplicon was cloned into a promoterless luciferase expression vector pGL3:basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce the plasmid pGL3:–594/+209. Reverse orientation cloning was also carried out to produce pGL:+209/–594. Following sequence verification, DNA was in vitro methylated using either Sss1, HpaII, or HhaI methylases (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of pGL3:control vector (SV40 constitutive promoter), pGL3:basic (promoterless), or unmethylated or methylated CYP24A1 promoter constructs were then transfected into JAR and HIPEC65 cells. Co-transfection with 10 ng of pRn (HSV-TK promoter linked to the Renilla luciferase gene) was carried out in all cases to normalize for transfection efficiency.Gene Induction Experiments—24 h prior to induction, CVS-derived cells, skin, and placental-derived fibroblasts were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 250,000 cells/well. Half of the wells were then treated with 100 nm calcitriol (Sigma), and the other half were left untreated. Cells were then incubated for 7 h prior to total RNA isolation using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed with the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen), from 1 μg of total RNA. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed in a 96-well optical plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a 7300 ABi thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The master mix consisted of 15 μl of Sybr Green Master Mix (Sigma), 1 μl of forward primer, 1 μl of reverse primer (50 pm final concentration), 8 μl of water, 5 μl of cDNA template in a total volume of 30 μl. Nondiluted cDNA was used for CYP24A1, CYP27B1, and VDR assays, and a 1:10 dilution was used for the GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) assay. Primer sequences were as follows: CYP24A1_F, 5′-CCCAAAGGAACAGTGCTCATG; CYP24A1_R, 5′-TCTCCTGAAGCCAACGTTCAG; CYP27B1_F, 5′-ATGAGGAACGGAGGACAGCC; CYP27B1_R, 5′-GAGCGTGTTGGACACCGTGT; VDR_F, 5′-TTGCGCTCCAATGAGTCCTTC; VDR_R, 5′-CTGTGTCCGGCTTTGGTCAC; GAPDH_F, 5′-TTCGACAGTCAGCCGCATCTT; GAPDH_R, 5′-CCCAATACGACCAAATCCGTT.RESULTSThe CYP24A1 but Not the VDR or CYP27B1 Gene Promoter Is Methylated in Full Term Human Placental Tissue—As a first step in the identification of potential epigenetic regulation of vitamin D levels in the placenta, we designed specific methylation amplification assays for regulatory regions of the VDR, CYP24A1, and CYP27B1 genes. In the case of the VDR and CYP24A1 genes, assays were designed to span the transcription start site and exon 1 within the associated CpG island, whereas for CYP27B1, we analyzed a region of exon 1 previously shown to be methylated in some cancers (48Kim S. Li M. Paik H. Nephew K. Shi H. Kramer R. Xu D. Huang T.H. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii, January 4–8, 2008. PSB, Stanford, CA2008: 315-326Google Scholar, 49Taylor K.H. Kramer R.S. Davis J.W. Guo J. Duff D.J. Xu D. Caldwell C.W. Shi H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8511-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Initial experiments on human term placenta revealed a complete lack of methylation at the VDR and CYP27B1 gene regulatory regions, with clear (but variable) methylation of the CYP24A1 promoter region (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This was not due to problems with specific assays, since methylation of both VDR and CYP27B1 were detected in choriocarcinoma cells (see below). Three independent assays spanning the CYP24A1-associated CpG island were then examined with each showing evidence of methylation in full term placenta (supplemental Fig. 1). A total of 10 term placentas were then examined using the CYP24A1-2 assay spanning a region of differential methylation recently identified in the placenta by whole genome methylation data (50Rakyan V. Down T. Thorne N. Flicek P. Kulesha E. Graf S. Tomazou E. Backdahl L. Johnson N. Herberth M. Howe K. Jackson D. Miretti M. Fiegler H. Marioni J. Birney E. Hubbard T. Carter N. Tavare S. Beck S. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1518-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These results confirmed methylation of the CYP24A1 CpG island in all full term placental samples, with a mean methylation level of 56.5% (Table 1). Whereas some CYP24A1 alleles showed nearly complete methylation, others were almost completely unmethylated. This is reminiscent of monoallelic methylation, previously described for the APC tumor suppressor gene in the placenta (37Wong N.C. Novakovic B. Weinrich B. Dewi C. Andronikos R. Sibson M. Macrae F. Morley R. Pertile M.D. Craig J.M. Saffery R.

Promoter methylation comparable with that seen in full term placental tissue was observed both in primary and cultured CVS tissue samples (Fig. 2 and Table 1) and in first trimester termination tissue (Table 1). Since the CVS culturing conditions do not favor trophoblast growth or division, the methylation of CYP24A1 seen in the cultured samples is probably mesodermal in origin. In addition, purified first trimester cytotrophoblasts also show methylation of the CYP24A1 gene (Fig. 2), demonstrating that this methylation is present in multiple cell types in first trimester placenta. No methylation was detected in purified full term placental fibroblasts or an SV40-transformed first trimester trophoblast cell line (Fig. 2). A summary of mean methylation levels obtained in this study is presented in Table 1.FIGURE 2Methylation of CYP24A1 in different human placental tissues and cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2075215651,"Deregulation of EGFR signaling is common in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and this finding led to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are highly effective in a subset of NSCLC. Mutations of EGFR (mEGFR) and copy number gains (CNGs) of EGFR (gEGFR) and HER2 (gHER2) have been reported to predict for TKI response. Mutations in KRAS (mKRAS) are associated with primary resistance to TKIs.We investigated the relationship between mutations, CNGs and response to TKIs in a large panel of NSCLC cell lines. Genes studied were EGFR, HER2, HER3 HER4, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. Mutations were detected by sequencing, while CNGs were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). IC50 values for the TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were determined by MTS assay. For any of the seven genes tested, mutations (39/77, 50.6%), copy number gains (50/77, 64.9%) or either (65/77, 84.4%) were frequent in NSCLC lines. Mutations of EGFR (13%) and KRAS (24.7%) were frequent, while they were less frequent for the other genes. The three techniques for determining CNG were well correlated, and qPCR data were used for further analyses. CNGs were relatively frequent for EGFR and KRAS in adenocarcinomas. While mutations were largely mutually exclusive, CNGs were not. EGFR and KRAS mutant lines frequently demonstrated mutant allele specific imbalance i.e. the mutant form was usually in great excess compared to the wild type form. On a molar basis, sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib were highly correlated. Multivariate analyses led to the following results: 1. mEGFR and gEGFR and gHER2 were independent factors related to gefitinib sensitivity, in descending order of importance. 2. mKRAS was associated with increased in vitro resistance to gefitinib.Our in vitro studies confirm and extend clinical observations and demonstrate the relative importance of both EGFR mutations and CNGs and HER2 CNGs in the sensitivity to TKIs."

Emerging evidence suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers adversely affect synaptic function, which leads to cognitive failure associated with AD. The Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction has been attributed to the synaptic removal of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs); however, it is unclear how Aβ induces the loss of AMPARs at the synapses. In this study we have examined the potential involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a signaling molecule critical for AMPAR trafficking and function. We found that the synaptic pool of CaMKII was significantly decreased in cortical neurons from APP transgenic mice, and the density of CaMKII clusters at synapses was significantly reduced by Aβ oligomer treatment. In parallel, the surface expression of GluR1 subunit as well as AMPAR-mediated synaptic response and ionic current was selectively decreased in APP transgenic mice and Aβ-treated cultures. Moreover, the reducing effect of Aβ on AMPAR current density was mimicked and occluded by knockdown of CaMKII and blocked by overexpression of CaMKII.

However, it is unclear how Aβ induces the loss of AMPARs at the synapses. The trafficking of AMPA receptors directly controls excitatory synaptic efficacy (20Derkach V.A. Oh M.C. Guire E.S. Soderling T.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci... 2007; 8: 101-113Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate the transport of AMPARs to and from the cell surface and lateral diffusion at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites (21Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci... 2002; 25: 103-126Google Scholar), including PDZ domain-mediated interactions between channel and scaffolding proteins (22Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R.

CaMKII, a multifunctional kinase highly enriched at postsynaptic densities (PSD) of glutamatergic synapses (28Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1983; 80: 7357-7361Google Scholar), has been found to drive AMPARs into synapses and reduce ""silent"" synapses devoid of AMPARs (22Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science.. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Google Scholar, 29Poncer J.C. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. J. Neurosci... 2002; 22: 4406-4411Google Scholar). CaMKII achieves the efficacy and specificity of signal transduction via compartmentalized localization (30Kennedy M.B. Science.. 2000; 290: 750-754Google Scholar, 31Hudmon A. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2002; 71: 473-510Google Scholar). Different pools of CaMKII compartmentalized at membrane, postsynaptic densities, nucleus, and cytosol are responsible for regulating distinct substrates ranging from glutamate receptor channels to transcription factors. It has been found that CaMKII dynamically alters its subcellular distribution in response to activity changes (32Shen K. Meyer T. Science.. 1999; 284: 162-166Google Scholar) or activation of certain G-protein coupled receptors (33Gu Z. Jiang Q. Yuen E.Y. Yan Z. Mol. Pharmacol... 2006; 69: 813-822Google Scholar). Because CaMKII located in postsynaptic sites plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity through the regulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (22Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science.. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Google Scholar, 34Soderling T.R. Chang B. Brickey D. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3719-3722Google Scholar, 35Lisman J.E. Zhabotinsky A.M. Neuron.. 2001; 31: 191-201Google Scholar), in this study we have examined the possibility that synaptic CaMKII is reduced by Aβ, which underlies the Aβ-induced decrease of AMPAR delivery to synapses. An AD Model and Aβ Oligomer Preparation—APP transgenic mice carrying the Swedish mutation (K670N, M671L) (36Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science.. 1996; 274: 99-103Google Scholar) were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Eight-week-old transgenic males (on B6SJLF1 hybrid background) were bred with mature B6SJLF1 females. The genetic background of these mice is the same with this breeding scheme. Genotyping were performed by PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol. Different ages of male transgenic and wild-type littermates were used in the experiments. The procedure of Aβ oligomer preparation was similar to what was described before (37Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr. W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. ..J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). In brief, the Aβ-(1–42) peptide (Tocris) was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol to 1 mm. Hexafluoroisopropanol was then removed under vacuum. The remaining peptide was then resuspended in DMSO to 5 mm and diluted in H2O to 0.1 mm. The oligomeric Aβ was formed by incubating at 4 °C for 24 h. Subcellular Fractionation of Proteins—Subcellular fractions were prepared as described previously (38Tang K. Liu C. Kuluz J. Hu B. J. Neurochem... 2004; 91: 429-437Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, blocks of frontal cortex were cut out, weighed, and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 ml/g, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor tablet). 50 μl of homogenates were removed as the total protein, and the remaining were subjected to several steps of centrifugation. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and large debris, the remaining supernatant was subjected to 10,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction (supernatant (S)). The crude synaptosome fraction (pellet) was suspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl, homogenized again, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min to obtain Triton soluble fraction (supernatant (P1)) and Triton insoluble fraction (pellet (P2)). The P2 fraction was dissolved in 1% SDS. The major component of P1 fraction includes cytosolic proteins from synpatosomes, whereas the P2 fraction mainly includes membrane-associated proteins from synpatosomes. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of proteins from WT and APP mice were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with various primary antibodies, including CaMKII α subunit (Santa Cruz, 1:2000), CaMKII β subunit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:2000), Thr-286-p-CaMKII α subunit (Santa Cruz, 1:2000), actin (Santa Cruz, 1:2000), PSD-95 (Affinity BioReagents, 1:3000), GluR1 (Santa Cruz, 1:1000), NR1 (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:2000), Ser-831-p-GluR1 (Upstate, 1:500), GluR2 (Chemicon, 1:1000), Ser-880-p-GluR2 (Abcam, 1:1000). The Aβ antibody (Chemicon, 6E10, 1:500) was used for detecting the oligomeric Aβ preparation. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), the blots were exposed to the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was obtained from densitometric measurements of immunoreactive bands on films with Image J software. Biochemical Measurement of Surface Receptors—The surface AMPA or NMDA receptors were detected as described previously (39Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Yan Z. J. Neurosci... 2005; 25: 4974-4984Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical slices were incubated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 20 min on ice. The slices were then rinsed 3 times in Tris-buffered saline to quench the biotin reaction followed by homogenization in 500 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Na3PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and incubated with neutravidin-agarose (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled. Quantitative Western blots were performed on biotinylated (surface) proteins using antibodies against GluR1 (Santa Cruz, 1:1000, N terminus) or NR1 (Upstate, 1:1000, C terminus). Primary Culture—Rat prefrontal cortex cultures were prepared as described previously (33Gu Z. Jiang Q. Yuen E.Y. Yan Z. Mol. Pharmacol... 2006; 69: 813-822Google Scholar). Briefly, prefrontal cortex was dissected from 18-day rat embryos, and cells were dissociated by incubating with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 30 min and subsequent trituration through a Pasteur pipette. The neurons were plated on coverslips (coated with poly-l-lysine, put in 24-well plates) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 for electrophysiological experiments and at a lower density of 0.2 × 105 cells/cm2 for immunocytochemical staining. When neurons attached to the coverslip within 24 h, the medium was changed to Neurobasal with B27 supplement. Cytosine arabinoside (1.25 μm) was added to the culture media from day 4 to inhibit glia growth. Neurons were maintained for 2–4 weeks. Immunocytochemistry—After Aβ treatment, neurons cultured on coverslips (DIV 25–28) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature and washed 3 times with PBS. For total protein staining, neurons were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. For surface protein staining, neurons were not permeabilized. Then neurons were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h to block nonspecific staining. Next, neurons were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, including anti-CaMKII α subunit (Santa Cruz, 1:200), anti-GluR1 (Upstate, 1:100, N-term), and anti-NR1 (Chemicon, 1:100, EC loop). After washing, neurons were incubated with Alexa-488 (green) or Alexa-594 (red)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. For the staining of F-actin, neurons were incubated with Alex568-conjugated phalloidin (1 unit/ml, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 20 min. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline for three times, the coverslips were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were obtained using a 100× objective with a cooled CCD camera mounted on a Nikon microscope. All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed using identical parameters with the Image J software. The clusters for CaMKII, F-actin, GluR1, surface NR1, or surface GluR1 were measured. To define dendritic clusters, a single threshold was chosen manually so that clusters corresponded to puncta of at least 2-fold intensity of the diffuse fluorescence on the dendritic shaft. On each coverslip, the cluster density of 30 neurons (2–3 dendritic segments of 50 μm length per neuron) was measured. Three to four independent experiments for each of the treatments were performed. Quantitative analyses were conducted blindly (without knowledge of experimental treatment). Transfection—To knockdown or overexpress CaMKII, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against CaMKII or an enhanced GFP-fused wild-type CaMKII plasmid was transfected into cultured cortical neurons (DIV 14–16) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as we described before (39Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Yan Z. J. Neurosci... 2005; 25: 4974-4984Google Scholar, 33Gu Z. Jiang Q. Yuen E.Y. Yan Z. Mol. Pharmacol... 2006; 69: 813-822Google Scholar). The siRNA oligonucleotide sequences for CaMKII α subunit were 5′-GGAGUAUGCUGCCAAGAUUtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAUCUUGGCAGCAUACUCCtg-3′ (antisense). CaMKII siRNA or a scrambled control siRNA was co-transfected (10 nm) with enhanced GFP (0.2 μg/ml). To test the specificity of CaMKII siRNA, a mutated CaMKII plasmid carrying siRNA-insensitive silent mutations was constructed using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated sequence on CaMKII was GAGTATGCAGCAAAGATT (mutated nucleotides are underlined). Cultures were used 3 days after transfection. Patch Clamp Recordings in Slices and Cultures—The whole-cell voltage clamp technique was used to measure AMPAR-EPSC and NMDAR-EPSC in cortical slices (39Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Yan Z. J. Neurosci... 2005; 25: 4974-4984Google Scholar). The slice (300 μm) was incubated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing bicuculline (15 μm). The internal solution contained 130 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 10 mm CsCl, 4 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2.2 mm QX-314 (Sigma), 12 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm Na2GTP, pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mOsm. Neurons were visualized with a 40× water-immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared IR light. All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier. Tight seals (2–10 gigaohms) were generated by applying negative pressure. Additional suction was applied to disrupt the membrane and obtain the whole-cell configuration. EPSCs were evoked by stimulating the neighboring cortical neurons with a bipolar tungsten electrode (FHC, Inc.) located at a few hundred micrometers away from the neuron under recording. Stimulation pulses (5.5 V, 0.05 ms) were used to evoke AMPAR-EPSC on neurons held at -70 mV. To evoke NMDAR-EPSC, stimulation pulses (6.5 V, 0.5 ms) were used, and neurons (bathed in 10 μm 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) were depolarized from -70 to +60 mV for 3 s before stimulation to fully relieve the voltage-dependent Mg2+ block of NMDARs. Whole-cell recordings of AMPAR and NMDAR channel currents in cultured neurons used standard voltage clamp techniques (39Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Yan Z. J. Neurosci... 2005; 25: 4974-4984Google Scholar). The internal solution contained 180 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4 mm MgCl2, 40 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm BAPTA, 12 mm phosphocreatine, 3 mm Na2ATP, and 0.5 mm Na2GTP, pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mOsm. The external solution for AMPAR currents contained 127 mm NaCl, 20 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm BaCl2, 12 mm glucose, 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.3–7.4 (300–305 mOsm/liter tetrodotoxin). For recording NMDAR currents, external solution was modified to contain 0 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 μm glycine. Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments 200B amplifier that was controlled and monitored by an IBM PC running pClamp 8 with a DigiData 1320 series interface (Axon instruments). After seal rupture, series resistance (4–10 megaohms) was compensated (70–90%). NMDAR- or AMPAR-mediated current was evoked by application of NMDA (100 μm) or glutamate (100 μm) for 2 s every 30 s in neurons held at -60 mV. Drugs were delivered with a ""sewer pipe"" system. The array of drug capillaries (∼150 μm inner diameter) was positioned a few hundred microns from the cell under examine. Solution changes were controlled by the SF-77B fast-step solution stimulus delivery device (Warner Instruments). Data were analyzed with Clampfit (Axon instruments) and Kaleidagraph (Albeck Software). CaMKII Subcellular Distribution and GluR1 Surface Expression Are Altered in APP Transgenic Mice—To detect the potential change of CaMKII by Aβ, we compared the expression of CaMKII in frontal cortex from WT versus APP mice. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, the total amount of CaMKII α subunit was not altered in 6-month-old APP mice compared with the age-matched WT littermates (2 ± 0.2% decrease, n = 8); however, the subcellular distribution of α-CaMKII was remarkably changed in APP mice, with a significant decrease in the Triton-insoluble synaptosome (P2) fraction (49 ± 3.5% decrease, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA), a significant increase in cytosolic (S) fraction (95 ± 8.3% increase, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA), and virtually no change in Triton-soluble synaptosome (P1) fraction (6 ± 0.5% increase, n = 8). Because CaMKII β subunit functions as an F-actin targeting module that localizes CaMKII holoenzyme to dendritic spines (40Shen K. Teruel M.N. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Neuron.. 1998; 21: 593-606Google Scholar), we also examined the impact of Aβ on β-CaMKII distribution. Similar to α-CaMKII, β-CaMKII in APP mice was not altered in the total level but was significantly decreased in P2 fraction (57 ± 4.8% decrease, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA) and increased in S fraction (105 ± 7.2% increase, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA). CaMKII is autophosphorylated at Thr-286 when the enzyme is activated (41Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. Cell.. 1986; 44: 861-870Google Scholar), therefore, prolonging the function of the enzyme beyond the transient rise of [Ca2+]i signal. Thus, we also examined whether Aβ altered the distribution of activated CaMKII (Thr-286-phosphorylated α-CaMKII) in APP mice. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, the total amount of p-CaMKII was not changed in APP mice (5 ± 0.4% increase, n = 8); however, p-CaMKII exhibited a similar alteration pattern in its subcellular distribution as CaMKII α subunit (47 ± 3.9% decrease in P2 fraction and 103 ± 8.5% increase in S fraction, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA). Actin was not changed in all of the separated cellular fractions including the supernatant (mainly G-actin) and pellets (mainly F-actin). These data suggest that CaMKII (α subunit, β subunit, or activated form) is redistributed from postsynaptic sites to cytosol in APP transgenic mice. Next, we examined the potential change of several other synaptic proteins by Aβ, including the scaffolding protein PSD-95, AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit, and NMDA receptor NR1 subunit. As shown in Fig. 1B, all of these synaptic proteins, which were present in Triton-soluble (P1) or insoluble (P2) synaptosome fractions, were not altered in APP mice. It suggests that APP transgenic mice, which do not have a significant loss of synapses at this stage, have selectively lost synaptic CaMKII. We further examined the change of CaMKII in APP transgenic mice at different time points. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, the CaMKII α subunit in P2 fraction was reduced to a greater extent in older APP mice (3 month: 30 ± 2.2% decrease, n = 8; 6 month: 49 ± 3.5% decrease, n = 8; 12 month: 71 ± 6.3% decrease, n = 8), suggesting a progressive loss of synaptic CaMKII by Aβ. Previous studies have shown that activated CaMKII can potentiate synaptic transmission by enhancing AMPAR channel conductance via GluR1 phosphorylation at Ser-831 (42McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.E. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Nature.. 1993; 362: 640-642Google Scholar, 43Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science.. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Google Scholar) and by delivering new AMPA receptors to the synapse (22Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science.. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Google Scholar, 29Poncer J.C. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. J. Neurosci... 2002; 22: 4406-4411Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the reduced CaMKII at synaptic sites in APP transgenic mice might result in changes in the AMPAR phosphorylation and surface expression. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, APP mice exhibited a significant decrease in Ser-831-phosphorylated GluR1 (41 ± 3.7% decrease, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA) and the level of surface GluR1 (32 ± 2.4% decrease, n = 8, p < 0.01, ANOVA). No significant change was observed on the level of Ser-880-phosphorylated GluR2, a target of protein kinase C, in WT and APP mice (Fig. 1, F and G). Unlike GluR1, the level of surface or total NMDAR NR1 subunit was not significantly altered (3 ± 0.4% increase, n = 8). It suggests that the decreased synaptic CaMKII in APP transgenic mice preferably disrupts AMPAR localization at the synaptic membrane. Synaptic CaMKII and Surface GluR1 Clusters Are Reduced after Aβ Exposure—To determine the direct impact of Aβ on CaMKII, we examined the effect of Aβ exposure on CaMKII subcellular redistribution in cultured cortical neurons. We first detected the oligomeric Aβ preparation using an Aβ antibody. As shown in the Western blot (Fig. 2A), there was a smear band of signals between 4–22 kDa, suggesting the presence of Aβ monomers, dimers, and trimers. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the CaMKII α subunit at Triton-insoluble synaptosome (P2) fraction was significantly (p < 0.01, ANOVA) decreased after being exposed to Aβ oligomer (1 μm) for 1, 3, or 7 days (1 day: 32 ± 2.5% decrease, n = 8; 3 days: 46 ± 2.9% decrease, n = 8; 7 days: 59 ± 4.2% decrease, n = 8), although the total amount of CaMKII was not changed. In parallel, the surface level of GluR1 subunit was significantly (p < 0.01, ANOVA) decreased after Aβ exposure (1 day: 24 ± 1.8% decrease, n = 8; 3 days: 40 ± 2.7% decrease, n = 8; 7 days: 52 ± 3.6% decrease, n = 8), whereas the surface level of NR1 subunit was not significantly changed (2–3% change, n = 8). The total amount of either GluR1 or NR1 was not altered by Aβ treatment. These data suggest that Aβ oligomers induce a selective loss of CaMKII from synapses and removal of AMPARs from synaptic membrane. Next, we performed immunocytochemical experiments in neuronal cultures to test the impact of Aβ on CaMKII synaptic localization. Because F-actin or GluR1 is highly enriched at synapses, the synaptically localized CaMKII was revealed as that co-localizing with F-actin or GluR1. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, in untreated control cultures most of CaMKII clusters (green) were co-localized with F-actin or GluR1 clusters (red) at dendritic spines, the major sites of synapse formation, as indicated by numerous yellow puncta. Aβ exposure (1 μm, 3 days) significantly decreased CaMKII clusters, but not F-actin or GluR1 clusters, which led to less yellow puncta (co-localized clusters) along dendrites. Quantitative analysis (Fig. 3C) indicated that Aβ significantly (p < 0.01, ANOVA) reduced the cluster density (number of clusters/50-μm dendrite) of CaMKII (control, 24.3 ± 1.9; Aβ, 15.6 ± 1.2, n = 30), CaMKII co-localized with F-actin (control, 20.3 ± 1.6; Aβ, 13.1 ± 1.0, n = 30), and CaMKII co-localized with GluR1 (control, 17.1 ± 1.4; Aβ: 11.2 ± 0.7 n = 30). No significant change was observed in the cluster density of F-actin (control, 37.4 ± 2.8; Aβ, 38.8 ± 3.2) or GluR1 (control, 21.2 ± 1.8; Aβ, 22.3 ± 2.0), suggesting the lack of changes on spine density by Aβ. Neuronal viability assays (44Yuen E.Y. Ren Y. Yan Z. Mol. Pharmacol... 2008; 74: 360-370Google Scholar) by co-staining of MAP2 (to label survival neurons) and propidium iodide (to label apoptotic neurons) revealed no toxicity with the Aβ treatment of cortical cultures (data not shown). These data indicate that Aβ selectively decreases the pool of CaMKII located at synapses. Because biochemical assays showed that the level of surface GluR1 was selectively reduced in APP transgenic mice and in Aβ-treated cultures, we performed immunocytochemical experiments to test the impact of Aβ on GluR1 located at synaptic membrane. The surface expression of AMPA or NMDA receptors was measured with antibodies against the extracellular domain of GluR1 or NR1 in non-permeabilized cultures. As shown in Fig. 4A, in untreated control cultures most of surface GluR1 clusters (red) were co-localized with surface NR1 clusters (green) at dendritic spines, as indicated by numerous yellow puncta. Aβ exposure (1 μm, 3 days) significantly decreased GluR1 clusters, but not NR1 clusters, which led to more green"
https://openalex.org/W2029323337,"The embodied cognition hypothesis suggests that motor and premotor areas are automatically and necessarily involved in understanding action language, as word conceptual representations are embodied. This transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study explores the role of the left primary motor cortex in action-verb processing. TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials from right-hand muscles were recorded as a measure of M1 activity, while participants were asked either to judge explicitly whether a verb was action-related (semantic task) or to decide on the number of syllables in a verb (syllabic task). TMS was applied in three different experiments at 170, 350 and 500 ms post-stimulus during both tasks to identify when the enhancement of M1 activity occurred during word processing. The delays between stimulus onset and magnetic stimulation were consistent with electrophysiological studies, suggesting that word recognition can be differentiated into early (within 200 ms) and late (within 400 ms) lexical-semantic stages, and post-conceptual stages. Reaction times and accuracy were recorded to measure the extent to which the participants' linguistic performance was affected by the interference of TMS with M1 activity. No enhancement of M1 activity specific for action verbs was found at 170 and 350 ms post-stimulus, when lexical-semantic processes are presumed to occur (Experiments 1–2). When TMS was applied at 500 ms post-stimulus (Experiment 3), processing action verbs, compared with non-action verbs, increased the M1-activity in the semantic task and decreased it in the syllabic task. This effect was specific for hand-action verbs and was not observed for action-verbs related to other body parts. Neither accuracy nor RTs were affected by TMS. These findings suggest that the lexical-semantic processing of action verbs does not automatically activate the M1. This area seems to be rather involved in post-conceptual processing that follows the retrieval of motor representations, its activity being modulated (facilitated or inhibited), in a top-down manner, by the specific demand of the task."
https://openalex.org/W2058418915,"Background Although anandamide (AEA) had been measured in human follicular fluid and is suggested to play a role in ovarian follicle and oocyte maturity, its exact source and role in the human ovary remains unclear. Methods and Findings Immunohistochemical examination of normal human ovaries indicated that the endocannabinoid system was present and widely expressed in the ovarian medulla and cortex with more intense cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) than CB1 immunoreactivity in the granulosa cells of primordial, primary, secondary, tertiary follicles, corpus luteum and corpus albicans. The enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acyclphosphatidylethanolamine-phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), were only found in growing secondary and tertiary follicles and corpora lutea and albicantes. The follicular fluid (FF) AEA concentrations of 260 FF samples, taken from 37 infertile women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection with embryo transfer, were correlated with ovarian follicle size (P = 0.03). Significantly higher FF AEA concentrations were also observed in mature follicles (1.43±0.04 nM; mean±SEM) compared to immature follicles (1.26±0.06 nM), P = 0.0142 and from follicles containing morphologically assessed mature oocytes (1.56±0.11 nM) compared to that containing immature oocytes (0.99±0.09 nM), P = 0.0011. ROC analysis indicated that a FF AEA level of 1.09 nM could discriminate between mature and immature oocytes with 72.2% sensitivity and 77.14% specificity, whilst plasma AEA levels and FF AEA levels on oocyte retrieval day were not significantly different (P = 0.23). Conclusions These data suggest that AEA is produced in the ovary, is under hormonal control and plays a role in folliculogenesis, preovulatory follicle maturation, oocyte maturity and ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W2048102298,"Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) a widely used treatment for uncomplicated malaria and recommended for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, is being investigated for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi). High levels of drug resistance to SP have been reported from north-eastern Tanzania associated with mutations in parasite genes. This study compared the in vivo efficacy of SP in symptomatic 6-59 month children with uncomplicated malaria and in asymptomatic 2-10 month old infants.An open label single arm (SP) standard 28 day in vivo WHO antimalarial efficacy protocol was used in 6 to 59 months old symptomatic children and a modified protocol used in 2 to 10 months old asymptomatic infants. Enrolment was stopped early (87 in the symptomatic and 25 in the asymptomatic studies) due to the high failure rate. Molecular markers were examined for recrudescence, re-infection and markers of drug resistance and a review of literature of studies looking for the 581G dhps mutation was carried out. In symptomatic children PCR-corrected early treatment failure was 38.8% (95% CI 26.8-50.8) and total failures by day 28 were 82.2% (95% CI 72.5-92.0). There was no significant difference in treatment failures between asymptomatic and symptomatic children. 96% of samples carried parasites with mutations at codons 51, 59 and 108 in the dhfr gene and 63% carried a double mutation at codons 437 and 540. 55% carried a third mutation with the addition of a mutation at codon 581 in the dhps gene. This triple: triple haplotype maybe associated with earlier treatment failure.In northern Tanzania SP is a failed drug for treatment and its utility for prophylaxis is doubtful. The study found a new combination of parasite mutations that maybe associated with increased and earlier failure.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00361114."
https://openalex.org/W2006631235,"Beta-catenin is an essential component of two cellular systems: cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJ) and the Wnt signaling pathway. A functional or physical connection between these beta-catenin pools has been suggested in previous studies, but not conclusively demonstrated to date. To further examine this intersection, we treated A431 cell colonies with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which forces rapid and synchronized dissociation of AJ. A combination of immunostaining, time-lapse microscopy using photoactivatable-GFP-tagged beta-catenin, and image analyses indicate that the cadherin-bound pool of beta-catenin, internalized together with E-cadherin, accumulates at the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) upon AJ dissociation, and can be translocated into the cell nucleus upon Wnt pathway activation. These results suggest that the ERC may be a site of residence for beta-catenin destined to enter the nucleus, and that dissociation of AJ may influence beta-catenin levels in the ERC, effectively affecting beta-catenin substrate levels available downstream for the Wnt pathway. This intersection provides a mechanism for integrating cell-cell adhesion with Wnt signaling and could be critical in developmental and cancer processes that rely on beta-catenin-dependent gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2076646456,"Thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films are frequently used in “lab on a chip” devices as flexible membranes. The common solvent used to dilute the PDMS for thin films is hexane, but hexane can swell the underlying PDMS substrate. A better solvent would be one that dissolves uncured PDMS but doesn't swell the underlying substrate. Here, we present protocols and spin curves for two alternatives to hexane dilution: longer spin times and dilution in tert-butyl alcohol. The thickness of the PDMS membranes under different spin speeds, spin times, and PDMS concentrations was measured using an optical profilometer. The use of tert-butyl alcohol to spin thin PDMS films does not swell the underlying PDMS substrate, and we have used these films to construct multilayer PDMS devices."

Furthermore, the RNA components of RNP enzymes show no evidence of fading out but instead, in some cases, have elaborated new functions."
https://openalex.org/W2009373631,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with inclusion body myopathy and Paget disease of bone is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the VCP (valosin-containing protein) gene. The disease is characterized neuropathologically by frontal and temporal lobar atrophy, neuron loss and gliosis, and ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), which are distinct from those seen in other sporadic and familial FTLD-U entities. The major component of the ubiquitinated inclusions of FTLD with VCP mutation is TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa). TDP-43 proteinopathy links sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, sporadic FTLD-U, and most familial forms of FTLD-U. Understanding the relationship between individual gene defects and pathologic TDP-43 will facilitate the characterization of the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Using cell culture models, we have investigated the role of mutant VCP in intracellular trafficking, proteasomal function, and cell death and demonstrate that mutations in the VCP gene 1) alter localization of TDP-43 between the nucleus and cytosol, 2) decrease proteasome activity, 3) induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, 4) increase markers of apoptosis, and 5) impair cell viability. These results suggest that VCP mutation-induced neurodegeneration is mediated by several mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2016020395,"Gamma-retroviruses and lentiviruses integrate non-randomly in mammalian genomes, with specific preferences for active chromatin, promoters and regulatory regions. Gene transfer vectors derived from gamma-retroviruses target at high frequency genes involved in the control of growth, development and differentiation of the target cell, and may induce insertional tumors or pre-neoplastic clonal expansions in patients treated by gene therapy. The gene expression program of the target cell is apparently instrumental in directing gamma-retroviral integration, although the molecular basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We report a bioinformatic analysis of the distribution of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) flanking >4,000 integrated proviruses in human hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. We show that gamma-retroviral, but not lentiviral vectors, integrate in genomic regions enriched in cell-type specific subsets of TFBSs, independently from their relative position with respect to genes and transcription start sites. Analysis of sequences flanking the integration sites of Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)- and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived vectors carrying mutations in their long terminal repeats (LTRs), and of HIV vectors packaged with an MLV integrase, indicates that the MLV integrase and LTR enhancer are the viral determinants of the selection of TFBS-rich regions in the genome. This study identifies TFBSs as differential genomic determinants of retroviral target site selection in the human genome, and suggests that transcription factors binding the LTR enhancer may synergize with the integrase in tethering retroviral pre-integration complexes to transcriptionally active regulatory regions. Our data indicate that gamma-retroviruses and lentiviruses have evolved dramatically different strategies to interact with the host cell chromatin, and predict a higher risk in using gamma-retroviral vs. lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy applications."
https://openalex.org/W2011132677,"The current studies show FGF15 signaling decreases hepatic forkhead transcription factor 1 (FoxO1) activity through phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation. The bile acid receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor) activates expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15 in the intestine, which acts through hepatic FGFR4 to suppress cholesterol-7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and limit bile acid production. Because FoxO1 activity and CYP7A1 gene expression are both increased by fasting, we hypothesized CYP7A1 might be a FoxO1 target gene. Consistent with recently reported results, we show CYP7A1 is a direct target of FoxO1. Additionally, we show that the PI 3-kinase pathway is key for both the induction of CYP7A1 by fasting and the suppression by FGF15. FGFR4 is the major hepatic FGF receptor isoform and is responsible for the hepatic effects of FGF15. We also show that expression of FGFR4 in liver was decreased by fasting, increased by insulin, and reduced by streptozotocin-induced diabetes, implicating FGFR4 as a primary target of insulin regulation. Because insulin and FGF both target the PI 3-kinase pathway, these observations suggest FoxO1 is a key node in the convergence of FGF and insulin signaling pathways and functions as a key integrator for the regulation of glucose and bile acid metabolism.

Hepatic cholesterol is converted to bile acids, secreted into the gallbladder, and during a meal is released into the small intestine to enhance digestion and absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. The majority of the bile acid pool (95%) is recycled back to the liver, whereas the remaining 5% is eliminated through fecal excretion (1.Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2.Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). This is an important route for the elimination of excess cholesterol and underscores the importance that bile acids play in regulating mammalian cholesterol metabolism. The initial and rate-controlling step in the classic pathway for cholesterol conversion into bile acids is catalyzed by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). 2The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1, cholesterol-7α hydroxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; FoxO1, forkhead transcription factor 1; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1; SHP, small heterodimer partner; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; q-PCR, quantitative real time RT-PCR.

Hepatology. 1995; 21: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, bile acids themselves regulate CYP7A1 gene expression through a multicomponent negative feedback pathway. One of the molecular pathways for bile acid regulation is initiated by the activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) responding directly to bile acid agonists (7.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y.

FGF15 along with FGF21 and FGF23 compose a subfamily of FGFs that are regulated by nuclear receptors and function as metabolic hormones.

Most FGFs require strong binding to cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans to stabilize binding to their cognate FGF receptor.

FXR and bile acids have been implicated as integrated regulators of bile acid and glucose metabolism (31.Houten S.M. Watanabe M. Auwerx J.

In support of this connection, we found that CYP7A1 was induced by fasting and during streptozotocin induced diabetes (33.Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Insulin binding to its cell surface receptor initiates a signaling cascade through the PI 3-kinase pathway, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt. Akt in turn phosphorylates forkhead transcription factor 1 (FoxO1) on three key residues, Thr-24, Ser-253, and Ser-316, converting FoxO1 from a predominantly nuclear to a predominantly cytoplasmic location, rendering it unable to activate its nuclear target genes (37.Accili D.

Because FoxO1 is negatively regulated by PI 3-kinase signaling and both FoxO1 and CYP7A1 are induced by fasting, we hypothesized that FoxO1 might be involved in the negative regulation of CYP7A1. Here, we show that FoxO1 directly regulates CYP7A1 gene expression and that, similar to insulin, FGF15/19 signaling leads to a PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of FoxO1 in mice and in cultures of primary hepatocytes. Thus, FoxO1 is at a critical junction in hepatic physiology where it links bile acids with glucose metabolism. Plasmids—The rat pGL3R7α-342 has been described previously (a gift from Dr. G. Gil, Virginia Commonwealth University) (50.del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3587-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into putative FoxO1 binding sites designated FoxO1/1 or FoxO1/2 by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) to generate pGL3R7α-342/M1, pGL3R7α-342/M2, pGL3R7α-342/M1 and -2, and pGL3R7α-228/M1. The following primers were used: M1, 5′-CTAGTAGGAGGACAAATAGTGGGTGCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCA-3′; M2, 5′-TGACAGATGTGCTCATCTGGGTACTTCTTTTTCTACACACAG-3′. pGL3R7α-228 was constructed by PCR-based amplification using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-ATGTTATGTCAGCACATGAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAAAGCAGGAAAATTTCCAAAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with SstI and HindIII, which were added to the forward and reverse primers, respectively, for cloning purpose and inserted into the SstI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic. The human CYP7A1 promoter construct ph-371/+24-Luc (36.Wang D.P. Stroup D. Marrapodi M. Crestani M. Galli G. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1831-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. J. Chiang (Northeastern Ohio University). Cytomegalovirus-SHP was a gift from Dr. D. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). FLAG-FoxO1/WT, FLAG-FoxO1/TSS, and TK-IRS3 were gifts from Dr. T. Unterman (University of Illinois College of Medicine). pCMV6-Akt-WT and pCMV6-Akt-K179M were provided by T. Franke (Columbia University) through Dr. D. Fruman (University of California, Irvine, CA). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay—HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described (33.Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Values represent the mean of duplicates ± S.D. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Animal Studies—All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UC Irvine (protocol 97–1545). FoxO1flox/flox mice expressing Cre recombinase under the α1-antitrypsin promoter (51.Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. D. Accili (Columbia University). These mice were crossed, generating liver-specific FoxO1 knock-out mice (confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA as described (51.Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar)) and their littermates, FoxO1flox/flox, which were used as controls. These mice are in the FVB/N strain. Fasting experiments were performed with 8–9-week-old male mice, as described below. In other studies 4-week-old B6129 male mice were obtained from Taconic and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. The mice were allowed to adapt to new environments for at least 1 week before experiments. At 8 weeks of age mice were fasted for 24 h, and all mice were sacrificed at 8:00 a.m. (end of the dark cycle). Livers and ileums were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA was isolated. For the induction of diabetes, 4-week-old 129SVE male mice (Taconic) were treated with streptozotocin by intraperitoneal injections (100 μg/g of body weight) daily for 3 days to induce type I diabetes, as described previously (33.Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed, and livers were processed as described above. Overexpression of FGF15 or FoxO1 Δ256 in mice was achieved through adenoviral delivery. For this, recombinant adenoviruses expressing either GFP, FGF15 (a gift from Dr. S. Kliewer, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), or FoxO1 Δ256 (a gift from D. Accili, Columbia University) were first propagated in 293 cells and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. A total of 1 × 109 plaque-forming units of each adenovirus was administered into 8-week-old 129SVE male mice (Taconic) by intravenous injection (4 animals in each group). 7 days after adenovirus inoculation mice were sacrificed for RNA and protein analysis. Where indicated, mice were fasted before sacrifice as described above. Primary Mouse Hepatocyte Preparation—Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from 7–9-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (The Jackson Laboratory) by liver collagenase perfusion as described previously (52.LeCluyse E.L. Bullock P.L. Parkinson A. Hochman J.H. Pharm. Biotechnol. 1996; 8: 121-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine mixture. The liver was perfused with Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA through the cannulated portal vein at a flow rate of 4 ml/min for 15 min followed by perfusion with EBSS supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml collagenase (Wako Chemicals) and 4.8 mm CaCl2 for 20 min. The liver was dissected from the mouse, and dissociated cells were dispersed gently in Williams' E medium supplemented 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were filtered through a 100-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon), and hepatocytes were separated by a density gradient centrifugation using 45% Percoll (Sigma) solution. Hepatocyte viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion, and more than 90% of cells were consistently viable. The isolated cells were plated in collagen-coated 6-well dishes at a density of 6 × 105/well. After a 4-h attachment, cells were overlaid with Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) and maintained in serum-free Williams' E medium supplemented with 10 nm dexamethasone, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin. 48 h after isolation, cells were treated with 100 nm human insulin (Sigma) for 24 h or 80 ng/ml FGF19 (R&D Systems) for 6 h and harvested for RNA analysis. Insulin or FGF19 additions were staggered so that cells were harvested at the same time. For the dose-response experiment, cells were treated with 0, 40, or 80 ng/ml FGF19 for 6 h, and RNA was isolated. Cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin (Calbiochem) for 30 min before the treatment with FGF19. For Western analysis, cells were treated with 30 nm insulin or 80 ng/ml FGF19 for 30 min, and total cell lysates were prepared. Cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin (Calbiochem) or 20 μm SP600125 (Calbiochem) 2.5 μm PIK 90 (Axon Medchem BV, The Netherlands) for 30 min before the treatment with FGF19 or insulin where indicated. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative real time RT-PCR (q-PCR), RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) at 42 °C for 30 min. cDNA was amplified and quantified using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. q-PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample and repeated at least three times. Ct values were used to calculate the relative expression level normalized to the expression of the housekeeping ribosomal protein L32. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. A melting curve analysis was performed for each sample after PCR amplification to verify that the amplicon is homogeneous in the absence of primer dimmers and DNA contamination. The sequences of primers used in q-PCR are available upon request. RNA from individual animals (4–6 animals in each group) was analyzed separately, and a Student t test was used for comparative statistical analysis as indicated in the individual figure legends. Glucose Production Assay—Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice after overnight fasting, as described above. After a 4-h attachment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), primary cells were cultured overnight in DMEM with 5% FBS. The medium was then replaced with serum- and glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 mm sodium lactate without phenol red. Where indicated, 20, 40, or 80 ng/ml FGF19 was added to the medium. After a 3-h incubation, the medium was collected, and glucose concentrations were measured using the Amplex red glucose assay kit (Invitrogen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293T cells transfected with a vector expressing FLAG-FoxO1, and 5 μg of nuclear protein was used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described previously (33.Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal (Sigma) was incubated with the nuclear extract for 20 min on ice before incubation with the labeled probes. Competition experiments were performed in binding reactions where a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probes was incubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min before incubation with the labeled probes. The sequences of one strand of the complementary oligonucleotide probes were as follows: wild type FoxO1/1, 5′-AGGACAAATAGTGTTTGCTTTGGTCACTCA-3′; mutant FoxO1/1, 5′-AGGACAAATAGTGggTGCTTTGGTCACTCA-3′; wild type FoxO1/2, 5′-TGTGCTCATCTGTTTACTTCTTTTTC-3′; mutant FoxO1/2, 5′-TGTGCTCATCTGggTACTTCTTTTTC-3′; insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1/insulin response element, 5′-CACTAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACAC-3′. Protein Isolation and Blotting—Total cell lysates from primary mouse hepatocytes or mouse livers infected with either adenovirus expressing GFP or FGF15 were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed first by Ponceau S staining to confirm that equal amounts of total protein were both loaded and transferred in each lane. Then the blot was incubated with an indicated antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reactivity was then detected with the ECL kit (Pierce). The primary antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (clone 12CA5) from Roche Applied Science, total FoxO1, phospho-FoxO1 (Thr-24) and phospho-Akt (Ser473) from Cell Signaling Technology, total Akt from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal from Sigma, mouse FGFR4 from R&D systems (AF2265), and mouse β-actin from Sigma (A1978). Antibody against hepatic nuclear factor 4 was from Dr. F. Sladek (University of California, Riverside, CA). Adenovirus Infection of Primary Mouse Hepatocytes—Prima"
https://openalex.org/W2068296497,"The relationship between sphingosine kinase (SPHK), cellular ceramide concentration and chemosensitivity was investigated in human colon cancer cell lines. Among nine colon cancer cell lines, SPHK1 and SPHK2 activity and protein expression was highest in RKO cells and lowest in HCT116 cells. A viability assay revealed that HCT116 cells were sensitive to the effects of oxaliplatin (l-OHP), whereas RKO cells were resistant to those of l-OHP. Treatment with 5μg/ml l-OHP induced a marked time-dependent increase in various ceramides (C16, C24, C24:1) in HCT116 cells but not in RKO cells, as indicated by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The increase in ceramide and caspase activation induced by l-OHP in the sensitive HCT116 cells was abolished by pretreatment with a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor, suggesting that the ceramide formation was due to the activation of neutral, rather than acid, sphingomyelinase. In contrast, in l-OHP-resistant RKO cells, treatment with an SPHK inhibitor or SPHK1 and SPHK2 silencing by RNA interference suppressed cell viability and increased caspase activity and cellular ceramide formation after l-OHP treatment. The elevated ceramide formation induced by SPHK inhibition and l-OHP was inhibited by fumonisin B1 but not myriocin, suggesting that ceramide formation was through the salvage pathway. Endogenous phosphorylated Akt levels were much higher in the resistant RKO cells than in the sensitive HCT116 cells. Either SPHK1 or SPHK2 silencing in RKO cells decreased phosphorylated Akt levels and increased p53 and p21 protein levels as well as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in response to l-OHP treatment. These findings indicate that SPHK isoforms and neutral sphingomyelinase contribute to the regulation of chemosensitivity by controlling ceramide formation and the downstream Akt pathway in human colon cancer cells.

Sphingolipids have critical functions as signaling molecules. In particular, ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) 3The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; l-OHP, oxaliplatin (cis-(oxalato(1R,2R-cyclohexanediamine)platinum); SPHK, sphingosine kinase; SMase, sphingomyelinase; nSMase, neutral sphingomyelinase; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; SKI, sphingosine kinase inhibitor (2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl) thiazole); MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mitogen-activated protein kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl. are involved in regulating cell responses such as proliferation and apoptosis (1Taha T.A.

Ceramide, located at the central position of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, is both the precursor and degradation product of sphingomyelin. Ceramide acts as a signaling molecule to activate a variety of signaling cascades that ultimately lead to cell responses such as apoptosis, growth arrest, cell differentiation, and various aspects of inflammation (5Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2002; 1585: 114-125Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is catalyzed by sphingomyelinases (SMases) yielding ceramide and phosphorylcholine. To date, several SMase activities have been identified that can be classified in two main groups, the acidic and neutral forms. Ceramide can also be formed from sphinganine by ceramide synthase. This de novo synthesis of ceramide requires hours of stress exposure and can be induced by several factors including tumor necrosis factor-α, hypoxia, and various chemotherapeutics (6Linn S.C. Kim H.S. Keane E.M. Andrai L.M. Wang E. Merrill Jr. A.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans... 2001; 29: 831-835Google Scholar). Ceramide is also produced by the salvage pathway. Ceramide is involved in the activation of both downstream and upstream caspases (7Takeda Y. Tashima M. Takahashi A. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 10654-10660Google Scholar). Ceramide also triggers the activation of various protein kinase cascades, including the classical MAPK/ERK cascade (8Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 14572-14575Google Scholar) and the more recently discovered stress-activated protein kinases of the SAPK/JNK subfamily (9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature.. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar). Another signaling pathway involved in the regulation of an apoptosis cell response that may be affected by ceramide is the survival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt cascade (10Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 275: 13330-13335Google Scholar). On the other hand, the sphingolipid S1P acts as a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types (11Spiegel S. Milstein S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2003; 4: 397-407Google Scholar, 12Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cancer Cell.. 2006; 9: 148-150Google Scholar), mainly involving specific cell surface S1P receptors (13Hla T. Pharmacol. Res... 2003; 47: 401-407Google Scholar) that belong to the class of G protein-coupled receptors (S1P(1,2,3,4,5)) (14Young N. van Brocklyn J.R. Scientific World Journal.. 2006; 6: 946-966Google Scholar). S1P prevents apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, Fas, and ceramide, among others. A critical factor regulating the availability of S1P is the activity of sphingosine kinase (SPHK), which phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P and is thought to act as an oncogene in tumorigenesis (12Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cancer Cell.. 2006; 9: 148-150Google Scholar, 13Hla T. Pharmacol. Res... 2003; 47: 401-407Google Scholar, 15Hait N.C. Oskeritzian C.A. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1758: 2016-2026Google Scholar). Two SPHK subtypes have been identified, SPHK1 and SPHK2. SPHK1 activity is stimulated by various growth factors and cytokines (15Hait N.C. Oskeritzian C.A. Paugh S.W. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1758: 2016-2026Google Scholar), whereas the activation mechanism of SPHK2 is unclear, although epidermal growth factor enhances SPHK2 activity in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (16Hait N.C. Sarkar S. Le Stunff H. Ikami A. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 29462-29469Google Scholar).

Wargovich M.J. Reddy B.S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Zhou D. FASEB J... 2006; 20: 386-388Google Scholar). On the other hand, SPHK2 has been reported to suppress growth and enhance apoptosis (18Liu H. Toman R.E. Goparaju S. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 40330-40336Google Scholar). However, the role of endogenous SPHK2 has not been clearly defined, as down-regulation of SPHK2 in some cancer cells unexpectedly results in cell growth inhibition (19Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol... 2005; 64: 695-705Google Scholar). These two lipids, ceramide and S1P, together form a cellular ""rheostat"" regulating the balance between cell growth and cell death. SPHK1 is up-regulated in a variety of tumors (17Kawamori T.

Morse M.A. Rudiger H.A. Sindram D. Hannun Y.A. Clavien P.A. Cancer Res... 2001; 61: 1233-1240Google Scholar). Directing the balance in favor of ceramide may thus have beneficial effects in cancer therapy. Because of their opposing cellular functions, the balance between ceramide and S1P appears to be a critical determinant of cell death and proliferation and may therefore be an important factor to consider in therapeutic strategies against tumor progression (12Milstien S. Spiegel S. Cancer Cell.. 2006; 9: 148-150Google Scholar, 21Pchejetski D. Golzio M. Bonhoure E. Calvet C. Doumerc N. Garcia V. Mazerolles C. Rischmann P. Teissie J. Malavaud B. Cuvillier O.

Our previous studies have shown that prostate cancer cells with high SPHK1 activity are resistant to the anticancer drug camptothecin (24Akao Y. Banno Y. Nakagawa Y. Hasegawa N. Kim T.-J. Murate T. Igarashi Y. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2006; 342: 1284-1290Google Scholar), and leukemia cells with high SPHK1 activity are resistant to daunorubicin (25Sobue S. Iwasaki T.

In the present study, therefore, we compared ceramide levels and SPHK isozymes activity in drug-sensitive and -resistant colon cancer cells. Nine colon cancer cell lines had various levels of SPHK1 and SPHK2 activities. Colon cancer cells with high SPHK1 and SPHK2 expression were resistant to oxaliplatin (l-OHP) compared with those with low SPHK isozymes expression. Their high activities modulated the l-OHP-induced increase in ceramide, and inhibition of both SPHK isozymes increased ceramide levels, rendering the colon cancer cells sensitive to l-OHP. The regulation of sensitivity to anticancer drugs by the sphingolipid rheostat through Akt activation and p53 expression in the two types of colon cancer cells is discussed. Materials—Oxaliplatin, myriocin, and fumonisin B1 were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ser473-phosphorylated Akt, Akt, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and Bax were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p21, nSMase2, and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-human SPHK1 and SPHK2 antibodies were prepared as described previously (27Koda M. Murate T. Koizumi K. Igarashi Y. Nozawa Y. Banno Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2005; 1733: 101-110Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego). 2-(p-Hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl) thiazole, a non-ATP competitive sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SKI), and GW4869, a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor, were purchased from Merck. The Caspase-3/7 assay kit (APO-One) was from Promega (Madison, WI). [choline-methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin and adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate were from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Lines and Cell Viability Measurement—Human colon cancer cell lines (COLO320DM, DLD1, HCT15, SW480, LoVo, HCT116, LS174T, RKO, CaCo2), purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For cell viability measurement, cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cell viability of drug-treated and mock-treated cells was then analyzed for 48 h by standard MTT assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Silencing of Sphingosine Kinase1, Sphingosine Kinase2, and Neutral Sphingomyelinase2—The siRNAs of human SPHK1, SPHK2, and nSMase2 were obtained from Sigma Genosys (Hokkaido, Japan) as described previously (26Sobue S. Nemoto S. Murakami M. Ito H. Kimura A. Gao S. Furuhata A. Takagi A. Kojima T. Nakamura M. Ito Y. Suzuki M. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Murate T. Int. J. Hematol... 2008; 87: 266-275Google Scholar). Scrambled siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (GE Healthcare). Sequences for the SPHK-specific siRNAs are as follows: SPHK1(1), 5′-GGGCAAGGCCUUGCAGCUC-3′ and 5′-GAGCUGCAAGGCCUUGCCC-3′; SPHK1(2), 5′-GGCUGAAAUCUCCUUCACG-3′ and 5′-CGUGAAGGAGAUUUCAGCC-3′; and SPHK2(1), 5′-GGGUAGUGCCUGAUCAAUG-3′ and 5′-CAUUGAUCAGGCACUACCC-3′; SPHK2(2), 5′-GCUGGGCUGUCCUUCAACCU-3′ and 5′-AGGUUGAAGGACAGCCCAGC-3′. Sequences for nSMase2-specific siRNA are 5′-AAUGCUACUGGCUGGUGGACC-3′ and 5′-GGUCCACCAGCCAGUAGCAUU-3′. Scrambled siRNA or siRNAs of SPHK1s and SPHK2s (50 nm) and nSMase2 (100 nm) were transfected to the tumor cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Changes in SPHK1, SPHK2, and nSMase2 expression were confirmed by Western blotting using anti-human SPHK1, anti-human SPHK2, and anti-human nSMase2 antibodies and by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed according to the method reported previously (25Sobue S. Iwasaki T. Sugisaki C. Nagata A. Kikuchi R. Murakami M. Takagi A. Kojima T. Banno Y. Akao Y. Nozawa Y. Kannagi R. Suzuki M. Abe A. Naoe T. Murate T. Leukemia (Basingstoke).. 2006; 20: 2042-2046Google Scholar). The relative mRNA level was expressed as the ratio of the respective mRNA divided by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium cholate, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4). The total cell lysate (10–30 μg of protein) was subjected to electrophoresis on 10%-13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Danvers, MA). The membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin. Expression of SPHK1, SPHK2, phosphorylated-Akt, total Akt, p53, p21, Bax, and PARP was measured by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Anti-β-actin antibody was used as the loading control. After repeated washes, bound antibodies were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Protein band density was determined with a densitometer (Atto Densitograph, version 2.5; Atto, Ltd., Tokyo). Sphingosine Kinase Enzyme Activity—The activity of the two SPHK isoforms, SPHK1 and SPHK2, was measured separately, as described previously (26Sobue S. Nemoto S. Murakami M. Ito H. Kimura A. Gao S. Furuhata A. Takagi A. Kojima T. Nakamura M. Ito Y. Suzuki M. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Murate T. Int. J. Hematol... 2008; 87: 266-275Google Scholar). SPHK activity was determined either in the presence of 0.25% Triton X-100 (SPHK1) or in 1 m KCl (SPHK2). SPHK1 activity was examined in the presence of 50 μm sphingosine and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 1 mm) containing 10 mm MgCl2 in 0.25% Triton X-100, which inhibits SPHK2 (26Sobue S. Nemoto S. Murakami M. Ito H. Kimura A. Gao S. Furuhata A. Takagi A. Kojima T. Nakamura M. Ito Y. Suzuki M. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Murate T. Int. J. Hematol... 2008; 87: 266-275Google Scholar). SPHK2 activity was determined with sphingosine added as a complex with 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and [γ-32P]ATP containing 10 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 1 m KCl, conditions in which SPHK2 activity is optimal and SPHK1 activity is strongly inhibited. Labeled S1P was extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel G60 with 1-butanol/acetic acid/H2O (3:1:1) as the solvent. The spot of S1P on the thin layer chromatography plate was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a densitometer. The activity was expressed as pmol/min/mg protein. Sphingomyelinase Activity Assay—Acid and neutral SMase activities were measured as described previously (7Takeda Y. Tashima M. Takahashi A. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 10654-10660Google Scholar). Caspase Activity Assay—Caspase-3 and -7 activities were measured using an Apo-One™ homogenous caspase-3/7 assay kit (Promega). Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Briefly, the cells were plated at 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with new medium with or without Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD; 100 μm) and preincubated for 1 h before treatment with 5 μg/ml l-OHP. After incubation for the indicated time, the caspase-Glo 3/7 reagents were added to the wells followed by measurements of luminescence 1 h later with a plate-reading luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Lipid Extraction and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)Analysis of S1P and Ceramides—Colon cancer cells were lysed by sonication in the lysis buffer. Cellular lipids were extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure under acidic conditions with 0.1 m HCl. C6-ceramide (50 ng) and C17-S1P (50 ng) (Avanti Polar Lipid, Inc., Alabaster, AL), used as internal standards, were added during the lipid extraction step. The lipid extracts were dissolved in 20% acetonitrile (100 μl) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to combined LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using a Waters 2695 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Milford, MA) coupled to a Micromass Quattromicro™ API triple-quadrapole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) as described previously (26Sobue S. Nemoto S. Murakami M. Ito H. Kimura A. Gao S. Furuhata A. Takagi A. Kojima T. Nakamura M. Ito Y. Suzuki M. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Murate T. Int. J. Hematol... 2008; 87: 266-275Google Scholar). Peak areas for all components were integrated automatically using Masslynx™ NT 4.0 software (Micromass). Losses were accounted for by dividing each sphingolipid peak area by the percent recovery of the C6-ceramide or C17-S1P internal standard in each sample. Each loss-adjusted sphingolipid peak area was converted into a concentration using a loss-adjusted standard curve for each sphingolipid, which was linear in the relevant range. Ceramide Synthase Activity Assay—The synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine was measured by LC-MS/MS analysis using C17 backbone sphingosine as described previously (28Spassieva S. Bielawski J. Anelli V. Obeid M. Methods in Enzymol... 2007; 434: 232-241Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.3 mg of C17 backbone sphingosine was evaporated and sonicated in the buffer (40 μl) containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES/HCl, pH 7.5. The cell lysate (40 μg) and 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA were added in the substrate buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by pipetting the reaction mixture into the extraction solvent (100 μl of chloroform and methanol (1:1, v:v)). The lipids were extracted and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis as described previously (29Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods (Amst.).. 2006; 39: 82-91Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Microsoft Excel and its affiliated software were used to calculate the correlation index. The statistical significance was analyzed by either Student's t test or one-way factorial analysis of variance and multiple comparison test (Fisher's method) using StatView version 5 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Relationship between Sphingosine Kinase Activity and Anticancer Drug Sensitivity of Colon Cancer Cells—SPHK1 is an anti-apoptotic enzyme, and the other SPHK isoform, SPHK2, has been reported to be pro-apoptotic (16Hait N.C. Sarkar S. Le Stunff H. Ikami A. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 29462-29469Google Scholar). SPHK1 and SPHK2 activities were determined separately in nine human colon cancer cell lines. Their activities differed among the nine colon cancer cell lines (supplemental Table 1). Among these cell lines, RKO cells exhibited the highest SPHK1 and SPHK2 activities, whereas HCT116 cells exhibited the lowest activities, and LoVo cells showed the intermediate activities (Fig. 1A). SPHK1 and SPHK2 activities in RKO cells were ∼20 and 3 times higher than those in HCT116 and LoVo cells, respectively. Their protein expression levels were higher in RKO cells than in HCT116 and LoVo cells, which corresponded to their activity levels (Fig. 1B). We then examined sensitivity to an anticancer drug, l-OHP, in the three cell lines. HCT116 cells were the most sensitive to l-OHP (IC50 was 7.5 ± 0.5 μg/ml), and RKO cells were the least sensitive to l-OHP (IC50 = 71.2 ± 3.4 μg/ml); LoVo cells showed intermediate sensitivity (IC50 = 19.3 ± 5.4 μg/ml) (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the activities and protein expressions of these SPHK isoforms may be related to chemosensitivity for l-OHP. RKO cells with higher SPHK activity and expression were much less sensitive (resistant) to the drug compared with HCT116 cells with lower SPHK activity and expression, which were sensitive to the drug. These results prompted us to investigate further how SPHK activity regulates chemosensitivity in these cells. Changes in Cellular Levels of Ceramides after l-OHP Treatment—Changes in C16-ceramide, C18-ceramide, and C24-ceramide levels have been involved in apoptosis of various cancer cells (30Murate T. Suzuki M. Hattori M. Takagi A. Kojima T. Tanizawa T. Asano H. Hotta T. Saito H. Yoshida S. Tamiya-Koizumi K. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 9936-9943Google Scholar, 31Kobasi S. Sekal C.E. Sundararaj K. Spassieva S. Bielawski J. Osta W. Day T.A. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 44311-44319Google Scholar-32Osawa Y. Uchinami H. Bielawski J. Schwabe R.F. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 27879-27887Google Scholar). To examine whether ceramide synthesis/metabolism is involved in the mechanism of sensitivity to l-OHP, LC-MS/MS was used to measure endogenous ceramide levels in HCT116, LoVo, and RKO cells, with or without l-OHP treatment. Endogenous ceramide levels and ceramide N-acyl chain compositions were not significantly different among these three cell lines, showing abundant C16-, C24-, and C24: 1-ceramide species and lower levels of C18- and C22-ceramides, but no detectable C20-ceramide (supplemental Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis of these molecular species in HCT116 cells treated with l-OHP revealed that the levels of both C24- and C24:1-ceramides (2.7- and 2.0-fold, respectively) increased transiently and markedly, and C16-ceramide (2.0-fold after 48 h) showed a gradual increase (Fig. 2A). Changes in C18- or C22-ceramide were modest (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of RKO cells with l-OHP (5 μg/ml) did not induce significant changes in any of the ceramide species. No cell death was observed at this l-OHP concentration in RKO cells. The treatment of LoVo cells with l-OHP (5 μg/ml) for 12 h induced increases in the levels of C16-, C24- and C24:1-ceramides, which were smaller than those of HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the changes in these endogenous ceramide levels are associated with l-OHP sensitivity. To validate whether the changes in endogenous ceramide levels are due to hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, we measured acid and neutral SMase activities in both HCT116 and RKO cell lines after various durations of l-OHP (5 μg/ml) treatment. Acid SMase activity did not change significantly during l-OHP treatment in either cell line (Fig. 2B). In contrast, however, neutral SMase activity was markedly increased (maximum: 3-fold at 12 h) in the l-OHP-sensitive HCT116 cells but not in the resistant RKO cells. These findings suggested that the increased ceramide generation was due to neutral SMase-catalyzed hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. Modulation of Ceramide Generation by Neutral Sphingomyelinase Inhibitor and Its Effect on l-OHP-induced Apoptosis in HCT116 Cells—l-OHP-sensitive HCT116 cells pretreated with 10 μm GW4869, a neutral SMase inhibitor, significantly reduced the l-OHP-induced accumulation of C16-, C24-, and C24:1-ceramides (Fig. 3A). Caspase-3/7 activity increased in response to l-OHP (5 μg/ml for 24 h) but was completely abolished by pretreatment of the cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (Fig. 3B). The l-OHP treatment-induced increase in caspase-3/7 activity was suppressed by GW4869 pretreatment but not by the de novo ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1. l-OHP treatment of HCT116 cells induced PARP cleavage, which was suppressed by Z-VAD and GW4869, compatible with the inhibitory profile of caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 3C). Fumonisin B1 did not affect l-OHP-induced PARP cleavage. The l-OHP-induced cytotoxicity of HCT116 cells was significantly reduced by treatment with Z-VAD and GW4869 but not fumonisin B1 (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that ceramide generation from sphingomyelin hydrolysis induced by neutral SMase was involved in the l-OHP-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of HCT116 cells. Effects of Inhibition of SPHK on l-OHP Sensitivity of RKO Cells and Caspase Activity in RKO Cells—Modulation of the sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme affects chemosensitivity (20French K.J.

Mazerolles C. Rischmann P. Teissie J. Malavaud B. Cuvillier O. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 11667-11675Google Scholar), and SPHK1 activity inversely correlates with ceramide levels (1Taha T.A. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 2006; 39: 113-131Google Scholar, 3Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 147: 545-558Google Scholar). Therefore, we used an SPHK inhibitor, SKI, to investigate how SPHK activity affects l-OHP sensitivity in the resistant RKO cells. We examined the specificity of SKI for SPHK1 and SPHK2 activities. Treatment of RKO cells with SKI (3 μm) inhibited both SPHK1 and SPHK2 activity by ∼50% (Fig. 4A), indicating a similar level of inhibitory potency for the two SPHK isozymes. Under these conditions, the effect of SKI was examined on l-OHP-induced ceramide accumulation in RKO cells. When RKO cells were pretreated with SKI, l-OHP treatment induced increases in the levels of C16-ceramide but not C24:1-ceramide (Fig. 4B). Moreover, only the combined treatment with SKI and l-OHP stimulated PARP degradation in RKO cells (Fig. 4C); SKI (3 μm) alone had no effect on ceramide formation and PARP degradation. l-OHP-induced cell cytotoxicity was significantly increased in the presence of SKI (3 μm) in RKO cells (IC50 = 8.9 ± 1.3 μg/ml; Fig. 4D). These results indicated that inhibition of SPHK activity enhanced the ceramide (C16) level and l-OHP sensitivity in the resistant RKO cells. As SPHK inhibition was shown here to increase ceramide accumulation, we examined its mechanism. RKO cells were pretreated with SKI (3 μm) or the inhibitors of enzymes involving de novo ceramide generation: myriocin (10 μm) for serine palmitoyltransferase and fu"

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) form tetrameric calcium channels in ER membranes, whose primary role is to control the release of ER calcium stores, but whose levels are also regulated, in an activation-dependent manner, by the ERAD pathway. Here we report that the ER membrane protein SPFH1 and its homolog SPFH2 form a heteromeric ∼2 MDa complex that binds to IP3R tetramers immediately after their activation and is required for their processing. The complex is ring-shaped (diameter ∼250Å), and RNA interference-mediated depletion of SPFH1 and SPFH2 blocks IP3R polyubiquitination and degradation.

Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2008; 9: 944-957Google Scholar). Intriguingly, several ER-resident proteins that are stable under normal conditions are also processed by the ERAD pathway. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA-reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in sterol synthesis, is targeted for ERAD when sterols are in excess (2DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Res... 2008; 18: 609-621Google Scholar), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs), which form tetrameric, IP3- and Ca2+-gated Ca2+ channels in mammalian ER membranes (3Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.D. Physiol. Rev... 2007; 87: 593-658Google Scholar), are degraded by ERAD when persistently activated (4Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci... 2004; 25: 35-41Google Scholar). ERAD substrates appear to be processed via four steps: recognition, retrotranslocation, polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Recognition can be prompted in various ways, either by generic signals (e.g. surface-exposed hydrophobic patches) or by specific recognition factors (e.g. Insigs, which target mammalian 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA-reductase for ERAD) (2DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Res... 2008; 18: 609-621Google Scholar, 5Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2008; 9: 679-689Google Scholar). Following recognition, ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated to the cytosol through an as yet unidentified pore, apparently in concert with the cytosolic AAA ATPase p97, which couples ATP hydrolysis to extraction (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol... 2003; 162: 71-84Google Scholar). Once exposed to the cytosol, substrates are polyubiquitinated. E2s (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes) and E3s (ubiquitin-protein ligases) impart selectivity to substrate ubiquitination, and several are known to be involved in the ERAD pathway, including the E2s Ubc6 and Ubc7, and the E3s yeast Hrd1p and mammalian Hrd1 and Gp78 (7Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol... 2007; 18: 770-779Google Scholar). Finally, polyubiquitinated substrates are delivered to the 26 S proteasome either by shuttle proteins that bind both ubiquitin and the 19 S regulatory cap of the proteasome (8Raasi S. Wolf D.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol... 2007; 18: 780-791Google Scholar), or by directly interacting with intrinsic subunits of the 19 S cap that contain ubiquitin-binding motifs (9Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I. Nature.. 2008; 453: 481-488Google Scholar). It appears that some of the aforementioned steps are integrated, because multiprotein complexes that can carry out more than one step are being defined. For example, a complex centered around Hrd1 contains proteins that recognize, polyubiquitinate, and perhaps even retrotranslocate ERAD substrates (10Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A.

IP3Rs participate in a wide range of cellular processes, e.g. fertilization, secretion, apoptosis, and development (3Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.D. Physiol. Rev... 2007; 87: 593-658Google Scholar). The three mammalian IP3R subtypes (IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3) are each ∼2700 amino acids in length, are tethered to the ER membrane by 6 transmembrane (TM) domains, assemble into homo- and heterotetramers, and are expressed in varying proportions in different tissues (3Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.D. Physiol. Rev... 2007; 87: 593-658Google Scholar). They are activated by cell surface receptors that generate IP3, with binding of IP3 and the co-agonist Ca2+ inducing a conformational change that causes channel opening (3Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.D. Physiol. Rev... 2007; 87: 593-658Google Scholar). Because persistent activation of IP3Rs leads to their degradation, this conformational change also likely serves as a recognition signal for ERAD (4Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci... 2004; 25: 35-41Google Scholar). This feature makes IP3Rs particularly valuable for studying ERAD, because activation almost instantaneously converts them from stable proteins into ERAD substrates. Thus, we have identified several mediators of IP3R ERAD, notably mammalian Ubc7 (14Webster J.M. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 38238-38246Google Scholar), the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex (15Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 34530-34537Google Scholar), and most recently, SPFH2 (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar). SPFH2, also known as erlin-2 (17Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci... 2006; 119: 3149-3160Google Scholar), belongs to a family of ∼100 mammalian proteins (“SPFH proteins”) that contain an ""SPFH"" domain, an ∼250-amino acid motif named because of minor sequence similarities in the proteins stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflC/K (18Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M. Trends Cell Biol... 2007; 17: 394-402Google Scholar). SPFH proteins tend to have similar properties, including localization to cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) and assembly into large oligomeric structures (18Browman D.T. Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M. Trends Cell Biol... 2007; 17: 394-402Google Scholar). However, no universal function has yet been attributed to the SPFH domain, and SPFH proteins have distinct subcellular localizations and roles. For example, stomatin, a plasma membrane protein, binds to and regulates acid-sensing ion channels (19Price M.P. Thompson R.J. Eshcol J.O. Wemmie J.A. Benson C.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 53886-53891Google Scholar), and prohibitins-1 and -2 are found primarily in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they carry out a variety of functions (20Merkwirth C. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2009; 1793: 27-32Google Scholar). Intriguingly, two plasma membrane SPFH proteins, MEC-2 from Caenorhabditis elegans and the mammalian stomatin-like protein, podocin, directly bind cholesterol via their SPFH domains, and it is likely that all SPFH proteins have this property (21Huber T.B. Schermer B. Müller R.U. Höhne M. Bartram M. Calixto A. Hagmann H. Reinhardt C. Koos F. Kunzelmann K. Shirokova E. Krautwurst D. Harteneck C. Simons M. Pavenstädt H. Kerjaschki D. Thiele C. Walz G. Chalfie M. Benzing T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 17079-17086Google Scholar). Binding to cholesterol undoubtedly relates to the localization of SPFH proteins in DRMs and suggests that SPFH proteins either recruit cholesterol to membrane microdomains or are restricted by cholesterol to DRMs, where they play other roles. Although the cholesterol content of intracellular membranes is minimal (22Prinz W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol... 2002; 13: 197-203Google Scholar), SPFH2 and a closely related protein, SPFH1, also known as erlin-1, localize to putative ER-derived DRMs in a cholesterol-dependent manner (17Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci... 2006; 119: 3149-3160Google Scholar). Here, we report that SPFH1 and SPFH2 form an ∼2-MDa ER membrane complex that binds to IP3Rs immediately following their activation and is required for their ERAD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of endogenous SPFH1/2 complexes reveals a double ring-shaped structure with an overall diameter of ∼250 Å. We propose that the SPFH1/2 complex plays a role in the recognition and targeting of IP3Rs and perhaps other substrates for ERAD. Materials—αT3-1, HeLa, and Rat-1 cells were cultured as described (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar). Already available antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R1 (23Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 11678-11683Google Scholar), anti-Hrd1, anti-SPFH2 (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar), and anti-α-transaldolase (a kind gift from Dr. A. Perl, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY); mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin clone FK2 (Bio-Mol International), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope clone HA11 (Covance), anti-p97 (Research Diagnostics, Inc.), anti-FLAG epitope clone M5 (Sigma), anti-IP3R3 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-human SPFH1 (a kind gift from Dr. S. M. Robbins, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta); rat monoclonal anti-grp94 (Stress-Gen); and horseradish peroxidase- and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SPFH1 (which recognizes mouse and rat but not human SPFH1) and anti-FLAG were generated against synthetic peptides corresponding to the rodent SPFH1 C terminus (EPSGESPIQNKENAG) and the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), respectively, and were affinity purified as described (23Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 11678-11683Google Scholar). Coomassie G-250, digitonin, Fura2-AM, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), hygromycin B, N-ethylmaleimide, Polybrene, protease inhibitors, puromycin, Triton X-100, and urea were purchased from Sigma; endothelin 1 (ET1) was from Calbiochem; endoglycosidase H was from New England Biolabs; bisacrylamide, dithiothreitol, Precision Plus™ Protein standards, and SDS were from Bio-Rad; doxycycline was from Clontech; Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Biosciences; Lipofectamine 2000 and NativeMark Unstained Protein Standard were from Invitrogen; and bortezomib (PS-341) was a kind gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and SPFH1/2 Complex Immunopurification—Cells grown in monolayer were harvested with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 or 1% CHAPS, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. When IP3R polyubiquitination was to be measured, cells were harvested with dithiothreitol-free lysis buffer, and 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide was added to the lysates for 1 min, followed by 5 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To immunoprecipitate specific proteins, clarified lysates were incubated with antisera and Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 4–16 h at 4 °C, and washed thoroughly with lysis buffer. To elute immunopurified SPFH1/2 complexes for subsequent blue native (BN)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, anti-SPFH1 or anti-SPFH2 immunoprecipitates in 1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer were incubated with 100 μg/ml of SPFH1 or SPFH2 peptide antigens used to generate antisera for 48–72 h at 4 °C. To dissociate SPFH1/2 complexes from IP3R1, anti-IP3R1 immunoprecipitates in 1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C, which allowed for dissociation of the majority of the co-purifying SPFH1/2 complexes. To elute immunopurified SPFH1/2 complexes for subsequent TEM, anti-SPFH1 immunoprecipitates prepared in 1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer were washed and then incubated in either detergent-free lysis buffer or 0.1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer with 100 μg/ml SPFH1 peptide for 72 h at 4 °C. Sample Preparation, PAGE, Immunoblotting, and Mass Spectral Analysis—For SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled in gel loading buffer (24Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Biochem. J... 1999; 339: 453-461Google Scholar) for 3 min prior to loading. For BN-PAGE, samples prepared in NativePAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) were supplemented with 0.25% Coomassie G-250 and loaded onto 3–12 or 4–16% gels and run at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue, or transferred to nitrocellulose (for SDS-PAGE) or polyvinylidene fluoride (for BN-PAGE) membranes and probed. Immunoreactivity was detected using Pierce chemiluminescence substrates and a Genegnome Imager (Syngene Bio Imaging). To identify proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to in-gel trypsinization and mass spectral analysis at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). The MS-Fit data base (University of California San Francisco Mass Spectrometry Facility) was used to provide possible identities for the peptides generated from each gel band. Plasmids and Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Constructs—To make deletion and truncation mutants, the sequence encoding mouse SPFH2-HA in pcDNA3 (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar) was mutated by inverse PCR and blunt-end ligated. An expressed sequence tag containing mouse SPFH1 cDNA was purchased from ATCC (clone BC011220), and a FLAG or HA epitope sequence was fused to the 3′ end of the open reading frame and inserted into pcDNA3 to generate SPFH1-FLAG or SPFH1-HA. SPFH1-Flag-N108Q was generated using the Stratagene QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit. cDNAs encoding SPFH1, SPFH2, SPFH1-HA, SPFH2-HA, and SPFH2-HA mutants were also inserted into the pQCXIH vector (BD Biosciences) to generate cDNA-containing retroviruses. Sequences encoding shRNAs were inserted into 6OH1O-pSUPER.retro.puro (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar) such that short interfering RNAs were generated in cells. The short interfering RNA-encoding sequences were as follows: Random (actgtcacaagtacctaca), SPFH1si4 (gtaccaggccattgcttct), and SPFH2si6 (gtacaaggctattgcttcc). Retrovirus-mediated RNA Interference and cDNA Expression in Rat-1 Cells—Retroviruses containing either shRNA-encoding 6OH1O-pSUPER.retro.puro vectors or cDNA-encoding pQCXIH vectors were generated in HEK293T cells, titered, and Rat-1 cells stably expressing tTS were transduced as previously described (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar). To deplete either SPFH1 or SPFH2, cells were incubated with SPFH1si4- or SPFH2si6-encoding retrovirus twice, and control cells for these ""single knockdown"" cells were twice incubated with Random shRNA-encoding virus and named ""Random-s."" To deplete both SPFH1 and SPFH2, SPFH2 knockdown cells were incubated twice with SPFH1si4-encoding retrovirus, and control cells for these ""double knockdown"" cells were generated by incubating Random-s cells with Random shRNA-encoding retrovirus two more times and were named ""Random-d."" shRNA expression was induced by treating virally transduced cells with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h, followed by selection of shRNA-expressing cells with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin for an additional 24–48 h. For stable cDNA expression, Rat-1 cells were transduced with pQCXIH-containing retrovirus for ∼8 h and supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene, followed by selection of transduced cells with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B for 8 days. TEM—SPFH1/2 complexes eluted in the absence of detergent were used without further processing, whereas complexes eluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 were first subjected to 15–50% glycerol density gradient centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 6 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (SPFH1/2 complexes were typically found in the 35–45% fractions). 5 μl of SPFH1/2 complex-containing samples were applied to glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grids were incubated for 1 min at room temperature or for >1 h at 4 °C, grids were washed once with water, and were finally stained for 1 min with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were visualized using a 200 kV transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM-2100) and images were recorded under minimum dose conditions using a 4096 × 4096 pixel CCD camera (TVIPS F415MP) at a magnification of ×40,000 with an underfocus of ∼1500 nm. The pixel size on the specimen level was calibrated to be 2.82 Å using catalase crystals as a standard. CCD frames were displayed with the Boxer program in the EMAN package (25Lüdtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol... 1999; 128: 82-97Google Scholar), and single molecule images were selected manually. Data sets of ∼3800 particles were collected for both the detergent-free and detergent-containing samples. All subsequent image analysis was performed with the Imagic 5 software package (26van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol... 1996; 116: 17-24Google Scholar). The data sets were normalized, band-pass filtered to remove high (>0.14 Å–1) and low (<0.0066 Å–1) spatial frequencies, and a circular mask was applied. The data sets were treated by reference free alignment (27Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J... 1993; 12: 1303-1309Google Scholar), and the best averages were used as references for multireference alignment as implemented in Imagic 5. At this stage, very similar projection averages were obtained for both data sets. After several rounds of multireference alignment, the data set of the purified sample was sorted into 64 classes and angles were determined for 24 of the best averages using the Imagic command C1 start-up/new projection. The resulting three-dimensional model was forward-projected along 48 directions and the resulting images served as references for a new round of multireference alignment. The projection matching refinement was iterated until no further improvement was observed, using 83 references in the final alignment. At this stage, the two data sets were combined and subjected to two more rounds of refinement by projection matching using 131 references for the final alignment. The resolution of the final model was estimated via the Fourier shell correlation method using 0.5 as cut-off (28Böttcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature.. 1997; 386: 88-91Google Scholar). For surface display, the final model was masked using the Imagic command ""threed-automatic-masking"" using standard parameters and filtered to remove spatial frequencies above 0.05 Å–1. The model was displayed using Chimera (29Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem... 2004; 25: 1605-1612Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least once, and representative images of gels or micrographs are shown. Quantitated data are graphed as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments, with paired Student's t test used to obtain p values. SPFH1 and SPFH2 Co-purify with Activated IP3Rs—We reported previously that SPFH2 is the most abundant protein that co-immunoprecipitates with activated IP3Rs (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained anti-IP3R1 immunoprecipitates from control and GnRH-stimulated αT3-1 cells revealed that in addition to the SPFH2 band at an apparent molecular mass of ∼43 kDa, a fainter band at ∼41 kDa was also visible under stimulated conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Mass spectral analysis identified the ∼41-kDa protein as SPFH1, a close homolog of SPFH2, and we validated the association of SPFH1 and SPFH2 with activated IP3R1 using antisera specific for each protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–6). Because SPFH2 was shown to associate with IP3Rs immediately following their activation (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar), we tested whether SPFH1 associated in a similar manner. As shown in Fig. 1B, the peak association of SPFH1 and SPFH2 with IP3R1 in GnRH-stimulated αT3-1 cells occurred at 3 min, prior to peak IP3R1 polyubiquitination and the association of p97, which binds to ERAD substrates at least in part via attached polyubiquitin chains (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol... 2003; 162: 71-84Google Scholar). Because association of SPFH1 and SPFH2 precedes substantial IP3R1 polyubiquitination, their interaction with activated IP3Rs is not likely dependent on polyubiquitin chain formation. Indeed, in αT3-1 cells preincubated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to deplete intracellular free ubiquitin (30Xu Q. Farah M. Webster J.M. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Mol. Cancer Ther... 2004; 3: 1263-1269Google Scholar), the rate of GnRH-induced IP3R1 polyubiquitination was slowed, but the association of SPFH2 (Fig. 1C) and SPFH1 (not shown) with activated IP3R1 was unaffected. Thus, SPFH1 and SPFH2 bind to activated IP3R1 prior to and independently of IP3R1 polyubiquitination. Molecular Properties of SPFH1 and SPFH2—SPFH1 and SPFH2 are very closely related proteins, sharing ∼70% identity and ∼80% similarity at the amino acid level (supplemental Fig. S1A and Fig. 4A). Their SPFH domains, which account for ∼80% of each protein (residues 27–300 in SPFH1 and 25–298 in SPFH2), share ∼90% identity. In addition to the SPFH domain, SPFH1 and SPFH2 contain several identifiable features: a hydrophobic stretch at their N termini (residues 6–26 in SPFH1 and 4–24 in SPFH2), an N-linked glycosylation site (Asn108 in SPFH1 and Asn106 in SPFH2), and an α-helical stretch predicted to form coiled-coil motifs (residues 179–276 in SPFH1 and 177–274 in SPFH2). The alignment in supplemental Fig. S1A depicts the secondary structure predictions for SPFH1 and SPFH2, emphasizing their similarities. Immunofluorescence microscopy of endogenous SPFH1 and SPFH2 showed that both proteins co-localize with DsRed2-ER (Fig. 2A), suggestive of an ER localization for these proteins (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar, 17Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci... 2006; 119: 3149-3160Google Scholar). SPFH1, like SPFH2 (16Pearce M.M.P. Wang Y. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20104-20115Google Scholar), was microsome-associated and, like other integral membrane proteins (SPFH2, IP3R1, and Hrd1), was only solubilized by detergents (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, IP3R1, SPFH1, and SPFH2 were only partially solubilized by Triton X-100 (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), consistent with the previously reported association of these proteins with DRMs (17Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci... 2006; 119: 3149-3160Google Scholar, 31Weerth S.H. Holtzclaw L.A. Russell J.T. Cell Calcium.. 2007; 41: 155-167Google Scholar). Similar to SPFH2, SPFH1 was resistant to Proteinase K in cells permeabilized with digitonin, but was susceptible in cells treated with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the majority of SPFH1 mass is located in the ER lumen. Endogenous SPFH1 and exogenous FLAG-tagged SPFH1 (SPFH1-FLAG) were sensitive to endoglycosidase H unless asparagine 108 was mutated to glutamine (Fig. 2D), indicating that SPFH1, like SPFH2, is glycosylated. SPFH1 and SPFH2 are predicted to contain a TM domain at their N termini, and Edman degradation of endogenous SPFH1 and SPFH2 confirmed that these hydrophobic regions are not cleaved signal sequences (not shown). Overall, these data indicate that like SPFH2, SPFH1 is a type II membrane protein anchored to the ER membrane by its N terminus and with the rest of the protein, including an N-linked glycosylation site, protruding into the ER lumen (supplemental Fig. S1B). SPFH1 and SPFH2 Form a Complex That Is >1 MDa in Size—Because SPFH1 and SPFH2 co-purify with activated IP3Rs with essentially identical kinetics, we wondered whether they might be physically associated. To test this possibility, we examined Coomassie Blue-stained anti-SPFH1 or anti-SPFH2 immunoprecipitates from αT3-1 cells and observed ∼41- and ∼43-kDa bands, in an ∼1:2 ratio, in both immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblots confirmed that these protein bands corresponded to SPFH1 and SPFH2, respectively (Fig. 3A, lower panels), and either immunoprecipitation depleted both proteins from cell lysates (Fig. 3B). Thus, SPFH1 and SPFH2 form a complex. Interestingly, no other protein bands were detectable in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A), indicating that the SPFH1/2 complex is largely devoid of other proteins. In αT3-1 cell lysates, the SPFH1/2 complex was ∼1 MDa in size, as estimated by BN-PAGE, which allows for the separation of proteins while still in complexes (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 4). Likewise, SPFH1/2 complexes immunopurified with either anti-SPFH1 or anti-SPFH2 migrated at ∼1 MDa (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 5), as did urea-washed, immunopurified complexes (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 6), indicating that the large size of the SPFH1/2 complex is not due to loosely associated proteins. In addition, SPFH1 and SPFH2 co-purifying with IP3R1 from stimulated cells migrated at ∼1 MDa, indicating that the SPFH1/2 complex, and not the individual proteins, associates with activated IP3Rs (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, size exclusion column chromatography of αT3-1 cell lysates yielded a value of ∼2 MDa for the size of the SPFH1/2 complex (not shown), and a similar discrepancy between BN-PAGE and gel filtration has been noted for the prohibitin 1/2 complex (32Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 3435-3442Google Scholar, 33Tatsuta T. Model K. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2005; 16: 248-259Google Scholar), suggesting that BN-PAGE may underestimate the size of high molecular mass complexes. As subsequent TEM yielded a size estimate of ∼2 MDa for the SPFH1/2 complex (Fig. 8), we conclude that the SPFH1/2 complex is ∼2 MDa in size and is composed of a total of ∼50 SPFH1 and SPFH2 molecules in an ∼1:2 ratio. The C-terminal Half of SPFH2 Mediates Its Interactions with SPFH1 and the Formation of ∼2-MDa Complexes—To determine which regions of SPFH1 and SPFH2 mediate their association, we generated constructs encoding wild-type SPFH1-FLAG and either wild-type or mutant SPFH2-HA (Fig. 4A). Initially, four SPFH2-HA internal deletion mutants (SPFH2-HAΔ26–58, Δ59–100, Δ101–176, and Δ177–274) and two C-terminal truncations (SPFH2-HAΔ275–340 and Δ177–340) were generated. Residues 1–25 were preserved in each of these SPFH2-HA constructs, as this region anchors SPFH2 to the ER membrane (17Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci... 2006; 119: 3149-3160Google Scholar). When SPFH1-FLAG was co-expressed with SPFH2-HA, SPFH2-HAΔ26–58, Δ59–100, or Δ101–176, each construct co-immunoprecipitated strongly with SPFH1-FLAG (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–6). In contrast, SPFH2-HAΔ275–340 bound less well (Fig. 4B, lane 10), and SPFH2-HAΔ177–274 and SPFH2-HAΔ177–340 bound hardly at all (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 11). Thus, regions near the C terminus of SPFH2, including the predicted coiled-coil (CC) region from 177–274 and another region C-terminal to 275, mediate binding to SPFH1. The region spanning residues 177–274 in SPFH2 is predicted to form two adjacent CC motifs (supplemental Fig. S1A and Fig. 4A), one from 177–230 (CC#1) and another from 231–274 (CC#2). SPFH2-HAΔ177"
https://openalex.org/W1982370572,"Induction of cell cycle arrest in lymphocytes after exposure to the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is dependent upon the integrity of lipid membrane microdomains. In this study we further demonstrate that the association of Cdt with lymphocyte plasma membranes is dependent upon binding to cholesterol. Depletion of cholesterol resulted in reduced toxin binding, whereas repletion of cholesterol-depleted cells restored binding. We employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance to demonstrate that toxin association with model membranes is dependent upon the concentration of cholesterol; moreover, these interactions were cholesterol-specific as the toxin failed to interact with model membranes containing stigmasterol, ergosterol, or lanosterol. Further analysis of the toxin indicated that the CdtC subunit contains a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) region. Mutation of the CRAC site resulted in decreased binding of the holotoxin to cholesterol-containing model membranes as well as to the surface of Jurkat cells. The mutant toxin also exhibited reduced capacity for intracellular transfer of the active toxin subunit, CdtB, as well as reduced toxicity. Collectively, these observations indicate that membrane cholesterol serves as an essential ligand for Cdt and that this association can be blocked by either depleting membranes of cholesterol or mutation of the CRAC site."

Recent findings from diverse systems suggest an extensive role for transcription in the assembly of heterochromatin, highlighting the emerging theme that transcription and noncoding RNAs can provide the initial scaffold for the formation of heterochromatin, which serves as a versatile recruiting platform for diverse factors involved in many cellular processes. Heterochromatin is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle and in response to developmental signals. Recent findings from diverse systems suggest an extensive role for transcription in the assembly of heterochromatin, highlighting the emerging theme that transcription and noncoding RNAs can provide the initial scaffold for the formation of heterochromatin, which serves as a versatile recruiting platform for diverse factors involved in many cellular processes. DNA-mediated processes in the eukaryotic nucleus occur on a chromatin template greatly influenced by DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications. Posttranslational modifications of histones permit different layers of regulatory control to be imposed to give rise to diverse chromatin states and architectures. Heterochromatin is a unique type of chromatin that is characterized by its transcriptionally repressed state and highly condensed structure. Emerging evidence reveals a convergent view of the molecular mechanisms that underlie heterochromatin assembly in diverse processes that range from pericentromeric heterochromatin formation in fission yeast to RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants to X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and imprinting in mammals. This Essay highlights recent findings that contribute to the evolving view of heterochromatin, with emphasis on the roles of transcription and RNA molecules in its assembly and function. The assembly of heterochromatin is believed to be a multistep process. Heterochromatin structures are nucleated at specific regulatory sequences and can spread into neighboring sequences, thereby influencing gene expression in a region-specific manner. Importantly, the ability of heterochromatin to propagate far from its original nucleation site provides a molecular platform for the recruitment of effector complexes involved in various chromosomal processes (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Studies from diverse systems suggest that a common set of structural components contribute toward the construction of the heterochromatin platform. Aside from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which relies on a different set of protein complexes to assemble heterochromatin, heterochromatin protein HP1 and its binding substrate, histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me), are markers of heterochromatin in most eukaryotes. H3K9me is catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase Suv39h in humans, SU(VAR)3-9 in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, and Clr4 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. HP1, originally characterized in Drosophila, consists of a family of proteins conserved from fission yeast (Swi6, Chp1, Chp2) to humans (HP1α, HP1β, HP1γ). HP1 proteins bind to H3K9me through their chromodomains, thereby facilitating HP1 localization at heterochromatic loci (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Together with Clr4, which also binds to H3K9me via its own chromodomain (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), HP1 proteins not only promote the propagation of heterochromatin but also the recruitment of protein complexes with various enzymatic activities essential for the assembly of repressed chromatin (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The presence of numerous effectors that are involved in different chromosomal processes at the heterochromatin domain contributes to the growing appreciation of the versatility of heterochromatin as a dynamic platform. For example, heterochromatin could serve to recruit factors involved in diverse processes such as cell-type switching, sister chromatid cohesion, RNAi, and transcriptional gene silencing (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Depending upon the chromosomal context, the strategies used to target heterochromatin differ in different organisms. In addition to DNA binding factors that are important for the targeting of heterochromatin, recent evidence suggests that transcription, in particular noncoding products of transcription, play critical roles in heterochromatin assembly. In mammals, transcription of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as Xist and Tsix (involved in XCI) and Kcnq1ot1 and Air (implicated in imprinting) are essential for the onset of the silent chromatin state (Nagano et al., 2008Nagano T.

Science. 2008; 322: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar) (see Review by C.P. Ponting, P.L. Oliver, and W. Reik in this issue of Cell). Moreover, recruitment of Polycomb group chromatin remodeling complexes for the initiation and spread of XCI is mediated by direct binding of the Polycomb group complex PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) to short RNA repeats within Xist (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao J. Sun B.K. Erwin J.A. Song J.J. Lee J.T. Science. 2008; 322: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Also, Air ncRNA interactions with the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a and chromatin at gene promoters are critical for imprinted silencing of the Slc22a3 gene in the mouse placenta (Nagano et al., 2008Nagano T. Mitchell J.A. Sanz L.A. Pauler F.M. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Feil R. Fraser P. Science. 2008; 322: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence also points to the importance of both RNAi and transcription in RNA-directed DNA methylation in plants. However, it appears that plants use RNA polymerases distinct from RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II, and III for heterochromatin assembly. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, RNA Pol IV and Pol V, which are essential for small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of transposons, also facilitate heterochromatin formation and silencing of genes adjacent to transposons (Wierzbicki et al., 2008Wierzbicki A.T. Hagg J.R. Pikaard C.S. Cell. 2008; 135: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Transcription of target loci by RNA Pol IV generates RNAs that are processed into 24 nucleotide siRNAs by RNA interference (RNAi) machinery that includes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2 and the DICER homolog Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) (reviewed in Henderson and Jacobsen, 2007Henderson I.R. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2007; 447: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). siRNAs are then loaded into the Argonaute family protein AGO4 that, together with RNA Pol V, helps guide DRM2 (domains rearranged methyltransferase 2), a DNA methyltransferase with de novo cytosine methylation activity, to methylate target sequences for epigenetic silencing (reviewed in Henderson and Jacobsen, 2007Henderson I.R. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2007; 447: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, transcription of the centromeric DNA repeats is critical for RNAi-mediated assembly of heterochromatin (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, Buhler and Moazed, 2007Buhler M. Moazed D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This process involves the RNA-induced transcriptional gene silencing (RITS) complex, which consists of the proteins Ago1 (an Argonaute homolog), Chp1, and Tas3, as well as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) containing Rdp1, Hrr1, and Cid12. These protein complexes coordinate their functions with the Dicer enzyme Dcr1 to mediate processing of centromeric repeat transcripts into siRNAs. They also facilitate the targeting of heterochromatin assembly factors such as the Clr4-containing ClrC complex to centromeric repeat sequences. Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that RNAi and histone-modifying factors cooperate with RNA Pol II and its associated complexes to nucleate heterochromatin. Indeed, defects in the RNA Pol II machinery severely compromise both the processing of repeat transcripts into siRNAs and the assembly of heterochromatic structures (see for example, Djupedal et al., 2005Djupedal I. Portoso M. Spahr H. Bonilla C. Gustafsson C.M. Allshire R.C. Ekwall K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2301-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is believed that RITS interacts with nascent RNA Pol II transcripts through Ago1-bound siRNAs (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R. Verdel A. Colmenares S.U. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Cell. 2004; 119: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and, together with its associated RDRC complex, contributes to centromeric silencing by mediating the processing of repeat transcripts into siRNAs (reviewed in Buhler and Moazed, 2007Buhler M. Moazed D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Interestingly, effective centromeric silencing also requires splicing factors that associate with the RDRC subunit Cid12 and function as a platform for siRNA generation by the RNAi machinery (Bayne et al., 2008Bayne E.H. Portoso M. Kagansky A. Kos-Braun I.C. Urano T. Ekwall K. Alves F. Rappsilber J. Allshire R.C. Science. 2008; 322: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Considering the involvement of RNAi complexes in posttranscriptional silencing of heterochromatic repeats, it is perhaps not unexpected that these factors are also associated with repeat transcripts. However, the more surprising finding has been that RNA Pol II transcription of repeat loci is closely linked to the initial loading of chromatin-modifying factors involved in heterochromatin assembly (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Two components of the ClrC complex, Rik1 and Clr4, play critical roles in integrating transcription and RNAi processes for heterochromatin assembly. The WD-β-propeller domain-containing protein Rik1 bridges the interaction between ClrC and the nascent transcript, presumably through its putative RNA-binding domain and interaction with the RITS complex (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Clr4, on the other hand, catalyzes the methylation of H3K9 to provide binding sites for HP1 family proteins. Transcription-coupled targeting of ClrC might be analogous to the recruitment of histone methyltransferases by RNA Pol II to modify chromatin in transcribed regions of chromatin (Li et al., 2007Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that what distinguishes heterochromatin may not be so much the lack of transcription, but rather RNA Pol II transcription being “hijacked” for the assembly of heterochromatin. This transcriptional hijacking appears to be highly regulated, involving both the RNA Pol II machinery and its attendant complexes in heterochromatin assembly. A scaffolding role for RNA Pol II transcription in heterochromatin assembly may help explain why a growing set of histone-modifying enzymes commonly associated with euchromatic transcription are also found at heterochromatin. Findings that we have reported suggest that in fission yeast, a self-reinforcing loop mechanism involving siRNA synthesis drives heterochromatin assembly (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar and references therein). In this mechanism, RITS bound to H3K9me through the chromodomain of Chp1 and heterochromatin proteins (such as Swi6) allow the RNAi machinery to act as a stable component of chromatin to process RNA transcripts from centromeric repeats into siRNAs. This continuous siRNA generation functions in a positive feedback loop to further stabilize heterochromatin (Figure 1). Interestingly, RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation appears to be primarily restricted to sites of siRNA production (reviewed in Buhler and Moazed, 2007Buhler M. Moazed D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism that limits siRNAs to the recruitment of heterochromatin factors (such as the ClrC complex) only in cis remains poorly understood. siRNAs are thought to facilitate proper positioning of Ago1 for slicing target transcripts, thereby stimulating RDRC synthesis of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) (reviewed in Buhler and Moazed, 2007Buhler M. Moazed D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). It is possible that even though heterochromatin assembly is stimulated by interactions between ClrC and siRNA-bound RITS, other aspects of heterochromatic transcription that are not exclusively dependent on the RNAi machinery may also help mediate ClrC recruitment. Consistent with this view, ClrC components are not entirely depleted from heterochromatic repeats in cells lacking the RNAi machinery (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Possible mediators of ClrC recruitment are the dsRNAs that arise either from transcription of heterochromatic repeats or by the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Figure 1). This scenario of ClrC targeting by dsRNAs could explain a number of puzzling observations. For instance, when compromised heterochromatin (for example, in cells lacking histone deacetylases) is rendered permissive for transcription, ClrC subunits display increased binding at the transcribed centromeric repeat sequences that requires the presence of the RNAi machinery (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Also, the appearance of dsRNAs at certain convergent gene loci can result in the transient formation of heterochromatin (Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008Gullerova M. Proudfoot N.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 983-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although heterochromatin and bidirectional transcription, which can potentially result in the production of dsRNAs, have both been documented in all known eukaryotes, RNAi is entirely absent in some eukaryotic lineages like Saccharomyces. It is conceivable that in systems either lacking or not using siRNAs, dsRNAs could be the transcriptional “red flag” that triggers the hijacking of the transcriptional machinery for the assembly of heterochromatin. The universal role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in establishing a closed heterochromatic structure has long been documented in many systems. However, recent findings in fission yeast reveal a dynamic interplay between HDACs and heterochromatin-linked transcription. The functions of class I HDACs (S. cerevisiae Rpd3; S. pombe Clr6) provide one such example. Rpd3/Clr6 exists in two distinct complexes. One of these complexes (S. cerevisiae Rpd3L; S. pombe complex I) targets gene promoters. In contrast, the other complex (S. cerevisiae Rpd3S; S. pombe complex II) targets gene bodies, partly through the recognition of Set2-dependent histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me) that is associated with RNA Pol II transcript elongation (Li et al., 2007Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Clr6 complexes have analogous functions in the regulation of bidirectional transcription at heterochromatic repeats. Complex I preferentially targets the “reverse” strand of the bidirectional transcription (Nicolas et al., 2007Nicolas E. Yamada T. Cam H.P. Fitzgerald P.C. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), driven by known promoter elements (Djupedal et al., 2005Djupedal I. Portoso M. Spahr H. Bonilla C. Gustafsson C.M. Allshire R.C. Ekwall K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2301-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas complex II suppresses the transcription of the “forward” strand (Nicolas et al., 2007Nicolas E. Yamada T. Cam H.P. Fitzgerald P.C. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The “reverse” and “forward” strands of the heterochromatic repeat transcript are equivalent to the sense and antisense strands, respectively, of a typical RNA Pol II gene. Intriguingly, RNA Pol II transcription is also restrained by the action of another class of HDACs, the class II HDAC Clr3. Biochemical characterization of Clr3 reveals that it is a part of a multisubunit SHREC complex containing a SNF2 chromatin-remodeling factor homolog called Mit1 (Sugiyama et al., 2007Sugiyama T. Cam H.P. Sugiyama R. Noma K. Zofall M. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2007; 128: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Clr3 coordinates its HDAC activity with Mit1 ATPase activity to properly position nucleosomes and create repressive chromatin structures essential for heterochromatic transcriptional silencing. Whether transcription-coupled processes contribute directly to SHREC localization is not known. However, the targeting of SHREC to centromeric repeats requires an H3K9me-HP1 platform that is established by transcription and RNAi machineries (Sugiyama et al., 2007Sugiyama T. Cam H.P. Sugiyama R. Noma K. Zofall M. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2007; 128: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Moreover, HDACs can also be recruited by DNA-binding factors such as centromere protein B (CENP-B) to form repressive chromatin structures at transposons and other loci. In both instances, HDACs assemble repressive chromatin, rendering it not only transcriptionally silent but also resistant to recombination, thereby promoting genome stability. Heterochromatic sequences are transcribed, and yet heterochromatic structure can exert a repressive effect on transcription by prohibiting RNA Pol II access (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). How does RNA Pol II gain access to the underlying DNA shielded by heterochromatin? Evidence suggests that in fission yeast, Swi6/HP1 protein not only mediates targeting of HDAC silencing factors but also recruits a JmjC domain-containing antisilencing factor called Epe1 that facilitates transcription of heterochromatic repeats (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have suggested that this apparent paradox could be further resolved by a mechanism involving differential temporal modulation of RNA Pol II accessibility during the cell cycle. The epigenetic landscape of heterochromatin is dynamically controlled throughout the cell cycle (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Kloc et al., 2008Kloc A. Zaratiegui M. Nora E. Martienssen R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 490-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), leading to the recruitment of disparate factors that confer transcriptional silencing. RNA Pol II occupancy at heterochromatin is restricted for most of the cell cycle (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). During the G2 phase, which occupies a large portion of the cell cycle, HP1 family proteins Swi6 and Chp2 aid in the recruitment and spreading of chromatin modifiers such as SHREC and mediate the assembly of repressive chromatin refractory to RNA Pol II transcription (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, Sugiyama et al., 2007Sugiyama T. Cam H.P. Sugiyama R. Noma K. Zofall M. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2007; 128: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). During mitosis, however, serine 10 of histone H3 is phosphorylated (H3S10P), resulting in heterochromatin remodeling by interfering with the binding of HP1 proteins to H3K9me. However, the H3S10P-mediated decrease in the chromatin association of HP1 proteins during mitosis does not result in loss of heterochromatic silencing. Instead, the decrease in chromatin-bound HP1 proteins correlates with the recruitment of the condensin complex (essential for chromosome condensation) to heterochromatin to repress centromeric transcription (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). There exists a short “window of opportunity” during S phase in which heterochromatin is relatively accessible to RNA Pol II for transcription of the underlying repeat sequences (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Kloc et al., 2008Kloc A. Zaratiegui M. Nora E. Martienssen R. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 490-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Evidence suggests that this increased S phase transcription coincides temporally with the recruitment of factors involved in heterochromatin assembly at repeat elements (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The upregulation of heterochromatin transcripts occurs preferentially on the “antisense” (forward) strand. Antisense transcripts may generate signals for the docking of heterochromatin assembly factors to repeat nascent transcripts. Indeed, Rik1 (a ClrC subunit) and Ago1 (a RITS complex subunit) are preferentially enriched at heterochromatic repeats during S phase (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Moreover, elongating RNA Pol II also targets the H3K36me modification associated with enhanced recruitment of HDAC silencing activities to heterochromatic repeats (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Preferential S phase binding of these factors may facilitate heterochromatin reconstitution during G2 when cis-acting posttranscriptional gene silencing (cis-PTGS) by RNAi and transcriptional silencing (TGS) by HDAC activities associated with HP1 proteins (Chp2 and Swi6) coordinately silence heterochromatic sequences (Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, Sugiyama et al., 2007Sugiyama T. Cam H.P. Sugiyama R. Noma K. Zofall M. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2007; 128: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Coupling of S phase transcription with increased heterochromatin assembly activities may also facilitate the maintenance of the heterochromatin state. This could be achieved by similarly promoting the recruitment of heterochromatin assembly factors such as components associated with the ClrC, HDAC, and RITS complexes (Chen et al., 2008Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, this process of transcription-coupled establishment of silenced chromatin is most likely facilitated by parental lysine 9-methylated histone H3s that are believed to be randomly segregated to daughter chromatids during chromosome replication. H3K9 methylation not only stabilizes the chromatin association of RNAi factors recruited by RNA Pol II transcription, but also engages ClrC (through the Clr4 chromodomain), which could methylate adjacent newly assembled histones. This thus promotes the re-establishment of parental histone modification patterns and heterochromatin assembly (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang K. Mosch K. Fischle W. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin factors have also been reported to associate with histone chaperones such as CAF1 (Quivy et al., 2004Quivy J.P. Roche D. Kirschner D. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Almouzni G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3516-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These proteins, which function during S phase, may act in concert with transcription- and H3K9me-dependent mechanisms to reassemble heterochromatin. The combinatorial effects of various heterochromatin stabilization pathways during S phase could enhance the rapid reconstitution of heterochromatin, thereby contributing to the stable inheritance of the heterochromatic state. Work performed in mammalian cells showed that S phase transcription of heterochromatic repeats initiates before replication of the heterochromatic sequences (Lu and Gilbert, 2007Lu J. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transcription is induced in response to cell proliferation and may involve H3S10P or dissociation of HP1 proteins triggered by specific signals during the cell cycle. Whether S phase transcription facilitates heterochromatin assembly in a manner similar to the process of transcription-coupled establishment of silenced chromatin in fission yeast is not known. It is possible that long noncoding RNAs mediate targeting of heterochromatin complexes during S phase in a manner analogous to that proposed for Air or Xist/Tsix RNAs for heterochromatin formation. Alternatively, these transcripts could mediate generation of dsRNAs that in turn provide signals for heterochromatin assembly, as discussed above. As more knowledge is gained about the molecular constituents and assembly mechanisms of heterochromatin, a growing body of evidence indicates that many characteristics thought to be unique to constitutive heterochromatin are found outside of the heterochromatin domain. For example, certain euchromatic genes are decorated with classical heterochromatic markers such as HP1 and methylated H3K9 that appear to correlate with gene activation rather than gene repression (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a new role for heterochromatin components was recently reported in fission yeast in which bidirectional transcription during the G1 phase of the cell cycle at certain convergent genes has been suggested to induce RNAi-mediated local assembly of heterochromatin structures (Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008Gullerova M. Proudfoot N.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 983-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The presence of heterochromatin at these sites provides a recruiting platform for cohesin, the protein complex responsible for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. Once localized, cohesin is believed to promote transcription termination between convergent genes during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, thereby preventing further dsRNA synthesis and disassembly of the heterochromatin. Delocalization of cohesin during M phase permits reexpression of dsRNAs and reconstitution of heterochromatin in the subsequent G1 phase of the cell cycle (Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008Gullerova M. Proudfoot N.J. Cell. 2008; 132: 983-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Future studies are needed to attain full understanding of the functions of RNAi and cohesin at these sites and to explore the possible role of transient heterochromatin assembly in genome stability. Perhaps no example better illustrates the versatility and power of the RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly platform in other cellular processes than the process of selective DNA elimination in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. The single-celled Tetrahymena contains two nuclei called the micronucleus and the macronucleus. During mating (conjugation), the differentiation of the new macronucleus from a micronuleus is accompanied by elimination of DNA elements known as internal eliminated segment sequences. Remarkably, this DNA elimination process requires the RNAi machinery and small RNAs that specifically target heterochromatin marks such as H3K9me and chromodomain proteins to the internal eliminated segment sequences (reviewed in Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2004Mochizuki K. Gorovsky M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of heterochromatin factors in DNA elimination remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to speculate that as in fission yeast, transient formation of heterochromatin platform, instead of recruiting cohesin, facilitates the recruitment of DNA nucleases such as recombinases to trigger DNA elimination. Transcription in eukaryotic genomes was once thought to be confined to euchromatin. However, our view of heterochromatin has been redefined with the discovery of the roles for the transcription apparatus and its transcripts as heterochromatin scaffolds and as substrates for the generation of small RNAs and dsRNAs that help to form transcriptionally silenced regions. Moreover, recent revelations that most of the genome is transcribed suggest a much broader role for transcription. Given that the epigenetic state of a genetic locus is largely influenced by its transcriptional state, it is possible that a mechanism analogous to the transcription-coupled establishment of silenced chromatin in fission yeast may not only be responsible for the faithful inheritance of heterochromatin but may mediate the general maintenance of chromatin states.

https://openalex.org/W1985731775,"The human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a 9.5-megadalton catalytic machine that employs three catalytic components, i.e. pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1p), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2p), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), to carry out the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. The human PDC is organized around a 60-meric dodecahedral core comprising the C-terminal domains of E2p and a noncatalytic component, E3-binding protein (E3BP), which specifically tethers E3 dimers to the PDC. A central issue concerning the PDC structure is the subunit stoichiometry of the E2p/E3BP core; recent studies have suggested that the core is composed of 48 copies of E2p and 12 copies of E3BP. Here, using an in vitro reconstituted PDC, we provide densitometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and analytical ultracentrifugation evidence that there are 40 copies of E2p and 20 copies of E3BP in the E2p/E3BP core. Reconstitution with saturating concentrations of E1p and E3 demonstrated 40 copies of E1p heterotetramers and 20 copies of E3 dimers associated with the E2p/E3BP core. To corroborate the 40/20 model of this core, the stoichiometries of E3 and E1p binding to their respective binding domains were reexamined. In these binding studies, the stoichiometries were found to be 1:1, supporting the 40/20 model of the core. The overall maximal stoichiometry of this in vitro assembled PDC for E2p:E3BP:E1p:E3 is 40:20:40:20. These findings contrast a previous report that implicated that two E3-binding domains of E3BP bind simultaneously to a single E3 dimer (Smolle, M., Prior, A. E., Brown, A. E., Cooper, A., Byron, O., and Lindsay, J. G. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 19772–19780). The human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a 9.5-megadalton catalytic machine that employs three catalytic components, i.e. pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1p), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2p), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), to carry out the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. The human PDC is organized around a 60-meric dodecahedral core comprising the C-terminal domains of E2p and a noncatalytic component, E3-binding protein (E3BP), which specifically tethers E3 dimers to the PDC. A central issue concerning the PDC structure is the subunit stoichiometry of the E2p/E3BP core; recent studies have suggested that the core is composed of 48 copies of E2p and 12 copies of E3BP. Here, using an in vitro reconstituted PDC, we provide densitometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and analytical ultracentrifugation evidence that there are 40 copies of E2p and 20 copies of E3BP in the E2p/E3BP core. Reconstitution with saturating concentrations of E1p and E3 demonstrated 40 copies of E1p heterotetramers and 20 copies of E3 dimers associated with the E2p/E3BP core. To corroborate the 40/20 model of this core, the stoichiometries of E3 and E1p binding to their respective binding domains were reexamined. In these binding studies, the stoichiometries were found to be 1:1, supporting the 40/20 model of the core. The overall maximal stoichiometry of this in vitro assembled PDC for E2p:E3BP:E1p:E3 is 40:20:40:20. These findings contrast a previous report that implicated that two E3-binding domains of E3BP bind simultaneously to a single E3 dimer (Smolle, M., Prior, A. E., Brown, A. E., Cooper, A., Byron, O., and Lindsay, J. G. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 19772–19780). The human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) 3The abbreviations used are: PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; E1p, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E2p, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase; E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; E3BP, E3-binding protein; E3BD, E3-binding domain; LBD, lipoyl-bearing domain; L3, LBD from E3-binding protein; BCKDC, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex; E2b, dihydrolipoyl transacylase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; SV, sedimentation velocity; TEV, tobacco-etched virus; IF interference; ABS, absorbance; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. resides in mitochondria and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to yield acetyl-CoA and reducing equivalents (NADH), serving as a link between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (1Reed L.J.

The PDC is a large (∼9.5 MDa) catalytic machine comprising multiple protein components. The three catalytic components are pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1p), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2p), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), with E3 being a common component between different α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. The two regulatory enzymes in the PDC are the isoforms of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. The PDC is organized around a structural core, which includes the C-terminal domains of E2p and a noncatalytic component that specifically binds E3, i.e. the E3-binding protein (E3BP). To this E2p/E3BP core, multiple copies of the other PDC components are tethered through noncovalent interactions. Each E2p subunit contains two consecutive N-terminal lipoic acid-bearing domains (LBDs), termed L1 and L2, followed by the E1p-binding domain (E1pBD) and the C-terminal inner-core/catalytic domain, with these independent domains connected by unstructured linkers. Similarly, each E3BP subunit consists of a single N-terminal LBD (referred to as L3), the E3-binding domain (E3BD), and the noncatalytic inner core domain. Together, the inner core domains of E2p and E3BP assemble to form the dodecahedral 60-meric E2p/E3BP core. The role of the E1pBD and E3BD domains is to tether E1p and E3, respectively, to the periphery of the E2p/E3BP core. It is presumed that the LBDs (L1, L2, and L3) shuttle between the active sites of the three catalytic components of the PDC during the oxidative decarboxylation cycle (4Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic PDC is unique among α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes in its requirement for E3BP; prokaryotic PDCs employ the single subunit-binding domain to secure either E1p or E3 to the complex (5Fries M. Stott K.M. Reynolds S. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using a “divide-and-conquer” approach, a wealth of structural information on the PDC has been accumulated recently. High-resolution crystal structures are available for the human E1p (6Ciszak E.M.

Biol. 2007; 370: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are known. Therefore, atomic models are available for almost all components and domains of the mammalian PDC. With the successes of the above structural approach, attention has turned to the overall structure of the PDC. There are two outstanding questions as follows. What are the subunit and overall catalytic component stoichiometries? What are the positions and orientations of the components in this large catalytic machine? Yu et al. (10Yu X. Hiromasa Y. Tsen H. Stoops J.K. Roche T.E. Zhou Z.H. Structure (Lond.). 2008; 16: 104-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently determined the cryo-EM structure of a PDC core comprising only human E2p subunits. Like yeast E2p, human E2p adopts a dodecahedral structure composed of 60 E2p proteins; each face of the dodecahedron has a large gap. Although this structure is highly informative, the composition of this core deviates substantially from that of the native PDC, because no E3BP subunits are present in the core structure. Based on the similar structure of the dodecahedral yeast PDC, a hypothesis was formed that, in human PDC, 12 copies of E3BP bind in the 12 gaps, which is termed the “60/12” model (20Sanderson S.J. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies on complexes of E2p and E3BP later negated the 60/12 model; Hiromasa et al. (21Hiromasa Y. Fujisawa T. Aso Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6921-6933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) therefore posited an alternative, the “48/12” model, in which the dodecahedral core includes 48 E2p subunits and 12 E3BP proteins. A further source of conjecture is how many E1p and E3 components bind to the periphery of the PDC. If one binding domain binds to one peripheral catalytic component, a maximally occupied 60/12 PDC would harbor 60 E1p heterotetramers and 12 E3 dimers (or 48 E1ps and 12 E3s in the 48/12 model). The notion of such 1:1 binding is supported by the preponderance of available biophysical evidence. Specifically, two crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and calorimetric measurements describe a 1:1 interaction between E3BD and E3 (14Brautigam C.A. Wynn R.M. Chuang J.L. Machius M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Ciszak E.M. Makal A. Hong Y.S. Vettaikkorumakankauv A.K. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 648-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Also, although no structures are available for the human E1p-E1pBD complex, a crystal structure of the homologs of these proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus also demonstrates a 1:1 interaction between the E1pBD of E2p and the E1p heterotetramer (22Frank R.A.W. Pratap J.V. Pei X.Y. Perham R.N. Luisi B.F. Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 1119-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, ITC experiments performed on the bacterial E1p and the cognate subunit-binding domain indicate a 1:1 association (23Jung H.-I. Cooper A. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4488-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At variance with the above observations, a different subunit stoichiometry has been proposed by Smolle et al. (24Smolle M. Lindsay J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Smolle M. Prior A.E. Brown A.E. Cooper A. Byron O. Lindsay J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19772-19780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Their evidence suggests that two binding domains bind for every peripheral component; such an arrangement potentially yields a PDC with half as many peripheral components bound. This study was undertaken to ascertain the subunit and component stoichiometries of the human PDC, particularly with regard to interactions between the E3BD and the E3 dimer. We show that quantification of bands on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of a PDC reconstituted at saturating E1p and E3 concentrations supports neither the 60/12 nor the 48/12 model. Instead, a “40/20” model is proposed, and subsequent ITC and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) data corroborate this new model. In addition, results from electrophoretic mobility shift assays, ITC, and AUC presented here uniformly show a 1:1 interaction between E3BD and the E3 dimer as well as between E1pBD and the E1p heterotetramer. The implications of this 1:1 binding stoichiometry for the macromolecular assembly of the PDC are discussed. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant human E3 (9Brautigam C.A. Chuang J.L.

Structure (Lond.). 2008; 16: 1849-1859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as described previously. The recombinant fusion protein LBDb-E3BD was constructed, expressed, and purified as described before. Descriptions and schematic representations of the LBDb-E1pBD, LBDb-E3BD, L3-E3BD, and XDD1 constructs in the pET28b expression vector can be found under “Results and Discussion” (see Fig. 2). The expression plasmids for human E1p and the full-length human E2p/E3BP core were generous gifts from Dr. Kirill Popov, University of Alabama Medical Center, Birmingham, AL (26Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Wu P. Jeng J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For use as a protein standard, the E2p expression construct was generated by the deletion of a SalI fragment containing the mature E3BP coding sequence from the E2p/E3BP plasmid. The E3BP construct was prepared by amplifying the coding sequence for mature E3BP from the E2p/E3BP plasmid; the amplified DNA fragment was also cloned into the pET28b expression vector. All E3BD-containing proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLys S cells (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Lipoic acid was added to the growth media to a final concentration of 0.2 mm before induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight growth at 30 °C, harvested cells were suspended in the lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by the addition of lysozyme and sonication. Cleared cell extract was treated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the eluted protein was further purified on a Superdex 200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The E3BD protein (E3BP residues 121–175) was prepared by incubating LBDb-E3BD protein with the TEV protease (100:1 (w/w)) for 24 h at 4 °C, followed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid extraction and purification on a Sephacryl S-100 column equilibrated in the same buffer. The recombinant E2p/E3BP core and E2p core proteins were expressed and purified according to the method described by Hiromasa et al. (21Hiromasa Y. Fujisawa T. Aso Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6921-6933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); a key modification was that the E2p/E3BP core and E2p core proteins in the absence of detergent were purified from the pellet of the first 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 precipitation. The individually expressed E3BP protein was purified from the pellet of the second 8% polyethylene glycol 8000 precipitation, followed by purification on gel filtration and FPLC Resource Q column. Protein Concentration Determination—At least two different measurements were used to determine the concentrations of the individual proteins. For E3, the absorbance of the flavin chromophore at 450 nm (ϵ450 nm = 10,325 m-1 cm-1) was monitored. Alternatively, E3 was precipitated using trichloroacetic acid, washed with trichloroacetic acid, and then dissolved in guanidinium hydrochloride to remove the bound FAD; the absorbance of E3 at 278 nm (ϵ278 nm = 23,971 m-1 cm-1) was used to determine the concentration of E3. The concentrations of LBDb-E1pBD, LBDb-E3BD, L3-E3BD, and XDD1 were determined by using the calculated extinction coefficients (ϵ280 nm) of 14,000, 14,435, 11,000, and 11,000 m-1 cm-1, respectively, and colorimetrically by the advanced protein determination assay (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). Because the E3BD sequence does not contain any UV-absorbing aromatic amino acid residues, a colorimetric assay was used to determine its protein concentration. The subunit-binding domain from E2b of the BCKDC was used as a standard in the advanced protein determination assay used to determine the E3BD concentration. Deviations between protein measurements were generally within 10%. Final protein concentrations were taken as the average of the spectral and colorimetric values. The ϵ278 nm of the 60-meric E2p/E3BP core was calculated to be 29,596 m-1 cm-1 assuming a subunit ratio of E2p:E3BP = 40:20 (this study). The ϵ278 nm values of individual E2p and E3BP proteins were 33,920 and 20,970 m-1 cm-1, respectively. The ϵ278 nm value for the E1p heterotetramer was 143,438 m-1 cm-1. In Vitro Assembly of the Human PDC—The purified recombinant E2p/E3BP core (0.45 nmol) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol was combined with purified His6-tagged E3 dimers (17.5 nmol) in a final volume of 2.6 ml, or with purified E1p heterotetramers (32 nmol), or with both E3 and E1p. The assembly mixtures were passed through an FPLC Superdex S-200 column to remove excess unbound E3 and/or E1p proteins from the E2p/E3BP core. To determine subunit stoichiometries, the purified reconstituted PDC was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. All sample gels and individual protein standard gels were run simultaneously and stained and destained together. The separated bands were quantified by both staining density alone and by comparing with the standard curves obtained with individual protein standards. The molar extinction coefficients described above were used. Results from the two methods are in good agreement except for the E1β subunit, which stained weaker with the dye than other subunits. The substoichiometric amount of E1β subunit obtained by direct staining intensity was corrected by comparing with the standard curve generated for this subunit. Native PAGE Binding Assay—Before electrophoresis, 180 pmol of E3 were mixed with varying concentrations of the E3BD-containing proteins in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 15 μl. Half of each sample was loaded onto Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (5% (w/v) stacking gel with 7% (w/v) resolving gel). After electrophoresis at 100 V for 2.5 h, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 20 min and destained in 10% (v/v) methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were performed in a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Titrations were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 at 20 °C. Prior to the titration, both proteins had been exhaustively dialyzed against this buffer. In a typical measurement for E3BD binding, 30 injections (at 3-min intervals) of 8 μl each of the E3BD-containing protein (200 μm) or LBDb-E1pBD (186 μm) were made into 1.4271 ml of the E3 dimer (20 μm) or the E1p heterotetramer (18 μm), respectively, in the cell. To measure E3 or E1p binding to the E2p/E3BP core, 210 μm of the E3 dimer or 150 μm of the E1p heterotetramer in the syringe was injected into the cell containing 14 or 50 μm (based on monomer concentration), respectively, of the E2p/E3BP core. The binding isotherms calculated by integration of the thermograms were used to derive the three nonlinear parameters for the interactions: the association constant (Ka), the molar ratio (n), and the enthalpy change (ΔH). Ka was converted to the dissociation constant (Kd) using the relationship Kd = 1/Ka. Curve fitting and the derivation of thermodynamic parameters were carried out using the nonlinear parameter optimization protocols implemented in the ORIGIN version 7.0 software package provided by MicroCal. The concentrations of the proteins were determined as described above. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—All analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were carried out in a model XL-I (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) centrifuge. Experiments with LBDb-E3BD were carried out in a buffer composed of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 12 mm KCl. These studies were performed at 20 °C in an An60-Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter) using a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm. The buffer for the experiments with L3-E3BD and XDD1 included 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. They were performed using a rotor speed of 45,000 rpm at 4 °C in an An50-Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). AUC studies featuring reconstituted PDC with either E1p or E3 were done at 20 °C, with rotor speeds of 15,000 or 20,000 rpm, respectively, in the An50Ti rotor. All AUC experiments were carried out in dual-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces fitted with sapphire windows; all sample volumes were ∼390 μl. Both the on-board laser interferometer and UV-visible spectrophotometer were used to monitor the sedimentation of the proteins. The partial specific volumes of the proteins, the buffer viscosity, and the buffer density were estimated using the freeware program SEDNTERP (27Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway R.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The initial qualities of the experiments were analyzed by performing simple c(s) analyses, in which the raw data are directly modeled as a continuous distribution of noninteracting, ideally sedimenting species. The freeware program SEDFIT (28Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 29Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) was used for such analyses. Although the concentrations of the proteins included in all SV experiments were estimated using UV spectrophotometry, the laser interferometer in the XL-I centrifuge was used as an independent, unbiased means for determining protein concentration. The raw data from the interferometer can be expressed in terms of the “number of fringes displaced,” termed ΔJ. This quantity is related concentration of the protein by an equation that is similar to the familiar Beer-Lambert law as shown in Equation 1, ΔJ≅CIMIc(Eq. 1) where c is concentration (expressed in mol/liter); M is the molar mass of the species; l is the optical path length (1.2 cm in this case), and CI is a constant with a value of 2.75 fringes·liter·g-1·cm-1. The term CIM assumes the place of the conventional extinction coefficient in this Beer-Lambert-like formulation; this term should be applicable for all proteins that do not have significant post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation. This term throughout this paper is referred to as “ϵIF”, making Equation 1 take the form shown in Equation 2, ΔJ≅ϵIFIc(Eq. 2) In practice, ϵIF was calculated using Equation 3, ϵIF=2.75Mc(Eq. 3) where Mc is the predicted molar mass of the protein based on its amino acid sequence. The mass of the FAD cofactor was not considered in calculating the ϵIF of E3. In an SV experiment with only one protein, ΔJ is observed; l is known, and ϵIF is easily calculated using Equation 3. Therefore, the only unknown in Equation 2 is c, allowing its calculation from the experimentally observed ΔJ. In the SV experiments presented in this work, there are usually two boundaries: a leading boundary, representing the co-sedimenting complexes of the larger and smaller proteins, and a lagging boundary that represents excess free smaller protein. For most of these experiments, three methods were used to determine the concentrations of the smaller protein that cosedimented with the larger. In the first, called the “lagging” method, the concentration of lagging material was quantified using Equations 2 and 3. Because a known concentration of lagging protein was input, the lagging concentration was subtracted from the input concentration, and this value was taken as the amount of lagging protein in the complex. For the second method, ΔJ for the leading boundary was determined. From this value, the input ΔJ of the larger protein was subtracted. This latter value was taken as the signal because of the cosedimenting smaller protein. Using Equations 2 and 3, the concentration of the cosedimenting smaller protein can be deduced. The third method is the multisignal method (30Deka R.K. Brautigam C.A. Tomson F.L. Lumpkins S.B. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Norgard M.V. J. Biol.

In parallel with the interferometric (IF) data, absorbance (ABS) profiles of the centrifugation cells were also obtained. Because c is known from the IF data, this value can be fixed, and the molar extinction coefficient for the absorbance optics, ϵABS, may be determined using the Beer-Lambert law shown in Equation 4, A=ϵABSIc(Eq. 4) where A is the absorbance. The freeware program SEDPHAT takes this approach in globally analyzing SV data acquired from the two different optical systems (32Balbo A. Minor K.H. Velikovsky C.A. Mariuzza R.A. Peterson C.B. Schuck P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); ϵABS is treated as a “floating” nonlinear parameter that is optimized along with sample menisci, frictional ratio, etc. By performing SV experiments with the individual proteins, the ϵABS may be established for each protein in isolation. The relationship between ϵIF and ϵABS for a particular protein defines a spectral signature for that protein. When two of the components are mixed and a multisignal SV experiment is carried out, it has been shown that these signatures may be used to deconvolute the c(s) distribution into two distributions, one for each component (32Balbo A. Minor K.H. Velikovsky C.A. Mariuzza R.A. Peterson C.B. Schuck P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Such distributions are called ck(s) distributions. In the current context, two ck(s) distributions may be calculated, one representing the population of the smaller protein and the other of the larger protein (or complex). Such distributions may be integrated to yield the concentrations of the components at defined s20,w values. In this way, the concentrations and thus stoichiometry of the individual components of a cosedimenting protein complex can be determined. For experiments performed with the core complex, the concentration derived was that of a subunit of the complex assuming one of two models. For the 40/20 model, the subunit was a heterotrimer comprising two copies of E2p and one of E3BP. For the 48/12 model, the subunit was a heteropentamer made up of four copies of E2p and one of E3BP. The c(s) and ck(s) distributions in this study were regularized using the maximum entropy and Tikhono"
https://openalex.org/W2084492188,"Prohibitin (PHB or PHB1) is an evolutionarily conserved, multifunctional protein which is present in various cellular compartments including the plasma membrane. However, mechanisms involved in various functions of PHB are not fully explored yet. Here we report for the first time that PHB interacts with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT) and is O-GlcNAc modified; and also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. Tyrosine 114 (Tyr114) and tyrosine 259 (Tyr259) in PHB are in the close proximity of potential O-GlcNAc sites serine 121 (Ser121) and threonine 258 (Thr258) respectively. Substitution of Tyr114 and Tyr259 residues in PHB with phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis results in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation as well as reduced O-GlcNAc modification of PHB. Surprisingly, this also resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and activity of OGT. This is attributed to the presence of similar tyrosine motifs in PHB and OGT. Substitution of Ser121 and Thr258 with alanine and isoleucine respectively resulted in attenuation of O-GlcNAc modification and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB suggesting an association between these two dynamic modifications. Sequence analysis of O-GlcNAc modified proteins having known O-GlcNAc modification site(s) or known tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) revealed a strong potential association between these two posttranslational modifications in various proteins. We speculate that O-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation of PHB play an important role in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways including insulin, growth factors and immune receptors signaling. In addition, we propose that O-GlcNAc modification and tyrosine phosphorylation is a novel previously unidentified binary switch which may provide new mechanistic insights into cell signaling pathways and is open for direct experimental examination."
https://openalex.org/W2069198079,"Glycodelin is a human glycoprotein with four reported glycoforms, namely glycodelin-A (GdA), glycodelin-F (GdF), glycodelin-C (GdC), and glycodelin-S (GdS). These glycoforms have the same protein core and appear to differ in their N-glycosylation. The glycosylation of GdA is completely different from that of GdS. GdA inhibits proliferation and induces cell death of T cells. However, the glycosylation and immunomodulating activities of GdF and GdC are not known. This study aimed to use ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometry to compare the glycomes of GdA, GdC, and GdF and to study the relationship between the immunological activity and glycosylation pattern among glycodelin glycoforms. Using MALDI-TOF strategies, the glycoforms were shown to contain an enormous diversity of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex-type glycans carrying Galβ1–4GlcNAc (lacNAc) and/or GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (lacdiNAc) antennae backbones with varying levels of fucose and sialic acid substitution. Interestingly, they all carried a family of Sda (NeuAcα2–3(GalNAcβ1–4)Gal)-containing glycans, which were not identified in the earlier study because of less sensitive methodologies used. Among the three glycodelins, GdA is the most heavily sialylated. Virtually all the sialic acid on GdC is located on the Sda antennae. With the exception of the Sda epitope, the GdC N-glycome appears to be the asialylated counterpart of the GdA/GdF glycomes. Sialidase activity, which may be responsible for transforming GdA/GdF to GdC, was detected in cumulus cells. Both GdA and GdF inhibited the proliferation, induced cell death, and suppressed interleukin-2 secretion of Jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Among the four glycodelin isoforms, only the N-glycan structures of GdA and GdS have been previously determined. This was achieved using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (6Dell A. Morris H.R.

In GdA, the Asn-28 site carries high mannose, hybrid, and complex-type structures, whereas the second Asn-63 site is exclusively occupied by complex-type glycans (6Dell A. Morris H.R. Easton R.L.

The major non-reducing epitopes characterized in the complex-type glycans are Galβ1–4GlcNAc (lacNAc), GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (lacdiNAc), NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAc (sialylated lacNAc), NeuAcα2–6GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (sialylated lacdiNAc), Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc (Lewis-x), and GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc (lacdiNAc analog of the blood group substance Lewis-x) (6Dell A.

GdS glycans are unusually fucose-rich, and the major complex type glycan structures are bi-antennary glycans with Lewis-x and Lewis-y antennae. Glycosylation of GdS is highly site-specific. Asn-28 contains only high mannose structures, whereas Asn-63 contains only complex type glycans. More than 80% of the complex glycans have 3–5 fucose residues/glycan, and none of the glycans is sialylated, which is unusual for a secreted human glycoprotein (7Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L.

The present study aims to identify the effect of all four glycodelin isoforms on lymphocyte viability, cell death, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and to correlate these bioactivities with their glycosylation patterns determined by mass spectrometry. Preparation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells—Human peripheral blood from healthy female donors was obtained from the Hong Kong Red Cross blood transfusion service. PBMCs were isolated from the buffy coat by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences). In brief, diluted buffy coat (1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2) was layered on the Ficoll and centrifuged at 400 × g for 40 min at room temperature. The remaining red blood cells were removed using red blood cell lysing buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA). The PBMCs were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. Monocytes were removed by cell adhesion in plastic culture flask for 2 h. Cell Cultures—PBMCs and human cell lines, including oviductal cells (OE E6/E7), natural killer cells (NK92mi), cells from a chronic myelogenous leukemia line (K562), T-lymphoma cells (Jurkat), hepatocarcinoma cells (HeLa), trophoblast choriocarcinoma cells (BeWo), and endometrial cells (RL95) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (K562, Jurkat, and PBMCs), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HeLa, OE E6/E7, BeWo, and RL95) or minimal essential medium (NK92mi) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Purification of Glycodelins—The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. GdA, -S, -F, and -C were purified as described from first trimester amniotic fluid, seminal plasma, follicular fluid, and cumulus matrix of human, respectively (5Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Koistinen R.

The collected samples were diluted with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in a ratio of 1:3–1:5 was added. GdA, -S, and -C were purified by monoclonal anti-glycodelin (clone F43–7F9) chromatography. In brief, the diluted amniotic fluid, seminal plasma, or cumulus matrix were loaded onto an anti-glycodelin column, which was then washed successively by TBS, 1 m NaCl with 1% isopropanol, 10 mm ammonium acetate with 0.1% isopropanol, pH 5, and TBS. Glycodelin was eluted by 20 mm CaCl2 with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted GdS and -C were further purified with anion-exchange Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) column by AKTA purifier 10 (Amersham Biosciences). The purification of GdF involved the successively use of several chromatographic columns, including Hi-trap blue, protein-G, lectin affinity, Mono Q, and gel filtration as described (21Yao Y.Q. Chiu C.N. Ip S.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The purified glycodelins were dialyzed in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated by Amicon-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc., Billerica, MA). Deglycosylated glycodelin was prepared by denaturation of GdA in 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol before incubation with 0.5 milliunits of peptide N-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 24 h. The digest was boiled for 5 min to inactivate the peptide N-glycosidase F and dialyzed in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Desiaylation of GdA and GdF was performed using sialidase-coated agarose beads (Sigma) in 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7) at 37 °C for 18 h. The free sialic acid was removed by dialysis with 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C overnight. The success of desiaylation was verified by the decreased binding of the treated glycodelin to the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin, which binds strongly to sialylated glycans and weakly to other glycoconjugates (22Tsuji T. Osawa T. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the purified glycodelins were determined by a commercial protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The purified glycodelins showed single bands in 12% gel SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1). XTT Cell Viability/Proliferation Assay—Cell viability was determined by a colorimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics Co., Basel, Switzerland), which measured the production of a color formazan end-product from a tetrazolium salt sodium 3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) from the viable cells. In this assay, XTT labeling mixture was freshly prepared by mixing XTT labeling reagent with electron coupling reagent at a ratio of 50:1. Fifty microliters of the labeling mixture was added to the cell culture 12 h before the end of the incubation period. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with λ correction at 595 nm (Infinite F200, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The cell suppression was expressed by the following equation: suppression index (%) = ((absorbance of glycodelin treated cells - absorbance of blank)/(absorbance of control cells - absorbance of blank)) × 100%. Cell Death Analysis by Flow Cytometry—After treatment the cells were labeled with Yo-Pro®-1 and propidium iodide (PI) for cell death analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were washed twice with PBS. Yo-Pro®-1 dye (1 μl) and PI (1 μl) in 0.5 ml of PBS was added into the cell suspension. After 15 min of incubation, the cells were analyzed immediately with a Coulter Epic Elite ESP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) equipped with an argon laser of 488 nm. Fluorescence signal was measured using the 525 nm and 610 nm band pass filters and was analyzed by the Winlist software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Cells that were not stained were counted as viable. Cells labeled with Yo-Pro®-1 only were counted as apoptotic cells. Cells labeled with both Yo-Pro®-1 and PI were counted as necrotic cells. It should be noted that this cell population may also contained late apoptotic cells that were PI-positive. Determination of IL-2 Production by ELISA—The levels of IL-2 was measured from the culture supernatant of the treated cells according to the manufacturer protocol (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). In brief, capture antibody in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) was coated on a 96-well ELISA plate overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 200 μl of 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h and were incubated with 100 μl of culture medium overnight at 4 °C. Then 100 μl of biotinylated detection antibody and avidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate mixture was added and incubated for 1 h. Color development was achieved by enzymatic reaction using 3.3′,5.5′-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with λ correction of 595 nm. The wells were washed five times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS between each step. Lectin Binding Assays—Lectin binding assay (19Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, the wells in 96-well plate were coated with various lectins (10 μg/ml) overnight. Uncoated sites in the well were blocked by incubation with 100 μl of 5% casein in PBS for 3 h with slow shaking. Glycodelins (7.5 pmol in 250 μl) were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing the wells twice with 0.05% Tween 20-TBS, monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43–7F9, 2.5 μg in 200 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h. The wells were washed 4 times, and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:5000 (Sigma) was added. After 2 h of incubation, the wells were washed, and 100 μl per well of o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) was added. The A490 was determined with a microplate reader (MR5000, Dynatech, Embrach, Switzerland). The assay was done at room temperature. The control wells contained bovine serum albumin instead of glycodelin. Processing of the Glycodelin N-Glycans—Preparations of purified GdA, GdF, and GdC (25–50 μg each) were used for all MALDI experiments and GC-MS analyses. Each of the 50 μg of GdA preparations was purified from separate pools of 500 ml of midtrimester amniotic fluid from 20 pregnant women, whereas each of the 50 μg of GdF preparations was purified from separate pools of 2.5 liters of follicular fluid from ∼270 women enrolled in the assisted reproduction program. Preparations of 50 μg of GdC were purified from 500 ml of cumulus matrix pooled from ∼165 cases of oocyte retrieval. The purified glycodelins were initially subjected to reduction, carboxymethylation, and tryptic digestion before the N-glycans were released by peptide N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) digestion. After that, the released N-glycans were purified by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp, Hertfordshire, UK). Prior to mass spectrometric analyses, the purified native N-glycans were derivatized using the sodium hydroxide permethylation procedure. All of the above procedures were carried out as described previously (23Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Elsevier Academic, Amsterdam2006: 415-425Google Scholar). MS and MS/MS Data Acquisition of Permethylated Glycodelin N-Glycans—MALDI-MS and MS/MS data were acquired using a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) mass spectrometer. The collision energy was set to 1 kV, and argon was used as collision gas. Samples were dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, and 1 μl was mixed at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) with 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid (20 mg/ml in 70% methanol in water) as matrix. Analyses of MALDI Data—The MS and MS/MS data were processed using Data Explorer 4.9 (Applied Biosystems). The mass spectra were baseline-corrected (default settings) and noise-filtered (with correction factor of 0.7), and then converted to ASCII format. The processed spectra were then subjected to manual assignment and annotation with the aid of a glycobioinformatics tool, GlycoWorkBench (24Ceroni A. Maass K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Dell A. Haslam S.M. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Peak picking was done manually, and proposed assignments for the selected peaks were based on 12C isotopic composition together with knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways. The proposed structures were then confirmed by data obtained from MS/MS and linkage analysis experiments. Gas Chromatography-MS Linkage Analysis—Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared and analyzed by GC-MS as previously described (23Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Elsevier Academic, Amsterdam2006: 415-425Google Scholar). Biological Characterization of Different Glycodelin Isoforms—XTT assay and flow cytometry was used to study the effect of glycodelin on cell viability/proliferation and cell death, respectively. In brief, PBMCs and cell lines, including OE E6/E7 (25Lee Y.L. Lee K.F. Xu J.S. Wang Y.L. Tsao S.W. Yeung W.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), NK92mi, K562, Jurkat, HeLa, BeWo, and RL95 were incubated with 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/ml glycodelins or deglycosylated glycodelin in 100 μl of culture medium for 36 h before XTT viability assay. Cell death analysis by flow cytometry was performed as described above in cells treated with 1 μg/ml glycodelins in 500 μl of culture medium for 48 h. For IL-2 analysis, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml glycodelins and stimulated by 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in 500 μl of culture medium for 16 h. The media after incubation were then collected. The cell debris in the conditioned media was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The IL-2 production was determined by ELISA as described above. The viability of the cells at 16 h was also determined by flow cytometry as described above. Determination of Sialidase Activity on Cumulus Cells—The Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster approved the protocol for collection and use of cumulus oophorus in this study. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were obtained from women who underwent treatment with intracytoplasmic sperm injection for male infertility. Human menopausal gonadotropin (Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) was used for ovarian stimulation after down-regulation with buserelin (26Ng E.H. Ajonuma L.C. Lau E.Y. Yeung W.S. Ho P.C. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 15: 772-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cumulus-oocyte complexes were dispersed in 1 ml of 0.1% hyalurondidase in human serum albumin-supplemented G-MOPS™ medium (Vitrolife, Kungsbacka, Sweden) at 37 °C. After digestion, cumulus cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min. The dispersed cumulus cells were then washed twice in TC-199 medium (Sigma) and resuspended to a final concentration of 4 × 106 viable cells/ml. Trypan blue exclusion test was employed to determine the viability of the cells. They were then cultured in 2 ml of TC-199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum as described before (27Chian R.C. Ao A. Clarke H.J. Tulandi T. Tan S.L. Fertil. Steril. 1999; 71: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After 48 h, sialidase activity on the cell surface of cumulus cells was determined using 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate, according to a previously described method (28Azuma Y. Sato H. Higai K. Matsumoto K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2007; 30: 1680-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing with fresh medium, the cells were incubated with 50 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylneuraminic acid in 1 ml of culture medium for 2–8 h at 37 °C. The conditioned medium was then collected, centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min, and the liberated 4-methylumbelliferone in the supernatant was measured using a fluorometer with excitation at 340 nm and emission at 505 nm (Infinite F200, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). Data Analyses—All values were expressed as mean ± S.E. The data were compared by Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc test (Tukey's test) to discern differences between individual groups. The data were analyzed using SigmaStat 2.03 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). A p value < 0.05 was taken as significant. Differential Lectin Binding Properties of Glycodelins—Glycodelin-A, -F, -S, and -C were purified from amniotic fluid, follicular fluid, seminal plasma, and cumulus matrix, respectively (Fig. 1) and were analyzed for lectin binding. The lectin binding properties of glycodelins are shown in Table 1. Consistent with our previous data (5Chiu P.C. Chung M.K. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Ho P.C. Ng E.H. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J.

GdA and GdF had significantly higher affinities to wheat germ agglutinin and Sambucus nigra bark agglutinin than GdC and GdS (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found in ConA, PNA, and RCA120 affinity between the glycodelin isoforms.TABLE 1Binding of lectins with glycodelin-C, -A, -S, and -F Data are presented as means ± S.E.

These studies help establish the mechanism of this new type of specialized protein export pathway. In bacteria, proteins exported beyond the cytosol to the bacterial cell envelope or secreted into the extracellular environment are important for establishing cell wall structure, acquiring nutrients, and responding to changes in the environment. Surface and secreted proteins of bacterial pathogens are also ideally positioned to interact with host cells; consequently, these proteins and the systems that export them are important for virulence (1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Studies of bacterial protein export systems could yield new targets for antimicrobial therapies. Many bacterial pathogens use specialized systems to export virulence factors (2Abdallah A.M. Gey van Pittius N.C. Champion P.A. Cox J. Luirink J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Appelmelk B.J. Bitter W.

Pathog. 2008; 45: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The common constituent of the accessory Sec pathways studied so far is an accessory SecA homolog called SecA2. SecA2 is homologous to the essential SecA (SecA1) that is part of the general Sec pathway present in all bacteria (15Driessen A.J. Nouwen N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 643-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Studies of the general Sec pathway show that the canonical SecA plays a central role in the process of guiding proteins that are synthesized as precursors with N-terminal signal sequences across the cytoplasmic membrane through a channel comprised of the SecYEG proteins (16Papanikou E. Karamanou S. Baud C. Frank M. Sianidis G. Keramisanou D. Kalodimos C.G. Kuhn A. Economou A. J. Biol.

With repeated cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, SecA undergoes conformational changes that allow it to ratchet precursor proteins through the SecYEG translocase (18Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). ATPase activity is essential to SecA function (19Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol.

SecA1 is essential and is the housekeeping SecA of the mycobacterial general Sec pathway (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J.

Mutants with the secA2 gene deleted have been constructed in pathogenic M. tuberculosis and in nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J.

Microbiol. 2003; 48: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The ΔsecA2 mutant of M. tuberculosis is attenuated in mouse and macrophage models of infection, which demonstrates the importance of SecA2 to M. tuberculosis virulence (5Braunstein M. Espinosa B.

Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6979-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analysis comparing exported proteins from wild type versus ΔsecA2 mutant M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis identifies a small number of proteins that depend on SecA2 for export (5Braunstein M.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In M. tuberculosis, the SodA protein is one of the few proteins identified as requiring SecA2 for its secretion (5Braunstein M. Espinosa B. Chan J. Belisle J.T. Jacobs W.R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In M. smegmatis, two lipoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences (Msmeg1712 and Msmeg1704) require SecA2 for their export to the cell wall (24Gibbons H.S. Wolschendorf F. Abshire M. Niederweis M. Braunstein M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both SecA1 and SecA2 have ATP-binding Walker Box motifs, and the purified M. tuberculosis proteins bind and hydrolyze ATP in vitro (25Hou J.M. D’Lima N.G. Rigel N.W. Gibbons H.S. McCann J.R. Braunstein M. Teschke C.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4880-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that M. tuberculosis SecA2 with a mutated Walker Box is defective in ATP binding in vitro (25Hou J.M. D’Lima N.G. Rigel N.W. Gibbons H.S. McCann J.R. Braunstein M. Teschke C.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4880-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To study the biological significance of ATPase activity in vivo, we tested the effect of amino acid substitutions in the Walker Box of SecA2 when expressed in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. The bulk of our studies here focused on a particular Walker Box mutant of M. smegmatis SecA2, SecA2 K129R. We showed SecA2 K129R to be unable to fulfill its role in exporting SecA2-dependent proteins. We further discovered that in several assays SecA2 K129R not only failed to complement ΔsecA2 mutant phenotypes but behaved as a dominant negative. In the process of characterizing the dominant negative SecA2 protein, we showed that wild type SecA2 protein is predominantly localized to the cytosol, which is notably different from the subcellular distribution of SecA1 and SecA2 K129R. The accessory SecA2 system of mycobacteria is unlike the accessory SecA2/Y2 systems of S. gordonii and Streptococcus parasanguinis in that it lacks an accessory SecY2 protein for export (6Rigel N.W. Braunstein M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. Mol.

Without an obvious translocase, we considered the possibility that SecA2 uses the canonical Sec machinery (SecA1/SecYEG) to promote export of its select subset of proteins. Using M. smegmatis strains engineered to deplete SecA1, we showed that export of the SecA2-dependent substrate Msmeg1712 was severely impaired in the absence of SecA1. This result indicates SecA1 is required for SecA2-dependent export. It represents the first piece of evidence indicating a role for a canonical SecA1 in exporting substrates of an accessory SecA2 pathway. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions-M. smegmatis was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 or on 7H10 (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 (Fisher); or Mueller Hinton (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80. M. tuberculosis was grown in 7H9 or on 7H10 supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) glycerol and 1× ADS (0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (w/v) dextrose, and 0.85% (w/v) NaCl). For cultures of mycobacteria, the antibiotics kanamycin (Acros Chemicals) and hygromycin (Roche Applied Science) were added as needed at 20 or 50 μg/ml, respectively. Luria Bertani was used to grow Escherichia coli cultures. When needed, kanamycin or hygromycin was added at 40 or 150 μg/ml, respectively. All of the plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1, and cloned sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill DNA sequencing facility and Eton Biosciences). Throughout this work, mc2155 and H37Rv were used as the wild type strains of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, respectively. NR116 (described below) was used as the ΔsecA2 mutant of M. smegmatis, and mc23112 (5Braunstein M. Espinosa B. Chan J. Belisle J.T. Jacobs W.R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was used as the ΔsecA2 mutant of M. tuberculosis. Construction of ΔsecA2 Mutant M. smegmatis NR116-The previously published M. smegmatis ΔsecA2 mutant (mc22522) is an in-frame, unmarked deletion of approximately one-third of the secA2 gene (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6979-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For this study a complete in-frame unmarked deletion of M. smegmatis secA2 (NR116) was used in which only three codons of the secA2 open reading frame remain. All of the phenotypes observed for mc22522 were also observed for NR116. NR116 was constructed in the following manner: (i) secA2 suicide plasmid pNR6. Sequences immediately upstream of secA2 were PCR-amplified from M. smegmatis genomic DNA using primers 5′-GTCGACCGACAGGTTCCAGCCGTAGAA-3′/5′-GTCGACCACGGCGTCAGTTGTGCCTCG-3′ and sequences immediately downstream of secA2 were PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GTCGACTAGGCCCCAGCCATTAGGTTC-3′/5′-TGATATCGAGCACCTCCCAGCCCCATTC-3′. The upstream PCR product was cloned into the vector pCC1 using the Copy Control PCR cloning kit (Epicenter) to generate pNR3. The downstream PCR product was cloned into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pNR4. A 1087-bp SalI fragment of pNR3 was ligated into SalI-cut pNR4. The resulting plasmid, pNR5, contained a 2385-bp deletion of secA2, leaving only three codons. A 1737-bp MscI-EcoRV fragment containing the secA2 deletion was cut from pNR5 and cloned into the EcoRV site of the counterselectable suicide plasmid pYUB657, yielding vector pNR6. (ii) Two step allelic exchange. The ΔsecA2 mutant strain NR116 was constructed by two-step allelic exchange as described previously (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6979-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Pavelka Jr., M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Braunstein M.

Wild type M. smegmatis strain mc2155 was electroporated with pNR6, and hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected. Transformants were screened by Southern blot to identify a single-cross-over integration of pNR6 at the chromosomal secA2 locus yielding strain SCO5. To resolve the single cross-over strain, a saturated culture of SCO5 was diluted 1:100 into 7H9 without hygromycin and grown overnight at 37 °C. This culture was then plated onto 7H10 supplemented with 4.5% (w/v) sucrose to select against the sacB marker encoded on the backbone of the suicide vector. Sucrose-resistant clones were screened for hygromycin sensitivity. Sucrose-resistant, hygromycin-sensitive clones were screened by Southern blot analysis (data not shown) for evidence of a second recombination event leading to chromosomal deletion of secA2 (30Sambrook J.

Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from M. smegmatis strains and digested with BamHI. The probe used was the 1093-bp PCR product containing the sequence immediately upstream of secA2, used to generate pNR3. The resulting inframe, unmarked ΔsecA2 deletion mutant derived from SCO5 was named NR116. Construction of secA2 Walker Box Mutant Plasmids pNR7 and pNR25-The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the DNA encoding the Walker Boxes of secA2 using plasmid templates pMB162 for M. tuberculosis secA2 and pYA810 for M. smegmatis secA2 (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6979-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Gibbons H.S. Wolschendorf F. Abshire M. Niederweis M. Braunstein M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both pMB162 and pYA810 vectors integrate at the chromosomal attB site of mycobacteria, and both plasmids express their respective secA2 genes from the hsp60 promoter. The Walker A motif of M. tuberculosis SecA2 was mutated in plasmid pMB162 using the following primers: 5′-CGGTGAGGGCAGAACCCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGCAAGGGTTCTGCCCTCACC-3′. The resulting mutant plasmid contained secA2 K115R and was named pNR7. To create the comparable Walker A mutation in M. smegmatis secA2, which is K129R, primers 5′-CGGGTGAGGGCAGGACGCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGCGTCCTGCCCTCACCCG-3′ were used with pYA810 as the template to generate plasmid pNR25. Construction of Inducible secA2 K129R Plasmid pNR54 (Tet ON)-M. smegmatis secA2 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-AGGATCCATCCGGAGGAATCACTT-3′ and 5′-AGGATCCCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGCGGAACACACCCGGCAGG-3′ and cloned into pCC1 to yield pNR52. Next, a 2.4-kb BamHI fragment was cloned from pNR52 into similarly cut pMP715 (kind gift from Dr. Martin Pavelka, University of Rochester). The resulting plasmid pNR53 has the secA2 gene cloned adjacent to the TetO operators. The vector pMP715 is an episomal plasmid that carries the Tet operator sequence from pSE100 (23Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), encodes the TetR repressor protein from pMC1s (31Ehrt S. Guo X.V. Hickey C.M. Ryou M. Monteleone M. Riley L.W. Schnappinger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and carries a kanamycin resistance gene. As with the precursor plasmids pSE100 and pMC1s, plasmid pMP715 can be used to achieve tetracycline regulation of gene expression (23Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using anhydrotetracycline (Atc). 6The abbreviations used are: Atc, anhydrotetracycline; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; SOL, soluble. To mutate Walker Box residue K129, pNR53 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis as described above. The resulting plasmid pNR54 carries secA2 K129R under control of the regulatable promoter. Induction of SecA2 K129R in M. smegmatis transformed with pNR54 was achieved by treating cultures with 100 or 200 ng/ml Atc for 21 h at 37 °C. Construction of Conditional secA1 Strains-As described previously, the SecA1 depletion strain MSE10 was used (23Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For this study, we additionally introduced the conditional secA1 allele into the ΔsecA2 mutant background. NR116 was transformed with the suicide plasmid pKIsecA1 (kind gift from Dr. Sabine Ehrt, Weill Cornell Medical College), and hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected on 7H10 plates. Transformants were screened by Southern blot (data not shown) to detect integration of pKIsecA1 at the native secA1 locus in the chromosome. Genomic DNA was isolated from M. smegmatis strains and digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The probe used was a 410-bp SphI-MscI fragment from pKIsecA1. The resulting strain was named JM693. To achieve regulation of SecA1 in strains MSE10 and JM693, each strain was transformed with pNR55 (described below) and treated with or without 600 ng/ml Atc. Construction of Msmeg1712-HA revTetR Plasmid pNR55 (Tet OFF)-To monitor the effect of SecA1 depletion on export of Msmeg1712-HA, we constructed a plasmid that constitutively expresses both Msmeg1712-HA and the reverse TetR repressor (revTetR). To construct pNR55, a 2392-bp NheI fragment containing revTetR was excised from pTEK-4S0X (23Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and ligated into the NheI site of pHSG85 (24Gibbons H.S. Wolschendorf F. Abshire M. Niederweis M. Braunstein M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). pHSG85 was constructed by cloning a NotI-HindIII fragment containing the msmeg1712 gene and the promoter region from pHSG83 (24Gibbons H.S. Wolschendorf F. Abshire M. Niederweis M. Braunstein M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) into similarly cut pMV261.kan. Vector pNR55 produces Msmeg1712 tagged at the C terminus with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Macrophage Infections-Bone marrow macrophages were elicited from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, as described previously (13Kurtz S. McKinnon K.P. Runge M.S. Ting J.P. Braunstein M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Hou J.M. D’Lima N.G. Rigel N.W. Gibbons H.S. McCann J.R. Braunstein M. Teschke C.M. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4880-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 105 macrophages/well were seeded into 8-well chamber slides. M. tuberculosis strains were grown to mid-exponential phase, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 80, diluted in tissue culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1× nonessential amino acids; Invitrogen), and added to the macrophages at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. Macrophages were infected for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. On days 0, 3, and 5 post-infection, the contents of triplicate wells for each infection were lysed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline 0.05% Tween 80. The lysates were diluted and plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar to enumerate intracellular bacteria during infection. Azide Sensitivity Assay-200 μl of saturated M. smegmatis culture was mixed with 3.5 ml of molten 7H9 top agar and then poured onto a 7H10 bottom agar plate. Sterile 6-mm filter discs were placed onto the surface of the cooled top agar. 10 μl of 0.15 m sodium azide was then added to the disc. The plates were inverted and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C, and the resulting zones of inhibition were measured. Each strain was tested in triplicate. Epitope-tagged Expression Vectors for Msmeg1704 and Msmeg1712-To monitor the export of Msmeg1704 and Msmeg1712, both proteins were tagged with the HA epitope at the C terminus and expressed from hygromycin-resistant episomal plasmids pNR35 (Msmeg 1712-HA) and pNR36 (Msmeg1704-HA) (24Gibbons H.S. Wolschendorf F. Abshire M. Niederweis M. Braunstein M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These vectors were constructed by replacing the kanamycin marker of pHSG51 and pHSG58 with the 1.5-kb SmaI-EcoRV hygromycin resistance fragment from pYUB412. 7S. Bardarov and W. R. Jacobs, Jr., unpublished observation. Subcellular Fractionation-To determine the subcellular localization of proteins in M. smegmatis, we fractionated bacterial whole cell lysates as described previously (24Gibbons H.S. Wolschendorf F. Abshire M. Niederweis M. Braunstein M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were generated by five passages through a French pressure cell. For Msmeg1704-HA and Msmeg1712-HA localization, the lysates were separated by differential ultracentrifugation into cell wall (27,000 × g pellet), membrane (100,000 × g pellet), and soluble (100,000 × g supernatant) fractions. For SecA1 and SecA2 localization experiments, the lysates were separated into cell envelope (100,000 × g pellet) and soluble (100,000 × g supernatant) fractions. In all cases, protein derived from the same amount of starting cells for each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots. Immunoblot Conditions-The anti-SecA2 (23Guo X.V. Monteleone M.

Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)), and anti-HA (Covance) antibodies were used at 1:20,000 dilutions. The anti-SecA1 antibody (23Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:50,000 dilution. In some experiments, secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) were used along with Western Lightening Chemiluminescent detection reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For quantitative westerns, secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used and detected using the ECF reagent (GE Healthcare). Fluorescence was quantified using a phosphorimager and ImageQuant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics). M. smegmatis Is a Valid Model for Studying the M. tuberculosis SecA2 System-Because of the challenges that accompany working with M. tuberculosis (slow growth and Biosafety Level 3 practices), the fast growing nonpathogen M. smegmatis is often used as a model mycobacterium (33Reyrat J.M. Kahn D. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 472-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M. smegmatis has a functional SecA2 export system (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that M. tuberculosis SecA2 can function in M. smegmatis as demonstrated by the ability of M. tuberculosis SecA2 to complement phenotypes of an M. smegmatis ΔsecA2 mutant (4Braunstein M. Brown A.M. Kurtz S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6979-6990Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate functional conservation between the M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis SecA2 systems, we tested the ability of M. smegmatis SecA2 to function in M. tuberculosis. M. smegmatis secA2 Complements the Macrophage Growth Defect of a M. tuberculosis ΔsecA2 Mutant-M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv can grow inside macrophages over a period of several days, whereas the ΔsecA2 mutant is defective in intracellular growth (13Kurtz S. McKinnon K.P. Runge M.S. Ting J.P. Braunstein M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of M. smegmatis SecA2 to function in M. tuberculosis by infecting murine bone marrow-derived macrophages with wild type M. tuberculosis (H37Rv), the ΔsecA2 mutant mc23112, the ΔsecA2 mutant complemented with wild type M. tuberculosis secA2 (ΔsecA2/Mtb secA2), or the ΔsecA2 mutant expressing wild type M. smegmatis secA2 (ΔsecA2/Msm secA2) (Fig. 1). As shown previously (13Kurtz S. McKinnon K.P. Runge M.S. Ting J.P. Braunstein M. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), H37Rv and the ΔsecA2 mutant complemented with M. tuberculosis secA2 grew similarly in macrophages over a 5-day period of infection, whereas the ΔsecA2 mutant failed to grow in these macrophages. Introduction of M. smegmatis secA2 encoded on pYA810 in single copy at the chromosomal attB site also enabled the ΔsecA2 mut"
https://openalex.org/W2144310197,"Deletions spanning chromosome 5q31.2 are among the most common recurring cytogenetic abnormalities detectable in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Prior genomic studies have suggested that haploinsufficiency of multiple 5q31.2 genes may contribute to MDS pathogenesis. However, this hypothesis has never been formally tested. Therefore, we designed this study to systematically and comprehensively evaluate all 28 chromosome 5q31.2 genes and directly test whether haploinsufficiency of a single 5q31.2 gene may result from a heterozygous nucleotide mutation or microdeletion. We selected paired tumor (bone marrow) and germline (skin) DNA samples from 46 de novo MDS patients (37 without a cytogenetic 5q31.2 deletion) and performed total exonic gene resequencing (479 amplicons) and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). We found no somatic nucleotide changes in the 46 MDS samples, and no cytogenetically silent 5q31.2 deletions in 20/20 samples analyzed by array CGH. Twelve novel single nucleotide polymorphisms were discovered. The mRNA levels of 7 genes in the commonly deleted interval were reduced by 50% in CD34+ cells from del(5q) MDS samples, and no gene showed complete loss of expression. Taken together, these data show that small deletions and/or point mutations in individual 5q31.2 genes are not common events in MDS, and implicate haploinsufficiency of multiple genes as the relevant genetic consequence of this common deletion."
https://openalex.org/W2053364778,"Accumulation of expanded polyglutamine proteins is considered to be a major pathogenic biomarker of Huntington disease. We isolated SCAMP5 as a novel regulator of cellular accumulation of expanded polyglutamine track protein using cell-based aggregation assays. Ectopic expression of SCAMP5 augments the formation of ubiquitin-positive and detergent-resistant aggregates of mutant huntingtin (mtHTT). Expression of SCAMP5 is markedly increased in the striatum of Huntington disease patients and is induced in cultured striatal neurons by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or by mtHTT. The increase of SCAMP5 impairs endocytosis, which in turn enhances mtHTT aggregation. On the contrary, down-regulation of SCAMP5 alleviates ER stress-induced mtHTT aggregation and endocytosis inhibition. Moreover, stereotactic injection into the striatum and intraperitoneal injection of tunicamycin significantly increase mtHTT aggregation in the striatum of R6/2 mice and in the cortex of N171-82Q mice, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that exposure to ER stress increases SCAMP5 in the striatum, which positively regulates mtHTT aggregation via the endocytosis pathway.

Thus, it seems that HD pathology is closely correlated with the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of mutant huntingtin (mtHTT) containing expanded polyQ (2.Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is crucial in many biological responses and is generated by various signals, such as unfolded protein response, aberrant calcium regulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation (10.Høyer-Hansen M. Jäättelä M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 11.Yoshida H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 630-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). ER stress response is generally considered an adaptive reaction of cells to environmental stress, serving as a survival signal (10.Høyer-Hansen M. Jäättelä M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). On the other hand, increasing evidence also strengthens the importance of ER stress in human diseases. A malfunction or excess of ER stress response caused by aging, genetic mutations, and environmental insults is implicated in human diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, diabetes mellitus, and inflammation (12.Uehara T.

However, the molecular event linking the aggregation of polyQ track protein to ER stress response is unknown. The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, a major protein degradation system, is altered or impaired in the cell culture model of HD (20.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R.

On the contrary, autophagy employing lysosomal degradation has been recently considered as a major clearance pathway of insoluble aggregates of polyQ track protein. Thus, inhibition of autophagy has been suggested to modulate the aggregate formation of mtHTT and to affect the toxicity of polyglutamine expansions in fly and mouse models of HD (23.Ravikumar B.

However, a key molecule controlling the aggregation and clearance of polyQ track proteins needs to be identified. To further our understanding of the regulation of polyQ track protein aggregation, we screened human full-length cDNAs and isolated SCAMP5 (secretory carrier membrane protein 5) as a modulator of polyQ track protein aggregation. SCAMP5 is up-regulated by mtHTT and ER stress and functions to inhibit endocytosis to increase mtHTT aggregation. Human cDNA Collections—Total RNAs were purified from neuronal cells and tumor samples. The full-length cDNA library was constructed by PCR-based oligocapping methods (45.Suzuki Y. Ishihara D. Sasaki M. Nakagawa H. Hata H. Tsunoda T. Watanabe M. Komatsu T. Ota T. Isogai T. Suyama A. Sugano S. Genomics. 2000; 64: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pCNS-D2 mammalian expression vector. Individual cDNA was identified by DNA sequencing analysis and annotated. A group of 2,200 cDNA clones including 600 kinase cDNAs was selected, and another group of 2,000 cDNA clones in pCMV6 was purchased from OriGene, Inc. Plasmid Constructions—Human SCAMP5 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the HindIII site of pEGFP-N1 (pGFP-S5), pcDNA-HA (pSCAMP5-HA), or pDsRed-Monomer-C1 (pmRFP-S5; Clontech) in a sense or antisense orientation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused polyglutamine (n = 110) (p110Q-GFP) was constructed by subcloning the PCR product into pEGFP-C1. Deletion mutants (D1–D4) were constructed by subcloning of the PCR products containing respective amino acid residues of human SCAMP5 into pcDNA-HA and pEGFP-N1. Human SCAMP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the KpnI site of pcDNA-HA (pSCAMP1-HA). The pSCAMP1-(1–149)/5 chimera was constructed by subcloning the PCR products of the SCAMP5 and SCAMP1 fragment (1–447 bp) into the KpnI and HindIII sites of pcDNA-HA. Cell-based Functional Screening—For primary screening, HEK293F cells grown in a 96-well culture plate were co-transfected with pDsRed-Monomer-C1, pHTTex120Q-GFP (or p110Q-GFP), and an individual cDNA in a mammalian expression vector. GFP-positive cells were observed for 18, 24, and 36 h under a fluorescence microscope for the aggregation of polyQ track protein. Transfection efficiency was normalized by that of RFP. For a secondary screening, the putative positive clones were examined again for their overexpression and knockdown effects on the aggregation of polyQ track protein. Primary Culture of Striatal, Cortical, and Hippocampal Neurons—The striatal, cortical, and hippocampal tissues of rat embryonic day 16 brain were dissociated by incubating with 0.01% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and plated on culture dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (0.01% in 100 mm borate buffer, pH 8.5) (Sigma) in Neurobasal™ medium containing 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen). Neurons grown in vitro for 3 days were transfected with the appropriate DNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (32.Chang J.W. Choi H. Kim H.J. Jo D.G. Jeon Y.J. Noh J.Y. Park W.J. Jung Y.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat primary neurons were grown on a coverslip coated with poly-l-lysine, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the samples were incubated with anti-SCAMP5 (Abcam), anti-CHOP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-ubiquitin antibody (Zymed Laboratories, Inc. and Chemicon) at room temperature for 1 h. After reaction with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), samples were examined with an UltraVIEW confocal imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an Eclipse TE 2000-U microscope (Nikon). Immunohistochemistry—Sectioned brain tissues were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Thereafter, the tissues were incubated with anti-mtHTT antibody (EM48, Chemicon) and anti-SCAMP5 or anti-GRP78 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Western Blotting—Protein samples in buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting as described (39.Song S. Kim S.Y. Hong Y.M. Jo D.G. Lee J.Y. Shim S.M. Chung C.W. Seo S.J. Yoo Y.J. Koh J.Y. Lee M.C. Yates A.J. Ichijo H. Jung Y.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For preparation of insoluble fractions, cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 400 × g for 3 min. The pellets were washed with lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and resuspended in a volume of PBS equal to the volume of supernatant. Post-mortem Brain Samples—Striatum samples from five HD patients (grade 3) and three age-matched controls were from Boston University School of Medicine (Bedford, MA). R6/2 Mice—R6/2 mice, which are transgenic for exon 1 of the human HD gene, carrying about 115–150 glutamine repeats (The Jackson Laboratory), and their wild-type littermates were used at 9-week age ranges. Generation of Stable Cells—SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with SCAMP5 short hairpin RNA (OpenBiosystem: TRCN0000105535∼TRCN0000105538) for 24 h and then incubated with 3 μg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen) for 5 days for the generation of mixed cell populations (SH-SY5Y/ctrl and SH-SY5Y/35–38). HTT 103Q-GFP/PC12 cells (Htt14A2.5/ecdysone-inducible PC12 cells) were kindly provided by Dr. L. M. Thompson (University of California). Transferrin Uptake Assay—Cells were grown on a coverslip coated with poly-l-lysine and starved for 30 min. Thereafter, cells were incubated with Alexa 594-labeled transferrin (25 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) for 15 min, washed three times with ice-cold PBS on ice, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for observation under a confocal microscope. Cell Death Assay—Cells were stained with 5 μm ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes) for 10 min and then examined under fluorescence microscope. Functional Isolation of SCAMP5 as an Enhancer of mtHTT Aggregation—To find out new regulators of polyQ track protein aggregation, we screened 4,200 human full-length cDNAs in the expression vector with cell-based assays. We examined overexpression effects of each clone on the aggregation of GFP-fused polyglutamine (n = 110) (poly110Q-GFP) or GFP-fused segment of HTT exon 1 containing expanded polyglutamine (n = 120) (HTTex120Q-GFP) (26.Kim M. Lee H.S. LaForet G. McIntyre C. Martin E.J. Chang P. Kim T.W. Williams M. Reddy P.H. Tagle D. Boyce F.M. Won L. Heller A. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 964-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these polyQ track constructs were expressed in cells, GFP allowed the detection of expression, aggregation, and subcellular localization of the chimera under a fluorescence microscope. During the screening, transfection efficiency, which was normalized by co-transfection with monomeric RFP (mRFP), was relatively even for the clones, and GFP-positive dots were counted as aggregates of the polyQ track protein. We confirmed HTTex120Q-GFP dots as protein aggregates with immunostaining assays using antiubiquitin antibody and detergent-resistant assays (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). From the secondary screening, we isolated 24 putative positive clones that regulate the aggregation of polyQ track protein in cell culture (data not shown). In particular, SCAMP5 exhibited strong effects on the aggregation of HTTex120Q-GFP in a dose-dependent manner during secondary screening (supplemental Fig. S1A). SCAMP5 is believed to be a vesicle membrane protein with unclear functions (30.Fernández-Chacón R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shows brain-specific expression. Thus, a role for SCAMP5 was assessed in detail. Ectopic expression of SCAMP5 increased the number of cells showing HTTex120Q-GFP aggregates in the primary striatal neurons (Fig. 1A), SH-SY5Y neuronal cells (supplemental Fig. S1A) and HEK293F non-neuronal cells (supplemental Fig. S1D), but did not enhance the aggregation of huntingtin exon 1 containing a normal length of polyQ (n = 18) (Fig. 1B). By employing ecdysone-inducible long term expression of the GFP-tagged mutant huntingtin fragment encoding exon 1 with 103 glutamines (HTT 103Q-GFP) in PC12 neuronal cells (27.Apostol B.L. Kazantsev A. Raffioni S. Illes K. Pallos J. Bodai L. Slepko N. Bear J.E. Gertler F.B. Hersch S. Housman D.E. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we also observed that the number of cells with HTT 103Q-GFP aggregates was increased 4-fold by the expression of SCAMP5 (Fig. 1C). This SCAMP5-mediated aggregation of HTTex120Q-GFP was increased in a dose-dependent manner in AF5 striatal neuronal cells (28.Truckenmiller M.E. Vawter M.P. Zhang P. Conejero-Goldberg C. Dillon-Carter O. Morales N. Cheadle C. Becker K.G. Freed W.J. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 318-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (data not shown). SCAMP5 Is Increased in Striatum of HD Patients and in Cultured Cells by ER Stress—Next, we determined the expression level of SCAMP5 in the striatum of HD patients. SCAMP5 was markedly increased in the striatum of HD patients (grade 3) compared with age-matched controls (Fig. 1D). In addition, the level of SCAMP5 was also increased at day 6 in PC12 neuronal cells by ecdysone-inducible expression of HTT 103Q-GFP (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, an ER stress marker, CHOP, was induced by HTT 103Q-GFP (Fig. 1E), which prompted us to examine the interaction between ER stress and polyQ track protein aggregation. Notably, we found that SCAMP5 was highly induced in the primary striatal neurons in response to ER stress triggered by tunicamycin (an inhibitor of protein glycosylation), thapsigargin (an ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor), or A23187 (a Ca2+ ionophore) but not in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2A). We also found that the expression of SCAMP5 was induced in SH-SY5Y and AF5 neuronal cell lines exposed to ER stress (data not shown). From reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, we observed that the mRNA level of SCAMP5 was not significantly changed by thapsigargin and tunicamycin (data not shown), suggesting that the increase of SCAMP5 may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. ER Stress Induces the Aggregation of mtHTT via SCAMP5—We then examined the effects of ER stress on the aggregation of mtHTT. Exposure to thapsigargin highly increased the aggregation of HTTex120Q-GFP in the primary striatal neurons (3.5-fold) (Fig. 2B) and in the NeuN-positive primary striatal neurons (data not shown) but not in the hippocampal neurons. Similarly, thapsigargin significantly increased both SCAMP5 expression and HTTex120Q-GFP aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2C). Next, we generated stable SH-SY5Y cell lines showing the reduced expression of SCAMP5 (SH-SY5Y/37) with short hairpin RNA (TRCN0000105537) (Fig. 2C, lower panel). The expression of SCAMP5 was not increased in SH-SY5Y/37 cells in response to thapsigargin compared with control cells (SH-SY5Y/ctrl). (Fig. 2C, lower panel). We also found that thapsigargin-induced aggregation of HTTex120Q-GFP was not increased in SH-SY5Y/37 cells (Fig. 2C, upper panel). These observations suggest that the expression level of SCAMP5 is critical for the regulation of ER stress-induced aggregation of HTTex120Q-GFP. In addition, thapsigargin treatment increased both SCAMP5 expression and ubiquitin-positive cytosolic aggregates in the primary striatal neurons cultured from newborn R6/2 HD model mice (29.Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, direct injection of tunicamycin into the striatum of R6/2 mice increased EM48-positive and nuclear aggregation of mtHTT (arrows) as well as the expression of SCAMP5 and GRP78 in the same cells of striatal sections (Fig. 3B). In parallel, intraperitoneal injection of tunicamycin enhanced nuclear aggregation of mtHTT in the cortex of N171-82Q mice (data not shown). SCAMP5 Induces mtHTT Aggregation via Endocytosis Inhibition—SCAMP5 shows significant amino acid sequence identity (45–57%) with other members of the SCAMP family. The observation that the N-terminal deletion mutant of SCAMP1 has a structural similarity with SCAMP5 and exhibits the inhibitory effect on receptor-mediated endocytosis led us to examine the effect of SCAMP5 on endocytosis (31.Fernández-Chacón R. Achiriloaie M. Janz R. Albanesi J.P. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12752-12756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We found that thapsigargin treatment inhibited transferrin uptake in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4A). However, this inhibition of transferrin uptake was alleviated in SH-SY5Y/37 cells, which express reduced amounts of SCAMP5. Likewise, thapsigargin inhibited transferrin uptake in the primary striatal neurons (supplemental Fig. S2A). In addition, ectopic expression of SCAMP5 also suppressed transferrin uptake to 70% of control cells in the primary striatal neurons and AF5 cells (Fig. 4B) as well as in SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the increased expression of SCAMP5 impairs receptor-mediated endocytosis. To define the domain(s) responsible for endocytosis inhibition and mtHTT aggregation, several deletion mutants of SCAMP5 (SCAMP5-D) were generated (Fig. 4C, left panel). Like the wild type, the SCAMP5-D4 mutant lacking the C terminus effectively inhibited endocytosis and mtHTT aggregation. However, further deletion from the C terminus, such as SCAMP5-D3 mutant losing transmembrane domain 4, abrogated the ability of SCAMP5 to inhibit endocytosis and to induce mtHTT aggregation, whereas deletion of transmembrane domains 3 and 4 seems to partially recover these activities. These results show a good correlation between the ability of SCAMP5 to inhibit endocytosis and to increase mtHTT aggregation, and most regions of SCAMP5, except the C-terminal tail region spanning residues 167–235, are required for the aggregation of mtHTT (Fig. 4C, right panel). Also, the association of endocytosis inhibition with the increased aggregation of mtHTT was evident in our analysis employing the endocytosis inhibitor. Dynamin K44A mutant, a dominant-negative mutant of endocytosis induced SDS-insoluble aggregates of mtHTT (supplemental Fig. S2B). These data support our hypothesis that the inhibition of endocytosis pathway by SCAMP5 may be critical to regulate the aggregation of mtHTT. SCAMP1 has multiple NPF (asparagine-proline-phenylalanine) repeats, which are known as binding partners of the EPS15 homology domain of intersectin in its N terminus. To obtain further insight into a role of SCAMP5 in endocytosis, a chimera (SCAMP1-(1–149)/5) was generated by fusing the N terminus of the SCAMP1-(1–149)-containing NPF repeats with SCAMP5 (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Compared with SCAMP5, ectopic expression of the SCAMP1-(1–149)/5 chimera was much less able to induce mtHTT aggregation and to inhibit endocytosis (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Also, addition of the N terminus of SCAMP1 did not change the subcellular localization of SCAMP5 (supplemental Fig. S2C). SCAMP5 was reported to be located in synaptic vesicles (30.Fernández-Chacón R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and located in the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S2C). These results support our proposal that the SCAMP5-mediated inhibition of endocytosis is linked to mtHTT aggregation and suggest that SCAMP5 may function as a negative regulator of endocytosis. In addition, ectopic expression of SCAMP5 was not toxic to cells (Fig. 5, A and B) but enhanced the toxicity of mtHTT when coexpressed with mtHTT in neuronal cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the SCAMP5-mediated increase of mtHTT aggregation may be linked to the neurotoxic activity of mtHTT. Despite the discrepancy between polyQ track protein aggregation and neurodegeneration (33.Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 34.Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar), cellular aggregation of expanded polyQ track protein is considered as a major pathogenic factor in polyglutamine disease (2.Zoghbi H.Y.

Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Genome-wide functional screenings have been performed by several groups. Hundreds of huntingtin-interacting proteins were isolated using pulldown and yeast two-hybrid assays (36.Kaltenbach L.S. Romero E. Becklin R.R. Chettier R. Bell R. Phansalkar A. Strand A. Torcassi C. Savage J. Hurlburt A. Cha G.H. Ukani L. Chepanoske C.L. Zhen Y. Sahasrabudhe S. Olson J. Kurschner C. Ellerby L.M. Peltier J.M. Botas J. Hughes R.E. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e82Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Also, modifiers of ataxin-3 neurodegeneration and polyglutamine aggregation were screened with thousands of fly (37.Bilen J. Bonini N.M. PLoS Genet. 2007; 10: 1950-1964Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans mutant lines (38.Nollen E.A. Garcia S.M. van Haaften G. Kim S. Chavez A. Morimoto R.I. Plasterk R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We isolated 24 enhancers of polyQ track protein aggregation using cell-based assay. Compared with the previous screenings, many genes functioning in the protein and vesicle transport process were isolated from our assays, and the aggregation enhancers identified here did not much overlap with those isolated by the other group. Despite some limitation of the overexpression and relative expression levels of each clone, our screening using cDNA overexpression can be an effective way to isolate new modifiers of polyglutamine disease. The three SCAMP proteins (SCAMP1–3) share a common domain structure composed of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain with multiple NPF repeats, four highly conserved transmembrane regions, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Interestingly, SCAMP4 and SCAMP5 lack the N-terminal NPF repeats that are highly conserved in all other SCAMP proteins (30.Fernández-Chacón R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, SCAMP5 was most potent in increasing mtHTT aggregation (data not shown). SCAMP5 is apparently induced in AF5 and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells by ER stress. ER stress-induced up-regulation of SCAMP5 was also evident in the striatum and cortex tissues and in cultured primary striatal and cortical cells. Interestingly, polyQ track protein is able to induce ER stress and to increase the expression of SCAMP5. Thus, ER stress, which was also observed by other groups to be generated by mtHTT (17.Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 18.Kouroku Y. Fujita E. Jimbo A. Kikuchi T. Yamagata T. Momoi M.Y. Kominami E. Kuida K. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Momoi T.

Cell Res. 2008; 314: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), may be mediated by SCAMP5. This regulation may form a positive feedback loop to accelerate the aggregation of polyQ track protein. Furthermore, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α and oxidative stress, such as H2O2, was also able to increase the expression of SCAMP5 in cultured cells (data not shown). Thus, we hypothesize that the increase of SCAMP5 in the brains of HD patients may be caused by pathogenic stresses, including ER stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress as well as genetic alteration in huntingtin and may contribute to the accumulation of polyQ track proteins for neurotoxicity (Fig. 5C). Autophagy is getting more attention as a clearance pathway of polyQ track protein. Inhibition of autophagy increases aggregate formation of mtHTT (23.Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 25.Williams A. Jahreissa L. Sarkara S. Saikia S. Menziesa M.F. Ravikumara B. Rubinsztein D.C. Curr. Top. Dev.

Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). The autophagic process initiates with the formation of autophagic vesicles (23.Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 24.Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C.

Recent papers show that the perturbation of endocytosis causes malfunction of autophagic clearance (41.Lee J.A. Beigneux A. Ahmad S.T. Young S.G. Gao F.B. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1561-1567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 42.Rusten T.E. Vaccari T. Lindmo K. Rodahl L.M. Nezis I.P. Sem-Jacobsen C. Wendler F. Vincent J.P.

Fisher E.M. Isaacs A. Brech A. Stenmark H. Simonsen A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), suggesting that endocytosis may be tightly associated with the autophagic process. Thus, we suggest that the inhibition of endocytosis by SCAMP5 may reduce lysosomal degradation of polyQ track protein by autophagic clearance, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, we found a large portion of endocytotic proteins (33%) and signal transduction proteins (33%) to be effective modulators of mtHTT aggregation such as RAB4A (member of the Ras oncogene family), RABGEF1 (RAB guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1), SEC23B (Sec23 homolog B), SEC24D (SEC24-related gene family, member D), SMAP1 (stromal membrane-associated protein 1), and Slp2 (synaptotagmin-like protein 2) from our cell-based assay. Thus, vesicle transport, including endocytosis, seems to be required for the maintenance of lysosomal biogenesis (46.Hennig K.M. Colombani J. Neufeld T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and for autophagic clearance (44.Nielsen R. Courtoy P.J. Jacobsen C. Dom G. Lima W.R. Jadot M. Willnow T.E. Devuyst O. Christensen E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although molecular detail on how the increased expression of SCAMP5 regulates endocytosis remains to be further addressed, we propose that SCAMP5-mediated interference of endocytosis may affect lysosomal activity, which eventually impairs the removal process of mtHTT aggregates. Taken together, these results elucidate that SCAMP5 is a key regulatory molecule linking ER stress to the aggregation of polyQ track protein via endocytosis modulation. We thank Dr. L. M.

https://openalex.org/W2022503985,"S5a/Rpn10 is a ubiquitin (Ub)-binding protein that is a subunit of the 26S proteasome but also exists free in the cytosol. It binds poly-Ub chains through its two Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs). We discovered that, unlike typical substrates of Ub ligases (E3s), S5a can be ubiquitinated by all E3s tested including multimeric and monomeric Ring finger E3s (MuRF1, Siah2, Parkin, APC, and SCFβTRCP1), the U-box E3, CHIP, and HECT domain E3s (E6AP and Nedd4) when assayed with UbcH5 or related Ub-conjugating enzymes. However, the E2s, UbcH1 and UbcH13/Uev1a, which function by distinct mechanisms, do not support S5a ubiquitination. Thus, S5a can be used for assay of probably all E3s with UbcH5. Ubiquitination of S5a results from its binding to Ub chains on the E3 (after self-ubiquitination) or on the substrate, as a mutant lacking the UIM domain was not ubiquitinated. Furthermore, if the S5a UIM domains were fused to GST, the protein was rapidly ubiquitinated by MuRF1 and CHIP. In addition, polyubiquitination (but not monoubiquitination) of MuRF1 allowed S5a to bind to MuRF1 and accelerated S5a ubiquitination. This tendency of S5a to associate with the growing Ub chain can explain how S5a, unlike typical substrates, which are recognized by certain E3s through specific motifs, is ubiquitinated by all E3s tested and is rapidly degraded in vivo.

In eukaryotes, ubiquitination of proteins plays a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes ranging from cell cycle and antigen presentation to gene transcription (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar, 2Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). A primary biochemical function of ubiquitination is to serve as a substrate recognition mechanism that targets specific proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. This large complex degrades most cellular proteins in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of protein requires the sequential action of three types of enzymes. First, the Ub-activating enzyme (E1) 3The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; Ub, ubiquitin; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; UIM, ubiquitin interacting motif; APC, anaphase-promoting complex; CHIP, C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; SCF, Skp1-Cullin-F-box ubiquitin ligase; MeUb, methylated Ub; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MS, mass spectrometry. activates the ubiquitin (Ub) in an ATP-dependent reaction and forms a thioester bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of the Ub and a cysteine on the E1. The activated Ub is then transferred to a cysteine residue on a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and finally, a Ub-protein ligase (E3) facilitates formation of an isopeptide linkage between the C terminus of the Ub and a lysine residue on the substrate or on the preceding Ub (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). In the final step, the Ub ligase (E3) binds both the substrate and the Ub∼E2 thioester and thus determines which substrate is ubiquitinated. E3s can be classified into two types based on their mechanism of transferring Ub to the substrate. One type, which comprises most E3s, contains a Ring motif (or the related U-box motif) and facilitates transfer of the activated Ub directly from the E2 to the substrate (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). The second type contains a HECT domain, which forms a thioester intermediate with Ub and then transfers the Ub to the substrate (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of different E3s (probably hundreds), and each E3 is believed to recognize only a limited number of proteins as substrates (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). In most cases the E3 recognizes a specific structure or amino acid sequence in the substrate (often termed the “degron”) (3Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). For example, the “N-end rule” E3, Ubr-1, recognizes particular types of amino acids at the N terminus of the substrates (4Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), whereas the E3 SCFCdc4 complex recognizes a specific phosphorylated amino acid sequence in its substrate, Sic1 (5Nash P.

Cells contain a variety of proteins that non-covalently bind Ub or Ub chains through several distinct Ub binding domains (6Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins have been reported to become ubiquitinated in cells or in vitro, and deletion or mutation of Ub binding domains abolishes their ubiquitination (6Hicke L. Schubert H.L.

Interestingly, ubiquitination of some of these proteins reportedly blocks their binding to other ubiquitinated proteins and seems to reduce the activities of these Ub-binding proteins (9Meray R.K.

However, despite an increasing number of reports about ubiquitination of Ub-binding proteins, only a few studies have identified E2s and E3s responsible for this process (8Polo S. Sigismund S.

S5a/Rpn10 is a major Ub-binding protein that binds preferentially to poly-Ub chains (13Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is found as a subunit of the 26S proteasome, but unlike other proteasome subunits, S5a exists predominantly as a free protein in the cytosol (i.e. not incorporated into the proteasome) (14van Nocker S.

S5a contains two stretches of about 15 amino acids called the ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) which is responsible for its affinity for the Ub chains (16Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M.

In yeast, the homolog of S5a, Rpn10, is required for degradation of a subset of cellular proteins by the proteasome (14van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D.

While investigating how the presence of free S5a affects ubiquitination of typical substrates of E3s, we observed that S5a can be ubiquitinated by two very different E3s (MuRF1 and CHIP) with the E2, UbcH5. Because a substrate is usually ubiquitinated by only a particular E3 and because these two enzymes recognize substrates by distinct mechanisms, this observation suggests that S5a interacts with E3s in an atypical manner. The present study demonstrates systematically that a large variety of E3s, which differ widely in enzymatic mechanism, size, structure, and specificity, can ubiquitinate S5a provided they function with UbcH5 and related E2s. S5a, thus, can be considered as a new type of substrate that is ubiquitinated by a novel mechanism involving the association of S5a with growing poly-Ub chains.

The GST fusion UIM domain of S5a, MJD1, KIAA1594, KIAA1386, Eps15, and Epsin were subcloned from yellow fluorescent protein-UIMs (7Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for His6-Parkin and GST-Mdm2 were generated by using cDNAs inserted into pGEX-6X expression plasmids. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Most proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)STAR) by induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 or 25 °C for 14 h. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline with a French press, and the crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. All GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione 4B-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and all His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). His6-E1 was purified with Ub-agarose (Sigma) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 2 mm ATP). UbcH5 was purified with Ub-agarose in lysis buffer containing 10 nm E1. The SCFβTRCP1 complex was purified from SF9 insect cells expressing His-Cul1, myc-Rbx1, myc-Skp1, and FLAG-βTRCP1 isolated as previously described (25Skowyra D. Koepp D.M. Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). APCCdc20 was immunoprecipitated from Xenopus oocytes, as described by Kirkpatrick et al. (26Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of S5a—To radiolabel S5a by 125I, 150 μl of 70 μm purified His10-S5a in phosphate-buffered saline was first incubated with IODO-BEADS (Pierce) for 5 min at room temperature. Then 250 μl of 0.5 mCi of 125I in phosphate-buffered saline was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Free iodine was removed with a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). To metabolically label S5a, His10-S5a was expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3)STAR) in media containing [35S]methionine, and the 35S-labeled S5a was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described above. Ubiquitination Assays—To assay the ubiquitination of S5a, 400 nm His10-S5a was incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min with 20 nm E1, 350–700 nm E2, 150–700 nm E3, and 58 μm Ub in conjugation buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The same procedure was performed for the ubiquitination of GST-UIMs. To ubiquitinate S5a by SCFβTRCP1, 200 nm His10-S5a was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with 230 nm E1, 1.5 μm UbcH5c, 58 μm Ub, 1 μm Ub-aldehyde, 6 nm SCFβTRCP1, 12 nm Nedd8, 6 nm UbcH12, and 6 nm Nedd8-activating enzyme in conjugation buffer A supplemented with 5 mm NaF, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 5 μm creatine kinase. To measure ubiquitination of S5a by Parkin, 200 nm His10-S5a was incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min with 400 nm E1, 5 μm UbcH7, 1.4 μm Parkin, and 200 μm Ub in conjugation buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP). To study ubiquitination of S5a by Mdm2, 1 μm of His10-S5a was incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min with 400 nm E1, 5 μm UbcH5c, 900 nm GST-Mdm2, and 200 μm Ub in the conjugation buffer B. To measure ubiquitination of troponin I, 400 nm troponin I was incubated at 37 °C for 30–120 min with 20 nm E1, 350 nm E2, 150 nm GST-MuRF1, and 58 μm Ub in conjugation buffer A. Ubiquitination of S5a by APC was assayed as described by Kirkpatrick et al. (26Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Binding of S5a to Immobilized MuRF1—GST-MuRF1 from 1 liter of E. coli culture was immobilized on 400 μl (bed volume) of glutathione resin and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The resin was equilibrated with conjugation buffer A. Then E1 was added to reach final concentrations of 20 nm, 350 nm UbcH5c, 58 μm Ub, and 2 mm ATP. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. A control sample was incubated in the same manner without E1, UbcH5c, or Ub. After incubation, the resin was washed 3 times with 40 bed volumes of Ub binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KCl, pH 7.0, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The resin was then equilibrated with Ub binding buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 5 μl of the resin was mixed with 125I-S5a at a final concentration of 400 nm and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was then transferred to a spin column (Bio-Rad) and washed twice with 500 μl of Ub binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, and the radioactive 125I-S5a in the eluate was measured using a gamma counter. A similar experiment was performed under conditions where GST-MuRF1 and S5a were ubiquitinated in the same test tube. GST-MuRF1 immobilized on the glutathione resin was prepared as above, and 125I-S5a (400 nm) was added to reach final concentrations of 20 nm E1, 350 nm UbcH5c, 58 μm Ub, and 2 mm ATP. In the control reaction, Ub was not included in the mixture. The mixtures were rotated at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken every 15 min. The resin was washed, and the bound S5a was measured as described above. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—His10-S5a was ubiquitinated by GST-MuRF1 or GST-E6AP as described above. The sample was resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue. The upper portion of the gel, corresponding to ubiquitinated S5a, was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel and analyzed by liquid chromatography MS/MS. Peptides were separated across a 50-min gradient ranging from 7 to 30% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in a microcapillary (125 μm × 18 cm) column packed with C18 reverse-phase material (Magic C18AQ, 5-μm particles, 200-Å pore size, Michrom Bioresources) and analyzed on-line on a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo-Electron). For each cycle, one full MS scan acquired on the Orbitrap at high mass resolution was followed by 10 MS/MS spectra on the linear ion trap from the 10 most abundant ions. MS/MS spectra were searched using the Sequest algorithm against the human IPI protein data base. Dynamic modifications of 114.0429275 Da on lysine was allowed for ubiquitination. All peptide matches were initially filtered based on enzyme specificity, mass measurement error, Xcorr and dCorr scores and further manually validated for peptide identification and site localization. All E3s Tested Can Ubiquitinate S5a—During recent studies, we observed that S5a was rapidly ubiquitinated by the E2, UbcH5, functioning with two different ubiquitin ligases, the muscle specific Ring finger E3, MuRF1, which is induced in atrophying muscles (27Kedar V. McDonough H. Arya R. Li H.H. Rockman H.A. Patterson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 18135-18140Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and the U-box E3, CHIP, which ubiquitinates unfolded proteins bound to Hsp70 (28Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 29Kim H.T. Kim K.P. Lledias F. Kisselev A.F. Scaglione K.M. Skowyra D. Gygi S.P. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17375-17386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We, therefore, speculated that S5a, unlike typical substrates, can be ubiquitinated by many different types of E3s. To test this possibility, we initially examined whether S5a could be a substrate of the E2, UbcH5, with several types of monomeric Ring E3s, including MuRF1, Siah2 (which is involved in apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α (21Habelhah H. Frew I.J. Laine A. Janes P.W. Relaix F. Sassoon D. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5756-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)), and Mdm2 (which catalyzes the degradation of p53 (30Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). We also examined its ubiquitination by an oligomeric Ring E3, SCFβTRCP1 (which catalyzes the degradation of various phosphoproteins including I-κBα and β-catenin (31Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)), a U-box E3, CHIP, and the HECT domain E3s, E6AP (which is responsible for degradation of p53 upon infection by human papillomaviruses (32Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar)) and Nedd4 (which is involved in endocytosis of membrane proteins (33Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). Ubiquitination of S5a and its detection were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In a typical reaction with MuRF1, S5a (400 nm) was incubated with MuRF1 (700 nm), E1 (20 nm), UbcH5 (700 nm), Ub (58 μm), and ATP (2 mm). All these E3s formed long Ub chains on S5a with UbcH5, and no ubiquitination was observed without an E3 added. Furthermore, to demonstrate that S5a is also ubiquitinated when it is in molar excess over E3, we performed the ubiquitination reaction with 2000 nm S5a and 400, 200, or 100 nm GST-MuRF1. Even at 100 nm GST-MuRF1, the majority of S5a in the reaction mixture was ubiquitinated within 1 h (supplemental Fig. S2). This finding indicates that during these reactions MuRF1 (and presumably other E3s) ubiquitinates S5a in a catalytic (not a stoichiometric) manner. It is noteworthy that ubiquitination of S5a by CHIP does not require the presence of a molecular chaperone for substrate recognition (Fig. 2). Typical substrates of CHIP are proteins recognized and bound to the molecular chaperones Hsp70 or Hsp90 (28Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CHIP ubiquitinates the model substrate, luciferase, only when it is denatured and bound to Hsp70 (Fig. 2). By contrast, in the absence of chaperones, CHIP ubiquitinates itself, which seems to be important in the ubiquitination of S5a without Hsp70 or Hsp90 present (see below). Ubiquitination of S5a Results from Binding to the Growing Ub Chain—These findings raised the possibility that S5a is promiscuously ubiquitinated by many E3s because of a mechanism that does not require a substrate recognition site of E3. Several studies have reported the ubiquitination of Ub-binding proteins in vivo, which has been proposed to occur because of their high affinity for Ub, as deletion or mutation in their Ub binding domains diminishes their ubiquitination in vivo (7Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Hoeller D. Crosetto N. Blagoev B. Raiborg C. Tikkanen R. Wagner S.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1246-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 36Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested systematically if the ubiquitination of S5a by various E3s requires the UIMs using mutant S5a in which the critical hydrophobic residues within the UIM1 and/or UIM2 region are replaced with alanines (16Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These mutations abolish the affinity of the UIMs for Ub (supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 16Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Mutations in both the UIM1 and UIM2 domains of S5a abolished ubiquitination of S5a by MuRF1, CHIP, and E6AP, with UbcH5 as the E2 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). However, S5a lacking just one functional UIM (UIM1 or UIM2) domain was still rapidly ubiquitinated. Thus, UIMs are required for the ubiquitination of S5a, but either of these UIMs is sufficient to allow S5a ubiquitination (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S1). To test whether the UIM regions of S5a are sufficient to promote ubiquitination of a protein, we assayed ubiquitination of GST fused at its C terminus to residues 203–329 of S5a that contain both UIM1 and UIM2. This fusion protein, GST-UIMS5a, was rapidly ubiquitinated by MuRF1 or CHIP with UbcH5, whereas GST without the UIM was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 4). To determine whether the UIM of S5a is unique in this regard, we also assayed the ubiquitination of GST fusion proteins containing UIMs of various other proteins (EPSIN, Eps15, MJD1, KIAA1594, or KIAA1386). These GST fusions were all ubiquitinated by GST-MuRF1 with UbcH5 (Fig. 4A). Also, His6-CHIP with UbcH5 ubiquitinated all these GST fusions, but not GST itself, and did so even in the absence of a molecular chaperone (Fig. 4B). Because these two E3s have very different specificities for substrates and CHIP does not directly bind substrates, these UIM proteins must function as substrates due to their tendency to bind to Ub chains. Accordingly, all these GST fusions bound to free poly-Ub chains (not attached to a protein substrate) containing 2–7 Ub molecules (supplemental Fig. S1). Self-ubiquitination of MuRF1 Specifically Accelerated the Ubiquitination of S5a—These observations make it very likely that binding to the growing Ub chains on the E3s or on the substrate proteins leads to the ubiquitination of the UIM proteins. To determine whether this self-ubiquitination of a E3 promotes the ubiquitination of S5a, MuRF1 was first incubated with E1, UbcH5, Ub, and ATP for 25 min to allow self-ubiquitination of MuRF1, and then S5a was added to the reaction. In a control reaction, MuRF1 was first incubated with E1, UbcH5, and ATP but without Ub, and then the capacity to ubiquitinate S5a was assayed by adding S5a and Ub. The ubiquitination of S5a was significantly faster when MuRF1 had been preubiquitinated before the addition of S5a (Fig. 5A). For example, ubiquitination of S5a by ubiquitinated MuRF1 was clearly evident 4 min after S5a addition, whereas in the reaction with control MuRF1, ubiquitination of S5a was not observed until 8 min. In contrast to S5a, troponin I was ubiquitinated more slowly by self-ubiquitinated MuRF1 than by unmodified MuRF1 (Fig. 5B). Ubiquitination of a typical substrate, thus, does not require and seems to be rather reduced by the presence of Ub chains on the E3. Furthermore, the self-ubiquitination of MuRF1 appeared to precede the ubiquitination of S5a in the control reaction, whereas S5a ubiquitination was slow in onset but accelerated later when MuRF1 had been self-ubiquitinated (Fig. 5A). By contrast, ubiquitination of troponin I and of MuRF1 appeared to start simultaneously (Fig. 5B). These observations further support our hypothesis that self-ubiquitination of MuRF1 is a prerequisite for the ubiquitination of S5a but not for ubiquitination of a typical substrate. If ubiquitination of S5a is caused by binding of S5a to the growing Ub chains on the E3, S5a should bind to ubiquitinated MuRF1 but not to unmodified MuRF1. To test this prediction, we compared the binding of the 125I-S5a to ubiquitinated or unubiquitinated GST-MuRF1 immobilized on a glutathione resin. A much greater amount of 125I-S5a associated with the ubiquitinated GST-MuRF1 than with GST alone or unmodified GST-MuRF1 (Fig. 6A). In addition, as MuRF1 was being ubiquitinated (i.e. during incubation of immobilized GST-MuRF1 with 125I-S5a, E1, UbcH5, Ub, and ATP), the binding of 125I-S5a to the immobilized MuRF1 increased markedly with time (Fig. 6B). However, when ubiquitination was prevented by omission of Ub, no binding of S5a occurred with time. S5a has a high affinity for poly-Ub chains but only a low affinity for monoubiquitinated proteins (37Wang Q. Young P. Walters K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test if monoubiquitination of the E3s is sufficient to cause ubiquitination of S5a, we assayed ubiquitination of S5a using methylated Ub (MeUb) in place of Ub to prevent formation of poly-Ub chains. Although troponin I and MuRF1 were monoubiquitinated with MeUb, no ubiquitination of S5a with MeUb by MuRF1 and UbcH5 was observed (Fig. 7A). To confirm that this resul"

We tested the hypothesis that SNAT2 is required to support neurotransmitter glutamate synthesis by examining spontaneous excitatory activity after inducing or repressing SNAT2 expression for prolonged periods. We stimulated de novo synthesis of SNAT2 mRNA and increased SNAT2 mRNA stability and total SNAT2 protein and functional activity, whereas SNAT1 expression was unaffected. Increased endogenous SNAT2 expression did not affect spontaneous excitatory action-potential frequency over control. Long term glutamine exposure strongly repressed SNAT2 expression but increased excitatory action-potential frequency. Quantal size was not altered following SNAT2 induction or repression. These results suggest that spontaneous glutamatergic transmission in pyramidal neurons does not rely on SNAT2. To our surprise, repression of SNAT2 activity was not limited to System A substrates. Taurine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and beta-alanine (substrates of the SLC6 gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter family) repressed SNAT2 expression more potently (10x) than did System A substrates; however, the responses to System A substrates were more rapid. Since ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein are known to bind to an amino acid response element within the SNAT2 promoter and mediate induction of SNAT2 in peripheral cell lines, we tested whether either factor was similarly induced by amino acid deprivation in neurons. We found that glutamine and taurine repressed the induction of both transcription factors. Our data revealed that SNAT2 expression is constitutively low in neurons under physiological conditions but potently induced, together with the taurine transporter TauT, in response to depletion of neutral amino acids."

Here we report the hydrolysis of the α- and β2-subunits of the tetrameric adaptor protein complex 2 by calpain. Calcium-dependent α- and β2-adaptin hydrolysis was observed in several rat tissues, including brain and primary neuronal cultures. Neuronal α- and β2-adaptin cleavage was inducible by glutamate stimulation and was accompanied by the decreased endocytosis of transferrin. Heterologous expression of truncated forms of the β2-adaptin subunit significantly decreased the membrane recruitment of clathrin and inhibited clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis.

Cells must internalize necessary macromolecules from their surfaces and the extracellular space; this trafficking into inner compartments achieves transmembrane signaling functions as well as maintaining cellular homeostasis. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is an important cargo internalization mechanism involved in a variety of cellular signaling and transport pathways, such as those involving epidermal growth factor or transferrin, respectively. Clathrin adaptor proteins play a central role in this process by recognizing specific cargo and facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles.

Strict determinants of calpain substrate utilization have been elusive, due to the fact that they are governed by structural constraints rather than primary sequence motifs (14Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilagyi A. Banoczi Z. Hudecz F. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20775-20785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Known substrates for calpains include proteins of widely diverse functions, including membrane receptors, ion channels and transporters, enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, and transcription factors. Thus, calpains are implicated in a diverse variety of normal and pathologic cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell motility, gene expression, and apoptotic and necrotic cell death (reviewed in Ref. 15Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar).

This cleavage separates the appendage domains from the adaptor trunk and results in decreased clathrin-dependent endocytosis. A significant fraction of this decrease can be attributed specifically to truncation of the β2-subunit, and incorporation of truncated β2-adaptin into AP-2 complexes can both decrease endocytosis and sensitize neurons to excitotoxicity. We also demonstrate calpain-mediated cleavage of the accessory clathrin adaptors clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM), epsin 1, and adaptor protein 180 (AP180). Although the present studies are focused primarily on calpain proteolysis of clathrin adaptors in the nervous system, these findings are likely to be representative of a more widespread phenomenon that also occurs in other cell types.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESClathrin Adaptor Expression Vectors—cDNAs encoding full-length rat β2-adaptin (with C-terminal FLAG-, 6×-histidine-, or hemagglutinin (HA) tags), N-terminal or C-terminal rat β2-adaptin fragments (amino acids 1-691, with no tag or C-terminal HA tag; amino acids 692-951, with C-terminal 6×-histidine or HA tags), and human AP180 (with an N-terminal HA tag) were created using PCRs with specific primers (β2-adaptin: GenBank™ NM_001030006, nucleotides 190-3045; AP180: GenBank™ NM_014841, nucleotides 244-2967) to which the protein tag-encoding sequences were added. The resultant cDNAs were then cloned into self-inactivating lentiviral transfer vector plasmids under the control of the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter (SIN-W-PGK) (23Deglon N.

The first step consisted of producing a partial 5′ cDNA using a forward wild-type primer and a mutagenic reverse primer and a partial 3′ cDNA using a mutagenic forward primer and a wild-type reverse primer in two separate PCR reactions. The second step consisted of combining the obtained 5′ and 3′ cDNA fragments (which overlapped in sequence where the mutagenic primers were introduced) and amplifying the mutated full-length cDNA by PCR with wild-type primers.Primary Cortical and Striatal Neuron Cultures—Primary neuronal cultures were prepared and maintained as described previously (postnatal day 2 cortical cultures according to (25Vaslin A.

For lentiviral-mediated protein expression, cultures were infected on DIV 1 (50 ng of p24/ml of culture medium for each vector), half the medium was replaced on DIV 4, and half of the medium was replaced weekly thereafter. SIN-W-TRE expression vectors were applied at a concentration of 25 ng of p24/ml of culture medium together with the tetracycline transactivator in the SIN-W-PGK vector (50 ng of p24/ml of culture medium). Neuronal expression of the adaptin transproteins was ∼1× and 3× that of endogenous levels under the control of the PGK and TRE promoters, respectively.Glutamate Stimulation of Cultured Neurons—At DIV 11-13, striatal and cortical neurons were exposed for 15 min to 100 μm glutamate in medium supplemented with 50 μm glycine and 2.7 mm CaCl2. Following glutamate treatment, cells were washed twice and incubated in Neurobasal medium for the indicated times. Where specified, cells were exposed to the NMDA-receptor antagonist MK801, calpain inhibitors ALLN, calpain inhibitor IV (benzyloxycarbonyl-LLY-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-LLY-FMK)), or PD 151746 (all purchased from Calbiochem/Merck) starting 1 h prior to glutamate stimulation, and these inhibitors were included in all subsequent manipulations.Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Except where otherwise noted, protein samples for proteolytic analyses were harvested in lysis buffer (comprised of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich catalog no. P8340), and supplemented with either 2 mm EDTA plus 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2, to prevent or allow calpain digestion, respectively. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed every 10 min. Protein extracts were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by immunoblotting.Recombinant calpain treatments of rat brain or HEK 293T cell extracts consisted of exposure to recombinant rat calpain 2 (11 μg/ml, Calbiochem/Merck) and 2 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. Calpain was inactivated by addition of 4 mm EDTA plus 4 mm EGTA.The following primary antibodies were used for protein immunodetection: anti-β2-adaptin (sc-6425), anti-α-adaptin (immunoreactive to αA-adaptin; sc-6421), anti-CALM (sc-5395), and anti-epsin 1 (sc-8673) goat polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; mouse monoclonal anti-α-adaptin (immunoreactive to αA- and αC-adaptin; NB300-721) from Novus Biologicals; anti-clathrin heavy chain (610499) and anti-dynamin 2 (610263) mouse monoclonal antibodies from BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-AP180 (A4825), anti-α-tubulin (T5168), and anti-FLAG M2 (F1804) mouse monoclonal antibodies from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-hemagglutinin mouse monoclonal antibody from Covance; rabbit polyclonal anti-histidine antibody (PA1-23022) from Affinity BioReagents; rabbit polyclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (ab4074) from Abcam; and anti-Na+/K+ ATPase mouse monoclonal antibody from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Secondary antibodies consisted of Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-goat (Invitrogen) or IRDye 800CW-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (LI-COR). Protein bands were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR).Identification of the Calpain Cleavage Site in β2-Adaptin by Edman Degradation—HEK 293T cells were transfected with SIN-W-PGK plasmid vector encoding FLAG-tagged β2-adaptin using CaPO4 transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection in chelator-free lysis buffer, and lysates were treated with rat recombinant calpain 2 plus 2 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. The FLAG-tagged C-terminal proteolytic fragment of β2-adaptin was then immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Invitrolon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponceau S. The C-terminal β2-adaptin fragment band (25 kDa) was cut from the membrane and subjected to sequencing by Edman degradation at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) on a commercial basis.Transferrin and Dextran Internalization Assays—Neuronal cultures grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were used for transferrin internalization assay on DIV 11-13. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 25 μm ALLN for 1 h, and the same concentration of inhibitor was added to all subsequent reagents. Cells were stimulated with glutamate (as described above) and incubated in B27-supplement-free Neurobasal medium for 1 h. Cells were then exposed to Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated transferrin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. To allow transferrin internalization, cells were incubated at 37C for 1 h. Samples were then placed on ice, and uninternalized transferrin was stripped from the cell surface by incubation in 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.8) plus 0.5 m NaCl for 5 min. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) on ice for 15 min. After washing, coverslips were mounted with Immunomount (Thermo Shandon) and analyzed on a TCS-SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). In some experiments, uptake of Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-dextran (average molecular mass 10 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich, 5 μg/ml) was assayed in parallel using the same procedure. Signals were analyzed in 52-210 neurons per condition from five independent cultures.Immunoprecipitation of α-Adaptin—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to α-adaptin (Novus Biologicals) were conjugated to Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) and used as described previously (27Steiner P. Sarria J.C. Glauser L. Magnin S. Catsicas S. Hirling H. J.

Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting.Cellular Fractionation Studies—Monolayer cultures of HEK 293T cells overexpressing full-length rat β2-adaptin or a combination of N-terminal and C-terminal rat β2-adaptin fragments were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and harvested in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were lysed by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle, and precleared by a 15-min centrifugation at 3,000 × g. After removal of an aliquot for total protein analysis, lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet of the 100,000 × g centrifugation (comprising the membrane fraction) was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and analyzed by immunoblotting together with its corresponding total protein extract.Immunostaining of Primary Cortical Neurons—Primary cortical neurons cultured on glass coverslips were fixed on DIV 12 with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against clathrin heavy chain (Cat. 2419, Cell Signaling) was diluted in PBS with 0.5 mg/ml saponin and applied to the cells for 1 h at room temperature. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) was used as a secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted with FluoroSafe (Calbiochem) and analyzed on a TCS-SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems).Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay—Measurements of lactate dehydrogenase release into the culture medium were performed using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) as described in a previous study (25Vaslin A. Puyal J. Borsello T. Clarke P.G. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Neuronal Survival Assessed by NeuN-positive Cell Counting—DIV 11 striatal neurons were exposed for 15 min to 50 μm glutamate in culture medium supplemented with 50 μm glycine and 2.7 mm CaCl2. Following glutamate treatment, cells were washed twice and incubated in fresh Neurobasal medium for 48 h. Cell cultures were then fixed and immunostained with anti-NeuN antibody (1/400, Chemicon) as described previously (26Zala D. Benchoua A. Brouillet E. Perrin V. Gaillard M.C. Zurn A.D. Aebischer P.

For multitissue analyses of AP-2 subunit proteolysis, adult female Wistar rats (180-200 g, Iffa Credo/Charles River) were sacrificed by sodium pentobarbital overdose and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffer. Organ tissues were removed and homogenized in lysis buffer plus 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA by mechanical disruption.Focal ischemia was induced in 12-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats according to (28Renolleau S.

Animals were decapitated 24 h after the end of ischemia, and the infarcted and contralateral control tissues were dissected in PBS with 1 mm MgCl2 on ice. Tissues were then homogenized rapidly in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) using a manual potter apparatus. Homogenates were subsequently sonicated and then centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Samples were stored at -80 °C until use.Human Brain Samples—Neurodegenerative changes were staged using biochemical means. Tau staging on a scale from 0 to 10 was determined by immunoblot quantification of Tau pathology as described in a previous study (29Delacourte A. David J.P. Sergeant N. Buee L. Wattez A. Vermersch P. Ghozali F. Fallet-Bianco C. Pasquier F. Lebert F. Petit H. Di Menza C. Neurology. 1999; 52: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); controls were limited to Tau stages 3 and 4 (tauopathy restricted to the hippocampal area), whereas AD samples were stage 10 (reflecting global tauopathy of all neocortical areas). Amyloidopathy staging was assessed in the neocortex on a scale from 0 to 10 as described before (30Deramecourt V. Bombois S. Maurage C.A. Ghestem A. Drobecq H. Vanmechelen E. Lebert F. Pasquier F. Delacourte A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2006; 65: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); amyloid stage was 0 in controls (no trace of amyloid deposition), whereas AD samples exhibited stages 7-9 (reflecting a substantial quantity of Aβ aggregates). Frozen samples from two control brains and five AD brains were homogenized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer.Statistical Analysis—Numerical data represent the mean values ± S.E. The one-way analysis of variance was used to compare multiple conditions, and the two-tailed Student's t test was used for two-group comparisons. p < 0.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance.RESULTSCalcium-dependent Proteolysis of α- and β2-Adaptins in Brain and Other Rat Tissues—In the context of assessing potential calcium-dependent protein interactions that modulate synaptic plasticity (12Palmer C.L. Lim W. Hastie P.G. Toward M. Korolchuk V.I. Burbidge S.A. Banting G. Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T. Henley J.M. Neuron. 2005; 47: 487-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we noted a calcium-dependent change in the electrophoretic mobility of the major anti-N-terminal β2-adaptin-immunoreactive protein species in rat brain extracts. In the presence of EDTA or EGTA, the major β2-adaptin protein species was visualized at the position expected for this 100-kDa protein, whereas a more rapidly migrating band (corresponding to an approximate molecular mass of 75 kDa) was observed in the presence of exogenous calcium (2 mm) (Fig. 1A). A similar phenomenon was observed in immunoblots for anti-C-terminal α-adaptin immunoreactive species, whose apparent migration changed from a position corresponding to a 100-kDa protein to that of a 25-kDa protein (also corresponding to the expected and a faster-migrating species, respectively (Fig. 1C)). To explore whether this phenomenon also occurred in non-brain tissues, we subjected samples of peripheral organs to a similar analysis. This examination revealed the same calcium-dependent effects in spleen, stomach, and lung (Fig. 1, B and D). Upon noting these results, we reasoned that the strong calcium dependence and the large apparent change in electrophoretic migration of these proteins might be explained by calpain-mediated proteolysis. We therefore examined whether a broad spectrum calpain inhibitor (ALLN) would prevent this apparent modification of AP-2 proteins. The change in the electrophoretic migration of AP-2 proteins was indeed prevented by ALLN, indicating calpain cleavage of both α- and β2-adaptins (Fig. 1, A and C).Proteolysis of Adaptins by Calpain 2—To establish the relevance of this proteolytic event in living cells, we tested whether activation of calpains by neuronal stimulation would also result in adaptin hydrolysis. 15-min exposures of primary striatal neurons to glutamate (Fig. 2, A and B) or the selective ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist NMDA (data not shown) also resulted in calcium-dependent and ALLN-sensitive α- and β2-adaptin hydrolysis. Glutamate-stimulated hydrolysis was sensitive to the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 and EGTA, showing a major dependence on NMDA receptors and extracellular calcium (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2Cleavage of β2- and α-subunits of AP-2 in cultured striatal neurons. A and B, C-terminally 6×-histidine-tagged β2-adaptin-expressing primary neurons were stimulated with 100 μm glutamate for 15 min in the presence of 2.7 mm CaCl2 (or 3 mm EGTA) in combination with calpain 1 inhibitor PD 151746 (25 μm), calpain 2 inhibitor Z-LLY-FMK (10 μm), or NMDA-receptor antagonist MK801 (10 μm). Protein extracts were collected 1 h after the end of the glutamate application and subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against the 6×-histidine tag (A) or α-adaptin (B). C, C-terminally 6×-histidine-tagged β2-adaptin expressed in HEK 293T cells is degraded in the same manner when exposed to purified calpain 1 and calpain 2, but not caspase 3. D, α-adaptin is degraded in the same manner when exposed to purified calpain 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the hydrolysis of adaptins was mediated directly by calpains, we exposed adaptins to recombinant enzymes. Whereas caspase-3 was unable to proteolyze calpain, proteolytic fragments of β2-adaptin were produced after exposure to either calpain-1 or calpain-2 (Fig. 2C). To assess the relevant calpain(s) activated by stimulation in neuronal cells, we determined whether specific calpain inhibitors would prevent the calcium-dependent adaptor cleavage in vivo. Whereas the calpain 1 inhibitor PD 151746 had no effect on glutamate-stimulated neuronal adaptin proteolysis (Fig. 2, A and B), the calpain 2 inhibitor Z-LLY-FMK prevented this hydrolysis. Moreover, the protein species produced by neuronal stimulation show identical SDS-PAGE migration characteristics to those observed when α- and β2-adaptins were subjected to recombinant calpain 2 treatment in vitro (Fig. 2, C and D).

Zinc binds to NR1/NR2A N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with high affinity and inhibits NMDAR function in a voltage-independent manner. The serine protease plasmin can cleave a number of substrates, including protease-activated receptors, and may play an important role in several disorders of the central nervous system, including ischemia and spinal cord injury. Here, we demonstrate that plasmin can cleave the native NR2A amino-terminal domain (NR2AATD), removing the functional high affinity Zn2+ binding site. Plasmin also cleaves recombinant NR2AATD at lysine 317 (Lys317), thereby producing a ∼40-kDa fragment, consistent with plasmin-induced NR2A cleavage fragments observed in rat brain membrane preparations. A homology model of the NR2AATD predicts that Lys317 is near the surface of the protein and is accessible to plasmin. Recombinant expression of NR2A with an amino-terminal deletion at Lys317 is functional and Zn2+ insensitive. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings show that Zn2+ inhibition of agonist-evoked NMDA receptor currents of NR1/NR2A-transfected HEK 293 cells and cultured cortical neurons is significantly reduced by plasmin treatment. Mutating the plasmin cleavage site Lys317 on NR2A to alanine blocks the effect of plasmin on Zn2+ inhibition. The relief of Zn2+ inhibition by plasmin occurs in PAR1-/- cortical neurons and thus is independent of interaction with protease-activated receptors. These results suggest that plasmin can directly interact with NMDA receptors, and plasmin may increase NMDA receptor responses through disruption or removal of the amino-terminal domain and relief of Zn2+ inhibition.

NMDA receptors are comprised of glycine-binding NR1 subunits in combination with at least one type of glutamate-binding NR2 subunit (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol.

Each subunit contains three transmembrane domains, one cytoplasmic re-entrant membrane loop, one bi-lobed domain that forms the ligand binding site, and one bi-lobed amino-terminal domain (ATD), thought to share structural homology to periplasmic amino acid-binding proteins (4Erreger K.

The activity of NMDA receptors is negatively modulated by a variety of extracellular ions, including Mg2+, polyamines, protons, and Zn2+ ions, which can exert tonic inhibition under physiological conditions (1Dingledine R.

Zinc is a transition metal that plays key roles in both catalytic and structural capacities in all mammalian cells (15Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc is required for normal growth and survival of cells. In addition, neuronal death in hypoxia-ischemia and epilepsy has been associated with Zn2+ (16Aizenman E. Stout A.K. Hartnett K.A. Dineley K.E. McLaughlin B. Reynolds I.J. J.

Abnormal metabolism of zinc may contribute to induction of cytotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (19Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar).

Zn2+ inhibits NMDA receptor function through a dual mechanism, which includes voltage-dependent block and voltage-independent inhibition (22Christine C.W. Choi D.W. J.

Voltage-independent Zn2+ inhibition at low nanomolar concentrations (IC50, 20 nm) is observed for NR2A-containing NMDA receptors (25Chen N. Moshaver A. Raymond L.A. Mol.

Evidence has accumulated that the amino-terminal domain of the NR2A subunit controls high-affinity Zn2+ inhibition of NMDA receptors, and several histidine residues in this region may constitute part of an NR2A-specific Zn2+ binding site (8Choi Y.B.

For the NR2A subunit, several lines of evidence suggest that Zn2+ acts by enhancing proton inhibition (8Choi Y.B. Lipton S.A.

Serine proteases present in the circulation, mast cells, and elsewhere signal directly to cells by cleaving protease-activated receptors (PARs), members of a subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Cleavage exposes a tethered ligand domain that binds to and activates the cleaved receptors (31Traynelis S.F. Trejo J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Schmidlin F. Bunnett N.W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protease receptor activation has been studied extensively in relation to coagulation and thrombolysis (33Carmeliet P. Collen D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition to their circulation in the bloodstream, some serine proteases and PARs are expressed in the central nervous system, and have been suggested to play roles in physiological conditions (e.g. long-term potentiation or memory) and pathophysiological states such as glial scarring, edema, seizure, and neuronal death (31Traynelis S.F.

Life Sci. 2002; 72: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Functional interactions between proteases and NMDA receptors have previously been suggested. Earlier studies reported that the blood-derived serine protease thrombin potentiates NMDA receptor response more than 2-fold through activation of PAR1 (37Gingrich M.B. Junge C.E. Lyuboslavsky P. Traynelis S.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4582-4595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin, another serine protease, similarly potentiates NMDA receptor response (38Mannaioni G. Orr A.G. Hamill C.E. Yuan H. Pedone K.H. McCoy K.L. Palmini R.B. Junge C.E. Lee C.J. Yepes M. Hepler J.R. Traynelis S.F. J. Biol.

Tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA), which catalyzes the conversion of the zymogen precursor plasminogen to plasmin and results in PAR1 activation, also interacts with and cleaves the ATD of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (39Fernandez-Monreal M. Lopez-Atalaya J.P. Benchenane K. Cacquevel M. Dulin F. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Jarrige A.C. MacKenzie E.T. Colloc'h N. Ali C. Vivien D. J. Biol.

Med. 2001; 7: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that plasmin may also interact directly with the NMDA receptor subunits to modulate receptor response. We therefore investigated the ability of plasmin to cleave the NR2A NMDA receptor subunit. We found that nanomolar concentrations of plasmin can cleave within the ATD, a region that mediates tonic voltage-independent Zn2+ inhibition of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors. We hypothesized that plasmin cleavage reduces the Zn2+-mediated inhibition of NMDA receptors by removing the Zn2+ binding domain. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Zn2+ inhibition of agonist-evoked NMDA currents is decreased significantly by plasmin treatment in recombinant NR1/NR2A-transfected HEK 293 cells and cultured cortical neurons. These concentrations of plasmin may be pathophysiologically relevant in situations in which the blood-brain barrier is compromised, which could allow blood-derived plasmin to enter brain parenchyma at concentrations in excess of these that can cleave NR2A. Thus, ability of plasmin to potentiate NMDA function through the relief of the Zn2+ inhibition could exacerbate the harmful actions of NMDA receptor overactivation in pathological situations. In addition, if newly cleaved NR2AATD enters the bloodstream during ischemic injury, it could serve as a biomarker of central nervous system injury. Immunoblot—Adult rat brain regions were dissected and homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-360, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing the following protease inhibitors: 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 1 nm sodium orthovanadate. The membranes were stored at -20 °C and were incubated with increasing concentrations of plasmin (30–500 nm) for 20 min at room temperature. 50–100 μg of protein per sample were incubated with 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were loaded into 10% Tris glycine pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) and run at 150 V for 1.5 h in running buffer (0.1% SDS, 125 mm Tris base, 1 m glycine). Proteins subsequently were transferred onto polyvinyldine difluoride (PVDF) membranes in transfer buffer (10% methanol, 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine) for 2 h at 100 V at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 2.5% milk in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated with an anti-NR2A primary antibody (1:1000, polyclonal, Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY) on a shaker at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed 3 × 10 min in Tris-buffered saline, incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1000, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), washed again, and subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). NR2A Amino-terminal Domain (NR2AATD) Protein Production—The NR2AATD was produced as a thrombin-cleavage glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli. NR2AATD (Ala33–Asp421) was generated by polymerase chain reaction with the following primer pairs: sense, 5′-acgattccatggcgctgaacattgcggtgctg-3′ and antisense, 5′-atcgaagctttatcagaggtcctcttcggatatcagcttctgttcgtcctctacgatgacgaagg-3′. The product then was cloned into a pGEX-KG vector. A c-myc tag (underlined in antisense primer; EQKLISEEDL) was incorporated in the COOH terminus of NR2AATD for identification purposes. After transformation into BL21-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), cells at OD 0.8 were induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Pelleted cells were lysed using French Press (Thermo Spectronic, Madison, WI), and GST-NR2AATD protein was solubilized with detergents. The fusion protein was purified through batch chromatography using reduced glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix (Amersham Biosciences). NR2AATD protein was cleaved from the GST by 10 units of thrombin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at room temperature for 1 h. Zn2+-IDA-Agarose Affinity Binding Assay—Fifty microliters of immobilized iminodiacetic acid (IDA) resin (Pierce) equilibrated in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a freshly prepared 10 mm ZnCl2 solution. The fully Zn2+-charged IDA-agarose was thoroughly washed with Buffer A. The pelleted Zn2+-IDA-agarose was resuspended in 25 μl of Buffer A and incubated with 25 μl of thrombin-cleaved NR2AATD protein (room temperature for 30 min). The NR2AATD-bound to Zn2+-IDA-agarose was pelleted, and the supernatant was collected (designated as FT). The agarose resin was washed with Buffer A six times, and the first wash solution (W1) was collected for analysis. The bound NR2AATD was eluted from Zn2+-IDA-agarose with several volumes of 50 mm EDTA or 1 mm l-histidine in Buffer A (designated as E1, E2, or E3). Negative controls were performed with IDA-agarose that was not charged with ZnCl2. Sequencing of NR2AATD Plasmin Cleavage Products—The proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted onto PVDF membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The amino-terminal sequence after plasmin cleavage was determined using Edman degradation, which was performed in the Applied Biosystems model cLC-Procise protein sequencer (41Hewick R.M.

Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) provided the structural template. The mGluR1 structure and alignment were imported into Prime (version 1.5, 2006, Schrodinger, LLC, New York), and the NR2AATD homology model was subsequently built using default settings. The model was refined initially using the Prime loop prediction tool on the two central loops (41–45 and 100–105) of the ATD. The entire structure was then energy minimized, and multiple rounds of energy minimization and side chain optimization were performed on all residues within5Å of the two central loops. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (11Low C.M. Zheng F. Lyuboslavsky P. Traynelis S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11062-11067Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). cDNAs for NR1-1a (U11418 and U08261; hereafter NR1) and NR2A (D13211) were provided by Drs. S. Heinemann (Salk Institute) and S. Nakanishi (Kyoto University), respectively. The ATD deletion construct of the NR2A subunit was developed from wild-type NR2A and NR2B-(ΔS28-M394). This construct encoded for the first 28 residues of NR2B, including the signal peptides. The residue following Ser28 was Ala318 of NR2A. Transfection of HEK 293 Cells and Plasmin Treatment—Human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK 293 cells; CRL 1573, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were plated at low confluency on glass coverslips (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) coated in 200 μg/ml poly-d-lysine and incubated overnight at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 in media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells then were transiently transfected using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) with 2.0 μg of plasmid cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein, NR1, and wild-type NR2A, green fluorescent protein, NR1, and mutant NR2A-K317A, or green fluorescent protein, NR1, and mutant NR2A-ΔATD-K317 at a 5:1:1 ratio. After transfection, the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 in media supplemented with 200 μm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and 200 μm 7-chlorokynurenic acid. Following transfection and overnight incubation, media was removed and cells were washed in external solution for patch clamp recording. Some washed coverslips then were removed from their wells and gently placed in a new, untreated 24-well plate that contained the external recording solution (500 μl, composition seen below) plus 100 nm plasmin. Clean, untreated plates without cells or bovine serum albumin from the media were used for plasmin treatment to reduce the amount of proteins that could compete with NR2A for cleavage and thus lower the apparent effectiveness of plasmin. The treated coverslips were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and were transferred to new wells containing only external solution for patch clamp recording. We performed the recordings for both the control and the plasmin-treated groups on the same day. Neuron Culture—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from 1- to 3-day postnatal wild type (C57BL/6) or PAR1-/- mice, which were created by breeding PAR1+/- mice, a gift from Dr. Shaun Coughlin (University of California, San Francisco, CA), with C57BL/6 wild-type mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Heterozygous littermates were bred to generate littermate homozygous null mutants and wild-type controls, which were subsequently used to generate homozygous colonies. PAR1-/- mice were >99% C57Bl/6. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The cortex was dissected and chopped into small cubes. The tissues were digested by 24 units/ml papain for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator, washed twice with 5–7 ml of inactivation solution (Neurobasal medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μg/ml DNase), and triturated gently with at least three serial fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. Cultures were maintained for 5–15 days in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, B-27, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 0.6% dextrose, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. On the recording day, some washed coverslips were transferred to wells of a new plate that contained the plasmin solution (300 nm), incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then washed by external recording solution (composition given below). Two-electrode Voltage-clamp Recordings from Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Preparation and injection of cRNA, as well as two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings from X. laevis oocytes, were performed as previously described (27Traynelis S.F. Burgess M.F. Zheng F. Lyuboslavsky P. Powers J.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6163-6175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected with 5–10 ng of cRNAs synthesized in vitro from linearized template cDNA and stored at 15 °C in Barth's solution. The ratio of NR1 to NR2 injected cRNA was 1:2. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were made 2–4 days postinjection at room temperature (23 °C). The recording solution contained (in mm) 90 NaCl, 1 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 BaCl2, plus 2–10 μm EDTA. In the experiments for agonist potency, pH was adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH, and EDTA was added to chelate contaminant divalent ions. In the experiments for the concentration-response curve of zinc inhibition, pH was adjusted to 7.2 and Tricine (10 mm) was used to buffer Zn2+ concentrations as described previously (27Traynelis S.F. Burgess M.F. Zheng F. Lyuboslavsky P. Powers J.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6163-6175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solution exchange was computer-controlled through an 8-modular valve positioner (Digital MVP Valve, Hamilton, CT). Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 0.3–3.0 m KCl, and current responses were recorded at a holding potential of -20 to -40 mV at 23 °C. Data acquisition and voltage control were accomplished with a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (OC-725, Warner Instrument, Hamilton, CT). Only currents greater than 50 nA were included in the analysis. 50 μm Glutamate and 30 μm glycine were used in all oocyte experiments unless otherwise stated. Whole Cell Voltage-clamp Recording from Transfected HEK 293 Cells—Voltage-clamp recordings (VHOLD -60 mV) were performed on transfected HEK 293 cells using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) at room temperature (23 °C). Recording electrodes (3.5–7 MΩ) were made from thin wall glass pipettes (TW150F-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) pulled using a vertical puller (Narishige PP-830, Tokyo, Japan), and were filled with an internal solution containing (in mm) 110 d-gluconate, 110 CsOH, 30 CsCl, 5 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 BAPTA, 2 NaATP, and 0.3 NaGTP, pH 7.35. Cells were bathed continually at 23 °C in an external solution composed of (in mm) 150 mm NaCl, 10 HEPES, 30 d-mannitol, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, and 0.01 EDTA, pH 7.4. Glutamate and glycine agonist solutions were made in external solution that contained 10 μm EDTA or 1 μm Zn2+. Once the cell membrane was ruptured by applying suction, the whole cell was lifted into the path of a 2-barrel fast perfusion system controlled by a piezoelectric translator (Burleigh Instruments, Fishers, NY) with 5–8-ms exchange times for the solutions (29Erreger K. Traynelis S.F. J. Physiol. 2005; 569: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed first to glycine (50 μm), and subsequently glutamate (50 μm in 50 μm glycine) was applied rapidly for 1 s, after which the cells were again washed in glycine. Steady-state amplitudes and deactivation time constants were measured using ChanneLab (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). Whole Cell Perforated Patch Recording from Cultured Cortical Neurons—Whole cell voltage-clamp current recordings (VHOLD -60 mV) were performed on 5–10-day cultured cortical neurons at room temperature (23 °C). The recording chamber was continually perfused with recording solution composed of (in mm) 150 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 5.5 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 by NaOH; osmolality adjusted to 315–320 mosmol with sucrose). 10 μm EDTA was added to chelate contaminant divalent ions except for Zn2+-containing solutions. Thin wall glass pipettes (TW150F-4, World Precision Instrument) were used to make recording electrodes (4–5 mΩ) by a vertical puller (Narishige PP-830, Tokyo, Japan) and filled with (in mm) 150 CsMeSO4, 10 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 25–50 μg/ml gramicidin D (pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH and osmolality adjusted to 310 mOsm with sucrose). Fresh stock solution of gramicidin D (1 mg/80 μl in dimethyl sulfoxide) was prepared daily. The final internal solution containing gramicidin D was used within 1 h. It took 15–30 min to achieve acceptable perforation with series resistance ranging from 30 to 60 mΩ. Drugs were applied directly by gravity and controlled by solenoid valves (Lee, Westbrook, CT) with tubes placed above the recorded cell. The solution exchange achieved a complete local perfusion of the recorded cell in ∼400 ms (10–90% rise time), which was measured by applying a high K+ solution onto cultured cortical neurons and measuring the time course of the instantaneous change of the leak current. All drugs were purchased from Sigma except papain and DNase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), Neurobasal medium, fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), CNQX disodium salt and ifenprodil (Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK), plasmin (Hematologic Technologies, Inc., Essex Junction, VT), and 2-furoyl-LIGRLO (Emory Microchemical Facility). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and analyzed statistically using unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test. Significance for all tests was set at p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W2045906994,"Background Tripping is a common factor in falls and a typical safety strategy to avoid tripping on steps or stairs is to increase foot clearance over the step edge. In the present study we asked whether the perceived height of a step could be increased using a visual illusion and whether this would lead to the adoption of a safer stepping strategy, in terms of greater foot clearance over the step edge. The study also addressed the controversial question of whether motor actions are dissociated from visual perception. Methodology/Principal Findings 21 young, healthy subjects perceived the step to be higher in a configuration of the horizontal-vertical illusion compared to a reverse configuration (p = 0.01). During a simple stepping task, maximum toe elevation changed by an amount corresponding to the size of the visual illusion (p<0.001). Linear regression analyses showed highly significant associations between perceived step height and maximum toe elevation for all conditions. Conclusions/Significance The perceived height of a step can be manipulated using a simple visual illusion, leading to the adoption of a safer stepping strategy in terms of greater foot clearance over a step edge. In addition, the strong link found between perception of a visual illusion and visuomotor action provides additional support to the view that the original, controversial proposal by Goodale and Milner (1992) of two separate and distinct visual streams for perception and visuomotor action should be re-evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2093780646,"Melanoregulin (MREG), the product of the Mreg(dsu) gene, is a small highly charged protein, hypothesized to play a role in organelle biogenesis due to its effect on pigmentation in dilute, ashen, and leaden mutant mice. Here we provide evidence that MREG is required in lysosome-dependent phagosome degradation. In the Mreg(-/-) mouse, we show that loss of MREG function results in phagosome accumulation due to delayed degradation of engulfed material. Over time, the Mreg(-/-) mouse retinal pigment epithelial cells accumulate the lipofuscin component, A2E. MREG-deficient human and mouse retinal pigment epithelial cells exhibit diminished activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, cathepsin D, due to defective processing. Moreover, MREG localizes to small intracellular vesicles and associates with the endosomal phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate. Collectively, these studies suggest that MREG is required for lysosome maturation and support a role for MREG in intracellular trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2122102194,"Protein prenylation is a widespread process that involves the transfer of either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl moiety to one or more C-terminal cysteines of the target protein. Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGTase) is responsible for the largest number of individual protein prenylation events in the cell. A decade-long effort to crystallize the catalytic ternary complex of RabGGTase has remained fruitless, prompting us to use a computational approach to predict the structure of this 200-kDa assembly. On the basis of high resolution structures of two sub-complexes, we have generated a composite model where the rigid parts of the protein are represented by precomputed grid potentials, whereas the mobile parts are described in atomic details using Internal Coordinate Mechanics. Selection of the best docking solution of the flexible parts on the grid is followed by explicit atomistic refinement of the lowest energy conformations enabling realistic modeling of complex structures. Using this approach we demonstrate that the flexible C terminus of Rab7 substrate forms a series of progressively weaker and less specific interactions that channel it into the active site of RabGGTase. We have validated the computational model through biochemical experiments and demonstrated that to be prenylated RabGTPase must possess at least nine amino acids between the prenylation motif and the hydrophobic sequence anchoring the beginning of the Rab C terminus on the enzyme. This sequence, known as the C-terminal interacting motif is shown to play a dual role in Rab prenylation by contributing a significant fraction of binding energy to the catalytic complex assembly and by orienting the C terminus of RabGTPase in the vicinity of the active site of RabGGTase. This mechanism is unique to RabGGTase when compared with other prenyltransferases, which encode the specificity for their cognate substrates directly at their active site.

Elucidation of structures of biomacromolecules is essential for understanding their functions. Structural biology provides us with submolecular level views of enzymatic reactions, protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions. Although the main methods of protein structure determination such as x-ray crystallography, NMR, and electron microscopy are biased toward well ordered structures, in reality conformational changes and transitions between ordered and disordered states are common and important features of protein function and regulation. It has become very clear over the last several years that sections of proteins and sometimes entire proteins do not display a defined structure in solution and become structured only in the presence of a ligand or a binding partner protein (1Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of an isolated disordered peptide fragment to a target protein without the support of the rest of the complex is frequently undetectable. If crystallographic studies can be performed on only a part of a large system, it may be exceedingly difficult to reproduce this ordered interaction in a crystal structure, and there are limitations to the application of NMR methods. Recent advances in realistic computer simulations give us an opportunity to address this problem. However, the large number of degrees of freedom of large systems presents a distinct challenge. Here ICM 3The abbreviations used are: ICM, Internal Coordinate Mechanics; RabGGTase, Rab geranylgeranyl transferase; REP, Rab escort protein; CBR, C-terminal binding region; CIM, CBR interacting motif; NBD, nitrobenzoxadiazole; NBD-FPP, (3,7,11-trimethyl-12-(7-nitro-benzo[1,2,5]oxadiazo-4-ylamino)-dodeca-2,6,10-triem-1) pyrophosphate. global optimizer was applied as an efficient macromolecular docking procedure to predicting the behavior of functionally locally disordered protein fragments upon macromolecular assembly (2Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 3Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). This has been successfully applied to peptide folding, protein docking and interface refinement (4Totrov M. Abagyan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), small molecule docking (5Totrov M. Abagyan R. Proteins. 1997; : 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and virtual screening (6Szewczuk L.M. Saldanha S.A. Ganguly S. Bowers E.M. Javoroncov M. Karanam B. Culhane J.C. Holbert M.A. Klein D.C. Abagyan R. Cole P.A. J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 5330-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To deal with a large complex, a part of the system that can be assumed to stay relatively unchanged is replaced by precomputed grid potentials as is done routinely in small molecule docking (e.g. Ref. 5Totrov M. Abagyan R. Proteins. 1997; : 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In this case, a smaller molecule or a peptide can be docked to the grid potentials to generate a set of conformers for further refinement. This technique was demonstrated to correctly predict the docking of a series of peptides to PTB and SH2 domains in an unbiased simulation (7Zhou Y. Abagyan R. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Addition of explicit atomistic refinement to the best scored conformations was shown to reproduce the unusual binding geometries of the HLA peptides (8Bordner A.J. Abagyan R. Proteins. 2006; 63: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to the major histocompatibility class I receptors. A well documented case of a protein complex with a functionally important locally disordered region is Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGTase). RabGGTase is a member of the protein prenyltransferase family that catalyzes covalent attachment of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties onto the conserved C-terminal cysteines of intracellular proteins (9Maurer-Stroh S. Washietl S. Eisenhaber F. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RabGGTase attaches geranylgeranyl moieties to the C terminus of more than 60 members of the Rab GTPase family: central regulators of intracellular vesicular transport (10Schwartz S.L. Cao C. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3905-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Rab GTPases is naturally disordered, a feature that is important for their biological function (11Goody R.S. Rak A. Alexandrov K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1657-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Unlike other protein prenyltransferases RabGGTase does not recognize a four-amino acid C-terminal sequence, known as a CAAX box, but requires an adaptor protein termed the Rab escort protein (REP) for substrate binding and selection. REP recruits newly synthesized Rab GTPases and then presents them to the RabGGTase. The proteins form a tight catalytic ternary complex in which two geranylgeranyl groups are transferred onto the C terminus of Rab GTPase (11Goody R.S. Rak A. Alexandrov K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1657-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L.

Recently, RabGGTase came into the spot-light due to the observation that its chemical inhibition induced apoptosis in cancer cells, promoting the search for new inhibitors of this enzyme (14Lackner M.R. Kindt R.M. Carroll P.M. Brown K. Cancilla M.R. Chen C. de Silva H. Franke Y. Guan B. Heuer T. Hung T. Keegan K. Lee J.M. Manne V. O'Brien C. Parry D. Perez-Villar J.J. Reddy R.K. Xiao H. Zhan H.

Development of RabGGTase-specific inhibitors requires understanding of the mechanistic and thermodynamic basis of its function. Although we recently solved the structures of an isoprenoid stabilized REP·RabGGTase complex and of prenylated and unprenylated Rab7·REP complexes, the structure of the ternary Rab·REP·RabGGTase complex remains unknown (16Pylypenko O. Rak A. Reents R. Niculae A. Sidorovitch V. Cioaca M.D. Bessolitsyna E. Thoma N.H. Waldmann H. Schlichting I. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 117: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). It transpired from the analysis of the available subcomplex structures that the REP molecule plays a central role in assembling the catalytic ternary complex by forming binding interfaces with both Rab GTPase and RabGGTase (17Rak A. Pylypenko O. Niculae A. Pyatkov K. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Cell. 2004; 117: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Alory C. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3857-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the REP-Rab interaction, one large interface is formed between the Rab-binding platform of REP and the GTPase domain of Rab, and a smaller one between the hydrophobic C-terminal binding region (CBR) of REP and the hydrophobic CBR interacting motif (CIM) of Rab GTPases (17Rak A. Pylypenko O. Niculae A. Pyatkov K. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Cell. 2004; 117: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Alory C. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3857-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Formation of the complex with Rab GTPases increases the affinity of REP for RabGGTase by nearly three orders of magnitude and leads to the formation of the catalytic ternary complex via interaction of domain 2 of REP with the α-subunit of RabGGTase (13Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Pylypenko O. Rak A. Reents R. Niculae A.

Cell. 2003; 11: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, details of the Rab prenylation mechanism remain unknown, and the following important questions remain open. How does RabGGTase process all Rab family members despite the high variability in the sequence and the length of their C terminus? What structural mechanism, and which amino acids, ensures proper positioning of the Rab C terminus into the catalytic center of RabGGTase? To address these issues, we have generated a computational model of the entire Rab·REP·RabGGTase ternary complex and performed an extensive search for low energy conformations of the C terminus, which was invisible in structures of the individual proteins. Based on the resulting models we designed a series of biochemical experiments to validate the computational model and demonstrate that the CIM functions as an anchor concentrating the prenylatable Rab C terminus toward the active site of RabGGTase. The model provides an explanation for the lack of requirement for conservation of the C terminus of Rab GTPases and elucidates structural determinants of the assembly of the functional ternary complex. Simulation—The stochastic simulation was performed with the Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) program (Molsoft, La Jolla, CA). The stochastic optimization and sampling procedure was described previously (2Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 3Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The grid potentials included two van der Waals grids for hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms, a hydrogen bonding grid that contained both donor and acceptor density, an electrostatic grid, and a hydrophobic grid, as described in Ref. 5Totrov M. Abagyan R. Proteins. 1997; : 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar. A surface-based implicit solvation model was used as described in Ref. 3Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, and the static part of the model was taken into account in the solvent accessibility calculations. The simulation was performed on a cluster of 200 Linux computers at the Scripps Research Institute. Expression Constructs, Protein Expression, and Purification—Expression of rat REP-1 in SF21 cells and subsequent purification was performed as described previously (13Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Armstrong S.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rab7 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described before (13Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The vectors for E. coli expression of Rab7 mutants were constructed by amplification of the open reading frame of Rab7 with the primers containing the respective mutations and subcloning the products into either previously described pGATEV vector (20Kalinin A. Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Heinemann I. Rostkova E. Constantinescu A.T. Alexandrov K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or pGATEV vector where the glutathione S-transferase gene was exchanged for maltose binding protein. 4K. Alexandrov, unpublished data. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed in 1-ml quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with continuous stirring and thermostatted at 25 °C on a Spex Fluoro-max-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ). Fluorescence titrations were carried out in titration buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithioerythritol). Data analysis was performed with the program Grafit 5.0 (Erithacus Software) and Scientist (MicroMath Scientific Software) as described (21Alexandrov K. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 14-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine the affinities of Rab·REP binary complexes, REP-1 was titrated into 100 nm Rab7-NBD in the presence of 100-1000 nm Rab7 mutants or wild type. To determine the affinities of ternary complexes, RabGGTase was titrated into 100 nm Rab7-NBD·REP-1 complex in the presence of 500-1000 nm unlabeled Rab7·REP-1 complex. Rab7-NBD was excited at 479 nm, and the fluorescence was collected at 527 nm. The Kd value was obtained by fitting the data in a competitive model using program Scientist 2.0 as described elsewhere (22Wu Y.W. Tan K.T. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12294-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Vitro Prenylation Assay—4 μm Rab wild type or mutants, 6 μm REP, 6 μm RabGGTase were incubated in prenylation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP) at 25 °C, and 50 μm NBD-FPP was added to initiate the reaction. At defined time intervals, 10-μl samples were withdrawn and quenched by addition of 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For an end-point assay, 6 μm Rab7 wild type or mutants, 10 μm REP, and 6 μm were mixed with 40 μm NBD-FPP in prenylation buffer and incubated for 1.5 h at 25 °C, followed by quenching with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled at 95 °C for 3 min and were loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence bands corresponding to the NBD-farnesylated protein were visualized in the gel using a Fluorescent Image Reader FLA-5000 (Fuji, excitation laser: 473 nm, cut-off filter: 510 nm) followed by staining with Coomassie Blue and scanning. The fluorescence intensities of the bands were quantitatively analyzed using AIDA densitometry software. The traces were fitted to a single exponential equation using GraFit 5.0. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Measurements—Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out in isothermal titration calorimetry buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 25 °C using a VP-isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). A least-square fit of the titration data to a single-site binding model was performed using the program Origin, which includes routines designed to analyze isothermal titration calorimetry data (MicroCal), giving the binding constant (Ka), the standard enthalpy of binding (ΔH°), and the stoichiometry of binding (n). Simulation of the Rab·REP·RabGGTase Ternary Protein Complex—The structure of the ternary Rab·REP·RabGGTase complex has been sought for a long time by several groups due to its central role in the maintenance of membrane-bound organelle identity and the clinical relevance of Rab prenylation inhibitors (23Lawson M.A. Coulton L. Ebetino F.H. Vanderkerken K. Croucher P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although we previously reported crystallization of such a complex, it has remained refractory to structure solution due to its poor x-ray diffraction properties (24Rak A. Niculae A. Kalinin A. Thoma N.H. Sidorovitch V. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This motivated us to seek an alternative approach for analysis of the structural details of RabGGTase-mediated protein prenylation reaction. To this end we chose to perform a computational reconstruction of the ternary complex based on the available structures of the binary complexes (Fig. 1B). The model construction and stochastic simulation were performed with the ICM program (Molsoft). The ICM sampler operates in a space of arbitrary subset of internal coordinates of four types: bond (or virtual bond) length, bond angles, torsion angles, and phase angles that define an additional dihedral angle for the secondary branch. To create a full model of the catalytic ternary complex of RabGGTase, including the unprenylated substrate Rab7, we combined two high resolution crystal structures of RabGGTase·REP complex (PDB code 1LTX) and Rab7·REP complex (PDB code 1VG0). The two complexes were superimposed using overlapping atoms of the REP protein (Fig. 1). Fifteen C-terminal residues (DKNDRAKASAESCSC) that were invisible in the electron density map of the Rab7·REP complex were added to the substrate in an extended conformation. The resulting model of the biological ternary complex was then divided into two parts (ordered and disordered) and the ordered part was converted to a set of grid potentials (8Bordner A.J. Abagyan R. Proteins. 2006; 63: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 22 residues of Rab7 were described in full atom representation, including hydrogens, and the first 4 residues were constrained to the crystallographic positions, whereas the last 18 residues were assumed to be fully flexible. For each C-terminal sequence, ten simulations from fully randomized structure were performed, and the solutions were clustered (25Abagyan R. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to obtain a diverse set of the best energy representatives. Eight out of ten simulations converged in 70 h to virtually the same lowest energy conformation with energies within 1 kcal/mol. The energy difference between the preferred bound conformation and the next geometrically different solution was 4 kcal/mol. The simulation led to a lowest energy conformation as shown in Fig. 2. The simulated C terminus of Rab7 follows the surface of REP toward the bottom of domain II, where it bridges the solvent gap and contacts the β-subunit of RabGGTase at the loop connecting helices 11 and 12. The C-terminal cysteine protrudes into the active site, where the cysteine thiol coordinates the Zn2+ ion. Interestingly this interaction is not critical to drive the folding and docking procedure, because the omission of the cysteine residues did not significantly change the outcome of simulation (not shown). In the model obtained, the C terminus of Rab7 contacts the surface of the RabGGTase β subunit by forming a weak hydrogen bond between the side chain of Rab7S206 and side chain of βY241. Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between Rab7S204 and αD139 and Rab7K199 and αE140. It appears likely that, depending on the C-terminal sequence of individual Rabs, different hydrogen bonds can be formed between the Rab C terminus and the β subunit of RabGGTase. Effects of Rab C-terminal Sequence on the Prenylation and the Association of the Ternary Protein Complex—Several predictions can be made on the basis of the obtained model. First, the model predicts that to undergo prenylation the C terminus of Rab7 needs to be in an almost completely extended conformation. Shortening the C-terminal peptide by more than three amino acids would prevent prenylatable cysteines from reaching the active site of RabGGTase thereby reducing the prenylability of Rab, unless the RabGGTase can swing closer to the surface of REP. This conclusion is particularly interesting, because Rab proteins display no sequence conservation within last 40 C-terminal residues (26Colicelli J. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : RE13Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis experimentally, we generated a series of Rab7 mutants truncated by one to eight amino acids (Fig. 3). The mutants were designed in such a way that the prenylation (Cys-Ser-Cys) and CIM motifs remained unchanged in all cases while the number of spacing residues varied. To assess the kinetics and efficiency of the prenylation reaction we employed a recently developed Rab in vitro prenylation assay that makes use of NBD-FPP, a fluorescent analogue of GGPP (27Wu Y.W. Waldmann H. Reents R. Ebetino F.H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1859-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (A and C) shows that truncation of the Rab7 C terminus by more than three residues leads to the dramatic reduction in Rab prenylation efficiency. Mutants truncated by four and five amino acids display residual prenylation activity, indicating that the ternary complex can probably undergo limited hinge movement. Further reduction in the sequence length completely removes the ability of Rab7 to act as the RabGGTase substrate. The inferred flexibility of the complex may explain why Rab7·REP-1·RabGGTase complex crystals diffract only to low resolution (24Rak A. Niculae A. Kalinin A. Thoma N.H. Sidorovitch V. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The requirement for appropriate length of the linker peptide between CIM and the prenylation motif also finds its support in earlier in vivo data, where a truncation of 10 amino acid residues linking putative CIM (VDL) and prenylation motif (CC) of Rab5 rendered the protein cytosolic (28Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The existence of the minimal length constraint in the Rab C terminus prompted us to analyze the hyper-variable C terminus of all mammalian Rab GTPases. In the majority of mammalian Rab GTPases putative CIM motif can be clearly identified, and supplemental Fig. S1 shows the list of aligned sequences. These data demonstrate that the minimal sequence between the CIM and the prenylatable cysteines in Rab proteins contains 9 amino acids, as featured by Rab9, Rab19, and Rab22. This is in agreement with the minimal artificial length of the Rab7 C terminus required for the efficient prenylation identified computationally and confirmed biochemically. Another prediction of our model is that the binding of the post CIM portion of the Rab C terminus to the RabGGTase should be rather weak due to the lack of extensive interactions with the RabGGTase. To test this we used a previously described fluorescent assay to measure the contribution of the C terminus to the affinities of the Rab·REP and the Rab·REP·RabGGTase complexes (29Guo Z. Wu Y.W. Das D. Delon C. Cramer J. Yu S. Thuns S. Lupilova N. Waldmann H. Brunsveld L. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Blankenfeldt W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2444-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Table 1, deletion of the prenylation motif has only a slight effect on the affinity of the ternary complex and no significant effect on the binary complex. Deletion of the last 14 residues does not affect the assembly of the Rab·REP complex but reduces the affinity of the ternary complex by a factor of 2, in accord with the computational model predicting the interaction of this part of C terminus with loop connecting helices 10 and 11 and the catalytic Zn2+ ion. It appears that interaction of the sequence down-stream of CIM with RabGGTase makes a small but measurable contribution to the affinity of the ternary protein complex. Such a weak association might be an advantage, because the overall reaction requires large rearrangements for the sequential double prenylation and translocation of the conjugated prenyl moieties to REP. Weak binding of the C terminus to the β-subunit may facilitate the dissociation of the prenylated product from the enzyme. This idea is indirectly supported by the observation that RabGGTase alone does not display detectable activity toward Rab GTPases (12Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, a 10-mer and a 20-mer peptide mimicking Rab7 C terminus can neither interact with RabGGTase nor undergo prenylation by RabGGTase even when present in the reaction mixture at millimolar concentration. 5Y.-W. Wu and K. Alexandrov, unpublished.

The replacement does not impair the prenylation efficiency of the protein and does not significantly influence the affinity in both the binary and ternary complexes (Fig. 3, B and C). These observations suggest that the proper length rather than the sequence of the linker peptide between CIM and prenylation motif is critical for Rab prenylation, which explains the ability of RabGGTase to process Rab proteins containing C-terminal peptides of such diverse sequences and lengths. This finding demonstrates that the side chains of amino acid residues of the C-terminal linker peptide make only a limited contribution to the overall affinity of the ternary complex, which is consistent with the computational model. Computational and Biophysical Analysis of Rab CIM Motif—In the x-ray structures of Rab7·REP-1 and the related YPT1·GDI complexes the C terminus of the GTPase can be traced only up to the CIM of Rab protein (17Rak A. Pylypenko O. Niculae A. Pyatkov K. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Cell. 2004; 117: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30Rak A. Pylypenko O. Durek T. Watzke A.

Proteins. 1997; 27: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that the interaction of the CBR with the CIM directs the C terminus of Rab proteins toward the active site of RabGGTase, because its mutation reduced prenylation efficiency (17Rak A. Pylypenko O. Niculae A. Pyatkov K. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Cell. 2004; 117: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear how the CIM performs this function and what role it plays in the assembly of the ternary complex and positioning of the C-terminal cysteines of Rab GTPases for catalysis. The developed computational model of RabGGTase ternary complex enabled us to test the role of CIM-CBR interactions in Rab prenylation. We repeated the stochastic sampling of the Rab7 C terminus when residues 190 and 192 were mutated to serines. Surprisingly, this dual mutation led to drastically different geometries of the lowest energy conformations. The RabGGTase-bound conformations of the C-terminal peptide were no longer at the previously identified positions. Instead, the peptide folded back on itself with its C terminus as far as 40 Å away from its active site location (not shown). Such a dramatic change highlights the importance of these two residues for the formation of the productive complex. This simulation suggests that the loss of C terminus coordination by CIM-CBR interactions would lead to reduction or inhibition of prenylation. To test this experimentally we prepared mutants of Rab7 where either or both of the residues were mutated to polar amino acids. The resulting mutants were purified and subjected to in vitro prenylation analysis as described above. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, individual mutations led to a reduction in the prenylation reaction rates. The Rab7 L192S mutant displayed more significant impairment of prenylation than Rab7 I190H, suggesting that Leu-192 is a more critical residue in the CBR-CIM interaction. The mutations have an additive effect, because the double mutant Rab7 I190HL192S showed no detectable prenylation indicating that the CIM motif is strictly required for Rab prenylation (Fig. 4). There are two most obvious explanations for the effect of CIM motif mutations on Rab prenylation. Because the CIM motif provides an additional contact between REP and Rab proteins, it may contribute to the overall affinity of the complex and thereby modulate the ability of RabGGTase to recruit and process the Rab protein. It is also possible that it is required for the coordination of the Rab C terminus, and the observed reduction in prenylation of CIM mutants reflects the failure of the C terminus to associate efficiently with the active site of RabGGTase. The latter model is more consistent with the results of our simulation. To discriminate between these possibilities, we quantified the contribution of the Rab7 CIM to the interaction energy of the Rab7·REP binary complex using isothermal titration calorimetry. The experiments give Kd values of 481 ± 53 nm, 476 ± 27 nm, 166 ± 12 nm, and 21 ± 2 nm for Rab7I190HL192S, Rab7L192S, Rab7Δ14, and Rab7 wild type, respectively (Fig. 5). This experiment clearly confirms that the CIM motif is an important quantitative contributor to the Rab·REP binary complex association, thereby ensuring the efficient assembly of the Rab·REP·RabGGTase ternary complex. To test whether the affinity decrease alone is responsible for the failure of the mutants to undergo prenylation, we increased the concentration of the reaction components in in vitro prenylation reaction. This did not lead to an increase in product yield or the observed rate constant, suggesting that the observed rate reflects the single turnover reaction rate, and the failure of the double mutant to become prenylated is not a consequence of its lower affinity for REP (not shown). Therefore, we conclude that, in agreement with the simulation data, the CIM mutation changes the micro-environment within the ternary protein complex rather than the assembly of the whole complex. It appears that loss of coordination of the C terminus reduces the likelihood of its proper association with the catalytic site of RabGGTase, possibly resulting in its entrapment at other sites of the complex, where it is involved in non-productive stabilizing interactions. Functional Model of Rab Prenylation—Combination of the structural, simulation, and biochemical data help to generate a mechanistic model of RabGGTase function (Fig. 6). The assembly of the catalytic ternary Rab·REP·RabGGTase complex is triggered by the recognition of GTPase domain of Rab by the Rab-binding platform of REP. This results in a low to intermediate affinity complex, which is tightened by the interaction of the CIM with the CBR. The resulting binary complex forms a high affinity ternary complex with RabGGTase via the interactions between the α-subunit of RabGGTase and domain II of REP. The affinity of the complex is further increased by the weak and largely unspecific interactions of the C terminus with the active site of RabGGTase. This sequential assembly of the prenylation machinery implies progressive establishment of large and small binding interfaces and weak interactions. We have shown that the substrate specificity of RabGGTase is achieved via engagement of the REP molecule. REP, on one hand, selectively binds the GTPase core of the Rab proteins and, on the other hand, concentrates its C terminus in the vicinity of the active site of RabGGTase through the CIM·CBR anchor. Unlike the other structurally related protein prenyltransferases, RabGGTase does not engage its substrate in a tight interaction with the active site. Instead its activity is purely concentration driven, any cysteine-containing peptide concentrated in the active center undergoes modification (29Guo Z. Wu Y.W. Das D. Delon C. Cramer J. Yu S. Thuns S. Lupilova N. Waldmann H. Brunsveld L. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Blankenfeldt W. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2444-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cost of this feature of RabGGTase is a 5- to 100-fold reduction in reaction rate compared with that of FTase and GGTase-I (32Thoma N.H. Niculae A. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48631-48636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Yokoyama K. Zimmerman K. Scholten J. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Despite this the arrangement allows RabGGTase to be active on >60 Rab GTPases with unrelated C-terminal sequences. We have built and tested a model of packing of the C-terminal sequence of Rab7 in the RabGGTase catalytic complex. A large transient complex of thee components was divided into a static precomputed part and an unstructured peptide and was subject to multiple simulations using stochastic optimization in internal coordinates with the ICM method. The simulation predicted the minimal functional length of the RabGTPase C terminus and a central role for the CIM sequence in funneling the prenylatable C-terminal cysteines into the active site of RabGGTase in the context of catalytic ternary complex. The model was confirmed experimentally and is in line with the notion that, in contrast to other prenyltransferases, RabGGTase has evolved an additional adaptor protein REP that enables it to accommodate GTPases with highly divergent C-terminal sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1986869617,"Previous studies have implicated several brain areas as subserving numerical approximation. Most studies have examined brain correlates of adult numerical approximation and have not considered individual differences in mathematical ability. The present study examined non-symbolic numerical approximation in two groups of 10-year-olds: Children with low and high mathematical ability. The aims of this study were to investigate the brain mechanisms associated with approximate numerosity in children and to assess whether individual differences in mathematical ability are associated with differential brain correlates during the approximation task. The results suggest that, similarly to adults, multiple and distributed brain areas are involved in approximation in children. Despite equal behavioral performance, there were differences in the brain activation patterns between low and high mathematical ability groups during the approximation task. This suggests that individual differences in mathematical ability are reflected in differential brain response during approximation."

Viruses are adept at evolving or co-opting genomic elements that allow them to maximize their replication potential in the infected host. This evolutionary plasticity makes viruses an invaluable system to identify new mechanisms used not only by viruses but also by vertebrate cells to modulate gene expression. Here, I discuss the identification and characterization of viral mRNA structures and noncoding RNAs that have led to important insights into the molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic cells. Viruses have historically represented a valuable experimental system to study the molecular biology of mammalian cells. In part, this is due to the fact that, prior to the advent of RNA interference, viruses represented the most genetically tractable system available to study how mammalian cells function. Moreover, because many viruses express their genomes, mRNAs, and proteins at very high levels, it proved possible to perform biochemical and molecular experiments using viral gene products that were difficult to attempt using cellular gene products. As a result, virus research led to the initial identification of almost all of the known posttranscriptional modifications of mRNA transcripts. These include mRNA capping, first discovered by analysis of reovirus and vaccinia virus mRNAs (Furuichi et al., 1975Furuichi Y. Morgan M. Muthukrishnan S. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 1970; 35: 743-752Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, mutational analysis has also identified several structures located in viral mRNA molecules that play key roles in their transcription, nuclear export, or translation (Table 1, Figure 1). Finally, many viruses express a number of noncoding RNAs that enhance viral replication and pathogenesis but whose functions and mechanisms of action often remain poorly understood.Table 1Important Viral mRNA StructuresNameVirus FamilyFunctionTransactivation response (TAR) elementHIV-1 and other lentivirusesBinds to a complex containing viral Tat and cellular P-TEFb to activate transcription elongationRev response element (RRE)Lentiviruses; analogous structures found in δ-retrovirusesRecruits a complex of viral Rev and cellular CRM1 to induce nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral mRNAsConstitutive transport element (CTE)MPMV and some other simple retrovirusesRecruits the cellular Tap/p15 complex to induce nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral mRNAsInternal ribosome entry site (IRES)Picornaviruses and some flavivirusesRecruits cellular translation factors and ribosomal subunits to viral translation initiation codons in the absence of an mRNA cap Open table in a new tab Although viral RNA elements obviously play an important role in directing the transcription of the genomes and anti-genomes of RNA viruses, the transactivation response (TAR) element remains unique in that it promotes the efficient transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA by cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). HIV-1 is a complex retrovirus, that is, it encodes not only the canonical structural proteins and enzymes found in all retroviruses (Gag, Pol, and Env) but also four auxiliary proteins and two regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. Mutational analysis of HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional tat gene showed that these were replication defective due to a dramatic drop in transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element (Fisher et al., 1986Fisher A.G. Feinberg M.B. Josephs S.F. Harper M.E. Marselle L.M. Reyes G. Gonda M.A. Aldovini A. Debouk C. Gallo R.C. et al.Nature. 1986; 320: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, Kao et al., 1987Kao S.-Y. Caiman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis mapped the target site for the Tat protein to a ∼50 base pair (bp) element located immediately 3′ to the transcription start site. TAR folds into a simple RNA stem-loop structure that represents the actual target for Tat function (Feng and Holland, 1988Feng S. Holland E.C. Nature. 1988; 334: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). It is now known that Tat first interacts with a cellular factor called cyclin T1, which, along with the kinase cdk9, constitutes positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (Wei et al., 1998Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.-M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The resulting complex of Tat and P-TEPb binds directly to HIV-1 TAR via the terminal loop and an adjacent RNA bulge. Once bound to TAR, P-TEFb mediates the phosphorylation of negative regulators of transcription elongation and of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNAP II molecules that have initiated transcription of HIV-1 proviral DNA. These phosphorylation events render RNAP II elongation competent and allow it to transcribe the entire viral genome (Barboric and Peterlin, 2005Barboric M. Peterlin B.M.

Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of Tat or TAR, transcription initiation at the LTR promoter still occurs but almost all of these initiating RNAP II molecules fall off the DNA template within ∼200 bp of the transcription start site. Analysis of Tat function led to the realization that not only transcription initiation but also transcription elongation can regulate gene expression levels in animal cells (Barboric and Peterlin, 2005Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e76https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0030076Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Almost all retroviruses contain a single RNAP II-dependent promoter element in the viral LTR that drives transcription of an initial genome-length RNA that also acts as an mRNA for translation of the viral Gag and Pol proteins (Cullen, 2003Cullen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 419-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the case of HIV-1, this initial transcript can also be processed into fully spliced transcripts encoding the Tat and Rev proteins of HIV-1 as well as the auxiliary protein Nef. Alternatively, this transcript can be processed into partially spliced mRNAs encoding the three other viral auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpu, and Vpr. The HIV-1 replication cycle, therefore, requires that the single initial viral transcript is exported out of the nucleus in several differentially spliced forms. These include an unspliced form that programs Gag and Pol expression and that is packaged into virion progeny; partially spliced forms that program expression of Env, Vif, Vpr, and Vpu; and fully spliced forms that program expression of Tat, Rev, and Nef (Cullen, 2003Cullen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 419-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The difficulty with this scenario is that eukaryotic cells do not normally permit the nuclear export of intron-containing mRNAs. Almost all cellular mRNAs are transcribed as intron-containing pre-mRNAs, and these introns are recognized in the nascent transcript by splicing factors, including commitment factors. Commitment factors both commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway and retain the pre-mRNA in the nucleus until all introns are removed (Legrain and Rosbash, 1989Legrain P. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 57: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). HIV-1 mRNAs rely entirely on cellular factors for appropriate splicing, and intron-containing HIV-1 transcripts are therefore also retained in the infected cell nucleus by splicing commitment factors. The strategy that HIV-1 has evolved to circumvent this nuclear retention is dependent on the viral Rev protein, which is translated from a fully spliced viral mRNA that is constitutively exported from the nucleus. As a result, HIV-1 mutants lacking a functional rev gene are able to express the proteins encoded by fully spliced viral mRNAs, that is, Tat, Nef, and the defective Rev protein itself, but cannot express any of the proteins encoded by incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, including Gag, Pol, and Env. The transcripts encoding these viral structural proteins, however, can be detected in the nucleus of cells infected by Rev-deficient viruses, where they are either degraded or eventually fully spliced and then exported (Cullen, 2003Cullen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 419-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Rev function requires a highly structured RNA target, located in the HIV-1 env gene, called the Rev response element or RRE (Malim et al., 1989Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The RRE contains a single, high-affinity Rev-binding site and also functions as a scaffold for the multimerization of Rev on viral mRNAs. Rev in turn interacts with a cellular factor called CRM1 that belongs to the karyopherin family of nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins (Fischer et al., 1995Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by a leucine-rich motif located toward the carboxyl terminus of Rev that was the first nuclear export signal (NES) to be identified and is the prototype of the leucine-rich class of NESs. Karyopherin function is regulated by the action of a G protein called Ran, which, like all G proteins, is active when bound by GTP and inactive when bound by GDP (Kohler and Hurt, 2007Kohler A. Hurt E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Cells contain high levels of a Ran-specific G nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in the nucleus and of a Ran-specific GTPase activating protein (GAP) in the cytoplasm. As a result, Ran:GTP is largely nuclear and Ran:GDP is mainly cytoplasmic. Ran:GTP binds to CRM1 in the nucleus and activates the binding of CRM1 to leucine-rich NESs. The ribonucleoprotein complex, consisting of Ran:GTP, CRM1, and Rev, that forms on the HIV-1 RRE directs incompletely spliced HIV-1 transcripts to the nuclear pore complex and then into the cytoplasm, where hydrolysis of the GTP moiety by cytoplasmic GAP disassembles this complex. Although Rev was the first nuclear mRNA export factor to be identified, it soon became clear that CRM1 is not required for the nuclear export of most cellular mRNAs. In fact, CRM1 is involved largely in the nuclear export of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and pre-ribosomal subunits, as well as in protein nuclear export (Kohler and Hurt, 2007Kohler A. Hurt E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). So which factors are required for the export of cellular mRNAs? An important part of the answer emerged from analysis of a second retrovirus called Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). MPMV has a simpler genomic organization than HIV-1 and only encodes the three structural proteins Gag, Pol, and Env. Nevertheless, MPMV expresses both a genome-length Gag/Pol mRNA and a spliced Env mRNA. As MPMV does not encode a Rev homolog, how do the incompletely spliced genomic MPMV mRNAs reach the cytoplasm? This question led to the discovery of an RNA stem-loop structure within the MPMV genome, the constitutive transport element (CTE), that mediates the nuclear export of incompletely spliced mRNAs in the absence of any viral proteins (Bray et al., 1994Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.-T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that the CTE recruits a heterodimer of two cellular proteins, Tap and p15, that also plays a critical role in the nuclear export of the majority of cellular mRNAs (Grüter et al., 1988Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1988; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (476) Google Scholar, Kohler and Hurt, 2007Kohler A. Hurt E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Normally, the Tap/p15 heterodimer is only recruited to mature, fully spliced mRNAs. However, the CTE is able to prematurely recruit Tap/p15 to partially spliced mRNAs and thereby circumvents the nuclear retention of incompletely spliced MPMV mRNAs. Although CTEs have now been defined in several other exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, not all CTEs act by directly recruiting Tap/p15. In particular, the avian leukemia virus CTE does not appear to bind to Tap or p15 directly, although Tap may be required for its function (LeBlanc et al., 2007LeBlanc J.J. Uddowla S. Abraham B. Clatterbuck S. Beemon K.L. Virology. 2007; 363: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further analysis may reveal new insights into how the export of retroviral nuclear mRNAs is regulated. After an mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm, it must recruit cellular ribosomes in order for the translation of the encoded open reading frame to occur (Figure 1). The process of translation initiation is both complex and heavily regulated. For the majority of cellular mRNAs, it is initiated by the recruitment of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F to the mRNA 5′ cap (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008Martinez-Salas E. Pacheco A. Serrano P. Fernandez N. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (see Review by N. Sonenberg and A.G. Hinnebusch in this issue of Cell). eIF4F consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and a third protein, eIF4G. The role of eIF4G is to facilitate recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex, consisting of the 40S ribosomal subunit, found in a complex with the initiator methionine tRNA (Met-tRNAi) and other eIFs, to the mRNA cap. Once recruited to the cap, the 40S subunit then scans along the mRNA searching for the translation initiation codon. At this point, the 60S ribosomal subunit is also recruited and translation initiation occurs (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008Martinez-Salas E. Pacheco A. Serrano P. Fernandez N. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Picornaviruses presented two mysteries in terms of how these pathogenic viruses are able to translate the single large polyprotein encoded by their positive-sense RNA genome. First, the single genome-length picornavirus mRNA is uncapped. Second, infection by picornaviruses such as poliovirus results in the efficient translation of viral mRNAs, yet cellular mRNA translation is largely blocked. So, why is this uncapped viral mRNA translated more efficiently than capped cellular mRNAs? The key discovery that led to the resolution of this conundrum was the identification of the poliovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a ∼450 nucleotide (nt) highly structured RNA element found in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of poliovirus mRNAs (Jang et al., 1988Jang S.K. Krausslich H.-G. Nicklin M.J.H. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). The IRES directly recruits several eIFs and the 40S ribosomal subunit to an internal viral translation initiation codon without the requirement for either cap binding or 5′UTR scanning. As a result, poliovirus translation is independent of the host cell cap recognition factor eIF4E. Moreover, although poliovirus translation initiation does require eIF4G, it functions perfectly well with the carboxy-terminal fragment of eIF4G that is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G by a virus-encoded protease. Because cap-dependent translation requires full-length eIF4G, this cleavage blocks host cell translation, whereas viral mRNA translation is not only unimpeded but in fact is enhanced by the access of viral mRNAs to the entire pool of available eIFs and ribosomal subunits (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008Martinez-Salas E. Pacheco A. Serrano P. Fernandez N. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has demonstrated that all picornaviruses as well as some flaviviruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), contain IRES elements. Surprisingly, these exist in several functionally distinct classes. For example, the HCV IRES, unlike the poliovirus IRES, can directly recruit 40S ribosomal subunits to the viral internal translation initiation codon in the absence of eIFs, although eIFs do participate in the process of translation initiation (Martinez-Salas et al., 2008Martinez-Salas E. Pacheco A. Serrano P. Fernandez N. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An even more unusual IRES is found in cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a picornavirus-like insect virus (Jan et al., 2003Jan E. Kinzy T.G. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15410-15415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Pestova and Hellen, 2003Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The CrPV IRES not only is able to recruit both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits to assemble elongation-competent 80S ribosomes on viral mRNAs but also acts as a mimic of Met-tRNAi to permit initiation of the translation of viral capsid proteins in the absence of Met-tRNAi. Although IRES elements were first discovered in RNA viruses, a subset of cellular mRNAs are now known to also contain IRESs. Interestingly, IRESs seem to be especially prevalent in mRNAs whose expression is activated by stress, when cap-dependent translation may be inefficient. Many IRES-containing host mRNAs encode proteins that protect cells from stress, whereas the proteins encoded by other IRES-containing cellular mRNAs seem to be important during apoptosis (Bushell et al., 2006Bushell M. Stoneley M. Kong Y.W. Hamilton T.L. Spriggs K.A. Dobbyn H.C. Qin X. Sarnow P. Willis A.E. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 401-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Komar and Hatzoglou, 2005Komar A.A. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23425-23428Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Another interesting translational phenomenon observed in several virus families, including many species of retroviruses and all coronaviruses, is programmed ribosomal frameshifting (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006Brierley I. Dos Ramos F.J. Virus Res. 2006; 119: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In retroviruses such as HIV-1, frameshifting prevents some ribosomes from terminating translation at the end of the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the Gag structural protein and instead induces ribosomes to shift into the overlapping pol ORF, resulting in the production of the large Gag-Pol polyprotein. Similarly, in coronaviruses, ribosomal frameshifting is used to produce the 1a/1b replicase polyprotein rather than the shorter 1a variant. Frameshifting is induced by a bipartite element consisting of a 5′ frameshifting site and an adjacent 3′ RNA structure (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006Brierley I. Dos Ramos F.J. Virus Res. 2006; 119: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Jacks et al., 1988Jacks T. Power M.D. Masiarz F.R. Luciw P.A. Barr P.J. Varmus H.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The frameshift site has the consensus sequence X_XXY_YYZ (where the translational phase is indicated), which then slips into the −1 frame, that is, XXX_YYY_Z. The actual shift sites found in HIV-1 and the SARS coronavirus are U_UUU_UUA and U_UUA_AAC, respectively. The 3′ RNA structure found in HIV-1 is thought to be a simple RNA hairpin but other −1 frameshifting signals instead contain a pseudoknot 3′ to the frameshift signal (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006Brierley I. Dos Ramos F.J. Virus Res. 2006; 119: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the function of the 3′ RNA structure is to induce transient ribosomal pausing at the frameshift site to facilitate ribosomal slippage in the −1 direction. Although frameshifting in HIV-1 occurs with an efficiency of ∼5%, frameshifting efficiency in other viruses can be as high as ∼25% and may be facilitated by a direct interaction between the paused ribosome and the downstream pseudoknot structure. Programmed frameshifting is not unique to viruses but is found also in a small number of cellular genes in both eukaryotes and bacteria (Shigemoto et al., 2001Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Walls E. Watson C.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Reith A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990Tsuchihashi Z. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2516-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). RNA interference (RNAi) was first discovered by genetic analysis in nematodes (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (12000) Google Scholar); however, it is likely that RNAi first evolved as an innate immune response to viral infection. Indeed, RNAi continues to represent a key component of the antiviral response in plants and invertebrates (Cullen, 2006Cullen B.R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The triggers for RNAi in these species are the long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that form critical intermediates in the replication of all RNA viruses except retroviruses. These dsRNAs are bound by the RNase III-related enzyme Dicer, which progressively cleaves these dsRNAs into ∼22 bp RNA duplexes containing terminal 2 nt 3′ overhangs (see Review by R.W. Carthew and E.J. Sontheimer in this issue of Cell). One strand of this duplex, called a small-interfering RNA (siRNA), is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it acts as a guide for RNA to target RISC to complementary regions of viral genomic, anti-genomic, or mRNA species. RISC then cleaves these viral RNAs, leading to their degradation. The first siRNAs to be identified were in fact antiviral siRNAs produced in tobacco cells infected by a pathogenic RNA virus, potato virus X (Hamilton and Baulcombe, 1999Hamilton A.J. Baulcombe D.C. Science. 1999; 286: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). RNAi is a critical component of the antiviral immune response in plants and invertebrates, but emerging evidence indicates that RNAi responses to viral infection are not induced in mammalian somatic cells (Cullen, 2006Cullen B.R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Instead, mammalian cells have evolved other innate responses that are induced by viral dsRNAs, including the interferon response. Because of the importance of RNAi as an antiviral defense in plants and insects, many RNA viruses that infect these species have evolved gene products that inhibit RNAi and, hence, enhance virus replication. Conversely, the absence of antiviral RNAi responses in mammalian cells means that the RNAi machinery in these cells generally remains active during viral infection (Figure 1). Although the role of RNAi as an antiviral response appears to have been lost in mammalian somatic cells, the residual RNAi machinery still plays a very important role by mediating the function of cellular microRNAs (miRNAs). Unlike siRNAs, which are derived from long dsRNAs (frequently of exogenous origin), miRNAs are encoded within the cell's genome as part of one arm of an ∼80 nt RNA hairpin located in a larger RNAP II transcript called a primary miRNA (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30116) Google Scholar). After excision, by the sequential action of the host cell RNase III-related enzymes Drosha and Dicer, miRNAs are loaded into RISC and downregulate the expression of cellular mRNAs. Unlike viral mRNA targets of viral siRNAs, cellular mRNAs are rarely fully complementary to cellular miRNAs. As full complementarity is a prerequisite for efficient cleavage by RISC, cellular mRNAs are generally not subject to degradation by cellular miRNAs. Instead, cellular miRNAs can induce the translational inhibition of cellular mRNAs by binding to partially complementary target sites (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30116) Google Scholar). As most mammalian viruses do not seem to interfere with the loading or function of RISC, miRNAs remain active in infected cells, thus offering the possibility for viruses to use the cellular RNAi machinery to regulate cellular or viral gene expression by programming RISC with viral miRNAs. Analysis of a range of virally infected cells has revealed that several DNA viruses, including herpesviruses, encode multiple distinct miRNAs. Of note, most viral miRNAs appear to be processed by the same Drosha and Dicer dependent pathway used by the majority of cellular miRNAs, although there are a few examples of viral miRNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, not RNAP II, and then excised directly by Dicer (Gottwein and Cullen, 2008Gottwein E. Cullen B.R. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Similarly, RISCs programmed by viral miRNAs appear to function in the same way as RISCs programmed by cellular miRNAs. Although beyond the scope of this article, it is interesting to note that several cellular and viral mRNA targets of viral miRNAs have now been defined (Gottwein and Cullen, 2008Gottwein E. Cullen B.R. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In general, it appears that viral miRNAs either downregulate cellular or viral genes that increase the sensitivity of virally infected cells to host innate or adaptive immune responses or, in the case of herpesvirus miRNAs, stabilize viral latency by downregulating the expression of the viral immediate early proteins, which favor entry into the lytic replication cycle. In addition to miRNAs, a number of DNA viruses also encode long noncoding RNAs that play a role in regulating viral replication and pathogenesis (Table 2; reviewed in Sullivan and Cullen, 2009Sullivan C.S. Cullen B.R. Non-coding regulatory RNAs of the DNA tumor viruses.in: Damania B. Pipas J. DNA Tumor Viruses. Springer, New York2009: 645-682Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar; see Review by C.P. Ponting, P.L. Oliver, and W. Reik in this issue of Cell). But how do viruses use noncoding RNAs to promote their replication? One interesting noncoding RNA is the latency associated transcript (LAT) encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). LAT is an ∼8.3 kb capped polyadenylated RNA that is the only viral RNA expressed at high levels in neurons latently infected with HSV-1. LAT is spliced to give an unstable ∼6.3 kb exonic RNA and a stable ∼2 kb intron. The instability of the 6.3 kb LAT RNA appears to be due to the fact that it is processed into several viral miRNAs that may play a key role in regulating HSV-1 latency (Umbach et al., 2008Umbach J.L. Kramer M.F. Jurak I. Karnowski H.W. Coen D.M. Cullen B.R. Nature. 2008; 454: 780-783PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the stable 2 kb LAT intron is less clear, but evidence has been presented arguing that the LAT intron is exported out of the nucleus by CRM1 and associates with cellular ribosomes, thus suggesting a role in modulating mRNA translation in neurons latently infected with HSV-1 (Atanasiu and Fraser, 2007Atanasiu D. Fraser N.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7695-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Table 2Selected Viral Noncoding RNAsNameVirusSizeFunctionLAT intronHSV-1∼2 kbUnclear, but may modulate translation in latently infected neuronsPANKSHV∼1.1 kbUnclear, but contains an element that stabilizes unspliced transcriptsβ2.7hCMV∼2.7 kbBinds to mitochondrial enzyme complex I to stabilize ATP production and inhibit apoptosisVA1adenovirus∼160 ntBinds to cellular PKR to block PKR activation by viral dsRNA and the resultant inhibition in translation Open table in a new tab Another interesting viral noncoding RNA is the polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). PAN is an unspliced RNAP II transcript that is the most highly expressed viral RNA during lytic KSHV infection, comprising up to 80% of all viral RNAs. Remarkably, the function of this RNA in the viral life cycle is still unclear. However, recent data demonstrate that PAN contains a novel ∼80 nt-long RNA element that stabilizes PAN RNA in the infected cell nucleus. Insertion of this viral RNA element in cis also increases the nuclear abundance of cellular mRNAs, such as β-globin mRNAs, that are normally unstable when expressed in an intronless form (Conrad et al., 2006Conrad N.K. Mili S. Marshall E.L. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 943-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this element simply stabilizes PAN RNAs or whether it also acts in trans to stabilize other KSHV-coding mRNAs, which are also largely intronless. Finally, several viral noncoding RNAs seem to be inhibitors of cellular innate antiviral immune responses. For example, the β2.7 noncoding RNA encoded by human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) binds to mitochondrial enzyme complex I of the host cell. This interaction stabilizes the production of ATP in infected cells and also inhibits virally induced apoptosis (Reeves et al., 2007Reeves M.B. Davies A.A. McSharry B.P. Wilkinson G.W. Sinclair J.H. Science. 2007; 316: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Another noncoding RNA, the VA1 RNA expressed by adenovirus, also binds to a cellular factor to inhibit an antiviral response. In this case, the target is protein kinase R (PKR), a cellular protein that binds to the long dsRNAs produced by adenoviruses and many other pathogenic viruses. Binding of dsRNA by PKR induces PKR dimerization and autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of cellular eIF2α, which results in a global inhibition of translation in the infected host cell. VA1, a highly structured ∼160 nt-long noncoding RNA, binds to PKR with high affinity and blocks PKR dimerization and activation. This prevents the inhibition of translation induced by adenovirus-derived dsRNAs and allows virus replication to proceed unimpeded (Mathews and Shenk, 1991Mathews M.B. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5657-5662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both hCMV β2.7 and adenovirus VA1, like KSHV PAN and HSV-1 LAT, are also expressed at high levels in infected cells. β2.7 comprises up to 20% of all viral transcripts in hCMV-infected cells, and adenovirus VA1 is expressed at an extraordinarily high number of copies (∼108) per infected cell. Presumably, these high expression levels facilitate the saturation of cellular binding sites for these RNAs. Efforts to understand the replication cycles of viruses are often motivated by the pathogenic potential of these intracellular parasites. However, such analyses have also led to several key insights into how not only infected cells but also uninfected cells regulate the expression of their genome. Moreover, as noted in the brief discussion of viral noncoding RNAs, our knowledge of how virally encoded transcripts work in the host cell remains far from complete. Clearly, future research into virus replication will provide unexpected and exciting insights into the complex molecular machinery that makes human cells tick."

The sensor kinase TodS has a complex domain arrangement containing two functional modules, each harboring a sensor- and an autokinase domain and separated by a receiver domain. Based on site-directed mutagenesis of phosphoaccepting His-190, Asp-500, and His-760 and in vitro transphosphorylation experiments with recombinant TodS fragments, we show that TodS uses a multiple step phosphorelay mechanism to activate TodT. Toluene binding stimulates exclusively phosphorylation of His-190, which is followed by phosphotransfer to Asp-500 and subsequently to His-760 prior to phosphorylation of TodT Asp-57. Mutation of His-190, Asp-500, and H760A prevented up-regulation of toluene-mediated stimulation of TodT transphosphorylation in vitro and reduced in vivo expression of PtodX to the basal level. Calorimetric studies support that TodT binds to the C-terminal kinase module with a KD of ∼200 nm and 1:1 stoichiometry.

This is the first report of a multiple step phosphorelay mechanism of a sensor kinase that involves two autokinase domains. The adaptation of bacteria to changes in environmental signals is often mediated at the transcriptional level by two-component systems (TCS), 2The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component system; HK, histidine kinase; HPT, histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; PAS domain, Per-Arnt-Sim domain; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. which contain as basic components a sensor kinase and a response regulator (1Ulrich L.E. Koonin E.V. Zhulin I.B. Trends Microbiol... 2005; 13: 52-56Google Scholar). Sensor kinases generally recognize signal molecules, which leads to an alteration of their phosphorylation state and subsequently transphosphorylation of the corresponding cognate response regulator. The ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated response regulator directly influences promoter activity (2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2000; 69: 183-215Google Scholar). Based on domain arrangement and function, TCSs are grouped into two major families. One family, the so-called prototypal TCSs, is characterized by the fact that sensor kinases and response regulators each contain a single phosphorylatable site and phosphotransfer occurs directly from the sensor kinase to the response regulator. The other family comprises the multiple step phosphorelay systems (3Appleby J.L. Parkinson J.S. Bourret R.B. Cell.. 1996; 86: 845-848Google Scholar), which in contrast to prototypal TCSs contain additional phosphorylation sites. These systems involve typically initial phosphorylation at the autokinase domain, followed by phosphotransfer to a receiver domain and subsequently to a phosphotransfer domain. The phosphoryl group for the transphosphorylation of the cognate response regulator departs from the latter domain (Fig. 1A). Multiple step phosphorelays have been described in which the phosphotransfer domain is an HPT domain (histidine-containing phosphotransfer, InterPro signature IPR008207, Ref. 4Zhang W. Shi L. Microbiology.. 2005; 151: 2159-2173Google Scholar) or a Spo0B-like protein (IPR016120, Ref. 5Varughese K.I. Madhusudan Zhou X.Z. Whiteley J.M. Hoch J.A. Mol. Cell... 1998; 2: 485-493Google Scholar). Both types of domains were shown to be devoid of autokinase activity (6Georgelis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol... 1997; 179: 5429-5435Google Scholar, 7Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A.

The initial phosphorylatable domains of a multiple step phosphorelay can either be part of a single protein, which is well documented for tripartite sensor kinases (Fig. 1) such as ArcB (8Kwon O.

Cell.. 1991; 64: 545-552Google Scholar). The domain organization of TodS from Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E is different from that of the tripartite sensor kinases (Fig. 1). TodS has two modules each containing a PAS-type sensor domain and an autokinase domain. Because of this particular domain arrangement, members of this family have been termed ""double sensor kinases.” TodS forms, together with TodT, a TCS that regulates expression of the tod (toluene dioxygenase) operon in P. putida for toluene metabolism (12Lau P.C.K.

Other members of the double sensor kinase family are also involved in the regulation of degradation pathways such as StyS (styrene degradation in P. fluorescence and Pseudomonas sp.

Furthermore, genome sequencing projects have revealed that TodS-like proteins are found in other hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria such as Dechloromonas aromatica (20Coates J.D. Chakraborty R. Lack J.G. O'Connor S.M. Cole K.A. Bender K.S. Achenbach L.A. Nature.. 2001; 411: 1039-1043Google Scholar) and Methylibium petroleiphilum (21Kane S.R. Chakicherla A.Y. Chain P.S. Schmidt R. Shin M.W.

The reason for this apparent functional link between the domain arrangement of TodS-type sensor kinases, and their involvement in the regulation of hydrocarbon degradation is unknown. The 108-kDa TodS protein is among the largest sensor kinases ever described. We developed a protocol for the purification of the full-length protein and showed that it exhibits a broad effector specificity, recognizing a wide variety of mono- and biaromatic compounds (15Lacal J. Busch A. Guazzaroni M.E. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 8191-8196Google Scholar, 16Busch A. Lacal J. Martos A. Ramos J.L. Krell T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 13774-13779Google Scholar). We have also shown that effector molecules bind to the N-terminal PAS domain, causing an increase in the amount of phosphorylated TodS, which in turn stimulates transphosphorylation of TodT (15Lacal J. Busch A. Guazzaroni M.E. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 8191-8196Google Scholar, 16Busch A. Lacal J. Martos A. Ramos J.L. Krell T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 13774-13779Google Scholar). TodT binds to three different sites at the PtodX promoter in a cooperative and hierarchical manner. TodT-P in conjunction with IHF (integration host factor) was found to stimulate promoter activity (22Lacal J. Guazzaroni M.E. Busch A. Krell T. Ramos J.L. J. Mol. Biol... 2008; 376: 325-337Google Scholar, 23Lacal J. Guazzaroni M.E. Gutiérrez-del-Arroyo P. Busch A. Vélez M. Krell T. Ramos J.L. J. Mol. Biol... 2008; 384: 1037-1047Google Scholar). However, the functional reason for the complex architecture of TodS remains unknown and is the focus of this work. Two different modes of activation can be envisaged: either each of the modules containing a PAS and a kinase domain are independent units responding to different signals and serving potentially different regulators, or alternatively, all three phosphorylation sites are functionally linked by intramolecular communication. Using a set of site-directed mutants as well as different recombinant fragments, we were able to establish that TodS uses also a multiple step phosphorelay mechanism involving amino acids His-190→Asp-500→His-760 followed by phosphorylation of Asp-57 at TodT.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant DNA Techniques—Site-directed mutations in the todS gene were introduced into plasmids pTodS (for protein expression; see Table 1) and pMIR66 (for β-galactosidase measurements; see Table 1) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides used are listed in Table 2. For the generation of truncated versions of TodS the corresponding gene fragments were amplified with appropriate primers using Taq Polymerase (Eppendorf) and pMIR66 as the template.

All plasmids were verified by sequencing the insert and flanking regions. Plasmids pHK1, pRRR, and pHK2 express the N-terminal module, the receiver domain and the C-terminal module of the TodS protein, respectively, and the corresponding truncated proteins produced from these constructs were called NTodS-short, MTodS, and CTodS-short, respectively.Table 2Oligonucleotides used to generate recombinant TodS fragments and site-directed mutants Plasmids Sequence (5′-3′) For expression plasmids of TodS fragmentspHK1 GGGGCTAGCAATTATTATAATATCTGCCTCAAG CGCGGATCCTCAGTCGGATTGAAATGGAAGpRRR GAGGCTAGCCAGCCTCGGGTGCTAAT CACGGATCCTCACCCCTGATCGGAAAGCTCpHK2 GCATACGGATCCTCACTGTCTGGCAGGGATACT For site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids pTodS and pMIR66pAB1 and pAB4 TTGCCAAGGTGAGCGCTGAGTTGCGCACTCCaMismatch nucleotides for amino acid replacement to alanine are underlined.

Open table in a new tab Overexpression and Purification of Proteins—TodS, its site-directed mutants and recombinant fragments were expressed and purified as detailed for TodS in Lacal et al. (15Lacal J. Busch A. Guazzaroni M.E. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 8191-8196Google Scholar). TodT and TodTD57A were purified as described for TodT in the same publication. Phosphorylation Assays—Prior to analysis, all proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Autophosphorylation of TodS, its recombinant fragments, or site-directed mutants was carried out with 200 μm ATP containing 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. To determine the effect of toluene on autophosphorylation a 2-mm stock solution of toluene was prepared in dialysis buffer and added to the sample to a final concentration of 100 μm. The corresponding volume of buffer was added to the control sample. After different time intervals, samples were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 6× Laemmli loading buffer or flash-freezing prior to analysis on SDS-PAGE. For transphosphorylation assays between TodS and TodT or TodTD57A, 20 μm TodS was incubated for 20 min with 200 μm ATP containing 4μCi [γ-32P]ATP, then a slight molar excess of TodT was added. Reactions were stopped after 15 min. For transphosphorylation experiments between individual fragments of TodS, NTodS- at 60 μm was incubated with 200 μm ATP containing 4μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min. ATP was then separated from the protein by gel filtration on NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare). Phosphorylated protein was then incubated with equimolar amounts of MTodS, and samples were removed at different time intervals. For transphosphorylation assays between recombinant TodS fragments and TodT the different TodS polypeptides at 20 μm where first incubated in 200 μm ATP containing 4 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min. Subsequently MTodS or an equivalent volume of buffer was added to all samples. After another 10 min of incubation, an equimolar amount of TodT was added. Samples were taken after 10 min for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Quantification of 32P-Labeled Proteins—Gels were dried under a vacuum at 80 °C and exposed to a phosphorimager (Personal FX equipment, Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis was done with QuantityOne® software. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Freshly purified TodS and TodT were dialyzed into 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 200 mm KCl, 300 mm imidazole, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a VP-microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). TodS at a concentration of 1.6 μm was titrated with aliquots of 23 μm TodT. This experiment was repeated using TodS and TodT solutions to which 1 mm freshly prepared ATP was added. Injection of 23 μm TodT into dialysis buffer resulted in small and uniform peaks typical of dilution heats. Data were analyzed with the MicroCal version of ORIGIN using the one binding site model. β-Galactosidase Assays—To quantify the expression from the TOD pathway promoter we used P. putida DOT-T1E todST, which is a knock-out mutant for todST, bearing pMIR77 (PtodX::lacZ) and pMIR66 or derivatives thereof (Table 1). Fresh LB medium was inoculated with a single colony from LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics and cultured at 30 °C overnight. These cultures were diluted 100-fold in the same medium supplemented or not with 1.5 mm toluene, and cell growth was monitored over time. When the cultures reached a turbidity of 0.8 at 660 nm β-galactosidase activity was determined in permeabilized whole cells as described by Miller (24Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1972; Google Scholar). TodS Contains Two Functionally Active Histidine Autokinase Domains—TodS was predicted to contain two autokinase domains (Fig. 1), and initial experiments were aimed at verifying whether both domains posses autophosphorylation activity. To this end, alanine substitution mutants of the histidine residues predicted to be the phosphoacceptors in each autokinase domain, namely His-190 and His-760, were generated by site-specific mutagenesis, and autophosphorylation assays in the absence and presence of toluene were carried out. Equal amounts of TodSH190A and TodSH760A were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of toluene (Fig. 2A), a band of similar intensity was detected for each mutant. These results were corroborated by autophosphorylation assays of the recombinant fragments NTodS-long and CTodS-long (Fig. 1B), each of which contain a single autokinase domain and a receiver domain. As expected, both proteins were phosphorylated (Fig. 2B), although the amount of phosphorylated CTodS-long was less than NTodS-long. These results show that TodS possesses two functionally active kinase domains with similar basal activity. Toluene Binding to the N-terminal PAS Domain Increases Phosphorylation of Its Neighboring Autokinase Domain—We have shown previously that effector molecules such as toluene bind exclusively to the N-terminal PAS domain of TodS (Figs. 1, 15, 16). Because this sensor kinase has two functional autokinase domains, effector binding could stimulate either one of the domains or potentially both. To address this question, autophosphorylation assays of mutants TodSH190A and TodSH760A were repeated in the presence of toluene. No alteration in the phosphorylation state as compared with the absence of toluene was observed for mutant TodSH190A, whereas a significant increase in phosphorylation in response to toluene was noted for mutant TodSH760A (Fig. 2A). Because phosphorylation of the latter mutant is solely due to the action of the N-terminal kinase domain, our data indicate that toluene increased the phosphorylation level of only the N-terminal kinase domain. Evidence for an Intramolecular Phosphorelay at TodS—TodS is predicted to contain three phosphorylatable amino acids: His-190 and His-760 of the autokinase domains and Asp-500 of the response regulator receiver domain (Fig. 1). It has been reported that recombinant domains of large proteins can associate in a native-like fashion without significant loss of protein activity when mixed in vitro (25Krell T. Renauld-Mongénie G. Nicolaï M.C. Fraysse S. Chevalier M. Bérard Y. Oakhill J. Evans R.W. Gorringe A. Lissolo L. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 14712-14722Google Scholar). To provide proof for phosphotransfer between the different domains of TodS, we generated recombinant proteins corresponding to the NTodS-short, MTodS, and CTodS-short fragments (Fig. 1B), each of which contained a single phosphoaccepting residue (His-190, Asp-500, and His-760, respectively). These three recombinant proteins with a single phosphoaccepting residue were subjected to autophosphorylation assays with ATP. The data available to date on the response regulator receiver domain indicate that it cannot be phosphorylated by ATP. To verify whether this also holds for TodS, the recombinant fragment MTodS (Fig. 1B) was subjected to phosphorylation assays with [γ-32P]ATP, which unequivocally revealed that it was not phosphorylated by ATP (data not shown). Satisfactory autophosphorylation was observed for NTodS-short, but CTodS-short was devoid of activity (data not shown). Therefore, attempts were focused on detecting transphosphorylation between NTodS-short and MTodS, containing His-190 and Asp-500, respectively. To this end, NTodS-short was phosphorylated in the presence of toluene and [γ-32P]ATP and applied to a NAP-5 gel filtration column to separate the protein from ATP. A stoichiometric amount of MTodS was added to the resulting protein, and samples were taken at different times for SDS-PAGE analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the band corresponding to NTodS-short gradually disappeared whereas a band representing phosphorylated MTodS became visible. Maximum MTodS phosphorylation was seen after 10 min, before this protein gradually dephosphorylated. This strongly suggests the existence of intramolecular phosphotransfer in TodS. TodT Transphosphorylation Occurs from the C-terminal Kinase Domain of TodS—Because TodS contains two kinase domains, transphosphorylation to TodT may occur from either of the domains or from both. To cast light on this issue, transphosphorylation between various TodS fragments and TodT was studied (Fig. 4). To this end TodS polypeptides were phosphorylated for 20 min, which was followed by the addition of an equimolar amount of TodT. The first two lanes in Fig. 4 illustrate that NTodS-short and NTodS-long (see Fig. 1) are efficiently phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP. However, no transphosphorylation to TodT was detectable. Lane 3 shows that CTodS-long was phosphorylated, although to a lower extent than NTodS as already noted in Fig. 2. However, the addition of TodT to CTodS-long as shown in lane 4 of Fig. 4 resulted in a quantitative transfer of the phosphoryl groups to TodT. The last lane, representing a mixture of NTodS-short, MTodS and TodT, was another control experiment which illustrated that NTodS-short maintained its capacity to transphosphorylate MTodS, but failed to phosphorylate TodT. In summary, these data are consistent with phosphotransfer from the C-terminal kinase domain toward TodT. Analysis of Site-directed TodS Mutants Confirms the Multiple Step Phosphorelay Mechanism and TodT Transphosphorylation from His-760—To provide further support for the existence of a His-190→Asp-500→His-760 phosphorelay, transphosphorylation assays were conducted with TodT and the three TodS mutants in which the phosphoaccepting amino acid was replaced with alanine. Equal amounts of TodS, TodSH190A, TodSD500A, and TodSH760A were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min before TodT was added. Experiments were carried out in the presence of toluene which implies that activity of HK1 domain is stimulated whereas HK2 domain operates at basal activity (Fig. 2A). Transphosphorylation assays of the wild-type protein showed bands for both TodS and TodT (Fig. 5, lane 1). The band corresponding to TodT dominated, indicating that transphosphorylation was a relatively rapid process, which is in agreement with studies of other TCSs (26Yamamoto K. Hirao K. Oshima T. Aiba H. Utsumi R. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 1448-1456Google Scholar). However, transphosphorylation assays of TodSH760A showed only a single strong band at the TodS level (Fig. 5, lane 4), whereas no band was seen for TodT. The absence of any transphosphorylation demonstrates that the phosphoryl group departed from residue His-760 in TodS toward TodT, which confirms data presented in Fig. 4. The strong band corresponding to TodSH760A confirms that toluene stimulated phosphorylation, but in the absence of transphosphorylation the phosphoryl group apparently remained at His-190 and Asp-500. Most interestingly, the amount of phosphorylated TodT seen in the transphosphorylation of TodSH190A (lane 2) and TodSD500A (lane 3) was very similar, probably because of the weak basal activity of the C-terminal kinase domain. Previous experiments have shown that toluene stimulated autophosphorylation of TodSD500A (data not shown) but not of TodSH190A (Fig. 2). However, this stimulation was not reflected as an increase in phosphorylated TodT in transphosphorylation assays (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that Asp-500 was essential to transmit an increase in phosphorylation of the N-terminal kinase domain to the C-terminal kinase domain. The notion that the His-190→Asp-500→His-760 phosphorelay is interrupted by replacing Asp-500 was supported by the fact that the amount of phosphorylated TodSD500A was larger than the phosphorylated wild-type TodS. TodT Binds TodS with 1:1 Stoichiometry: The Presence of ATP Is Essential for Interaction—We used ITC (27Krell T. Microb. Biotechnol... 2008; 1: 126-136Google Scholar) to study the interaction between TodS and TodT. ITC experiments of TodS with TodT at three different temperatures did not reveal binding heats, which suggested, unexpectedly, that the two proteins did not interact. Another series of ITC titrations of TodS with different nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP revealed, surprisingly, that TodS bound only ATP. We then studied whether TodS interacted with TodT in the presence of 1 mm ATP, by adding a freshly prepared solution to both proteins prior to the experiment. The raw data from this experiment (Fig. 6) showed that initial peaks were broad at their base, which could be explained by the fact that initial binding heats were followed by heats from the kinetically slower process of TodS-TodT transphosphorylation (note: binding processes that are not followed by a kinetically slow event give rise to peaks which are narrow at its base). This distorted the enthalpic and entropic contribution, but did not impact on the binding constant or the stoichiometry of the interaction (27Krell T. Microb. Biotechnol... 2008; 1: 126-136Google Scholar). After each injection the signal returned to the baseline, which enabled correct peak integration and curve fitting (Fig. 6, lower panel). Data analysis revealed that both proteins interacted with a stoichiometry of 1.06 ± 0.1 and a dissociation constant of 214 ± 10 nm. The control experiment with TodT/ATP and buffer/ATP yielded small, uniform peaks. When this experiment was repeated in the presence of 1 mm ADP, AMP-PNP, or 100 μm toluene, no interactions was observed between TodS and TodT. Subsequently the interaction between NTodS-long and CTodS-long with TodT was studied in an analogous fashion, i.e. in presence of 1 mm ATP. CTodS-long was found to bind to TodT with an affinity of 65 ± 7nm (data not shown). No binding heats were observed for the titration of NTodS-long with TodT. TodT Asp-57 Is the Last Step in the TodS/TodT Phosphorylation Cascade—The data presented so far suggested the existence of an intramolecular phosphorylation cascade at TodS, and that residue His-760 of TodS is the amino acid that donates the phosphoryl group to the response regulator. Previous in vitro transcription studies (15Lacal J. Busch A. Guazzaroni M.E. Krell T. Ramos J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 8191-8196Google Scholar) suggested that Asp-57 operates as the phosphoaccepting residue. To verify this prediction transphosphorylation assays between TodS and TodT or TodTD57A were carried out (Fig. 7). No transphosphorylation was detected for the TodTD57A mutant, which indicated that this amino acid is the last step in the His-190→Asp-500→His-760→Asp-57 phosphorelay in the TodS/TodT TCS. In Vivo Proof for the Deduced Phosphorylation Cascade in the TodS/TodT System—The effect of the amino acid substitutions H190A, D500A, and H760A was evaluated in vivo by measuring expression from PtodX promoter fused to 'lacZ. Plasmid pMIR77 bearing the PtodX::lacZ fusion was transformed in the knock-out mutant P. putida DOT-T1EtodST– bearing or not pMIR66 (todST) or plasmids pAB4, pAB5, and pAB6, which are pMIR66 derivative with a todS mutant allele that produces TodSH190A, TodSD500A, and TodSH760A, respectively. In cells with pMIR77 plus pMIR66, expression from PtodX was basal and low (25–40 Miller units) in the absence of toluene, and increased to 5000 ± 500 Miller units when toluene was added. However, in the three strains bearing pAB4, pAB5, and pAB6 encoding the above-mentioned three TodS mutants, expression from PtodX was below 30 Miller units regardless of the presence of toluene. Therefore, the mutation of His-190, Asp-500, and His-760 entirely abrogates toluene-mediated induction of PtodX activity in vivo. These data entirely support (a) that toluene stimulates phosphorylation of H190, (b) that Asp-500 is essential for intra-TodS phosphotransfer and that there is no direct link between the two kinase domains, and (c) that His-760 is the site for transphosphorylation of TodT. TodS Belongs to a New Family of Multiple Step Phosphorelay Sensor Kinases—Two-component systems contain as basic components a sensor kinase and a response regulator. Data currently available indicate that response regulators involved in transcriptional control form a relatively well-conserved family of proteins. Galperin (28Galperin M.Y. J. Bacteriol... 2006; 188: 4169-4182Google Scholar) showed that over 80% of DNA binding response regulators belong to either the NarL or OmpR families, which are characterized by an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif-containing DNA binding domain. In contrast to the relative conservation of response regulators is the extreme functional and structural diversity of sensor kinases (29Mascher T. Helmann J.D. Unden G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 2006; 70: 910-938Google Scholar), which can be membrane-bound or not, have a large variety of different sensor domains located either in the periplasm or cytosol and recognize signals in many different ways (29Mascher T. Helmann J.D. Unden G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 2006; 70: 910-938Google Scholar). To fully comprehend the physiological relevance of TCSs it appears indispensable to explore the functional and structural diversity of sensor kinases. TodS is clearly different from other sensor kinases characterized to date because it contains two modules each of which has a sensor and a kinase domain. Based on our data, we propose the functional model of TodS depicted in Fig. 8. Initial binding of toluene increases the phosphorylation state of the N-terminal autokinase domain. The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the internal receiver domain, and eventually to the C-terminal kinase domain before it is transferred to Asp-57 of TodT, which is the primary regulator of the PtodX promoter. Effector binding stimulated phosphorylation of His-190, whereas TodT phosphorylation occurred from His-760, evidence of communication between the two kinase domains. Available data support the absence of a direct communication between the two kinase domains, and that Asp-500 is essential for establishing this link. This statement is based on two lines of evidence. First, in vitro autophosphorylation studies show that toluene stimulates activity of TodSD500A (increased phosphorylation at His-190) but not that of the H190A mutant. However, the amount of phosphorylated TodT in transphosphorylation experiments with TodSD500A and TodSH190A is similar (Fig. 5). Second, no toluene-mediated stimulation of transcription from PtodX was observed in in vivo gene expression studies of mutant D500A. At present we have not explored whether the phosphorelay occurs in the inverse direction (His-760→Asp-500→His-190), which could be of functional and physiological importance. The phosphorelay described for TodS is in several aspects comparable to that of previously described systems such as the ArcB system. In both cases the sequence of transphosphorylation involves the amino acids H1-D-H2. In vivo data for ArcB show that there is no direct transphosphorylation between H1 and H2 and that the response regulator ArcA is exclusively phosphorylated by H2 (8Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol... 2000; 182: 3858-3862Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that the TodS phosphorelay shares the same characteristics. However, the TodS phosphorelay distinguishes itself from the ArcB system in the fact that it employs a second autokinase domain, instead of an HPT domain, as phosphotransfer domain and that it also harbors an additional PAS domain. Both differences will be discussed in some more detail below. Sequence analysis of TodS using SMART (30Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 5857-5864Google Scholar) identifies with high confidence two histidine autokinase domains (defined by signatures IPR003661 and IPR003594), which were termed HK1 and HK2. Here we show that both domains possess autokinase activity using ATP as cofactor. In general, the biological function of a histidine autokinase domain consists in its autophosphorylation and the subsequent catalysis of phosphotransfer to either the cognate response regulator or, in the case of phosphorelays, to an internal receiver domain. In the case of TodS, the HK1 domain fulfills this function. However, the phosphotransfer domain, typically HPT domains or Spo0B-like proteins in other phosphorelays, is in the case of TodS another histidine autokinase domain. The fact that a histidine kinase domain operates as a phosphotransfer domain in a phosphorelay corresponds thus to a new biological function for this domain. HK1 and HK2 share only a modest degree of sequence identity of 23%. Furthermore both domains belong to different classes (HPK1a and HPK4, respectively, for HK1 and HK2) according to the sequence-based classification proposed by Grebe and Stock (31Grebe W. Stock J.B. Adv. Micro. Physiol... 1999; 41: 139-227Google Scholar). This indicates that TodS might have evolved as result of a gene fusion rather than gene duplication event. The obvious question is thus why TodS has an autokinase phosphotransfer domain whereas the large majority of other phosphorelay systems employ an HPT domain instead. The answer to that question may lie in the second feature, which distinguishes TodS from other known phosphorelay systems, which is the presence of an additional PAS domain located in sequence just upstream the HK2 domain. In general, PAS domains are involved in sensing of small molecules (32Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 1999; 63: 479-506Google Scholar), and it is therefore likely that PAS 2 of TodS also exerts this function. We have shown that TodS His-760 can receive phosphoryl groups from either ATP or Asp-500. In this context it appears possible that either or both activities are modulated by an as yet unknown signal, which is recognized by the C-terminal PAS sensor domain. We have shown previously that aromatic effector molecules bind exclusively to the N-terminal PAS domain. The notion that both PAS domains might respond to different signals is underlined by the weak sequence identity of 17% between both PAS domains. For the TodS homologue StyS it was proposed that the C-terminal PAS domain might respond to the cell redox potential (33Rampioni G. Leoni L. Pietrangeli B. Zennaro E. BMC Microbiol... 2008; 8: 92-105Google Scholar). This would also agree with the concept that the physiological reason for complex multidomain sensor kinases lies in their capacity to respond to different signals enabling for a fine-tuning of the transcriptional response. The existence and mechanism of action of a secondary signal, which might modulate TodS activity remain to be documented. Sensor kinases predicted to contain two autokinase domains separated in sequence by a receiver domain are present in numerous bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Bradyrhizobium sp., Stigmatella aurantica, and Anabaena variabilis or eukaryotes like Dictyostelium discoideum or Filobasidiella neoformans. It is thus possible that these proteins also use a multiple step phosphorelay mechanism. Requirement of ATP for TodS/TodT Interaction—There is no doubt that the TodS/TodT system represents a novel regulatory mechanism and presents specific features not found in other two component systems. A feature which clearly distinguishes TodS/TodT from other systems concerns the molecular interaction between the two proteins. A large series of studies on other TCSs converged on the finding that both components interact in vitro with relatively modest affinity for a protein-protein interaction, as exemplified by FixL/FixJ (KD = 4 μm, Ref. 34Sousa E.H. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry.. 2005; 44: 15359-15365Google Scholar), EnvZ/OmpR (1.2 μm, Ref. 35Cai S.J. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 24155-24161Google Scholar), CheA/CheY (0.9–1.3 μm, Ref. 36Stewart R.C. van Bruggen R. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 8766-8777Google Scholar), and EvgS/EvgA (1.2 μm, Ref. 37Perraud A.L. Rippe K. Bantscheff M. Glocker M. Lucassen M. Jung K. Sebald W. Weiss V. Gross R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1478: 341-354Google Scholar). In all cases, the presence of ATP was not required for molecular interaction. ITC experiments of TodS with TodT at three different temperatures did not reveal binding heats, a finding which strongly suggests that the two proteins do not interact. The same result was obtained in the presence of 100 μm toluene. However, when the experiments were repeated with both protein solutions containing 1 mm ATP, a sigmoid binding curve was observed (Fig. 6). We hypothesize that ATP binding at TodS induces conformational changes enabling interaction with TodT. The cellular ATP concentration is estimated to be between 3 and 5 mm implying TodS saturation, and the potential physiological relevance of this finding awaits further study.

https://openalex.org/W2010288135,"We report a novel isoform of non-muscle myosin II-C (NM II-C), NM II-C2, that is generated by alternative splicing of an exon, C2, encoding 41 amino acids in mice (33 in humans). The 41 amino acids are inserted into loop 2 of the NM II-C heavy chain within the actin binding region. Unlike most vertebrate non-muscle and smooth muscle myosin IIs, baculovirus-expressed mouse heavy meromyosin (HMM) II-C2 demonstrates no requirement for regulatory myosin light chain (MLC(20)) phosphorylation for maximum actin-activated MgATPase activity or maximum in vitro motility as measured by the sliding actin filament assay. In contrast, noninserted HMM II-C0 and another alternatively spliced isoform HMM II-C1, which contains 8 amino acids inserted into loop 1, are dependent on MLC(20) phosphorylation for both actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility ( Kim, K. Y., Kovacs, M., Kawamoto, S., Sellers, J. R., and Adelstein, R. S. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 22769-22775 ). HMM II-C1C2, which contains both the C1 and C2 inserts, does not require MLC(20) phosphorylation for full activity similar to HMM II-C2. These constitutively active C2-inserted isoforms of NM II-C are expressed only in neuronal tissue. This is in contrast to NM II-C1 and NM II-C0, both of which are ubiquitously expressed. Full-length NM II-C2-GFP expressed in COS-7 cells localizes to filaments in interphase cells and to the cytokinetic ring in dividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140673804,"This paper describes the role of alpha-subunit VISIT-DG sequence residues alphaSer-347 and alphaGly-351 in catalytic sites of Escherichia coli F(1)F(o) ATP synthase. X-ray structures show the very highly conserved alpha-subunit VISIT-DG sequence in close proximity to the conserved phosphate-binding residues alphaArg-376, betaArg-182, betaLys-155, and betaArg-246 in the phosphate-binding subdomain. Mutations alphaS347Q and alphaG351Q caused loss of oxidative phosphorylation and reduced ATPase activity of F(1)F(o) in membranes by 100- and 150-fold, respectively, whereas alphaS347A mutation showed only a 13-fold loss of activity and also retained some oxidative phosphorylation activity. The ATPase of alphaS347Q mutant was not inhibited, and the alphaS347A mutant was slightly inhibited by MgADP-azide, MgADP-fluoroaluminate, or MgADP-fluoroscandium, in contrast to wild type and alphaG351Q mutant. Whereas 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole (NBD-Cl) inhibited wild type and alphaG351Q mutant ATPase essentially completely, ATPase in alphaS347A or alphaS347Q mutant was inhibited maximally by approximately 80-90%, although reaction still occurred at residue betaTyr-297, proximal to the alpha-subunit VISIT-DG sequence, near the phosphate-binding pocket. Inhibition characteristics supported the conclusion that NBD-Cl reacts inbetaE (empty) catalytic sites, as shown previously by x-ray structure analysis. Phosphate protected against NBD-Cl inhibition in wild type and alphaG351Q mutant but not in alphaS347Q or alphaS347A mutant. The results demonstrate that alphaSer-347 is an additional residue involved in phosphate-binding and transition state stabilization in ATP synthase catalytic sites. In contrast, alphaGly-351, although strongly conserved and clearly important for function, appears not to play a direct role."
https://openalex.org/W2080924260,"Dopamine is an important neuromodulator in animals and its roles in mammalian sexual behavior are extensively studied. Drosophila as a useful model system is widely used in many fields of biological studies. It has been reported that dopamine reduction can affect female receptivity in Drosophila and leave male-female courtship behavior unaffected. Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to decrease the dopamine level in dopaminergic cells in Drosophila, and investigated the consequence of this manipulation on male homosexual courtship behavior. We find that reduction of dopamine level can induce Drosophila male-male courtship behavior, and that this behavior is mainly due to the increased male attractiveness or decreased aversiveness towards other males, but not to their enhanced propensity to court other males. Chemical signal input probably plays a crucial role in the male-male courtship induced by the courtees with reduction of dopamine. Our finding provides insight into the relationship between the dopamine reduction and male-male courtship behavior, and hints dopamine level is important for controlling Drosophila courtship behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1977459589,"Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) is a cysteine protease expressed by Streptococcus pyogenes. The D9N, G163S, G163S/A172S, and G239D mutant proteins were expressed to study the effect of the allelic variants on their protease activity. In contrast to other mutants, the G239D mutant was approximately 12-fold less active. The Gly-239 residue is located within the C-terminal S230-G239 region, which cannot be observed in the x-ray structure. The three-dimensional structure and backbone dynamics of the 28-kDa mature SPE B (mSPE B) were determined. Unlike the x-ray structure of the 40-kDa zymogen SPE B (proSPE B), we observed the interactions between the C-terminal loop and the active site residues in mSPE B. The structural differences between mSPE B and proSPE B were the conformation of the C-terminal loop and the orientation of the catalytic His-195 residue, suggesting that activation and inactivation of SPE B is involved in the His-195 side-chain rotation. Dynamics analysis of mSPE B and the mSPE B/inhibitor complexes showed that the catalytic and C-terminal loops were the most flexible regions with low order parameter values of 0.5 to 0.8 and exhibited the motion on the ps/ns timescale. These findings suggest that the flexible C-terminal loop of SPE B may play an important role in controlling the substrate binding, resulting in its broad substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2003491925,"Despite current enthusiasm for investigation of gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions, the essential issue of how to define and detect gene-environment interactions remains unresolved. In this report, we define gene-environment interactions as a stochastic dependence in the context of the effects of the genetic and environmental risk factors on the cause of phenotypic variation among individuals. We use mutual information that is widely used in communication and complex system analysis to measure gene-environment interactions. We investigate how gene-environment interactions generate the large difference in the information measure of gene-environment interactions between the general population and a diseased population, which motives us to develop mutual information-based statistics for testing gene-environment interactions. We validated the null distribution and calculated the type 1 error rates for the mutual information-based statistics to test gene-environment interactions using extensive simulation studies. We found that the new test statistics were more powerful than the traditional logistic regression under several disease models. Finally, in order to further evaluate the performance of our new method, we applied the mutual information-based statistics to three real examples. Our results showed that P-values for the mutual information-based statistics were much smaller than that obtained by other approaches including logistic regression models."
https://openalex.org/W2098906045,"T cell receptor (TCR) beta gene assembly by V(D)J recombination proceeds via successive Dbeta-to-Jbeta and Vbeta-to-DJbeta rearrangements. This two-step process is enforced by a constraint, termed beyond (B)12/23, which prohibits direct Vbeta-to-Jbeta rearrangements. However the B12/23 restriction does not explain the order of TCRbeta assembly for which the regulation remains an unresolved issue. The initiation of V(D)J recombination consists of the introduction of single-strand DNA nicks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) containing a 12 base-pairs spacer. An RSS containing a 23 base-pairs spacer is then captured to form a 12/23 RSSs synapse leading to coupled DNA cleavage. Herein, we probed RSS nicks at the TCRbeta locus and found that nicks were only detectable at Dbeta-associated RSSs. This pattern implies that Dbeta 12RSS and, unexpectedly, Dbeta 23RSS initiate V(D)J recombination and capture their respective Vbeta or Jbeta RSS partner. Using both in vitro and in vivo assays, we further demonstrate that the Dbeta1 23RSS impedes cleavage at the adjacent Dbeta1 12RSS and consequently Vbeta-to-Dbeta1 rearrangement first requires the Dbeta1 23RSS excision. Altogether, our results provide the molecular explanation to the B12/23 constraint and also uncover a 'Dbeta1 23RSS-mediated' restriction operating beyond chromatin accessibility, which directs Dbeta1 ordered rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2004074336,"Background The Arc of Fire across southern Amazonia seasonally attracts worldwide attention as forests are cut and burned for agricultural expansion. These forests contain numerous wild relatives of native South American crops, such as peach palm. Methodology/Principal Findings Our prospecting expeditions examined critical areas for wild peach palm in the Arc of Fire in Mato Grosso, Pará, Maranhão and Tocantins, as well as areas not previously examined in Amazonas and Amapá states. Recent digitization of the RADAM Brasil project permitted comparison among RADAM's parataxonomists' observations, previous botanical collections and our prospecting. Mapping on soils and vegetation types enabled us to hypothesize a set of ecological preferences. Wild peach palm is best adapted to Ultisols (Acrisols) in open forests across the Arc of Fire and westward into the more humid western Amazonia. Populations are generally small (fewer than 10 plants) on slopes above watercourses. In northern Mato Grosso and southern Pará soybean fields and pastures now occupy numerous areas where RADAM identified wild peach palm. The controversial BR-163 Highway is already eroding wild peach palm as deforestation expands. Conclusions/Significance Many of these populations are now isolated by increasing forest fragmentation, which will lead to decreased reproduction via inbreeding depression and eventual extinction even without complete deforestation. Federal conservation areas are less numerous in the Arc of Fire than in other parts of Brazilian Amazonia, although there are indigenous lands; these conservation areas contain viable populations of wild peach palm and require better protection than they are currently receiving. Ex situ conservation of these populations is not viable given the relative lack of importance of domesticated peach palm and the difficulty of maintaining even economically interesting genetic resources."

Here, we have studied the regulation of Bgs1p by Cfh3/Chr4p, a member of a family of conserved adaptor proteins, which resembles the chitin synthase regulator Chs4p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. cfh3Delta cells showed a genetic interaction with cps1-191, and Cfh3p co-immunoprecipitated with Bgs1/Cps1p. In the absence of cfh3(+), cells were more sensitive to digestion by glucanases, and both Calcofluor staining and glucan synthesis were reduced. We found that in a wild-type strain, beta(1,3)-glucan synthesis was reduced under stress conditions. In the cfh3Delta, cps1-191, and cfh3Delta cps1-191 strains, beta(1,3)-glucan synthesis was further reduced, and growth was impaired under stress conditions, suggesting that Cfh3p and Bgs1p might play a role in ensuring growth in unfavorable environments. In a cfh3Delta mutant, Bgs1p was delocalized when the cells were distressed, but a blockade in endocytosis prevented this delocalization. Finally, we found that the SEL1 repeats are required for Cfh3p function. These results show that Cfh3p is a regulatory protein for Bgs1p and that its function is particularly necessary when the cells are undergoing stress."
https://openalex.org/W2034216948,"The procofactor, factor VIII, is activated by thrombin or factor Xa-catalyzed cleavage at three P1 residues: Arg-372, Arg-740, and Arg-1689. The catalytic efficiency for thrombin cleavage at Arg-740 is greater than at either Arg-1689 or Arg-372 and influences reaction rates at these sites. Because cleavage at Arg-372 appears rate-limiting and dependent upon initial cleavage at Arg-740, we investigated whether cleavage at Arg-1689 influences catalysis at this step. Recombinant B-domainless factor VIII mutants, R1689H and R1689Q were prepared and stably expressed to slow and eliminate cleavage, respectively. Specific activity values for the His and Gln mutations were ∼50 and ∼10%, respectively, that of wild type. Thrombin activation of the R1689H variant showed an ∼340-fold reduction in the rate of Arg-1689 cleavage, whereas the R1689Q variant was resistant to thrombin cleavage at this site. Examination of heavy chain cleavages showed ∼4- and 11-fold reductions in A2 subunit generation and ∼3- and 7-fold reductions in A1 subunit generation for the R1689H and R1689Q mutants, respectively. These results suggest a linkage between light chain cleavage and cleavages in heavy chain. Results obtained evaluating proteolysis of the factor VIII mutants by factor Xa revealed modest rate reductions (<5-fold) in generating A2 and A1 subunits and in cleaving light chain at Arg-1721 from either variant, suggesting little dependence upon prior cleavage at residue 1689 as compared with thrombin.

Factor VIII, a plasma protein missing or defective in individuals with hemophilia A, is synthesized as an ∼300-kDa single chain polypeptide corresponding to 2332 amino acids. Within the protein are six domains based on internal homologies and ordered as NH2-A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2-COOH (1.Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H.

Bordering the A domains are short segments containing high concentrations of acidic residues that follow the A1 and A2 domains and precede the A3 domain and are designated a1 (residues 337–372), a2 (residues 711–740), and a3 (1649–1689). Factor VIII is processed by cleavage at the B-A3 junction to generate a divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimeric protein composed of a heavy chain (A1-a1-A2-a2-B domains) and a light chain (a3-A3-C1-C2 domains) (3.Fay P.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thrombin is believed to act as the physiological activator of factor VIII, as association of factor VIII with von Willebrand factor impairs the capacity for the membrane-dependent factor Xa to efficiently activate the procofactor (5.Eaton D.

Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25367-25375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This latter observation was based upon results showing that mutations at Arg-740, impairing this cleavage, significantly reduced cleavage rates at the two other P1 sites. Thrombin-catalyzed activation of factor VIII is dependent upon interactions involving the anion binding exosites of the proteinase (11.Esmon C.T. Lollar P. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the complex interactions involving multiple cleavages within a single substrate may utilize a ratcheting mechanism (14.Bianchini E.P. Orcutt S.J. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Krishnaswamy S.

Biochem. 1996; 240: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although cleavage at Arg-740 represents a fast step relative to cleavages at other P1 residues in the activation of factor VIII (19.Hill-Eubanks D.C. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17854-17858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the influence of Arg-1689 cleavage on cleavages in the heavy chain remains unknown. In the present study cleavage at Arg-1689 is examined using recombinant factor VIII variants possessing single point mutations of R1689Q and R1689H. Results indicating reduced rates of A1 and A2 subunit generation, which are dependent upon the residue at position 1689, suggest that cleavage at Arg-1689 affects rates of proteolysis at Arg-740 and Arg-372. These observations are consistent with a mechanism whereby heavy chain and light chain compete for a binding thrombin exosite(s), with heavy chain preferred over light chain. In this competition mechanism, cleavage at Arg-740 is favored over Arg-1689. Subsequent cleavage at Arg-372 in heavy chain may involve a ratcheting mechanism after initial cleavage at Arg-740. On the other hand, the mechanism for factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VIII appears to be less dependent on cleavage at the Arg-1689 site as compared with thrombin.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—The monoclonal antibodies C5 (recognizing the a1 region) and 2D2 (recognizing the A3 domain) were generous gifts from Zaverio Ruggeri and Bayer, respectively. The anti-A2 domain factor VIII monoclonal antibody R8B12 (8.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody GMA-8003 recognizing the C2 domain were obtained from Green Mountain Antibodies. The reagents human α-thrombin, factor IXa, factor X, and factor Xa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Recombinant nonsulfated hirudin and horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin were from Calbiochem. Chromogenic factor Xa substrate Pefa-5523 (Pefachrome® FXa) was purchased from Centerchem. Factor VIII-deficient plasma was prepared as previously described (20.Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine were prepared using N-octyl glucoside as previously described (21.Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The Bluescript factor VIII vector (pBS factor VIII) and B-domainless factor VIII expression construct RENeo factor VIII were kindly provided by Pete Lollar and John Healey (Emory University).Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Factor VIII—B-domainless factor VIII cDNA was restricted from the factor VIII expression construct FVIIIHSQ-MSAB-NotI-RENeo using the endonucleases XhoI and NotI and cloned into the pBluescript II K/S-vector. The B-domainless factor VIII cDNA was further restricted using endonucleases SacII/ApaI and subcloned into the pBluescript II K/S-vector. The R1689H and R1689Q mutations were introduced into the construct using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as previously described (22.Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The presence of only the desired mutation was confirmed using dideoxy sequencing. The mutated factor VIII cDNA was then ligated back into the factor VIII expression construct and subjected to a second round of dideoxy sequencing to confirm that only the desired mutation was present. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used to transfect the factor VIII expression vector into baby hamster kidney cells. The selection, subcloning, and cloning of stable transfectants were performed by standard methods, and the cloned cells were cultured in roller bottles for protein expression (23.Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The conditioned media was collected daily, and the expressed proteins were purified by SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography as previously described (23.Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A one-stage clotting assay was used to detect active fractions. Yields of purified wild-type and variant factor VIII ranged from 0.08 to 0.4 mg per liter of conditioned media. Resultant factor VIII was >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE with the main contaminant being albumin. Factor VIII samples were quick-frozen and stored at −80 °C.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The concentration of purified factor VIII proteins was determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GMA-8003 was used as the capture antibody, and biotinylated R8B12 was used as the detection antibody. The amount of factor VIII bound to the plate was determined as previously described (22.Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using a chromogenic assay utilizing streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) with the chromogen o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). Purified commercial recombinant factor VIII (Kogenate; Bayer Corp.) was used as the standard. Factor VIII-specific activity values were determined using one-stage clotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22.Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Factor Xa Generation Assay—The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (24.Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the factor VIII activation time course after thrombin addition, factor VIII (1 nm) was reacted with thrombin (0.05 nm) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) at 22 °C. Samples were removed at indicated times, and thrombin activity was inhibited by the addition of hirudin (0.1 units/ml). Factor Xa generation was initiated by the addition of factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (300 nm). The reactions were terminated with EDTA (50 mm) at the indicated times. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate Pefa-5523 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm for 5 min using a Vmax microtiter plate reader (GE Healthcare). To assess the Km (apparent), various concentrations of wild-type and mutant factor VIII (0–45 nm) were reacted with thrombin (0.05 nm) for 15 s. Thrombin was inactivated by the addition of hirudin (0.1 units/ml) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (10 μm), and each sample was reacted with factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (300 nm). Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation, added to tubes containing EDTA (50 mm final concentration), and processed as described above. To assess the Ki (apparent), various concentrations of the R1689Q factor VIII (0–60 nm) were added to a reaction containing wild-type factor VIII (5 nm) and thrombin (0.05 nm) in the presence of phospholipids (10 μm) for 1 min. Thrombin was inactivated by the addition of hirudin (0.1 units/ml), and each sample was reacted with factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (300 nm) as described above.Cleavage of Factor VIII by Thrombin or Factor Xa—Factor VIII (100 nm) was reacted with 2.5 nm thrombin in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.14 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20. Alternatively, factor VIII (100 nm) was reacted with factor Xa (2.5 nm) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) in the above buffer. Reactions were run at 22 °C, and samples were taken at indicated time points during the time course. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min.Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Samples were run by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad mini gel apparatus at 175 V for 1 h. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for Western blotting. Blots were probed using the anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibodies indicated in the figure legends followed by reaction with a goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (Sigma). The signal was detected using the ECF® (enhanced chemifluorescence) system (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots were scanned at 570 nm using a Storm 860 (GE Healthcare). Densitometric scans were quantitated from linear density regions of the blots using Image-Quant software (GE Healthcare).Data Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three separate times, and the average values with standard deviations are shown. Western blot analysis determining the rates of subunit generation after thrombin cleavage of wild type and mutants were calculated based upon summing all factor VIII band density values. The intensity of each band was determined by volume integration and corrected for variability in background staining by using densities in the areas immediately adjacent to each band. The concentration of A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits was normalized to the total density in each lane to correct for slight differences in loading. Initial time points were fitted using non-linear least squares regression to the second order polynomial equation, [FVIII]=A+Bt+Ct2(Eq. 1) where [FVIII] is the concentration of A1, A2, or A3-C1-C2 in nm, t is the time in minutes, and A, B, and C are coefficients of the quadratic equation. A is the initial concentration of factor VIII in nm. B corresponds to the slope value when the time is 0 min and C represents the non-zero quadratic coefficient. The absolute value of B represents the rate of the A1, A2, or A3-C1-C2 subunit generation that was normalized by the thrombin concentration and expressed in nm A1, A2, or A3-C1-C2 subunit/min/nm thrombin, respectively.Factor Xa cleavage of the factor VIII light chain was assessed by Western blot analysis as described above and fitting the data to the second order polynomial equation (Equation 1) using non-linear least squares regression. A is the initial concentration of factor VIII in nm. B corresponds to the slope value when the time is 0 min. The absolute value of B represents the rate of light chain loss that was normalized by the factor Xa concentration and expressed in nm light chain/min/nm factor Xa, respectively.Kinetic parameters were determined by Xa generation analysis. Km and Vmax were calculated from initial rate data by fitting the data using non-linear least-squares regression analysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation, vo=(Vmax×[S])/(Km+[S])(Eq. 2) where vo is the initial velocity in (nm/min), and [S] is the concentration of wild-type or mutant factor VIII in nm. Using these conditions, the Vmax recorded is for factor Xa generation and relates directly to the amount of factor VIIIa formed, whereas Km is a measure of the concentration of substrate factor VIII acted upon by thrombin.The Ki for R1689Q factor VIII was calculated by fitting the data to the competitive inhibition equation by nonlinear least squares regression analysis, vo=(Vmax×[S])/{Km×(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]}(Eq. 3) where [S] is the concentration of wild-type factor VIII in nm, [I] is the concentration of R1689Q factor VIII in nm, and Ki is the inhibitor dissociation constant for R1689Q factor VIII.RESULTSCharacterization of Recombinant Factor VIII Protein—Thrombin-catalyzed activation of factor VIII occurs after proteolysis at three P1 Arg residues: Arg-740, Arg-372, and Arg-1689. Recent studies have identified a mechanistic role for the rapid cleavage at Arg-740 in facilitating subsequent proteolytic events at Arg-1689 and the rate-limiting Arg-372 (10.Newell J.L. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25367-25375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether cleavage at Arg-1689 contributes to the thrombin-catalyzed activation of factor VIII and in particular the slow step of cleaving Arg-372, we prepared and stably expressed two recombinant factor VIII mutants, R1689H and R1689Q. Selection of these mutations was based on a previous study evaluating the hemophilia A missense mutation R372H (25.Nogami K. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 4362-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). That study demonstrated an ∼80-fold reduction in the rate of thrombin cleavage at His-372 as compared with Arg-372 in wild-type protein. Moreover, in an R372Q mutant, there was no thrombin cleavage detected at position 372. Thus, employing the His and Gln mutations at position 1689 allowed us to, respectively, slow and eliminate proteolysis at this site. Wild-type or mutant B-domainless factor VIII expressed in baby hamster kidney cells is secreted in two forms, a single chain (contiguous heavy chain and light chain) and the heterodimer, in near equivalent amounts (see Fig. 1 for a schematic). Specific activity values for R1689H and R1689Q as measured using one-stage clotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were 47 ± 3 and 9.3 ± 2% that of wild-type factor VIII, respectively. These values suggested a near-normal phenotype for the R1689H variant, whereas the R1689Q mutation approximated a mild-hemophilic phenotype, which is consistent with previous results (17.Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18.Donath M.J. Lenting P.J. Van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showing that cleavage at Arg-1689 makes modest contributions to the specific activity of factor VIII.Thrombin-catalyzed Cleavage of Recombinant Factor VIII and the Generation of the A3-C1-C2 Subunit—To directly assess the effects of the His and Gln mutations at residue 1689 in light chain, reactions using thrombin with variant factor VIII were performed over a 120-min time course. Results were visualized using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the A3-domain-specific monoclonal antibody, 2D2. Results from blotting data evaluating rates of A3-C1-C2 subunit generation for wild type and R1689H and R1689Q variants are shown (Fig. 2). Reaction of wild-type factor VIII (100 nm) with thrombin (2.5 nm) showed efficient cleavage of both the single chain and the light chain, resulting in the rapid generation of the A3-C1-C2 subunit. These blots were quantitated by scanning densitometry and subjected to nonlinear least squares regression analysis (Fig. 2C) to calculate the rates of A3-C1-C2 subunit generation (Table 1). Because generation of A3-C1-C2 is derived from a single cleavage at Arg-1689, rates for cleavage and subunit generation are equivalent. The cleavage rate for thrombin at this site was reduced ∼340-fold for the R1689H variant compared with wild type (Table 1). This value reflects a greater reduction in cleavage rate than the ∼80-fold reduction that was observed in a prior study when His replaced Arg at the 372 site (25.Nogami K. Zhou Q. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 4362-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, this result is consistent with accommodation of His in the specificity binding pocket of the enzyme, allowing for scissile bond cleavage. Alternatively, we observed no detectable light chain cleavage in the R1689Q mutant (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with this mutation precluding active site docking. We also observed that prior to the reaction with thrombin, this variant possessed a low level (<10% of 2D2-reactive material) of a high molecular band running just below the single chain material and consistent with a contiguous A2-light chain intermediate. This band was also visualized when blotting with the anti-A2 antibody (see supplemental Fig. 1) supporting this contention. The reason for its presence in the untreated sample is unclear; however, its disappearance after thrombin addition indicates further processing at the Arg-740 site.FIGURE 2Generation of A3-C1-C2 subunit after thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of recombinant factor VIII mutants. Panels A and B, recombinant factor VIII R1689H and R1689Q (100 nm) were reacted with thrombin (10 nm) for 120 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting using an anti-A3 antibody. Also in panels A and B, wild type (WT, 100 nm) was reacted with 2.5 nm thrombin for 25 min. In panel C, initial time points, shown as continuous lines, were fitted to the second-order polynomial equation (Equation 1) using non-linear least squares regression. The inset shows results obtained using recombinant factor VIII wild type (100 nm) reacted with a lower thrombin concentration (0.25 nm). ▴, wild type; ▪, R1689H; ♦, R1689Q. Experiments were performed at least three separate times, and average values are shown.

A similar approach was used to assess rates of A1 subunit generation using the anti-A1 domain-specific monoclonal antibody, C5. When examining thrombin cleavage of the factor VIII mutants, results revealed overall reduced rates of cleavage at Arg-372 as seen by retention of factor VIII heavy chain (contiguous A1-A2) with a reduction in A1 subunit generation as compared with wild-type protein (Fig. 3). Because the A1 subunit is derived after a single cleavage at Arg-372, its generation reflects the rate of cleavage at that site. Results from the blots were quantitated, and rates of A1 subunit generation are shown in Table 1. These results suggest that slowing thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis by incorporating a non-optimal P1 His at position 1689 yields a modest (∼3-fold) reduction in Arg-372 cleavage (Fig. 3, A and C), whereas replacement of the P1 residue with the non-cleavable Gln yield a further rate reduction of A1 subunit generation of ∼7-fold (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, stalling cleavage within light chain effectively stalls the rate-limiting cleavage at Arg-372 in the heavy chain.FIGURE 3Generation of A1 subunit following thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of recombinant factor VIII mutants. Panels A and B, factor VIII (100 nm) was reacted with thrombin (2.5 nm) for the indicated times as described under “Materials and Methods.” Samples were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting using an anti-A1 antibody.

A2 subunit is derived from cleavages at Arg-372 and Arg-740, the latter at the a2-B junction. In the B-domainless factor VIII heterodimer, a remnant (∼14 residues) of the B domain remains C-terminal to the a2 segment, and its presence or absence cannot be discriminated by SDS-PAGE. Thus, the band visualized as A2 subunit requires only the single cleavage at Arg-372 to be releas"
https://openalex.org/W2062759505,"There is a wealth of literature on the role of short-range interactions between low-level orientation-tuned filters in the perception of discontinuous contours. However, little is known about how spatial information is integrated across more distant regions of the visual field in the absence of explicit local orientation cues, a process referred to here as visuospatial interpolation (VSI). To examine the neural correlates of VSI high field functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study brain activity while observers either judged the alignment of three Gabor patches by a process of interpolation or discriminated the local orientation of the individual patches. Relative to a fixation baseline the two tasks activated a largely over-lapping network of regions within the occipito-temporal, occipito-parietal and frontal cortices. Activated clusters specific to the orientation task (orientation>interpolation) included the caudal intraparietal sulcus, an area whose role in orientation encoding per se has been hotly disputed. Surprisingly, there were few task-specific activations associated with visuospatial interpolation (VSI>orientation) suggesting that largely common cortical loci were activated by the two experimental tasks. These data are consistent with previous studies that suggest higher level grouping processes -putatively involved in VSI- are automatically engaged when the spatial properties of a stimulus (e.g. size, orientation or relative position) are used to make a judgement."
