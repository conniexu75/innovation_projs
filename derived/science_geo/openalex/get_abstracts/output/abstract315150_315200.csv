The levitation technique has been extended toward smaller particles (about 1 micron), lower laser power (less than 1 milliwatt), and deeper traps (greater than ten times the particle's weight). The techniques developed here have particular importance in cloud physics, aerosol science, fluid dynamics, and optics. The interactions of the drops with light, the electric field, the surrounding gas, and one another can be observed with high precision."
https://openalex.org/W1985996495,"A ""skinning"" procedure is described for irreversibly disrupting the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal muscle and allowing calcium and other diffusible solutes (such as adenosine triphosphate) access to the myofilament space. Single skinned fibers give isometric tensions of about 1.5 kilograms per square centimeter when exposed to ionized calcium even after 1 to 2 weeks of storage at 5°C. For up to 5 days the preparation will sequester and, under appropriate conditions (anion substitution, caffeine addition, or magnesium withdrawal), release calcium. The regulation of intracellular calcium distribution and the calcium-induced activation of the contractile proteins are discussed and related to the morphology of human fibers and to similar processes occurring in other muscle preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2019456083,"The concept of a stressed elastic lithospheric plate riding on a viscous asthenosphere is used to calculate the recurrence interval of great earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries, the separation of decoupling and lithospheric earthquakes, and the migration pattern of large earthquakes along an arc. It is proposed that plate motions accelerate after great decoupling earthquakes and that most of the observed plate motions occur during short periods of time, separated by periods of relative quiescence."

Improved technologies are available for different ecological regions. Important technological innovations include manual land clearing, mulch farming, conservation tillage and tiedridges, agroforestry, cover crops, mixed- and relay-cropping, and early sowing for improved and sustained productivity. Irrigation, animal traction or draft animals, and the use of chemical fertilizers are also important. Much of the agrarian stagnation in Africa is caused by neglect and misuse of the most basic of all resources, the soil. In fact, the root cause of the perpetual famine can be traced to the misuse of soil and water resources and issues related to their misuse. Substantial increases in food production are possible if the proven technologies can be effectively transferred and implemented. Priorities lie in both short-term development projects and in initiating long-term research to understand soil and water resources and how to manage them. The agrarian research must address the issue of improving the welfare of resource-poor farmers."
https://openalex.org/W2030039595,"Two species of snail, Euchondrus albulus and Euchondrus desertorum, eat endolithic lichens growing under the surface of limestone rocks in the Negev Desert, Israel. This unusual type of herbivory has the unexpected and major impact of weathering this rocky desert at a rate of 0.7 to 1.1 metric tons per hectare per year. The biotic weathering contributes to the process of soil formation at a rate that is similar to wind-borne dust deposition. These findings demonstrate that herbivores can have a significant regulatory impact on ecosystem processes, even in cases where the total amount of primary production consumed is small."
https://openalex.org/W2072405546,"Phase transitions, similar to those seen in physical systems, are observed in spreading activation networks. Such networks are used both in theories of cognition and in artificial intelligence applications. This result confirms a predicted abrupt behavioral change as either the topology of the network or the activation parameters are varied across phase boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2169262994,"Even when blinded with masks, adult male water striders (Gerris remigis) accurately ascertain the sex of other adult water striders in the laboratory. Freely moving females that were artificially made to play back computer-generated male surface wave and body-contact signals of about 90 waves per second were treated as males by the masked males and as females when no such playbacks were made. Thus, the males can use presence or absence of the male signal as the sole means for sex discrimination."

https://openalex.org/W4254364386,"There is no first principles theory of freezing or melting, even for the simplest materials. The prediction of phase diagrams is an important first step in understanding the crystal-melt interface, crystallization near equilibrium, and nucleation. Recently, a new approximate theory for the freezing of classical liquids, known as the density functional theory, has been developed. The predictions of the theory are relatively accurate and its mathematical structure is simple enough to provide an attractive starting point for theories of more complex, dynamical phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W3081423326,"First it was the physicists, then the chemists, and most recently the materials scientists and ceramists who have hastily included in their annual meetings symposia on the new high-temperature, ceramic superconductors. Below are briefings from the 1987 Spring Meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS) that was held in Anaheim, California, from 21 to 24 April, 1 week before the American Ceramics Society's conclave in Pittsburgh. With the initial wave of euphoria now past, the atmosphere in Anaheim was decidedly more professional than that of the now fabled ""Woodstock of Physics"" that was part of the American Physical Society's March Meeting in New York City only 5 weeks before. Nonetheless, perhaps 1500 materials researchers listened to 69 scheduled papers and several late walk-ons that were crammed into a 2-day symposium. With a martial strictness, cochairs Michael Schlüter of AT&T Bell Laboratories and Donald Gubser of the Naval Research Laboratory kept the talks to the allotted 10 minutes each. Except for an impassioned presentation by Juei-Teng Chen of Wayne State University, who sought to convince listeners that a group there had seen dear signs of superconductivity at 240 K, which is ambient temperature during a cold night on the northern plains, no significant indications of room-temperature superconductivity were reported. The most skeptical view was that of Theodore Geballe of Stanford University, who suggested that some of the unreproducible signs seen in several laboratories could be due to something other than superconductivity, as similar effects disappeared in Stanford samples with repeated cycling between room and liquid-nitrogen temperature. If there was one theme at the symposium, it was that oxygen is the key to the family of rare-earth-based ceramic materials now in hand that remain superconducting up to about 100 K."
https://openalex.org/W2017111008,"The acceptance of ASYST by the scientific community could dramatically change the way scientific data are handled and reduce the need for extensive in-house software development for many applications. However, there is no substitute for a well-conceived use of any software. We feel that the full acceptance of the ideas and concepts pioneered by Adaptable Laboratory Software and other software houses will depend on the ability of the scientific community to fully test and verify the procedures used by such products. Only then can the results produced by these software packages be subjected to confirmation which is crucial to rigorous scientific endeavor."
https://openalex.org/W3210198603,"Although it has not yet been universally adopted, pest management figures prominently in current planning. For pest management to be effective, agricultural scientists must adopt an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems; this means considering not only complexes of pests including insects, pathogens, and weeds, but whole crop systems. The requisites for successful pest management programs include availability of current weather data, cooperation between research and Extension personnel, and feedback from individual growers. A pilot program for alfalfa pest control is in its third year of development at Purdue University. It involves the cooperation of entomologists, engineers, physiologists, economists, and agronomists, and research and implementation proceed simultaneously. Microcomputers are used for monitoring, integrating, storing, and transmitting meteorological information to a central location, where it is used in simulations of the alfalfa plant and the alfalfa weevil. The resulting advisories are produced at teletype terminals at four locations in the alfalfa growing region of Indiana. Our experience with this prototype system indicates that computer-based pest management programs will be dynamic and reliable systems capable of delivering alternative action strategies with virtually unlimited accessibility."

https://openalex.org/W1973693895,"In concluding this report, which omits a great deal, the retiring Chairman is probably entitled to a valedictory. (Margaret Mead referred to it as a benediction.) The Association faces two major challenges beyond those obvious ones of maintaining financial solvency and reversing a declining membership. First, there is the necessity to articulate goals for the future. This was started by a series of meetings under the heading of Arden House II, following the tradition of the meeting held in 1951 under the leadership of Warren Weaver. A proposed Committee on Goals can serve this purpose. Second, there is a need to maximize the coherence of all efforts supported by the Association to achieve the greatest effect with the funds available. The proposed Committee on Program and Planning can encourage this. I complete this assignment with the sense of having been very privileged to hold the office of President and Chairman of the Board. I pass on the gavel to Roger Revelle, and to Margaret Mead and Bill McElroy in turn, with great confidence and that certain knowledge that nobody can succeed like a successor."
