https://openalex.org/W1968822620,"Wandering histiocytes, foreign body giant cells, and inflammatory connective-tissue cells are stimulated by degradation products of dead matrix to grow in and repopulate the area of an implant of decalcified bone. Histiocytes are more numerous than any other cell form and may transfer collagenolytic activity to the substrate to cause dissolution of the matrix. The process is followed immediately by new-bone formation by autoinduction in which both the inductor cells and the induced cells are derived from ingrowing cells of the host bed. The inductor cell is a descendant of a wandering histiocyte; the induced cell is a fixed histiocyte or perivascular young connective-tissue cell. Differentiation of the osteoprogenitor cell is elicited by local alterations in cell metabolic cycles that are as yet uncharacterized."

Chromomycin and olivomycin form complexes with DNA, preferably in the helical form, but not with RNA. These complexes require guanine in DNA and the addition of a stoichiometric amount of bivalent cation. None of the other antibiotics requires the presence of any single base in the template for its action."

This test is based on the fixation and transfer of the activated first component of complement (C1a). We have concluded that a single molecule of 19S antibody in combination with antigen at the cell surface is sufficient to bind one molecule of C1a. For 7S antibodies at least two molecules in close proximity at the cell surface are required to fix one molecule of C1a."
https://openalex.org/W2401142226,"Numerous experimental techniques for the separation of transfer ribonucleic acids have been successful in preparing partially purified fractions of several specific t-RNAs. Many of the existing methods have depended upon the differential solubility of specific t-RNAs in complex two-phase systems (1-6) and the separation was achieved by means of counter-current extraction techniques. Column chromatography experiments using cellulose exchangers, (7,8) methylated albumin (9,10) or with solvent phases supported on inert material (11-13) have also shown partial separation of specific t-RNAs. Paper chromatographic procedures have produced partial resolutions of t-RNA.14 Methods involving chemical treatment of specific t-RNAs have been reported (15-19)."

https://openalex.org/W2085375692,A pulsed ruby laser microbeam produces changes in single living cells stained with a low concentration of Janus green B. Electron micrographs show that such alterations are the result of morphological damage sustained by and restricted to the mitochondria in the irradiated area.

This fraction increased the amount of protein synthesized in a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli as much as 35 times and directed the synthesis of proteins different from those of E. coli."

Staining was shown to be specific and due to antigenic determinants on or closely associated with the protein moiety of hyaluronateprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1969240047,"NORLEUCINE appears to inhibit bacterial growth due to incorporation into proteins in place of methionine, as the analogue inhibits methionine incorporation but does not significantly reduce its synthesis1. It has been demonstrated2 that resistance to amino-acid analogues in Escherichia coli is achieved frequently by over-synthesis of the amino-acid itself, and this appears to be the case with norleucine-resistant strains as some excrete a substance (presumably methionine) which stimulates the growth of sensitive strains in the presence of the analogue. Colonies of such resistant strains have haloes of growth around them when plated on sensitive strains in the presence of norleucine. A mutant (strain P-76-2) selected as a norleucine-resistant strain by this method had increased amounts of homocysteine methylase (compared to the parent strain P-76) when grown in minimal medium and the formation of the enzyme was only slightly reduced by growth with methionine2,3. It was proposed that strain P-76-2 failed to produce a represser or formed a faulty one. The probable excretion of methionine and the high enzyme-level supported this idea. It was also possible that resistance to norleucine was due to decreased permeability to the analogue; failure of methionine to repress enzyme formation would then be due to a similar permeability restriction. The increased levels of homocysteine methylase on minimal medium are, however, not consistent with this view, and as methionine-requiring auxo-trophs, isolated from strain P-76-2, grow well with small amounts of methionine there seems to be no restriction on the entry of this amino-acid. The control of methionine synthesis in strain P-76-2 has been further investigated to ascertain whether all the enzymes of the methionine-synthesis pathway are de-repressed and also to determine whether methionine exerts a feedback inhibition effect on the activity of the first enzyme as it does in other strains4."

https://openalex.org/W1580621737,"Abstract Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the formation of nicotinic acid mononucleotide, carbon dioxide, and inorganic pyrophosphate from quinolinic acid and 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 165,000 and can be irreversibly dissociated into inactive protein units with a molecular weight of 54,000. Unlike other reactions in which the enzymatic transfer of the phosphoribosyl group occurs, the kinetics of this reaction is consistent with the involvement of a ternary complex of enzyme, quinolinic acid, and 5-phosphoribosyl l-pyrophosphate. Attempts to show exchange reactions were unsuccessful."

https://openalex.org/W2043629523,"IT has been suggested that the bacterial cell may vary in its response to antiseptics with age (Chick1, Sherman and Albus2, Hinshelwood3, and Jacobs4). Until recently, it has been customary to describe bacteria as old or young according to the length of time for which the cultures have been incubated. If an individual cell is regarded as new-born the moment it has separated from its parent/sister and old-aged the moment before such separation occurs, it is clear that in any randomly growing culture there will always be present cells of all ages."

https://openalex.org/W2062871083,"INDIVIDUAL strains of Serratia marcescens may liberate two different bacteriocins1. The distinction is made on grounds of temperature of inactivation and susceptibility to various other destructive agents coupled with distinctive spectra of activity. During an investigation of antibiotics produced by Serratia the foregoing phenomenon was also encountered and electrophoretic separation of the components was attempted. Strains, media and electrophoretic techniques were those previously used2,3. In addition, twenty strains isolated locally and numbered Sm 16–19 and Sm 37–52 were also investigated. All 51 Serratia strains could be differentiated on grounds of lysogenicity and phage susceptibility Antibiotic activity was detected by the method of Fredericq4 or by spotting the clear supernatants of overnight growths of cultures induced by ultra-violet light on plates freshly spread with indicator organisms."
