https://openalex.org/W2953159556,"One of the major challenges in the field of soft tissue engineering using bioprinting is fabricating complex tissue constructs with desired structure integrity and mechanical property. To accomplish such requirements, most of the reported works incorporated reinforcement materials such as poly(ϵ-caprolactone) (PCL) polymer within the 3D bioprinted constructs. Although this approach has made some progress in constructing soft tissue-engineered scaffolds, the mechanical compliance mismatch and long degradation period are not ideal for soft tissue engineering. Herein, we present a facile bioprinting strategy that combines the rapid extrusion-based bioprinting technique with an in-built ultraviolet (UV) curing system to facilitate the layer-by-layer UV curing of bioprinted photo-curable GelMA-based hydrogels to achieve soft yet stable cell-laden constructs with high aspect ratio for soft tissue engineering. GelMA is supplemented with a viscosity enhancer (gellan gum) to improve the bio-ink printability and shape fidelity while maintaining the biocompatibility before crosslinking via a layer-by-layer UV curing process. This approach could eventually fabricate soft tissue constructs with high aspect ratio (length to diameter) of ≥ 5. The effects of UV source on printing resolution and cell viability were also studied. As a proof-of-concept, small building units (3D lattice and tubular constructs) with high aspect ratio are fabricated. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the ability to perform multi-material printing of tissue constructs with high aspect ratio along both the longitudinal and transverse directions for potential applications in tissue engineering of soft tissues. This layer-by-layer ultraviolet assisted extrusion-based (UAE) Bioprinting may provide a novel strategy to develop soft tissue constructs with desirable structure integrity."

Although phosphate homeostasis in mammals has long been studied at the organismal level, the intracellular mechanisms controlling phosphate metabolism are not well-understood. Inositol pyrophosphates have emerged as important regulatory elements controlling yeast phosphate homeostasis. To verify whether inositol pyrophosphates also regulate mammalian cellular phosphate homeostasis, here we knocked out inositol hexakisphosphate kinase (IP6K) 1 and IP6K2 to generate human HCT116 cells devoid of any inositol pyrophosphates. Using PAGE and HPLC analysis, we observed that the IP6K1/2-knockout cells have nondetectable levels of the IP6-derived IP7 and IP8 and also exhibit reduced synthesis of the IP5-derived PP-IP4. Nucleotide analysis showed that the knockout cells contain increased amounts of ATP, whereas the Malachite green assay found elevated levels of free intracellular phosphate. Furthermore, [32Pi] pulse labeling experiments uncovered alterations in phosphate flux, with both import and export of phosphate being decreased in the knockout cells. Functional analysis of the phosphate exporter xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1) revealed that it is regulated by inositol pyrophosphates, which can bind to its SPX domain. We conclude that IP6K1 and -2 together control inositol pyrophosphate metabolism and thereby physiologically regulate phosphate export and other aspects of mammalian cellular phosphate homeostasis.

Phosphate homeostasis is crucial for growth and survival, because virtually all biochemical processes utilize phosphate. In mammals, a complex hormonal regulatory network involving intestines, bones, and kidneys regulates serum phosphate concentration (1Michigami T. Kawai M. Yamazaki M. Ozono K. Phosphate as a signaling molecule and its sensing mechanism.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98 (30109818): 2317-234810.1152/physrev.00022.2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Excessive serum phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) has been linked to cardiovascular disease and increased mortality in chronic kidney disease patients, whereas hypophosphatemia can result in a form of rickets. Serum phosphate levels are maintained by FGF23-αKlotho, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D signaling. Many cell types have been shown to transcriptionally respond to changes in extracellular phosphate concentrations, and the phosphate uptake transporter Pit1/SLC20A1 has been proposed to sense extracellular phosphate. However, how phosphate homeostasis is maintained at the cellular level remains a poorly studied area. Analysis of yeast and plant genomes has revealed that the SPX protein domain (after SYG1, Pho81, and XPR1, Pfam: PF03105) is found in many proteins that regulate phosphate metabolism (2Azevedo C.

Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) are myo-inositol–derived signaling molecules ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells (8Wilson M.S. Livermore T.M. Saiardi A. Inositol pyrophosphates: between signalling and metabolism.Biochem. J. 2013; 379 (23725456): 369-379Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). They are defined and distinguished from other inositol phosphates by the presence of at least one phosphoanhydride bond. The best characterized, 5-IP7, whose phosphoanhydride bond is at the 5-position of the myo-inositol carbon ring (8Wilson M.S. Livermore T.M. Saiardi A.

J. 2013; 379 (23725456): 369-379Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar), is synthesized by IP6K enzymes from inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6; phytic acid). The IP6Ks are catalytically flexible: they can use IP5 as substrate to generate 5PP-IP4, whereas in the presence of ADP they can dephosphorylate IP6 to I(2,3,4,5,6)P5 (9Wundenberg T. Grabinski N.

These enzymes preferentially act on 5-IP7, converting it to 1,5(PP)2-IP4 (called IP8) (10Fridy P.C. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. York J.D.

Budding yeast has one IP6K enzyme named Kcs1, whereas mammalian genomes encode three IP6K isoforms: IP6K1, IP6K2, and IP6K3. Studies using kcs1Δ yeast or individual IP6Ks KO mice have linked PP-IPs to a plethora of cellular activities (12Burton A. Hu X. Saiardi A. Are inositol pyrophosphates signalling molecules?.J.

Identification of an evolutionarily conserved family of inorganic polyphosphate endopolyphosphatases.J. Biol.

This appears to be an evolutionarily conserved phenotype, because mammalian IP6K2 was initially discovered as a protein that could stimulate phosphate (Pi) uptake into Xenopus oocytes, and was called PiUS (Pi Uptake Stimulator) before its enzymatic abilities were discovered (16Schell M.J. Letcher A.J. Brearley C.A. Biber J. Murer H. Irvine R.F.

Furthermore, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the human IP6K3 gene locus are associated with differences in serum phosphate concentration (19Kestenbaum B. et al.Common genetic variants associate with serum phosphorus concentration.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 1223-123210.1681/ASN.2009111104Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Unlike yeast or plants, mammalian genomes contain a single SPX domain-containing protein. Localized at the plasma membrane, XPR1 was originally characterized as a retroviral receptor (Xenotropic and Polytropic retrovirus Receptor 1), but is functionally a phosphate exporter (20Giovannini D. Touhami J. Charnet P. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Inorganic phosphate export by the retrovirus receptor XPR1 in metazoans.Cell Rep. 2013; 3 (23791524): 1866-187310.1016/j.celrep.2013.05.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the current study we aimed to investigate if and how PP-IPs regulate intracellular phosphate homeostasis in mammalian cells. Most previous work has used cells knocked out for only one IP6K at a time, generating cells with a reduction rather than complete depletion of PP-IPs levels. IP6K1 and IP6K2 have a wide and overlapping tissue distribution, whereas IP6K3 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (21Moritoh Y. Oka M. Yasuhara Y. Hozumi H. Iwachidow K. Fuse H. Tozawa R. Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 3 regulates metabolism and lifespan in mice.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27577108)3207210.1038/srep32072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We used CRISPR and the human colon carcinoma line HCT116 to create a cell line truly devoid of PP-IPs by disrupting both IP6K1 and IP6K2. These DKO cells showed an increased amount of ATP as well as increased intracellular free phosphate. Conversely, release as well as uptake of radioactive phosphate was reduced. Knockdown of XPR1 inhibited [32Pi] release in WT cells, but had no effect in DKO cells, demonstrating that PP-IPs regulate phosphate export through XPR1. To study the role that PP-IPs play in mammalian phosphate homeostasis, we generated cells devoid of this small molecule messenger. Mammalian genomes possess three IP6K homologs. The IP6K1 and IP6K2 genes are located close together on the same chromosome (located at chromosome 3p21.31 in humans; in mice, chromosome 9;9 F1 and 9;9 F2 for ip6k1 and ip6k2, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Therefore, crossing the ip6k1−/− and ip6k2−/− mice is unlikely to generate an ip6k1−/−ip6k2−/− DKO mouse because of linkage. Instead, we used CRISPR to create a cell line without PP-IPs. IP6K3 is expressed mainly in muscle cells (21Moritoh Y. Oka M. Yasuhara Y. Hozumi H. Iwachidow K. Fuse H. Tozawa R. Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 3 regulates metabolism and lifespan in mice.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27577108)3207210.1038/srep32072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and indeed the cell lines we tested, which were not muscle-derived, contained no or a very low amount of IP6K3 mRNA, whereas IP6K1 and IP6K2 were widely co-expressed (Fig. S1A). We chose to use the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 as it is near-diploid (22Knutsen T. Padilla-Nash H.M. Wangsa D. Barenboim-Stapleton L. Camps J. McNeil N. Difilippantonio M.J. Ried T. Definitive molecular cytogenetic characterization of 15 colorectal cancer cell lines.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010; 49 (19927377): 204-223PubMed Google Scholar), expresses IP6K1 and IP6K2 only, and has easily detectable levels of IP7 and IP8 (23Wilson M.S. Bulley S.J. Pisani F. Irvine R.F. Saiardi A. A novel method for the purification of inositol phosphates from biological samples reveals that no phytate is present in human plasma or urine.Open Biol. 2015; 5 (25808508)15001410.1098/rsob.150014Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We targeted IP6K1 and IP6K2 using guide RNAs against exon 5 of both genes to disrupt the inositol-binding motifs (Fig. 1B) (17Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Synthesis of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate by a newly identified family of higher inositol polyphosphate kinases.Curr.

No IP6K1 or IP6K2 protein was detectable in DKO IP6K1−/−IP6K2−/− lines (Fig. 1C), which also contained significantly less IP6K1 and IP6K2 mRNA than WT cells (Fig. 1D). We attempted to analyze IP6K3 mRNA, in case this homolog was up-regulated to compensate, but were unable to detect any in the knockout or WT cells. We then analyzed the effect of loss of IP6Ks on the cellular inositol phosphate profile. Similar results were obtained with both TiO2 beads purification PAGE analysis (Fig. 1E) and [3H]inositol labeling SAX-HPLC (Fig. 1F) techniques. Single IP6K knockout lines still showed detectable levels of IP7. In IP6K2−/− cells, IP7 was significantly reduced compared with WT but was still present, whereas the IP6K1−/− line did not have significantly less IP7 than WT. No IP7 or IP8 was detectable in the DKO cells, demonstrating that, while IP6K2 appears to contribute most IP7 in HCT116 cells, knockout of both IP6K1 and IP6K2 is necessary to completely deplete these PP-IPs. We consequently focused our attention on the DKO cell lines. These cells showed a normal level of IP6 and the major IP5 isoform I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (Fig. 2). Two smaller peaks were seen eluting between I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6. One was identified by coelution with standard as the alternative IP6K product I(2,3,4,5,6)P5 or its indistinguishable stereoisomer I(1,2,4,5,6)P5 (9Wundenberg T. Grabinski N. Lin H. Mayr G.W. Discovery of InsP6-kinases as InsP6-dephosphorylating enzymes provides a new mechanism of cytosolic InsP6 degradation driven by the cellular ATP/ADP ratio.Biochem. J. 2014; 462 (24865181): 173-18410.1042/BJ20130992Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As this peak increased in the DKO cells (Fig. 2B), in vivo one or both of these isomers must be synthesized through an IP6K-independent but regulated route. The second peak, strongly reduced in the DKO cells, coeluted with a standard of the IP6K product 5PP-IP4. The remaining signal suggests coelution of an unknown species, probably another IP5 isomer, that we have named IPx. Morphologically, the DKO cells appeared similar to the WT cells (Fig. 1G), and there was no significant difference in cell growth (Fig. 1H). Treatment of mammalian cells with the phosphatase inhibitor sodium fluoride is known to increase levels of PP-IPs by inhibiting their turnover (24Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Turnover of inositol pentakisphosphates, inositol hexakisphosphate and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates in primary cultured hepatocytes.Biochem. J. 1993; 293 (8343137): 583-59010.1042/bj2930583Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fluoride treatment of WT cells resulted in 5-IP7 and IP8 accumulation as expected (Fig. S1B). A band migrating slightly faster than IP6 is also seen, likely 5PP-IP4. However, the DKO cells accumulated solely the PPIP5K product 1-IP7, which migrates more slowly. In WT cells 1-IP7 represents <2% of total IP7 (25Gu C. Wilson M.S. Jessen H.J. Saiardi A. Shears S.B. Inositol pyrophosphate profiling of two HCT116 cell lines uncovers variation in InsP8 levels.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 (27788189)e016528610.1371/journal.pone.0165286Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of the mammalian PPIP5K isoforms PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 was unchanged in IP6K KO cells (Fig. S1C). Previous work found that kcs1Δ yeast and IP6K1−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts have defects in mitochondrial function (26Szijgyarto Z. Garedew A. Azevedo C. Saiardi A. Influence of inositol pyrophosphates on cellular energy dynamics.Science. 2011; 334 (22076377): 802-80510.1126/science.1211908Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we did not find any difference between WT and DKO cells using respirometry (Fig. 3A). The mitochondria looked similar following MitoTracker Deep Red staining (Fig. 3B), and expression of various electron transport complex subunits was unchanged (Fig. 3C). It is possible that the different result seen in murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrates cell type specificity for IP7 function. As discussed above, PP-IPs regulate phosphate storage and buffering in budding yeast by controlling polyP production. The presence, abundance, and nature of polyP in mammalian cells remains an open question, and likely will be until the relevant mammalian polyP enzymology is discovered. No true polyP null or overexpression cells are available to act as controls. We attempted to detect polyP in WT and DKO cells. Phenol extraction followed by PAGE and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining did not reveal any polyP characteristic ladders or smears (Fig. S2A). We then tried radioactive [32Pi] labeling to maximize sensitivity. Cells were starved of phosphate for 24 h, on the assumption that if polyP was present it would be degraded during this period to provide phosphate. Phosphate was then restored, along with [32Pi], for a further 24 h, which would stimulate synthesis of radiolabeled [32Pi]polyP. Visualization of PAGE-resolved extracts by toluidine blue and autoradiography also failed to show any polyP-like signal (Fig. S2B). HCT116 cells may therefore not possess polyP; if it exists there, it is both low abundance and very short chain, requiring novel extraction procedures and detection methods more sensitive than radioactive labeling. The absence of polyP led us to theorize that other phosphate-rich and abundant molecules, such as ATP, might work as phosphate buffers in mammalian cells. Intracellular ATP exists at millimolar concentrations (27Yoshida T. Kakizuka A. Imamura H. BTeam a novel BRET-based biosensor for the accurate quantification of ATP concentration within living cells.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (28000761)3961810.1038/srep39618Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), representing a large portion of a cell’s phosphate content. Using ion-pairing HPLC we simultaneously and quantitatively measured ATP, ADP, and AMP in cell extracts (Fig. 3D). A 1.7-fold increase in amount of ATP was seen for DKO cells (Table S1), but there were no significant alterations in AMP or ADP level. The relative proportions of AMP, ADP, and ATP can be combined into one value by calculating the adenylate energy charge (AEC; (ATP + 0.5 ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP)). The DKO cells had significantly higher AEC ratio (Fig. 3E, Table S1). No significant alterations in ATP level or AEC were found for single IP6K1−/− and IP6K2−/− cell lines. Cellular sensing of energy, via sensing of AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP ratios, is performed by the AMPK (AMP-activated kinase) complex. Phosphorylation of AMPK’s α subunit at Thr172 is required for full activity, and this is promoted by AMP binding (28Garcia D. Shaw R.J. AMPK: mechanisms of cellular energy sensing and restoration of metabolic balance.Mol. Cell. 2017; 66 (28622524): 789-80010.1016/j.molcel.2017.05.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The increase in AEC in DKO cells, meaning proportionately less AMP, was reflected in a >0.6-fold reduction in AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3F). To confirm the ATP increase following PP-IPs cellular depletion in another cell type and by using a different experimental approach, we used the yeast 5-pyrophosphatase Siw14 (29Steidle E.A. Chong L.S. Wu M. Crooke E. Fiedler D. Resnick A.C. Rolfes R.J. A novel inositol pyrophosphate phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Siw14 selectively cleaves the β-phosphate from 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5PP-IP5).J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 6772-678310.1074/jbc.M116.714907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This enzyme has no mammalian homolog. We transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding either the WT humanized Myc-Siw14 or pyrophosphatase-dead C214S mutant. Overexpression of the active, but not the dead, Myc-Siw14 depleted IP7 and IP8 levels (Fig. S3A). As with the HCT116 DKO stable cell line, which experiences a chronic loss of PP-IPs, acute depletion by transient transfection in HeLa cells also caused a significant increase in ATP cellular level (Fig. S3B). In this case, levels of ADP and AMP were also higher when PP-IPs were depleted. The increased adenylate pools in DKO likely reflects an increase in total cellular phosphate content. We next investigated if free phosphate levels were also affected. Indeed, DKO cells contained 1.3-fold more free phosphate compared with WT cells (WT 10.0 ± 0.9 versus DKO 13.1 ± 1.7 pmol of phosphate/μg of protein; Fig. 4A). Starving the cells of phosphate for 24 h decreased free intracellular phosphate in both lines to 0.4-fold of the phosphate-replete value; there was no significant difference in phosphate concentration in starved cells. The absence of PP-IPs in DKO cells therefore results in an increase in both free phosphate and bound phosphate, in the form of adenylates. Such phosphate overload could negatively influence phosphate flux in and out of the cells. To test this hypothesis, the steady-state results were complemented by [32Pi] pulse labeling experiments to analyze flux (Fig. 4, B and C). To maximize physiological relevance, culture medium containing the usual phosphate concentration was used, rather than phosphate-free medium. Both [32Pi] uptake and release were significantly reduced in the DKO cells: 0.7-fold [32Pi] was taken up, and 0.6-fold [32Pi] released back into the medium, validating our hypothesis. Release of [32Pi] from labeled cells into the medium is XPR1-dependent (20Giovannini D. Touhami J. Charnet P. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Inorganic phosphate export by the retrovirus receptor XPR1 in metazoans.Cell Rep. 2013; 3 (23791524): 1866-187310.1016/j.celrep.2013.05.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This protein is the only identified mammalian phosphate exporter, but several phosphate importers (sodium-phosphate cotransporters) are known, across three classes: SLC17, SLC34, and SLC20 (1Michigami T. Kawai M. Yamazaki M. Ozono K. Phosphate as a signaling molecule and its sensing mechanism.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98 (30109818): 2317-234810.1152/physrev.00022.2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We were only able to detect mRNA for SLC20A1/Pit1 in HCT116 cells. There was no statistically significant difference in expression of Pit1 or XPR1 (Fig. S4, A and B) between WT and DKO cells. XPR1 is also the only mammalian SPX domain-containing protein. As PP-IPs are known to regulate the activity of SPX proteins from other systems, we were interested in a closer look at the reduced phosphate efflux phenotype. We knocked down XPR1 using siRNA. Commercial antibodies for XPR1 are unable to detect endogenous protein by Western blotting. Therefore, we relied on RT-qPCR to record a reduction in XPR1 mRNA (Fig. 5A). Transient knockdown of XPR1 significantly reduced [32Pi] release 0.8-fold in WT HCT116 cells (Fig. 5B), again confirming its role as phosphate exporter (20Giovannini D. Touhami J. Charnet P. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Inorganic phosphate export by the retrovirus receptor XPR1 in metazoans.Cell Rep. 2013; 3 (23791524): 1866-187310.1016/j.celrep.2013.05.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, siXPR1 did not further affect the low [32Pi] release from DKO cells. This shows that in WT cells phosphate is exported through XPR1 in an IP6K1/2-generated PP-IPs-dependent manner. The ability of XPR1’s SPX domain to bind IP6 has been shown by NMR (4Wild R. Gerasimaite R. Jung J.-Y. Truffault V. Pavlovic I. Schmidt A. Saiardi A. Jessen H.J. Poirier Y. Hothorn M. Mayer A.

To investigate if PP-IPs such as IP7 are XPR1 ligands, we incubated purified SPXXPR1 with [3H]IP6 for a competition-binding assay (Fig. 5C). Titration of unlabeled IP7 reduced the radioactive counts, meaning that it was able to compete with the radioactive [3H]IP6 for binding. We observed similar IC50 values for competing for binding for IP6, 1-IP7, and 5-IP7 of ∼9.8, 8.4, and 4.2 μm, respectively, whereas I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 displaced IP6 with a lower affinity. Therefore, IP7 can bind directly to this SPX protein. Similar affinities for IP6 and IP7 appears to be a common characteristic of SPX domains from various proteins. However, as seen here for XPR1, studies of the yeast VTC complex also revealed functional selectivity for IP7 over IP6 (5Gerasimaite R. Pavlovic I. Capolicchio S. Hofer A. Schmidt A. Jessen H.J.

Despite the importance of floral diversity for proper bee nutrition, urban development has drastically altered resource availability and diversity for these important pollinators. Therefore, understanding the floral resources foraged by bees in urbanized areas is key to identifying and promoting plants that enhance colony health in those environments. In this study, we identified the pollen foraged by bees in four developed areas of the U.S., and explored whether there were spatial or temporal differences in the types of floral sources of pollen used by honey bees in these landscapes. To do this, pollen was collected every month for up to one year from colonies located in developed (urban and suburban) sites in California, Texas, Florida, and Michigan, except during months of pollen dearth or winter. Homogenized pollen samples were acetolyzed and identified microscopically to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Once identified, each pollen type was classified into a frequency category based on its overall relative abundance. Species richness and diversity indices were also calculated and compared across states and seasons. We identified up to 64 pollen types belonging to 39 plant families in one season (California). Species richness was highest in CA and lowest in TX, and was highest during spring in every state. In particular, ""predominant"" and ""secondary"" pollen types belonged to the families Arecaceae, Sapindaceae, Anacardiaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, Lythraceae, Myrtaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae, Saliaceae, and Ulmaceae. This study will help broaden our understanding of honey bee foraging ecology and nutrition in urban environments, and will help promote the use of plants that serve the dual purpose of providing aesthetic value and nutritious forage for honey bee colonies placed in developed landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2952103408,"Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes contain several types of transcripts, including mRNAs and micro RNAs (miRNAs), and have emerged as important mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Exosome-like vesicles were identified in the ovarian follicles of several mammalian species. Although the miRNA contents have been extensively characterized, the detailed investigation of their mRNA profiles is lacking. Here, we characterize the mRNA profiles of exosome-like vesicles in ovarian follicles in a pig model. The mRNA contents of the exosome-like vesicles isolated from porcine follicular fluid were analyzed and compared with those from mural granulosa cells (MGCs) using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Bioinformatics studies suggested that the exosomal mRNAs are enriched in those encoding proteins involved in metabolic, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) -protein kinase B (AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. While the mRNA profile of the exosome-like vesicles resembled that of MGCs, the vesicles contained mRNAs barely detectable in MGCs. Thus, while the majority of the vesicles are likely to be secreted from MGCs, some may originate from other cell types, including theca cells and oocytes, as well as the cells of non-ovarian organs/tissues. Therefore, the mRNA profiles unveiled several novel characteristics of the exosome-like vesicles in ovarian follicles."
https://openalex.org/W2950267703,"The perennial and stoloniferous weed, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (bermudagrass), is a serious problem in vineyards. The spectral similarity between bermudagrass and grapevines makes discrimination of the two species, based solely on spectral information from multi-band imaging sensor, unfeasible. However, that challenge can be overcome by use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and ultra-high spatial resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. This research aimed to automatically, accurately, and rapidly map bermudagrass and design maps for its management. Aerial images of two vineyards were captured using two multispectral cameras (RGB and RGNIR) attached to a UAV. First, spectral analysis was performed to select the optimum vegetation index (VI) for bermudagrass discrimination from bare soil. Then, the VI-based OBIA algorithm developed for each camera automatically mapped the grapevines, bermudagrass, and bare soil (accuracies greater than 97.7%). Finally, site-specific management maps were generated. Combining UAV imagery and a robust OBIA algorithm allowed the automatic mapping of bermudagrass. Analysis of the classified area made it possible to quantify grapevine growth and revealed expansion of bermudagrass infested areas. The generated bermudagrass maps could help farmers improve weed control through a well-programmed strategy. Therefore, the developed OBIA algorithm offers valuable geo-spatial information for designing site-specific bermudagrass management strategies leading farmers to potentially reduce herbicide use as well as optimize fuel, field operating time, and costs."

This study aimed to characterise the demography, mortality and common disorders of Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK during 2013. VetCompass collates anonymised clinical data from UK primary-care veterinary practices for epidemiological research. The clinical records of all Bulldogs available in the VetCompass study dataset were reviewed manually in detail to extract the most definitive diagnoses recorded for all disorders that existed during 2013 and for all deaths. Bulldogs comprised 1621 (0.36%) of 445,557 study dogs. Bulldogs increased from 0.35% of the 2009 birth cohort to 0.60% in 2013. Median longevity was 7.2 years, which was lower in males (6.7 years) than females (7.9 years) (P = 0.021). The most prevalent fine-level precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (n = 206, prevalence 12.7%, 95% CI: 11.1–14.4), pyoderma (142, 8.8%, 95% CI: 7.4–10.2) and overweight/obesity (141, 8.7%, 95% CI: 7.4–10.2). The most prevalent disorder groups were cutaneous (n = 463, prevalence: 28.6%, 95% CI: 26.4–30.8), ophthalmological (292, 18.0%, 95% CI: 16.2–20.0), aural (211, 13.0%, 95% CI: 11.4–14.8), enteropathy (188, 11.6%, 95% CI: 10.1–13.3) and upper respiratory tract (171, 10.5%, 95% CI: 9.1–12.1).

https://openalex.org/W2952178843,"Impairments in cognitive function, mood, and sleep quality occur following ascent to high altitude. Low oxygen (hypoxia) and poor sleep quality are both linked to impaired cognitive performance, but their independent contributions at high altitude remain unknown. Adaptive servoventilation (ASV) improves sleep quality by stabilizing breathing and preventing central apneas without supplemental oxygen. We compared the efficacy of ASV and supplemental oxygen sleep treatments for improving daytime cognitive function and mood in high-altitude visitors (N = 18) during acclimatization to 3,800 m. Each night, subjects were randomly provided with ASV, supplemental oxygen (SpO2 > 95%), or no treatment. Each morning subjects completed a series of cognitive function tests and questionnaires to assess mood and multiple aspects of cognitive performance. We found that both ASV and supplemental oxygen (O2) improved daytime feelings of confusion (ASV: p < 0.01; O2: p < 0.05) and fatigue (ASV: p < 0.01; O2: p < 0.01) but did not improve other measures of cognitive performance at high altitude. However, performance improved on the trail making tests (TMT) A and B (p < 0.001), the balloon analog risk test (p < 0.0001), and the psychomotor vigilance test (p < 0.01) over the course of three days at altitude after controlling for effects of sleep treatments. Compared to sea level, subjects reported higher levels of confusion (p < 0.01) and performed worse on the TMT A (p < 0.05) and the emotion recognition test (p < 0.05) on nights when they received no treatment at high altitude. These results suggest that stabilizing breathing (ASV) or increasing oxygenation (supplemental oxygen) during sleep can reduce feelings of fatigue and confusion, but that daytime hypoxia may play a larger role in other cognitive impairments reported at high altitude. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that some aspects of cognition (executive control, risk inhibition, sustained attention) improve with acclimatization."
https://openalex.org/W2949413553,"Insect pollinator communities are thought to transition from bee-dominated communities at low elevations to fly-dominated communities at high elevations. We predicted that increased tree canopy cover and a subsequent decrease in meadows and flowering plants would limit bees but not flies at higher elevations. We tested and supported this prediction by examining changes in both abundance and species richness for 128 bee species and 96 fly species at key points along an elevational gradient in Northern Arizona represented by distinct vegetation life zones. In addition to an increase in fly species and abundance relative to bees with increasing elevation, there were changes in community structure). To better understand factors that might influence this transition we examined how tree canopy cover changed along the elevational gradient and how this influenced the change in insect pollinator communities. While bee communities were progressively divergent between forest and meadow habitats with increasing elevation and tree canopy cover, there was no significant pattern with flies between meadow and forest habitats. However, fly abundance did increase with increasing elevation relative to bees. Along a comparable elevational gradient on an adjacent mountain with no tree canopy cover (i.e., a fire burned mountain), the bee-to-fly transition did not occur; bees persisted as the dominant pollinator into the highest life zone. This suggests that tree canopy cover can in part explain the transition from bee-to fly-dominated communities. In conclusion, this is the first study in North America to document a bee-fly transition for both abundance and species richness and show that tree canopy cover may play a role in determining pollinator community composition, by restricting bees to open meadow habitats."

Perilymph sampling can thus provide molecular cues to hearing and balance disorders. While such liquid biopsy of the inner ear is not yet in routine clinical practice, previous studies have uncovered alterations in perilymph in patients with certain types of hearing loss. However, the proteome of perilymph from patients with intact hearing has been unknown. Furthermore, no complete characterization of perilymph from patients with vestibular dysfunction has been reported. Here, using liquid-chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, we analyzed samples of normal perilymph collected from three patients with skull base meningiomas and intact hearing. We identified 228 proteins that were common across the samples, establishing a greatly expanded proteome of the previously inferred normal human perilymph. Further comparison to perilymph obtained from three patients with vestibular dysfunction with drop attacks due to Meniere's disease showed 38 proteins with significantly differential abundance. The abundance of four protein candidates with previously unknown roles in inner ear biology was validated in murine cochleae by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization: AACT, HGFAC, EFEMP1, and TGFBI. Together, these results motivate future work in characterizing the normal human perilymph and identifying biomarkers of inner ear disease."
https://openalex.org/W2950422583,"Determining correlates of density for large carnivores is important to understand their ecological requirements and develop conservation strategies. Of several earlier density studies conducted globally, relatively few addressed a scale (usually >1000 km2) that allows inference on correlates of density over heterogeneous landscapes. We deployed 164 camera trap stations covering ~2500 km2 across five areas characterized by broadly different vegetation cover in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania, to investigate correlates of density for a widespread and adaptable carnivore, the leopard (Panthera pardus). We modelled data in a spatially explicit capture-recapture framework, with both biotic and abiotic covariates hypothesised to influence density. We found that leopard density increased with distance to protected area boundary (mean±SE estimated effect = 0.44±0.20), a proxy for both protected area extent and distance from surrounding human settlements. We estimated mean density at 4.22 leopards/100 km2 (85% CI = 3.33‒5.35/100 km2), with no variation across habitat types. Results indicate that protected area extent and anthropogenic disturbance limit leopard populations whereas no support was found for prey availability and trap array as drivers of leopard density. Such vulnerability is relevant to the conservation of the leopard, which is generally considered more resilient to human disturbance than other large cats. Our findings support the notion that protected areas are important to preserve viable population of leopards, increasingly so in times of unprecedented habitat fragmentation. Protection of buffer zones smoothing the abrupt impact of human activities at reserve edges also appears of critical conservation relevance."

Although it has long been known that CL plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics, recent evidence in the yeast model indicates that CL is also essential for intermediary metabolism. To gain insight into the function of CL in energy metabolism in mammalian cells, here we analyzed the metabolic flux of [U-13C]glucose in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line, TAZ-KO, which is CL-deficient because of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the CL-remodeling enzyme tafazzin (TAZ). TAZ-KO cells exhibited decreased flux of [U-13C]glucose to [13C]acetyl-CoA and M2 and M4 isotopomers of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase, the predominant enzyme for anaplerotic replenishing of the TCA cycle, was elevated in TAZ-KO cells, which also exhibited increased sensitivity to the pyruvate carboxylase inhibitor phenylacetate. We attributed a decreased carbon flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA in the TAZ-KO cells to a ∼50% decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, which was observed in both TAZ-KO cells and cardiac tissue from TAZ-KO mice. Protein–lipid overlay experiments revealed that PDH binds to CL, and supplementing digitonin-solubilized TAZ-KO mitochondria with CL restored PDH activity to WT levels. Mitochondria from TAZ-KO cells exhibited an increase in phosphorylated PDH, levels of which were reduced in the presence of supplemented CL.

Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups that were fed an AIN-93G-based diet that contained 5% fiber provided by cellulose (control), BM or BG. Four weeks after starting the respective diets, the animals were sacrificed and digesta from the cecum, proximal colon and distal colon were collected and the SCFA concentrations were quantified. Microbiota in the cecal and distal colonic digesta were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The concentrations of acetate and n-butyrate in cecal digesta were significantly higher in the BM and BG groups than in the control group, whereas the concentration of total SCFAs in cecal digesta was significantly higher only in the BM group than in the control group. The concentrations of acetate and total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta were significantly higher only in the BM group than in the control group. The abundance of Bacteroidetes in cecal digesta was significantly higher in the BM group than in the control group. In contrast, the abundance of Firmicutes in cecal digesta was significantly lower in the BM and BG groups than in the control group. These results indicated that BM increased the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta. These changes might have been caused by fructan and resistant starch in addition to β-glucan. In conclusion, fermentable fibers in BM reached the distal colon and modified the microbiota, leading to an increase in the concentration of total SCFAs in the distal colonic digesta, more effectively compared with the high-β-glucan barley line (BG)."

Experiments performed in the presence of varying proportions of β-(1,4)/β-(1,6)-galactobioses indicated that the preferred substrate was preferentially depleted from the culture supernatant.

Genomes of bifidobacteria typically encode a multitude of oligosaccharide-specific ABC transporters (12Milani C. Turroni F. Duranti S. Lugli G.A. Mancabelli L. Ferrario C. van Sinderen D. Ventura M.

Uptake of oligosaccharides by these transporters is likely to confer an important advantage in the competitive human gut niche, particularly in the colon, which harbors the highest bacterial density. Despite this key role, our insight into oligosaccharide uptake in the human gut niche remains limited. human gut microbiota root mean square deviation solute-binding protein degree of polymerization galactooligosaccharide(s) isothermal titration calorimetry Protein Data Bank galacto-N-biose lacto-N-biose GNB/LNB-binding protein galactosyl-lactose β-(1,3)-galactobiose β-(1,4)-galactobiose β-(1,6)-galactobiose β-(1,6)-galactotetraose. β-Galactosides are ubiquitous in the human diet (e.g. in both human and animal milk) (13Urashima T.

Oligomeric β-galactosides of different origin have been shown to selectively promote members of the Bifidobacterium genus that harbor many probiotic health-promoting strains (15O'Callaghan A. van Sinderen D.

Dietary β-galactosides display source-dependent diversity with respect to degree of polymerization (DP), glycosidic linkages, and the presence of other monosaccharides. β-Galactosides are also considered prime prebiotic dietary supplements (galactooligosaccharides (GOS)) produced by transglycosylation of lactose, partially due to their bifidogenic effect. Notably, commercial GOS preparations typically comprise tens of compounds of DP 2–6 and contain β-(1,3)-, β-(1,4)-, and β-(1,6)-galactosidic linkages (16van Leeuwen S.S. Kuipers B.J.H. Dijkhuizen L.

The role of oligosaccharide transporters in β-galactooligosaccharide utilization selectivity has received less attention, with two recent studies having addressed the identification and binding properties of β-galactooligosaccharide transport proteins in Bifidobacterium breve (21Shigehisa A.

Characterization of a bifidobacterial system that utilizes galacto-oligosaccharides.Microbiology. 2015; 161 (25903756): 1463-147010.1099/mic.0.000100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Sotoya H.

We have previously identified a transcriptionally induced operon during growth of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 on GOS (a commercial β-galactoside mixture). This operon encodes a transcriptional regulator, a β-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 42 (BlGH42A), and an ABC transporter (23Andersen J.M. Barrangou R. Abou Hachem M. Lahtinen S.J. Goh Y.J. Svensson B. Klaenhammer T.R. Transcriptional analysis of oligosaccharide utilization by Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14 (23663691): 312-32510.1186/1471-2164-14-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase revealed a broad specificity, hydrolyzing β-(1,6)-, β-(1,3)-, and β-(1,4)-galactosidic bonds with a modest 5-fold preference for β-(1,6)-galactobiose (β6Gal2) as compared with the β-(1,4) isomer (24Viborg A.H. Fredslund F. Katayama T. Nielsen S.K. Svensson B. Kitaoka M. Lo Leggio L. Abou Hachem M. A β1–6/β1–3 galactosidase from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis Bl-04 gives insight into sub-specificities of β-galactoside catabolism within Bifidobacterium.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94 (25287704): 1024-104010.1111/mmi.12815Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we report the molecular characterization of the β-galactoside–specific SBP (Bal6GBP) associated with the ABC transporter. In contrast to the relatively promiscuous β-gal, Bal6GBP displayed selectivity exceeding 3 orders of magnitude for β6Gal2 as compared with the β-(1,4) isomers, which was explained by the structure of Bal6GBP in complex with β6Gal2. The high selectivity of Bal6GBP is reflected in a dramatic difference in growth profiles of B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 showing several hours of lag phase on less preferred substrates. This was shown to be attributed to the inefficient uptake of ligands that are less preferred by the binding protein. Structural analyses allowed tracking the evolutionary relationship with the lacto-N-biose (human milk-derived) binding protein from Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (25Suzuki R. Wada J. Katayama T. Fushinobu S. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Sugimoto H. Tanaka A. Kumagai H. Ashida H. Kitaoka M. Yamamoto K.

Despite the low primary structure identities, these two binding proteins share a similar architecture of the side chains interacting with the nonreducing galactosyl moiety but diverge in the recognition of the penultimate carbohydrate ring from the nonreducing end. Altogether, the present study constitutes a unique case enabling the comparison of ligand selectivity of an ABC-associated transport protein and the intracellular glycoside hydrolase mediating uptake and breakdown, respectively, of the same substrates. These findings underscore the leading role of ABC-mediated glycan transport in governing the growth preferences of core gut microbiota members on β-galactosides. This insight paves the way to tailored editing of specific members of the microbiota based on uptake profiles in future interventions to promote health and to alleviate disease. The β-galactoside SBP from B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 (Bal6GBP) was recombinantly produced and purified (yield = 85 mg liter−1 medium). The binding of a panel of di- and oligosaccharides to Bal6GBP was screened using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which established the specificity toward β-galactopyranosyl–linked ligands (Table S1). The binding affinities and kinetic parameters of the β-galactoside ligands (Fig. 1) were discerned by SPR (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The highest affinity of Bal6GBP was for β6Gal2 (KD ≈ 100 nm), and the selectivity toward this galactosidic linkage was striking as the affinity dropped by 304- and 1630-fold for β-(1,3)-galactobiose (β3Gal2) and β-(1,4)-galactobiose (β4Gal2), respectively. The selectivity was governed by staggering (up to 3 × 104-fold) changes in the association rate constant (kon), whereas the dissociation rate constants (koff) varied modestly with glycosidic linkage. The affinity appeared to decrease with size for β-(1,6)-galactosides with a 26-fold drop for β-(1,6)-galactotetraose (β6Gal4) as compared with β6Gal2. This trend was not valid for the less preferred β-(1,4)-galactosides. The affinity of Bal6GBP was highest at pH 6.5 but varied only modestly in the pH range 5.4–8.2, consistent with the slightly acidic pH prevalent in the colon.Figure 2Binding analyses of Bal6GBP.

The structure of GL-BP was determined in complex with galacto-N-biose (PDB code 2Z8E), lacto-N-biose (PDB code 2Z8D), and lacto-N-tetraose (PDB code 2Z8F). The crystal obtained for phasing from the SeMet-labeled protein belongs to the same space group as the ligand-bound form, but with a different β angle and slightly different cell lengths (Table 3). The structure of the open form of the protein was determined from the SeMet protein crystals, which revealed high flexibility between domain 1 and domain 2, resulting in an open ligand-free form and a closed ligand-bound form (29Abe K.

Thus, closure of the protein involves a rigid-body movement of domains with changes mainly occurring in the hinge region. Bal6GBP in complex with β6Gal2 showed a well-defined density of the ligand that primarily assumes the β-configuration. The ligand is almost completely engulfed in the largely solvent-inaccessible binding site (Fig. S2). The nonreducing galactosyl stacks onto Trp-275 from domain 2, which defines position 1. A total of 12 potential hydrogen bonds recognize β6Gal2: three from domain 1, six from domain 2, and three from the hinge region (Table S2 and Fig. 3B). Five of the six water molecules that coordinate the ligand also mediate hydrogen-bonding networks to residues in the binding pocket. All hydroxyl groups of the galactosyl at position 1 are recognized by polar interactions to Gln-96, Glu-98, Asp-145, Asn-279, Gly-310, and Ser-311. This correlates well with the strict requirement for β-galactosyl at position 1 for recognition by Bal6GBP. By contrast, only the C2-OH and C4-OH of the galactosyl at position 2 are recognized by direct polar contacts to Asn-74, Glu-98, Asp-196, and Asn-308. Glucosyl can be accommodated at position 2, albeit with 140-fold reduced affinity for the disaccharide allolactose as compared with β6Gal2 (Table 2), probably due to the recognition of the axial C4-OH in β6Gal2 by Asn-74 and Glu-98, which also interacts with the C2-OH from the reducing end galactosyl unit. Both hemiacetal ring oxygens in β6Gal2 form hydrogen bonds with indole nitrogens of tryptophans (Trp-47 and Trp-254; Fig. 3B). Only two loci were previously observed to be highly up-regulated during growth on galactooligosaccharides, the canonical lactose metabolism locus encoding a LacS transport system and the ABC system characterized in the present study (23Anders"
https://openalex.org/W2952080074,"Background The Ghana Health Service in collaboration with partner institutions implemented a five-year primary health systems strengthening program known as the Ghana Essential Health Intervention Program (GEHIP). GEHIP was a plausibility trial implemented in an impoverished region of northern Ghana around the World Health Organizations (WHO) six pillars combined with community engagement, leadership development and grassroots political support, the program organized a program of training and action focused on strategies for saving newborn lives and community-engaged emergency referral services. This paper analyzes the effect of the GEHIP program on child survival. Methods Birth history data assembled from baseline and endline surveys are used to assess the hazard of child mortality in GEHIP treatment and comparison areas prior to and after the start of treatment. Difference-in-differences (DiD) methods are used to compare mortality change over time among children exposed to GEHIP relative to children in the comparison area over the same time period. Models test the hypothesis that a package of systems strengthening activities improved childhood survival. Models adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of baseline differentials, secular mortality trends, household characteristics such as relative wealth and parental educational attainment, and geographic accessibility of clinical care. Results The GEHIP combination of health systems strengthening activities reduced neonatal mortality by approximately one half (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28,0.98, p = 0.045). There was a null incremental effect of GEHIP on mortality of post-neonate infants (from 1 to 12 months old) (HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.30,1.79; p = 0.480) and post-infants (from 1 year to 5 years old) -(HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.55–1.90; p = 0.940). Age-specific analyses show that impact was concentrated among neonates. However, effect ratios for post-infancy were inefficiently assessed owing to extensive survival history censoring for the later months of childhood. Children were observed only rarely for periods over 40 months of age. Conclusion GEHIP results show that a comprehensive approach to newborn care is feasible, if care is augmented by community-based nurses. It supports the assertion that if appropriate mechanisms are put in place to enable the various pillars of the health system as espoused by WHO in rural impoverished settings where childhood mortality is high, it could lead to accelerated reductions in mortality thereby increasing survival of children. Policy implications of the pronounced neonatal effect of GEHIP merit national review for possible scale-up."
https://openalex.org/W2950876717,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), poses a threat to public health. While standard surveillance focuses on Rifampicin and/or Isoniazid resistance, little is known about other resistance patterns. This study aims to identify predominant drug resistance (DR) patterns in Germany and risk factors associated with them in order to inform diagnostic and treatment strategies.Case-based TB surveillance data notified in Germany from 2008-2017 were utilized to investigate DR and MDR-TB patterns for Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), Ethambutol (E), and Streptomycin (S). Predominant patterns were further analyzed stratified by sex, age, country of birth, prior TB, and disease site. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine risk factors associated with any resistance, MDR-TB, and complete HRZES resistance.26,228 cases with complete DST results were included in the study, among which 3,324 cases had any DR (12.7%). Four patterns were predominant, representing about ¾ of all cases with any resistance (S: 814 [3.1%]; H: 768 [2.9%]; HS: 552 [2.1%]; Z: 412 [1.6%]). High proportions of S and H resistances were found among both German and foreign-born populations, especially those born in Eastern Europe, and were unexpectedly high among children (H: 4.3%; S: 4.6%). Foreign-born cases had significantly higher proportion of any resistance (16.0%) and MDR-TB (3.3%) compared to German-born cases (8.3% and 0.6%). Of 556 MDR-TB cases, 39.2% showed complete HRZES resistance. Logistic regression revealed having prior TB and being foreign-born as consistently strong risk factors for any DR, MDR-TB, and complete HRZES resistance.DR patterns observed in Germany, particularly for MDR-TB were more complex than expected, highlighting the fact that detailed drug-testing results are crucial before incorporating HRZES drugs in MDR-TB treatment. Furthermore, the relatively high rate of H-resistance in Germany provides strong rationale against the use of only H-based preventive therapy for LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2952123416,"Oral administration of nucleotide analogues and injection of interferon-α (IFNα) are used to achieve immediate suppression in replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Nucleotide analogs and IFNα inhibit viral polymerase activity and cause long-term eradication of the virus at least in part through removing covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) via induction of the APOBEC3 deaminases family of molecules, respectively. This study aimed to explore whether the orally administrable low molecular weight agent CDM-3008 (RO8191), which mimics IFNα through the binding to IFNα/β receptor 2 (IFNAR2) and the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, can suppress HBV replication and reduce cccDNA levels. In primary cultured human hepatocytes, HBV DNA levels were decreased after CDM-3008-treatment in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.1 μM, and this was accompanied by significant reductions in cellular cccDNA levels, both HBeAg and HBsAg levels in the cell culture medium. Using a microarray we comprehensively analyzed and compared changes in gene (mRNA) expression in CDM-3008- and IFNα-treated primary cultured human hepatocytes. As reported previously, CDM-3008 mimicked the induction of genes that participate in the interferon signaling pathway. OAS1 and ISG20 mRNA expression was similarly enhanced by both CDM-3008 and IFNα. Thus, CDM-3008 could suppress pgRNA expression to show anti-HBV activity. APOBEC3F and 3G mRNA expression was also induced by CDM-3008 and IFNα treatments, suggesting that cccDNA could be degraded through induced APOBEC3 family proteins. We identified the genes whose expression was specifically enhanced in CDM-3008-treated cells compared to IFNα-treated cells. The expression of SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, and CISH, which inhibit STAT activation, was enhanced in CDM-3008-treated cells suggesting that a feedback inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway was enhanced in CDM-3008-treated cells compared to IFNα-treated cells. In addition, CDM-3008 showed an additive effect with a clinically-used nucleoside entecavir on inhibition of HBV replication. In summary, CDM-3008 showed anti-HBV activity through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), with greater feedback inhibition than IFNα."
https://openalex.org/W2949973175,"Background Although lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in elderly patients, evidence about tumor-directed therapy in elderly patients is sparse, and it is unclear to what extent this affects treatment and care. Our study aimed to discover potential disparities in care between elderly patients and those under 65 years of age. Methods We studied claims from 13 283 German patients diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009 who survived for at least 90 days after diagnosis. We classified patients as “non-elderly” (≤ 65), “young-old” (65–74), “middle-old” (75–84), and “old-old” (≥ 85). We compared receipt of tumor-directed therapy (6 months after diagnosis), palliative care, opioids, antidepressants, and pathologic diagnosis confirmation via logistic regression. We used generalized linear regression (gamma distribution) to compare group-specific costs of care for 3 months after diagnosis. We adjusted all models by age, nursing home residency, nursing care need, comorbidity burden, and area of residence (urban, rural). The age group “non-elderly” served as reference group. Results Compared with the reference group “non-elderly”, the likelihood of receiving any tumor-directed treatment was significantly lower in all age groups with a decreasing gradient with advancing age. Elderly lung cancer patients received significantly fewer resections and radiotherapy than non-elderly patients. In particular, treatment with antineoplastic therapy declined with increasing age (“young-old” (OR = 0.76, CI = [0.70,0.83]), “middle-old” (OR = 0.45, CI = [0.36,0.50]), and “old-old” (OR = 0.13, CI = [0.10,0.17])). Patients in all age groups were less likely to receive structured palliative care than “non-elderly” (“young-old” (OR = 0.84, CI = [0.76,0.92]), “middle-old” (OR = 0.71, CI = [0.63,0.79]), and “old-old” (OR = 0.57, CI = [0.44,0.73])). Moreover, increased age was significantly associated with reduced quotas for outpatient treatment with opioids and antidepressants. Costs of care decreased significantly with increasing age. Conclusion This study suggests the existence of age-dependent care disparities in lung cancer patients, where elderly patients are at risk of potential undertreatment. To support equal access to care, adjustments to public health policies seem to be urgently required."
https://openalex.org/W2950846327,"Behavioural innovation, the use of new behaviours or existing ones in novel contexts, can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences for animals. An understanding of these consequences would be incomplete without considering the traits that predispose certain individuals to exhibit innovative behaviour. Several individual and ecological variables are hypothesized to affect innovativeness, but empirical studies show mixed results. We examined the effects of dominance rank, exploratory personality, and urbanisation on the innovativeness of wild-caught black-capped chickadees using a survival analysis of their performance in two problem-solving tasks. Additionally, we provide one of the first investigations of the predictors of persistence in a problem-solving context. For lever pulling, we found a trend for dominants to outperform subordinates, particularly in rural birds, which did not align with predictions from the necessity drives innovation hypothesis. When examining possible explanations for this trend we found that older chickadees outperformed younger birds. This follow-up analysis also revealed a positive effect of exploratory personality on the lever-pulling performance of chickadees. Our results suggest that experience may foster innovation in certain circumstances, for instance via the application of previously-acquired information or skills to a novel problem. As we found different predictors for both tasks, this suggests that task characteristics influence the innovative propensity of individuals, and that their effects should be investigated experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2950068628,"Vibrio cholerae is an important human pathogen causing intestinal disease with a high incidence in developing countries. V. cholerae can switch between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Biofilm formation is determinant for transmission, virulence and antibiotic resistance. Due to the enhanced antibiotic resistance observed by bacterial pathogens, antimicrobial nanomaterials have been used to combat infections by stopping bacterial growth and preventing biofilm formation. In this study, the effect of the nanocomposites zeolite-embedded silver (Ag), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) nanoparticles (NPs) was evaluated in V. cholerae planktonic cells, and in two biofilm states: pellicle biofilm (PB), formed between air-liquid interphase, and surface-attached biofilm (SB), formed at solid-liquid interfaces. Each nanocomposite type had a distinctive antimicrobial effect altering each V. cholerae lifestyles differently. The ZEO-AgNPs nanocomposite inhibited PB formation at 4 μg/ml, and prevented SB formation and eliminated planktonic cells at 8 μg/ml. In contrast, the nanocomposites ZEO-CuNPs and ZEO-ZnNPs affect V. cholerae viability but did not completely avoid bacterial growth. At transcriptional level, depending on the nanoparticles and biofilm type, nanocomposites modified the relative expression of the vpsL, rbmA and bap1, genes involved in biofilm formation. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the outer membrane proteins OmpT, OmpU, OmpA and OmpW also differs among treatments in PB and SB. This work provides a basis for further study of the nanomaterials effect at structural, genetic and proteomic levels to understand the response mechanisms of V. cholerae against metallic nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2951351039,"The time spent in sedentary behaviour represents an important public health burden. To reduce sedentary time in the general population, the simplest, most effective, and most accessible method is to decrease lying and sitting time. We aimed to compare differences on energy expenditure (EE) across lying, sitting, and standing positions; and to analyse the associations between the change on EE of changing from one position to another and anthropometric and body composition parameters in young healthy adults. A total of 55 (69% women) young healthy adults aged 21.7 ± 2.2 participated in the study. We measured EE by indirect calorimetry across lying, sitting, and standing positions following the standard procedures. The EE was significantly higher in standing than in both lying and sitting positions (mean difference: 0.121±0.292 and 0.125±0.241 kcal/min, respectively; all P<0.001), and no differences were observed between lying and sitting positions (P = 1.000). There was a negative association between the EE differences in sitting vs. standing position and lean body mass (P = 0.048), yet no associations between EE differences with the rest of the anthropometric and body composition parameters were observed in each position pair studied (all P>0.321). Our findings support the fact that increasing the time spent standing could be a simple strategy to slightly increase EE. Therefore, our results have important clinical implications including a better monitoring, characterizing, and promoting countermeasures to sedentariness through low-level physical activities."

https://openalex.org/W2951203736,"Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled intracellular apicomplexan parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. It is capable of infecting humans and nearly all warm-blooded animals including pigs, but cats are the only known definitive host. This ubiquitous zoonotic pathogen can cause abortion, stillbirth and fetal abnormalities, and has been associated with mental and behavioral changes in humans. Acute infection is potentially fatal in immunocompromised individuals. The present study aimed to assess the Toxoplasma seroprevalence in pigs, humans and cats after its initial reported detection in pigs about three decades ago in Cebu, Philippines. A total of 924 humans, 104 cats and 514 slaughter pigs were tested for antibodies against T. gondii using a commercial latex agglutination test. The results revealed positive detection rates of 26.3% (244/924) for humans, 42.3% (44/104) for cats and 13.4% (69/514) for slaughter pigs. Statistical analyses revealed that the area (P = 0.004), cat ownership (P = 0.020), the frequency of contact with cats (P < 0.0001) and consumption of street foods (P = 0.043) were significantly associated with seropositivity for T. gondii in humans. Meanwhile, the use of litter trays (P = 0.001) and contact with other animals (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with seropositivity in cats. The odds ratio for selected significant factors revealed that living in suburban areas (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.20-2.31), owning a cat (OR 1.482, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07) and eating street foods (OR 1.585, 95% CI: 1.01-2.48) were associated with an increased risk of T. gondii exposure in humans. In cats, the use of a litter tray (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 1.73-11.71) was associated with an increased risk of exposure. None of the profile parameters were found to be significantly associated with seropositivity in slaughter pigs (P > 0.05). This study is the first report of the serological detection of T. gondii in humans and cats in Cebu, Philippines, and the first assessment of the prevalence of the parasite in pigs in the area since its initial detection in 1982. This is also the first report documenting the seropositivity of T. gondii in pregnant women in the country. The confirmed seropositivity of T. gondii in Cebu, Philippines, in the present study implies the endemicity of toxoplasmosis in this area and highlights the need for routine testing and increased public awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2949794481,"Most associative learning tests in rodents use negative stimuli, such as electric shocks. We investigated if young rats can learn to associate the presence of an odour with the experience of being tickled (i.e. using an experimenter's hand to mimic rough-and-tumble play), shown to elicit 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), which are indicative of positive affect. Male, pair-housed Wistar rats (N = 24) were all exposed to two neutral odours (A and B) presented in a perforated container on alternate days in a test arena. Following 60s of exposure, the rats were either tickled on days when odour A (n = 8) or odour B (n = 8) was present, or never tickled (n = 8). When tickled, rats produced significantly more 50 kHz USVs compared to the days when not being tickled, and compared to control rats. The level of anticipatory 50 kHz USVs in the 60s prior to tickling did not differ significantly between the tickled and control rats. As a retrieval test following the odour conditioning, rats were exposed successively in the same arena to three odours: an unknown neutral odour, extract of fox faeces, and either odours A or B. Compared to controls, 50 kHz USVs of tickled rats increased when exposed to the odour they had previously experienced when tickled, indicating that these rats had learned to associate the odour with the positive experience of being tickled. In a test with free access for 5 min to both arms of a T-maze, each containing one of the odours, rats tickled with odour A spent more time in the arm with this odour. This work is the first to test in a fully balanced design whether rats can learn to associate an odour with tickling, and indicates that positive odour conditioning has potential to be used as an alternative to negative conditioning tests."
https://openalex.org/W2951829442,"Diverse fungal endophytes live in plants and are shaped by some abiotic and biotic stresses. Plant disease as particular biotic stress possibly gives an impact on the communities of fungal endophytes. In this study, clubroot disease caused by an obligate biotroph protist, Plasmodiophora brassicae, was considered to analyze its influence on the fungal endophyte community using an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) through high-throughput sequencing and culture-dependent methods. The results showed that the diversity of the endophyte community in the healthy roots was much higher than the clubroots. Ascomycota was the dominant group of endophytes (Phoma, Mortierella, Penicillium, etc.) in the healthy roots while P. brassicae was the dominant taxon in the clubroots. Hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) indicated significant differences between the endophyte communities in the healthy roots and clubroots. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) analysis showed that the dominant genera could be regarded as potential biomarkers. The endophyte community in the healthy roots had a more complex network compared with the clubroots. Also, many plant pathogenic Fusarium were isolated from the clubroots by the culture-dependent method. The outcome of this study illustrates that P. brassicae infection may change the fungal endophyte community associated with the roots of tumourous stem mustard and facilitates the entry of soil pathogen into the roots."

https://openalex.org/W2952336793,"Like the transfer of genetic variation through gene flow, language changes constantly as a result of its use in human interaction. Contact between speakers is most likely to happen when they are close in space, time, and social setting. Here, we investigated the role of geographical configuration in this process by studying linguistic diversity in Japan, which comprises a large connected mainland (less isolation, more potential contact) and smaller island clusters of the Ryukyuan archipelago (more isolation, less potential contact). We quantified linguistic diversity using dialectometric methods, and performed regression analyses to assess the extent to which distance in space and time predict contemporary linguistic diversity. We found that language diversity in general increases as geographic distance increases and as time passes—as with biodiversity. Moreover, we found that (I) for mainland languages, linguistic diversity is most strongly related to geographic distance—a so-called isolation-by-distance pattern, and that (II) for island languages, linguistic diversity reflects the time since varieties separated and diverged—an isolation-by-colonisation pattern. Together, these results confirm previous findings that (linguistic) diversity is shaped by distance, but also goes beyond this by demonstrating the critical role of geographic configuration."
https://openalex.org/W2949493160,"Climate change, mismanaged resource extraction, and pollution are reshaping global marine ecosystems with direct consequences on human societies. Sustainable ocean development requires knowledge and data across disciplines, scales and knowledge types. Although several disciplines are generating large amounts of data on marine socio-ecological systems, such information is often underutilized due to fragmentation across institutions or stakeholders, limited standardization across scale, time or disciplines, and the fact that information is often not searchable within existing databases. Compiling metadata, the information which describes existing sets of data, is an effective tool that can address these challenges, particularly when metadata corresponding to multiple datasets can be combined to integrate, organize and classify multidisciplinary data. Here, using Mexico as a case study, we describe the compilation and analysis of a metadatabase of ocean knowledge that aims to improve access to information, facilitate multidisciplinary data sharing and integration, and foster collaboration among stakeholders. We also evaluate the knowledge trends and gaps for informing ocean management. Analysis of the metadatabase highlights that past and current research in Mexico focuses strongly on ecology and fisheries, with biological data more consistent over time and space compared to data on human dimensions. Regional imbalances in available information were also evident, with most available information corresponding to the Gulf of California, Campeche Bank and Caribbean and less available for the central and south Pacific and the western Gulf of Mexico. Despite existing knowledge gaps in Mexico and elsewhere, we argue that systematic efforts such as this can often reveal an abundance of information for decision-makers to develop policies that meet key commitments on ocean sustainability. Surmounting current cross-scale social and ecological challenges for sustainability requires transdisciplinary approaches. Metadatabases are critical tools to make efficient use of existing data, highlight and address strengths and deficiencies, and develop scenarios to inform policies for managing complex marine social-ecological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2952657454,"Background Understanding the role of the gut microbiome is pivotal for the future development of therapies for the prevention and management of autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes when sampling during early life may be particularly important. The current standard methods for collecting gut microbiome samples for research is to extract fresh samples or freeze samples immediately after collection. This is often impractical however for population-based studies. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal method for the stabilization of stool bacterial DNA obtained from nappies and transported by post in ambient conditions to the research centre for a national birth cohort study. Methods Four methods to collect samples were compared to immediate freezing of samples: 1) collecting faeces onto a swab which was immediately frozen, 2) using a commercially available kit with stabilisation solution (OMNIgene•GUT kit) at ambient temperature, 3) collecting onto a swab and 4) collecting into a sterile plain tube. Samples 3) and 4) were returned to the laboratory by post at ambient temperatures. A Bland Altman analysis was used to assess the agreement between the different methods and the frozen standard. Results Stool samples were collected by parents. For samples transported in ambient conditions, the limits of agreement showed that the OMNIgene•GUT kit had the narrowest 95% limits of agreement with the frozen standard as measured by the number of operational taxonomic units and the Shannon diversity index. Conclusions All methods assessed for preserving samples collected from nappies at a distance and delivered by post for gut microbiome analysis showed variation / disagreement from the frozen standard. Overall, the OMNIgene•GUT kit preserved the samples with minimal changes compared to other methods and was practical for parents to use."
https://openalex.org/W2950337311,"Diabetes is characterized by a loss of β-cell mass, and a greater understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms governing β-cell function is required for future therapies. Previously, we reported that a complex of the Islet-1 (Isl1) transcription factor and the co-regulator single-stranded DNA-binding protein 3 (SSBP3) regulates the genes necessary for β-cell function, but few proteins are known to interact with this complex in β-cells. To identify additional components, here we performed SSBP3 reverse-cross-linked immunoprecipitation (ReCLIP)- and MS-based experiments with mouse β-cell extracts and compared the results with those from our previous Isl1 ReCLIP study. Our analysis identified the E3 ubiquitin ligases ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) and RNF40, factors that in nonpancreatic cells regulate transcription through imparting monoubiquitin marks on histone H2B (H2Bub1), a precursor to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). We hypothesized that RNF20 and RNF40 regulate similar genes as those regulated by Isl1 and SSBP3 and are important for β-cell function. We observed that Rnf20 and Rnf40 depletion reduces β-cell H2Bub1 marks and uncovered several target genes, including glucose transporter 2 (Glut2), MAF BZIP transcription factor A (MafA), and uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2). Strikingly, we also observed that Isl1 and SSBP3 depletion reduces H2Bub1 and H3K4me3 marks, suggesting that they have epigenetic roles. We noted that the RNF complex is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and normal mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels. These findings indicate that RNF20 and RNF40 regulate β-cell gene expression and insulin secretion and establish a link between Isl1 complexes and global cellular epigenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2952794395,"The elderly gait encompasses several disorders, including a lower minimum toe clearance (MTC) to the ground, which is a potential cause of tripping and falling while walking. Devices that assist in the MTC could reduce such risks. However, the development of effective assistive methods and their evaluation in the elderly might jeopardize their safety. To address this, young adults could take the place of the elderly. We present Muscle Activity Restriction Taping Technique (MARTT) that was devised to simulate the healthy-elderly gait characteristics in the young adults, particularly the lower MTC, by restricting the activity of lower-limb muscles. Two different restriction approaches, one that restricts muscles at the shank and the other at the shank and thigh, simultaneously, were tested at different walking speeds. Both approaches achieved a reduction in the MTC, regardless of the walking speed. The MTC was reduced to a median value lower than 10.1 mm, which is within the range of the MTC values reported for the elderly. The reduction of the MTC significantly increased toe contact to the ground. With the restriction of the shank muscles, the toe-contact frequency was more than twice as that in normal walking, and with the restriction of both the shank and thigh muscles, more than five times. In addition, MARTT reproduced the lower step length, the lower single support phase, and the joint motion compensation characteristic of the elderly gait, in the youth."

Information provided to pregnant women about fetal movements is inconsistent perhaps due to limited knowledge about normal fetal movement patterns in healthy pregnancies. We aimed to describe maternally perceived fetal movement strength, frequency, and pattern in late pregnancy in women with subsequent normal outcomes.Participants were ≥28 weeks' gestation, with a non-anomalous, singleton pregnancy who had been randomly selected from hospital booking lists and had consented to participate. Fetal movement data was gathered during pregnancy via a questionnaire administered face-to-face by research midwives. Participants remained eligible for the study if they subsequently gave birth to a live, appropriate-for-gestational-age baby at ≥37 weeks.Participants were 274 women, with normal pregnancy outcomes. The majority (59.3%, n = 162) of women reported during antenatal interview that the strength of fetal movements had increased in the preceding two weeks. Strong fetal movements were felt by most women in the evening (72.8%, n = 195) and at night-time including bedtime (74.5%, n = 199). The perception of fetal hiccups was also reported by most women (78.8%). Women were more likely to perceive moderate or strong fetal movements when sitting quietly compared with other activities such as having a cold drink or eating.Our data support informing women in the third trimester that as pregnancy advances it is normal to perceive increasingly strong movement, episodes of movements that are more vigorous than usual, fetal hiccups, and a diurnal pattern involving strong fetal movement in the evening. This information may help pregnant women to better characterise normal fetal movement and appropriately seek review when concerned about fetal movements. Care providers should be responsive to concerns about decreased fetal movements in the evening, as this is unusual."

Treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) seems to be a promising solution, however the results from clinical studies are still equivocal. Better selection of candidate patients and improving monitoring of patients following MSC administration can increase treatment effectiveness. In order to determine which characteristics can be used to predict a good response and better monitoring of patients, blood samples were taken prior to therapy, one week and one month after therapy, from 26 allogeneic HSCT patients whom contracted GvHD and were treated with MSCs. Samples were examined for differential blood counts, bilirubin levels and cell surface markers. Serum cytokine levels were also measured. We found that the level of lymphocytes, in particular T and NK cells, may predict a good response to therapy. A better response was observed among patients who expressed low levels of IL-6 and IL-22, Th17 related cytokines, prior to therapy. Patients with high levels of bilirubin prior to therapy showed a poorer response. The results of this study may facilitate early prediction of success or failure of the treatment, and subsequently, will improve selection of patients for MSC therapy."

Methods We recruited 1250 males and 1250 females aged 18 to 50. Abortion rate was calculated through direct question and NSU methodology. The NSU was applied on three sub-samples (male, female and aggregate). Integrating replies to 25 reference groups, we estimated the network size (C) of respondents and its age-gender structure. To calculate the part of network that is subject to abortion, we compared two approaches: proportional and data based. The Visibility Factor (VF) was calculated through 222 females who had abortion. Direct estimate was considered as gold standard. Results Using C’s derived from proportional method, the Relative Bias (RB) in the male and female samples was 33% and 84%. Applying the data-based C’s, the RB in the gender-specific and aggregate samples was 5% and 2%. Conclusion The proportional method overestimates the prevalence.

With two codebooks, 18 scientific (e.g. reporting the study design of the study correctly) and 7 interest-raising measures (e.g. words like 'ground-breaking') were evaluated in the PRs and NSs. For all measures the percentage of presence in NSs and PRs was calculated, together with a Mean PR Influence Factor. Quality of PRs and NSs was defined as a score, based on 12 of the 18 scientific measures. Mean (SD) NS quality score was 6.5 (1.7) which was significantly lower than the PR score of 8.0 (1.5). The two quality scores were significantly correlated. Quality measures that were frequently omitted included reporting important study limitations (present in 21% of PRs, 21% of NSs), funding (59% of PRs, 7% of NSs) and conflicts of interest (16% of PRs, 3% of NSs). We did not evaluate the quality of the scientific papers (SPs), and can therefore not determine if the quality of PRs and NSs is associated with the quality of SPs.This large study of medical university press releases and corresponding news stories showed that important measures of a scientific study such as funding and study limitations were omitted to a very large extent. The lay public and health personnel as well as policy makers, politicians and other decision makers may be misled by incomplete and partly inaccurate representations of scientific studies which could negatively affect important health-related behaviours and decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2951552790,"One of the greatest challenges of developmental psychology is figuring out what children are thinking. This is particularly difficult in early childhood, for children who are prelinguistic or are just beginning to speak their first words. In this stage, children’s responses are commonly measured by presenting young children with a limited choice between one of a small number of options (e.g., “Do you want X or Y?”). A tendency to choose one response in these tasks may be taken as an indication of a child’s preference or understanding. Adults’ responses are known to exhibit order biases when they are asked questions. The current set of experiments looks into the following question: do children demonstrate response biases? Together, we show that 1) toddlers demonstrate a robust verbal recency bias when asked “or” questions in a lab-based task and a naturalistic corpus of caretaker-child speech interactions, 2) the recency bias weakens with age, and 3) the recency bias strengthens as the syllable-length of the choices gets longer. Taken together, these results indicate that children show a different type of response bias than adults, recency instead of primacy. Further, the results may suggest that this bias stems from increased constraints on children’s working memory."
https://openalex.org/W1977637730,"The benefit of revascularization of chronic total occlusion (CTO) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is controversial. On the other hand, left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a more sensitive marker of LV myocardial ischemia and LV function than LV ejection fraction (EF). The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of revascularization of CTO on LV function using LV GLS. A total of 70 consecutive patients (65.1±8.9 years, 59 males, LVEF 51.0±12.0%) with CTO who had a positive functional ischemia and underwent PCI, were included in this study. Echocardiography was performed before and 9 months after the procedure with conventional assessment including LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume (LVEDV, LVESV), LVEF, and with 2DSTE analysis of GLS. Successful PCI was obtained in 60 patients (86%). There were no stent thromboses during follow-up. GLS showed a significant improvement 9 months after successful PCI (pre-PCI -12.4±4.1% vs. post-PCI -14.5±4.1%, P< 0.01), whereas in failed PCI group that did not change significantly (pre-PCI -13.2±4.2% vs. post-PCI -14.0±4.7%, P = 0.64). LVEF, LVEDV and LVESV did not change significantly during follow-up in both successful and failed groups. Successful PCI for CTO improved LV function, assessed by LV GLS."
https://openalex.org/W2950633392,"During the third trimester of development, the human fetus accumulates fat, an important energy reservoir during the early postnatal period. The fetal liver, perfused by the nutrient-rich and well-oxygenated blood coming directly from the placenta, is assumed to play a central role in these processes. Earlier studies have linked fetal liver blood flow with maternal nutritional status and response to the maternal oral glucose tolerance test. Our aim was to explore the effect of a regular maternal meal on fetal liver blood flow at two timepoints during the third trimester, representing the start and towards the end of the fetal fat accretion period. We also sought to explore the influence of prepregancy body mass index on how the maternal meal affects fetal liver blood flow.Using ultrasound Doppler, we examined 108 healthy women with singleton pregnancies in gestational weeks 30 and 36. At each visit, the first examination was performed with the participant in a fasting state at 08.30 a.m., followed by a standard breakfast meal of approximately 400 kcal. The examination was repeated after 105 minutes. Umbilical vein and ductus venosus blood flow was estimated from diameter and blood flow velocity measurements. Fetal liver flow was calculated as umbilical vein flow minus ductus venosus flow, and change in liver blood flow as flow after minus before the meal. The total group was divided into a normal-weight group (prepregancy body mass index 18.5-25.0 kg/m2; n = 83) and an overweight group (prepregancy body mass index >25.0 kg/m2; n = 21). Four women with prepregancy body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 were excluded from these analyses. Non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests were used for group comparisons.For the total group, we observed a significant increase in median (10th - 90th percentile) liver flow 28.9 (‒67.9-111.6) ml/min (p = 0.002) following the meal in week 36, but not in week 30, ‒2.63 (‒53.2-65.0) ml/min (p = 0.91). This result in turn yielded a statistically significant increase in delta liver flow from weeks 30 to 36 of 26.0 (‒107.1-146.6) ml/min (p = 0.008). The increase in postprandial liver flow was observed only in the normal-weight group in week 36. Accordingly, the delta liver flow values between the two weight groups were significantly different in week 36 (p = 0.006) but not in week 30 (p = 0.155). Among the normal-weight women, the increase in delta liver blood flow from weeks 30 to 36 was 39.3 (‒83.0-156.1) ml/min (p<0.001); in contrast, we observed no statistically significant change in the overweight group (‒44.5 (‒229.0-123.2) ml/min; p = 0.073). As a substitute for liver size, we divided the delta liver flow values by abdominal circumference and found no changes in the statistical significance results within or between the two weight groups.In our healthy study population, we observed a statistically significant difference in liver blood flow after maternal intake of a regular meal. This effect depended on gestational age and maternal prepregancy body mass index, but apparently was independent of liver size, based on abdominal circumference as a proxy measure."
https://openalex.org/W2950201963,"Human telomerase maintains genome stability by adding telomeric repeats to the ends of linear chromosomes. Although previous studies have revealed profound insights into telomerase functions, the low cellular abundance of functional telomerase and the difficulties in quantifying its activity leave its thermodynamic and kinetic properties only partially characterized. Employing a stable cell line overexpressing both the human telomerase RNA component and the N-terminally biotinylated human telomerase reverse transcriptase and using a newly developed method to count individual extension products, we demonstrate here that human telomerase holoenzymes contain fast- and slow-acting catalytic sites. Surprisingly, both active sites became inactive after two consecutive rounds of catalysis, named single-run catalysis. The fast active sites turned off ∼40-fold quicker than the slow ones and exhibited higher affinities to DNA substrates. In a dimeric enzyme, the two active sites work in tandem, with the faster site functioning before the slower one, and in the monomeric enzyme, the active sites also perform single-run catalysis. Interestingly, inactive enzymes could be reactivated by intracellular telomerase-activating factors (iTAFs) from multiple cell types. We conclude that the single-run catalysis and the iTAF-triggered reactivation serve as an unprecedented control circuit for dynamic regulation of telomerase. They endow native telomerase holoenzymes with the ability to match their total number of active sites to the number of telomeres they extend. We propose that the exquisite kinetic control of telomerase activity may play important roles in both cell division and cell aging.

https://openalex.org/W2951383188,"Animal and plant species often face multiple threats simultaneously. We explored the relative impact of three major threats on populations of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox. This species was once widely distributed across the southern San Joaquin Valley, California, USA, but agriculture and urban development have replaced much of its natural habitat. We modeled impacts of climate change, land-use change, and rodenticide exposure on kit fox populations using a spatially explicit, individual-based population model from 2000 to 2050 for the Central Valley, California. Our study indicates that land-use change will likely have the largest impact on kit fox populations. Land development has the potential to decrease populations by approximately 15% under a compact growth scenario in which projected population increases are accommodated within existing urban areas, and 17% under a business-as-usual scenario in which future population growth increases the developed area around urban centers. Plausible scenarios for exposure to pesticides suggest a reduction in kit fox populations by approximately 13%. By contrast, climate change has the potential to ameliorate some of these impacts. Climate-change induced vegetation shifts have the potential to increase total available kit fox habitat and could drive population increases of up to 7%. These vegetation shifts could also reduce movement barriers and create opportunities for hybridization between the endangered San Joaquin kit fox and the more widely distributed desert kit fox, found in the Mojave Desert. In contrast to these beneficial impacts, increasing climate extremes raise the probability of the kit fox population dropping below critical levels. Taken together, these results paint a complex picture of how an at-risk species is likely to respond to multiple threats."
https://openalex.org/W2949621712,"To investigate the emotional conflict processing during the processing of emotional stimuli in individuals with different levels of social adjustment through developing an event-related potential (ERP) method, the study used positive words (happy), negative words (disgusted), positive faces and negative faces as experimental materials for a face-word Stroop emotional conflict task, which was completed by 34 participants. For the N2 component, there was a significant difference between the high and low social adjustment groups for the congruent condition; the low social adjustment group evoked more negative amplitude under the congruent condition. Under the incongruent condition, there was a marginally significant difference between the high and low social adjustment groups; the low social adjustment group evoked more negative amplitude under the incongruent condition. For the SP component, there were no significant differences for both the high and low social adjustment group between the congruent and incongruent conditions of emotional conflict. However, within the low social adjustment group, the incongruent evoked more positive amplitude. Our findings indicate that the difference in the emotional conflict process between individuals with high and low social adjustment mainly lies in the early processing stages of emotional information. That is, for both congruent and incongruent emotional stimuli, individuals with high social adjustment showed better emotional conflict monitoring, used less cognitive resources, and had a higher degree of automated processing than those with low social adjustment. During the later stages of emotional conflict processing, individuals with low social adjustment showed poorer conflict processing."
https://openalex.org/W2952082334,"Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is routinely conducted for DNA quantitative analysis using the cycle-threshold (Ct) method, which assumes uniform/optimum template amplification. In practice, amplification efficiencies vary from cycle to cycle in a PCR reaction, and often decline as the amplification proceeds, which results in substantial errors in measurement. This study reveals the cumulative error for quantification of initial template amounts, due to the difference between the assumed perfect amplification efficiency and actual one in each amplification cycle. The novel CyC* method involves determination of both the earliest amplification cycle detectable above background (“outlier” C*) and the amplification efficiency over the cycle range from C* to the next two amplification cycles; subsequent analysis allows the calculation of initial template amount with minimal cumulative error. Simulation tests indicated that the CyC* method resulted in significantly less variation in the predicted initial DNA level represented as fluorescence intensity F0 when the outlier cycle C* was advanced to an earlier cycle. Performance comparison revealed that CyC* was better than the majority of 13 established qPCR data analysis methods in terms of bias, linearity, reproducibility, and resolution. Actual PCR test also suggested that relative expression levels of nine genes in tea leaves obtained using CyC* were much closer to the real value than those obtained with the conventional 2-ΔΔCt method. Our data indicated that increasing the input of initial template was effective in advancing emergence of the earliest amplification cycle among the tested variants. A computer program (CyC* method) was compiled to perform the data processing. This novel method can minimize cumulative error over the amplification process, and thus, can improve qPCR analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2966923827,"The Notch receptor is a key mediator of developmental programs and cell-fate decisions. Imbalanced Notch signaling leads to developmental disorders and cancer. To fully characterize the Notch signaling pathway and exploit it in novel therapeutic interventions, a comprehensive view on the regulation and requirements of Notch signaling is needed. Notch is regulated at different levels, ranging from ligand binding, stability to endocytosis. Using an array of different techniques, including reporter gene assays, immunocytochemistry, and ChIP-qPCR we show here, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, regulation of Notch signaling at the level of the nuclear pore. We found that the nuclear pore protein Nup214 (nucleoporin 214) and its interaction partner Nup88 negatively regulate Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, loss of Nup88/214 inhibited nuclear export of recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin κJ region (RBP-J), the DNA-binding component of the Notch pathway. This inhibition increased binding of RBP-J to its cognate promoter regions, resulting in increased downstream Notch signaling. Interestingly, we also found that NUP214 fusion proteins, causative for certain cases of T-cell acute lymphatic leukemia, potentially contribute to tumorigenesis via a Notch-dependent mechanism. In summary, the nuclear pore components Nup88/214 suppress Notch signaling in vitro, and in zebrafish, nuclear RBP-J levels are rate-limiting factors for Notch signaling in mammalian cells, and regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of RBP-J may contribute to fine-tuning Notch activity in cells.

Notch in T-ALL: new players in a complex disease.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32 (21775206): 434-44210.1016/j.it.2011.06.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Belver L.

We here identified Nup88 and Nup214 as novel negative regulators of Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo. Nup88/214 negatively regulates the Notch co-factor RBP-J by decreasing its nuclear levels, thus reducing NICD-dependent transcription. T-ALL–associated Nup214 fusion proteins phenocopied a loss of Nup214 and up-regulated Notch, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis. Here we describe a novel role for the nuclear pore components Nup88 and Nup214 in Notch signaling. Using a constitutively active Notch (NotchΔE) tagged with EGFP (31Huenniger K. Krämer A. Soom M. Chang I. Köhler M. Depping R. Kehlenbach R.H. Kaether C. Notch1 signaling is mediated by importins α 3, 4, and 7.Cell Mol.

Surprisingly, siRNAs against Nup214 did not change trafficking of NotchΔE/NICD-EGPF but increased Notch signaling. To further get insights into the mechanism, we transfected human cells with siRNAs against Nup214 and a luciferase-based Notch reporter with 12× CSL-binding sites (31Huenniger K. Krämer A. Soom M. Chang I. Köhler M. Depping R. Kehlenbach R.H. Kaether C. Notch1 signaling is mediated by importins α 3, 4, and 7.Cell Mol.

Stability of Nup214 depends on its binding partner Nup88 (32Fornerod M. van Deursen J. van Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G. The human homologue of yeast CRM1 is in a dynamic subcomplex with CAN/Nup214 and a novel nuclear pore component Nup88.EMBO J. 1997; 16 (9049309): 807-81610.1093/emboj/16.4.807Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), therefore knockdown (KD) of Nup88 was also tested. KD of either Nup strongly induced Notch signaling, whereas the KD of an unrelated Nup, Nup358, had only a small effect (Fig. 1A). The induction of Notch signaling upon KD of Nup88 or Nup214 was blocked by the γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) DAPT (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the KD affects canonical NICD- and CSL/RBP-J–mediated Notch signaling. All siRNAs specifically down-regulated their targets (Fig. 1B, additional siRNA against Nup214 was tested in Fig. S3, C and D). The KD of Nup88 influenced protein levels of Nup214 and vice versa, as published before (28Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. Nup214 is required for CRM1-dependent nuclear protein export in vivo.Mol. Cell.

Fig. 1C demonstrates that KD of Nup88 or Nup214 did not lead to general nuclear pore collapse, as indicated by staining with an anti–FG-repeat antibody (Mab414). Because both KDs of Nup88 and Nup214 had the same effect, because of the mutual dependence, we focused on Nup214. We transfected increasing amounts of Nup214 siRNA and measured mRNA expression of Nup214 and a canonical Notch target, HES1 (34Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Two mammalian helix–loop–helix factors structurally related to Drosophila hairy and enhancer of split.Genes Dev. 1992; 6 (1340473): 2620-263410.1101/gad.6.12b.2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows a dose-dependent KD of Nup214 mRNA and a concomitant HES1 up-regulation. Nup214 plays a role in CRM1-mediated nuclear export (27Bernad R. Engelsma D. Sanderson H. Pickersgill H.

We therefore tested whether CRM1-mediated nuclear export is involved and inhibited this transport pathway by the selective CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) (35Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Leptomycin B inhibition of signal-mediated nuclear export by direct binding to CRM1.Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242 (9683540): 540-54710.1006/excr.1998.4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Incubation of PC3 cells with LMB resulted in a similar, GSI-sensitive up-regulation of Notch signaling as the KD of Nup214 (Fig. 1E). The effects are not cell type–specific, because KD of Nup214 induced Notch signaling also in the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (Fig. 1, F and G). Together these results suggest that the CRM1–Nup214 axis is involved in regulating Notch signaling. The CSL-luciferase assay in PC3 cells measured endogenous Notch signaling activity, but not its physiological consequences. We therefore analyzed the differentiation of C2C12 cells with or without KD of Nup214. Upon serum withdrawal, these cells differentiate into myotubes, and this differentiation is prevented by Notch signaling (36Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. The intracellular domain of mouse Notch: a constitutively activated repressor of myogenesis directed at the basic helix–loop–helix region of MyoD.Development. 1994; 120 (7956819): 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KD of Nup214 inhibited proliferation of C2C12 cells (1.7-fold proliferation after 2 days in siControl-treated cells, −0.9-fold in siNup214 treated cells, n = 3 experiments), confirming earlier findings in HeLa cells (28Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. Nup214 is required for CRM1-dependent nuclear protein export in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26 (16943420): 6772-678510.1128/MCB.00342-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition KD of Nup214 delayed or reduced differentiation of C2C12 cells (Fig. 2A) as measured by the ratio of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) positive cells to total cells (Fig. 2B), the fusion index (not shown) and a reduction on MyHC protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D). Differentiation could be rescued by additional KD of Hes1, a major Notch downstream gene in myogenesis (37Kuroda K. Tani S. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Kurooka H. Honjo T. Delta-induced Notch signaling mediated by RBP-J inhibits MyoD expression and myogenesis.J. Biol.

Wolf J. et al.Oscillations of MyoD and Hes1 proteins regulate the maintenance of activated muscle stem cells.Genes Dev. 2019; 33 (30862660): 524-53510.1101/gad.322818.118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that the differentiation block by KD of Nup214 was mediated via Notch signaling (Fig. 2, A–D). Taken together, the data suggested that KD of Nup214 prevented differentiation of C2C12 cells by increasing Notch signaling. To analyze the role of Nup214 in vivo, we used zebrafish. In zebrafish, Notch signaling is involved in differentiation of many tissues, for example in notochord formation, somitogenesis, and hypochord specification (39Latimer A.J. Appel B. Notch signaling regulates midline cell specification and proliferation in zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2006; 298 (16876779): 392-40210.1016/j.ydbio.2006.05.039Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RT-PCR for the single zebrafish nup214 orthologue demonstrated that nup214 mRNA is maternally supplied to the zygote and that nup214 is strongly expressed in early stages of development (Fig. 3A). In situ hybridization confirmed the expression in early stages. After 17 h postfertilization and even more pronounced after 24 h postfertilization, nup214 displayed an increased tissue-specific expression pattern with strongest expression in the developing brain (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, in adult zebrafish nup214 expression is restricted to a number of tissues like ovary, brain, kidney, and gills (Fig. 3, C and D). In the ovary, nup214 is expressed in oocytes of early stages, whereas in maturing oocytes nup214 message is localized in a stripe-like subcortical domain (Fig. 3D). Such asymmetrical localization was also observed for other maternally supplied mRNAs like notch (40Bally-Cuif L. Schatz W.J. Ho R.K. Characterization of the zebrafish Orb/CPEB-related RNA binding protein and localization of maternal components in the zebrafish oocyte.Mech. Dev. 1998; 77 (9784598): 31-4710.1016/S0925-4773(98)00109-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of note, in Arabidopsis, the only other organism for which we found a tissue expressing study, the Nup214 orthologue LNO1 is also highly expressed in reproductive tissue and very low in vegetative tissue (41Braud C. Zheng W. Xiao W. LONO1 encoding a nucleoporin is required for embryogenesis and seed viability in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2012; 160 (22898497): 823-83610.1104/pp.112.202192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To address the function of nup214 in zebrafish development, we performed a morpholino (MO) based knockdown approach. RT-PCR analysis showed that injection of a MO targeting the splice donor site of exon 4 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of correctly spliced nup214 mRNA (Fig. 3E). To directly assess whether nup214 KD causes up-regulation of Notch activity in zebrafish, we analyzed the expression of col2a1a by in situ hybridization. Normally, col2a1a expressing cells are confined to a single cell layer in the trunk hypochord and floorplate of zebrafish embryos. After injection of the nup214 splice MO, col2a1a is expressed now also in the area of the trunk notochord (Fig. 3F, compare line scans of both conditions). As shown before (39Latimer A.J. Appel B. Notch signaling regulates midline cell specification and proliferation in zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2006; 298 (16876779): 392-40210.1016/j.ydbio.2006.05.039Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this expansion into the notochord area is a clear indication of Notch activation. The knockdown effect was validated using a second nup214 MO that targets the 5′ UTR, interfering with translation (ATG MO; Fig. 3E). Injection of the ATG-MO dose-dependently induced the same expansion into the notochord as seen with the splice morpholino (Fig. S1). These data strongly suggested that Nup214 functions as a negative regulator of Notch signaling also in vivo during zebrafish development. To further substantiate the in vivo data we analyzed an additional target of Notch, her4 (42Takke C. Dornseifer P. v Weizsäcker E. Campos-Ortega J.A. her4, a zebrafish homologue of the Drosophila neurogenic gene E(spl), is a target of NOTCH signalling.Development. 1999; 126 (10101116): 1811-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of the splice MO against Nup214 induced an up-regulation of her4, suggestive of an increased Notch signaling (Fig. S2). Together, these data demonstrate that Nup88/214 negatively regulate Notch activity and, as LMB treatment has a similar effect, raise the intriguing possibility that Nup88/214 is involved in nuclear export of a Notch activator. KD of Nup88/214 (or LMB treatment) keeps this putative activator in the nucleus, resulting in increased Notch signaling. An essential component of canonical Notch signaling is the DNA-binding factor RBP-J (CSL), which together with NICD forms the co-activator complex that drives Notch-dependent transcription (43Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Physical interaction between a novel domain of the receptor Notch and the transcription factor RBP-Jκ/Su(H).Curr. Biol. 1995; 5 (8749394): 1416-142310.1016/S0960-9822(95)00279-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To test whether Nup214 is involved in RBP-J trafficking and whether this affects Notch-signaling, we used RBP-VP16, a RBP-J mutant that drives RBP-J/CSL-promoter genes independently of NICD (44Waltzer L. Bourillot P.Y. Sergeant A. Manet E. RBP-Jκ repression activity is mediated by a co-repressor and antagonized by the Epstein–Barr virus transcription factor EBNA2.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23 (8559649): 4939-494510.1093/nar/23.24.4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfection of RBP-VP16 in the presence or absence of GSI showed that it indeed induced transcription of a CSL-based luciferase reporter independent of NICD (Fig. 4A). KD of Nup214 further increased luciferase expression more than 3-fold, suggesting that Nup214 is directly or indirectly involved in nuclear trafficking of RBP-J. To visualize this trafficking, C2C12 cells were treated with or without Nup214 siRNA and processed for immunofluorescence detection of endogenous RBP-J (see Fig. S3 for characterization of antibody). Quantification demonstrated that KD of Nup214 significantly shifted the distribution of RBP-J toward the nucleus (Fig. 4, B and C) while not changing total RBP-J levels (Fig. 4D). More RBP-J in the nucleus does not necessarily mean more DNA binding, and not all RBP-J binding sites are dynamic (45Castel D. Mourikis P. Bartels S.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (23651858): 1059-107110.1101/gad.211912.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 46Wang H. Zang C. Taing L.

Bartels S.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (23651858): 1059-107110.1101/gad.211912.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and analyzed known RBP-J binding sites in Notch target genes (45Castel D. Mourikis P. Bartels S.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27 (23651858): 1059-107110.1101/gad.211912.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) compared with control regions (Fig. 4E). KD of Nup214 increased RBP-J binding to Notch target genes, but not to control regions. Very similar results were obtained with a different RBP-J antibody (Fig. S4). Taken together, these data suggested that Nup214 negatively regulates Notch signaling by shuttling RBP-J out of the nucleus. KD of Nup214 increases the level of nuclear RBP-J and its binding to Notch target genes, thereby enhancing Notch activity. LMB inhibits CRM1-dependent nuclear export, a major export route for proteins and RNA (47Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. CRM1-mediated nuclear export: to the pore and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17 (17317185): 193-20110.1016/j.tcb.2007.02.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and Nup214 is involved in CRM1-dependent nuclear export (28Hutten S.

To test whether KD of Nup214 would cause inhibition of all CRM1-dependent export, we determined the localization of activation-induced deaminase (AID)–GFP, a known CRM1 substrate (48McBride K.M.

Methods In-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 adolescents (16 males; aged 14–17 years (Mage = 15.7)) who had taken part in one of two linked brief alcohol intervention trials based in 10 accident and emergency departments in England. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subject to thematic analysis. Results Research and intervention methods were generally found to be acceptable though confidentiality was important and parental presence could hinder truthful disclosures regarding alcohol use. Participants discussed the importance of being involved in research that was relevant to them and recognised alcohol consumption as a normative part of adolescence, highlighting the importance of having access to appropriate health information. Beyond this, they recognised the benefits and risks of trial participation for themselves and others with the majority showing a degree of altruism in considering longer term implications for others as well as themselves. Conclusions Alcohol screening and intervention in emergency care is both acceptable and relevant to adolescents but acceptability is reliant on confidentiality being assured and may be inhibited by parental presence.

https://openalex.org/W2949156254,"Numerous studies have shown that the serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor is implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of several psychiatric and neurological disorders. Furthermore, functional imaging studies in a variety of species have demonstrated that 4-(2´-Methoxyphenyl)-1-[2´-(N-2´´-pyridinyl)-p- [18F]fluorobenzamidoethylpiperazine ([18F]MPPF) is a valid and useful PET tracer to visualize the 5HT1A receptor. However, to our knowledge, [18F]MPPF has never been demonstrated in the canine brain. The ability to image the 5HT1A receptor with PET in dogs could improve diagnosis and therapy in both canine and human behavioural and neuropsychiatric disorders. To examine the potential use of [18F]MPPF in dogs, five healthy adult laboratory beagles underwent a 60-minutes dynamic PET scan with [18F]MPPF while arterial blood samples were taken. For each region of interest, total distribution volume (VT) and corresponding binding potential (BPND) were calculated using the 1-tissue compartment model (1-TC), 2-Tissue compartment model (2-TC) and Logan plot. The preferred model was chosen based on the goodness-of-fit, calculated with the Akaike information criterium (AIC). Subsequently, the BPND values of the preferred compartment model were compared with the estimated BPND values using three reference tissue models (RTMs): the 2-step simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2), the 2-parameter multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM2) and the Logan reference tissue model. According to the lower AIC values of the 2-TC model compared to the 1-TC in all ROIs, the 2-TC model showed a better fit. Calculating BPND using reference tissue modelling demonstrated high correlation with the BPND obtained by metabolite corrected plasma input 2-TC. This first-in-dog study indicates the results of a bolus injection with [18F]MPPF in dogs are consistent with the observations presented in the literature for other animal species and humans. Furthermore, for future experiments, compartmental modelling using invasive blood sampling could be replaced by RTMs, using the cerebellum as reference region."
https://openalex.org/W2951833926,"An RNA switch triggers biological functions by toggling between two conformations. RNA switches include bacterial riboswitches, where ligand binding can stabilize a bound structure. For RNAs with only one stable structure, structural prediction usually just requires a straightforward free energy minimization, but for an RNA switch, the prediction of a less stable alternative structure is often computationally costly and even problematic. The current sampling-clustering method predicts stable and alternative structures by partitioning structures sampled from the energy landscape into two clusters, but it is very time-consuming. Instead, we predict the alternative structure of an RNA switch from conditional probability calculations within the energy landscape. First, our method excludes base pairs related to the most stable structure in the energy landscape. Then, it detects stable stems (""seeds"") in the remaining landscape. Finally, it folds an alternative structure prediction around a seed. While having comparable riboswitch classification performance, the conditional-probability computations had fewer adjustable parameters, offered greater predictive flexibility, and were more than one thousand times faster than the sampling step alone in sampling-clustering predictions, the competing standard. Overall, the described approach helps traverse thermodynamically improbable energy landscapes to find biologically significant substructures and structures rapidly and effectively."
