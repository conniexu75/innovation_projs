https://openalex.org/W2005286637,"Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are mosquito-borne viral diseases. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN1, encoded by CD209), an attachment receptor of dengue virus, is essential for productive infection of dendritic cells. Here, we report strong association between a promoter variant of CD209, DCSIGN1-336, and risk of dengue fever compared with dengue hemorrhagic fever or population controls. The G allele of the variant DCSIGN1-336 was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in three independent cohorts from Thailand, with a carrier frequency of 4.7% in individuals with dengue fever compared with 22.4% in individuals with dengue hemorrhagic fever (odds ratio for risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever versus dengue fever: 5.84, P = 1.4 x 10(-7)) and 19.5% in controls (odds ratio for protection: 4.90, P = 2 x 10(-6)). This variant affects an Sp1-like binding site and transcriptional activity in vitro. These results indicate that CD209 has a crucial role in dengue pathogenesis, which discriminates between severe dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. This may have consequences for therapeutic and preventive strategies."

This reaction has been previously defined to follow second order kinetics, although variable product stoichiometry has been reported. In this study we have re-examined this reaction and found that under fully deoxygenated conditions the product stoichiometry is 1:1 (methemoglobin:nitrosylhemoglobin), and unexpectedly, the kinetics deviate substantially from a simple second order reaction and exhibit a sigmoidal profile. The kinetics of this reaction are consistent with an increase in reaction rate elicited by heme oxidation and iron-nitrosylation. In addition, conditions that favor the “R” conformation show an increased rate over conditions that favor the “T” conformation. The reactivity of nitrite with heme is clearly more complex than has been previously realized and is dependent upon the conformational state of the hemoglobin tetramer, suggesting that the nitrite reductase activity of hemoglobin is under allosteric control.

The reaction between nitrite and deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb 1The abbreviations used are: deoxyHb, deoxyhemoglobin; NO, nitric oxide; metHb, methemoglobin; HbNO, nitrosylhemoglobin; oxyHb, oxygenated hemoglobin; apoHb, apohemoglobin; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NEM, N-ethyl maleimide. or Hb[FeII]2+) generates methemoglobin (metHb or Hb[FeIII]3+) and nitrosylhemoglobin (HbNO or Hb[FeIINO]2+) (1Brooks J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1937; 123: 368-382Crossref Google Scholar) through the intermediacy of nitric oxide (NO) (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction has recently been invoked to explain nitrite-mediated effects on blood flow at rest and during exercise. At supra- and near-physiologic concentrations, nitrite produces increased blood flow in a dose-dependent fashion, regardless of NO synthase inhibition or metabolic demand (3Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A. Cannon III, R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HbNO production, formed from nitrite infusion, was shown to be inversely proportional to hemoglobin oxygen saturation (3Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A. Cannon III, R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). An important characteristic of nitrite is that HbNO formation only occurs with deoxyHb and not oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb or Hb[FeIIO2]2+), suggesting an oxygen-dependence to the NO-forming reaction. The reaction of nitrite with oxyHb occurs via a complex autocatalytic mechanism that has not yet been fully elucidated (4Kim-Shapiro D.B. Gladwin M.T. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The potential nitrite-reductase activity of deoxyHb has previously been invoked as a potential source of bioactive NO (5Reutov V.P. Sorokina E.G. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 874-884PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction between nitrite and deoxyHb was extensively examined by Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These investigators concluded that the reaction was second order and that the major products of the reaction were metHb and HbNO. Their observations were largely consistent with the reactions shown in Equations 1-4. As reaction 3 is extremely fast (k3 ∼ 4 × 107), the kinetics of the reaction are dictated by the second order reaction shown in Equation 2, which was calculated to have a rate constant of 1.23 × 104 m-1 s-1 (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction 4 represents a residual rate observed under basic conditions with a rate constant of 0.1 m-1 s-1. As the pKa of nitrite is 3.15, this gives an effective rate constant at pH 7.4 of ∼0.8 m-1 s-1. However, inconsistent with this mechanism, Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed a final reaction stoichiometry of 70% metHb and 30% HbNO, not the expected 1:1 ratio predicted by Equations 1-4 and previously observed by Brooks (1Brooks J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1937; 123: 368-382Crossref Google Scholar).

In contrast to the earlier study (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we concluded that although the initial rate of the reaction has a first order dependence on both nitrite and hemoglobin concentrations, the kinetics profile does not fit a second order/reaction but exhibits autocatalytic kinetics. In addition we found that under strictly anaerobic conditions the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1 (metHb to HbNO), but this can vary significantly if there is slight oxygen contamination or if oxygen diffuses into the reaction vessel during the time of measurement. Our data suggest that the only species present during the reaction are deoxyHb, metHb, HbNO, and a metHb nitrite adduct (metHB- NO2- or Hb[FeIIINO2]2+). MetHbNO (Hb[FeIIINO]3+), recently suggested to play a major role in this reaction (6Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Abernethy D.R. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46349-46356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), was not observed. We calculated a second order rate constant at pH 7.4 of 0.2-0.3 m-1 s-1 based on initial rates and have shown that this rate is increased in the presence of low concentrations of oxygen. We have also shown that the presence of metHb is able to accelerate the reaction and that the rate is increased by R state stabilizing agents and slowed by T state stabilizing agents, in a similar manner to the reduction of GSNO by deoxyhemoglobin (7Spencer N.Y. Patel N.K. Keszler A. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the nitrite reductase activity of hemoglobin is linked to the conformation state of the hemoglobin tetramer and is expected to occur at the greatest rate when partially oxygenated. This observation has implications for physiological autoregulation that occurs across a range of hemoglobin oxygen saturations (8Ross J.M. Fairchild H.M. Weldy J. Guyton A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1962; 202: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Materials—Hemoglobin was prepared from human blood by previously published methods (9Antonini E. Brunori M.

Gladwin M.T. Hogg N. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11303-11308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Apohemoglobin (apoHb) was prepared as previously described (9Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971: 1-11Google Scholar). 1-[2-(Carboxylato) pyrrolidin-1-yl] diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (PROLI/NO) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Spectrophotometric Determinations—Hemoglobin solutions in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm DTPA) were extensively degassed by vacuum/argon cycling in an air-tight sealed cuvette. An anaerobic solution of sodium nitrite was added, and the absorbance spectrum was obtained as a function of time. For most experiments a 1-cm path length cuvette was used; however, for experiments using 1 mm hemoglobin, a 1-mm path length cuvette was employed. Spectral data were deconvolved by multiple linear regression analysis using previously obtained spectra of the individual components. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Measurements—HbNO was measured by EPR using a Bruker EMX 10/12 spectrometer operating at 9.4 GHz, 5 G modulation, 10.1 milliwatt power, 81.9 ms time constant, and 83.9 s scan over 80 gauss. MetHb was measured similarly at low field using 15 G modulation. Kinetic Modeling—Kinetic schemes were modeled using Gepasi, available at www.gepasi.org (11Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and data fitting was accomplished using the multistart Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. The Reaction of Nitrite with DeoxyHb under Fully Deoxygenated Conditions—Upon incubation of deoxyHb with excess nitrite in a 1-cm path length cuvette, the spectral changes shown in Fig. 1A were observed. These changes are essentially identical to those observed by Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were attributed to the concomitant formation of HbNO and metHb. The spectra were analyzed by multiple linear regression using the basis spectra of deoxyHb, oxyHb, metHb, HbNO, metHbNO, and the metHb-nitrite adduct (Fig. 1B). OxyHb was included to test for the presence of oxygen contamination, which was less than 3% in all experiments. Regression analysis revealed the time course of each component (Fig. 1C) and gave a very good fit to the data at all time points (see residuals in Fig. 1D). Fig. 1C shows the time courses of the six hemoglobin species during the progression of the reaction and shows two major deviations from the data of Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, the yield of HbNO and metHb are approximately equal, suggesting that the stoichiometry of product formation is 1:1 as originally determined by Brooks (1Brooks J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1937; 123: 368-382Crossref Google Scholar) and not 7:3 as determined by Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over a range of nitrite concentrations from 0.25 to 1.75 mm the average product ratio of HbNO:metHb was 1.00 ± 0.05 (mean ± S.E., n = 9). Second, the time course of the decay of deoxyHb is not second order but is approximately linear (with some sigmoidicity) over at least the first half of the reaction, suggesting a more zero order dependence in deoxyHb. Importantly, the formation of metHbNO was not observed at any time during the course of the reaction. Removal of the spectrum of metHb-NO O2·¯ from the fit did not significantly alter the calculated concentrations of HbNO or total metHb (data not shown). All subsequent data were fitted using only the spectra of deoxyHb, oxyHb, metHb, HbNO. To confirm the reaction stoichiometry observed using regression analysis, the concentrations of metHb and HbNO were determined directly by EPR. Incubation of nitrite with deoxyHb resulted in the development of EPR spectra characteristic of the formation of both HbNO (in the g = 2 region, Fig. 2A) and metHb (in the g = 6 region, Fig. 2B). The average ratio of HbNO:metHb was 0.87 ± 0.24 (mean ± S.E., n = 8). As deoxyHb is EPR-silent, the formation of metHb and HbNO can be monitored by EPR against a high background concentration of deoxyHb (a condition where spectrophotometric observations are difficult). When hemoglobin was present in 10-fold excess of nitrite, although the ratio of metHb to HbNO remained 1:1 the kinetics of the reaction appeared first order with respect to nitrite (Fig. 2C). The Reaction of Nitrite with DeoxyHb in the Presence of Oxygen Contamination—As mentioned above, all experiments were performed with less than 3% contamination of oxyHb. Interestingly, in samples that contained a significant concentration of oxyHb (e.g. Fig. 3), the stoichiometry of product formation deviated from 1:1 (HbNO:metHb), and the time course exhibited a “more second order” appearance. This suggests that the discrepancy between our observations and those of Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may at least in part be attributable to the presence of oxygen that is either present initially or that diffuses into the cuvette during the slow time course of the reaction. It was also noticed that the presence of oxygen significantly increased the rate of deoxyHb decay, a critical observation that is discussed later in this report. Kinetic Analysis Based on Initial Rates—As the time course of deoxyHb decay in the presence of nitrite is complex, it was analyzed in terms of initial rate. A series of spectrophotometric experiments were performed to study the dependence of the initial rate on the concentration of reactants. The initial rate of deoxyHb consumption, derived from multiple linear regression fits, at constant (100 μm) hemoglobin concentration is plotted as a function of nitrite concentration in Fig. 4A. As can be seen, the initial rate exhibits a linear dependence in nitrite concentration under these conditions. Assuming that the initial rate depends on a bimolecular reaction between nitrite and Hb (as shown in Equation 5), d[deoxyHb]dt0=k5[deoxyHb]0[nitrite]0(Eq. 5) the value of k5 was determined to be 0.19 ± 0.01 m-1 s-1. When nitrite was kept constant at 500 μm and hemoglobin was varied, a plot of initial rate versus the concentration of Hb gave a rate constant of 0.23 ± 0.03 m-1 s-1 (Fig. 4B). The initial rate of Hb consumption at high (1 mm) initial concentration of deoxyHb (data not shown) gave a value for k5 of 0.29 ± 0.05 m-1 s-1. The close proximity of these three rate constants obtained under different conditions suggests strongly that the initial reaction rate is governed by a process that shows a linear, first order dependence in both hemoglobin and nitrite. However, the reaction deviates from this simple situation as time progresses. The Reaction of Nitrite with ApoHb—If the kinetics of the reaction were truly zero order, it would imply that the reaction rate is controlled by a species whose concentration does not change (i.e. a catalyst). In this reaction mixture, the only species that remains unchanged is the globin component of the protein. We therefore investigated whether the initial reaction involved a catalytic reaction between nitrite and apoHb. However, the presence of apoHb had no effect on the rate of deoxyHb decay (data not shown), suggesting that heme-nitrite interactions were essential for the observed reaction. Modulation of the Reaction Rate by Protein Conformation and Heme Oxidation State—Fig. 5 demonstrates that the rate of reaction of nitrite with deoxyHb is critically dependent on the conformational state of the protein. If the protein is modified with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) to stabilize the R conformation, the reaction proceeds at a significantly faster rate than if the reaction is performed in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, a stabilizer of the T conformation. Calculated rate constants from initial rate data are 0.40 ± 0.02 m-1 s-1 in the presence of NEM and 0.087 ± 0.005 m-1 s-1 in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate. This indicates that the reactivity of the heme toward nitrite can be modulated allosterically. This observation suggests a mechanism to explain the unusual kinetic profile of this reaction. If the modification of one subunit of tetrameric hemoglobin, either to the oxidized or nitrosylated form, alters the reactivity of the remaining subunits the reaction with nitrite will accelerates as a function of time. To test this we prepared a solution of hemoglobin that was partially oxidized by the addition of a substoichiometric amount of the NO donor PROLI/NO to oxygenated Hb. The use of a pure NO solution was avoided, as this will react before mixing is complete (12Zhang Y. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and will likely give a higher concentration of fully oxidized tetramer than is predicated by statistics. For comparison, a hemoglobin solution was prepared in which deoxyHb was mixed with tetrameric metHb. As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of randomly distributed metHb results in a faster reaction rate that the addition of an equivalent concentration of metHb tetramers. This suggests that the presence of one or more metHb subunits in a hemoglobin tetramer increases the rate of reaction between nitrite and the ferrous hemes of the same tetramer. It should be noted that in this experiment the metHb tetramer is added after deoxygenation to avoid the rapid dimer exchange that may occur upon the addition of metHb to oxyHb (13Marden M.C. Griffon N. Poyart C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Fig. 6The effect of metHb on the reaction between deoxyHb and nitrite. Hemolgobin (80 μm) was mixed with either metHb (20 μm) or sufficient PROLI/NO to generate metHb (20 μm). The solutions were fully deoxygenated and incubated with nitrite (200 μm), and 100 consecutive UV-vis spectra were obtained. The spectrophoteometric data were analyzed by multiple linear regression, and the rates of deoxyHb decay and metHb/HbNO formation were calculated. Data are typical of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic Models for the Reaction between Nitrite and DeoxyHb—The sigmoidal kinetics of the reaction between nitrite and deoxyHb indicate that the mechanism of reaction involves an element of autocatalysis. Two possible mechanisms that capture the seminal observations made in this study are discussed below in the context of the classically described conformational R and T states of the hemoglobin tetramer. Both models incorporate a step in which the oxidation or nitrosylation of one heme of a tetramer alters the reactivity of the associated hemes. In both these models we have used the symbol “S” to represent slow reacting (analogous to the T state) hemes and “F” to represent fast reacting (R state) hemes. (i) In the nitrate reductase model, the reaction of nitrite with a slow reacting heme (S), modeled as a second order reaction between nitrite and S, generates NO, metHb, and three fast reacting hemes (F, Equation 6). This is analogous to the symmetry model in which hybrids are forbidden. In addition, the binding of NO to a slow reacting heme to make HbNO, modeled as a second order reaction between NO and S, also generates three fast reacting hemes (Equation 7). The fast reacting hemes are also allowed to react with nitrite (Equation 8) and NO (Equation 9). The scheme is autocatalytic by virtue of the fact that Equation 8 followed by Equation 7 can be viewed as a sequence of reactions that is catalyzed by F and that generates an additional 2F. This model is simplistic in that it invokes a complete conversion of slow reacting to fast reacting hemes upon oxidation or nitrosylation of a single subunit. 4S+nitrite→3F+NO+metHb(Eq. 6) 4S+NO→3F+HbNO(Eq. 7) F+nitrite→NO+metHb(Eq. 8) F+NO→HbNO(Eq. 9) (ii) The nitrite anhydrase model departs from the reaction presented by Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that the initial reaction involves the conversion of nitrite to N2O3, perhaps as a result of “local acidity” in the heme pocket (14Robinson J. Giles G. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 37: 88-89Google Scholar). This model suggests that hemoglobin acts as a true catalyst to generate N2O3 (Equations 10 and 11), which is known to dissociate into NO and NO2 (Equation 12). As in the first model, the reaction of NO with a tetramer of slow hemes generates HbNO and three fast hemes (Equation 13), but now NO2 is the oxidant that causes metHb formation (Equation 14). Fast hemes are allowed the same reactions as slow hemes (Equations 15-18). This reaction scheme is autocatalytic if the fast hemes are more efficient catalysts than slow hemes.

For Model 1 (Fig. 7A), k7 and k9 were fixed at 4 × 107 m-1 s-1 and k6 and k8 were allowed to vary. The average value of k6 and k8 were 6.45 × 10-2 ± 1.24 × 10-2 m-1 s-1 and 0.640 ± 0.089 m-1 s-1, respectively, indicating a rate acceleration of an order of magnitude. This suggests that deoxygenated hemoglobin in the R state will react with nitrite ∼ 10-fold faster than in the T state. For Model 2, (Fig. 7B), the derived rate constants are shown in Table I and indicate a tight binding of nitrite to heme in both S and F forms.Table IDerived kinetic parameters from the fits of kinetic models to deoxyHb decay in the presence of nitriteNitrite reductase modelNitrite anhydrase model[Nitrite] > [Hb][Nitrite] ≤ [Hb][Nitrite] > [Hb][Nitrite] ≤ [Hb]k60.064 ± 0.024 m−1 s−10.056 ± 0.012 m−1 s−1k1081.5 ± 49.6 m−1 s−140 ± 32 m−1 s−1k7aThese values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.4 × 107 m−1 s−14 × 107 m−1 s−1k−100.006 ± 0.004 m−1 s−10.049 ± 0.079 m−1 s−1k80.640 ± 0.18 m−1 s−10.580 ± 0.19 m−1 s−1k110.23 ± 0.1 m−1 s−11.53 ± 1.22 m−1 s−1k9aThese values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.4 × 107 m−1 s−14 × 107 m−1 s−1k12aThese values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.1 × 105 s−11 × 105 s−1k−12aThese values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.1.1 × 109 m−1 s−11.1 × 109 m−1 s−1k13, k18aThese values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.4 × 107 m−1 s−14 × 107 m−1 s−1k14, k17aThese values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.1 × 109 m−1 s−11 × 109 m−1 s−1k151.22 ± 0.19 m−1 s−13.81 ± 2.07 m−1 s−1k−15(4.28 ± 8.24) × 10−5 m−1 s−1(5.1 ± 8.74) × 10−3 m−1 s−1k162.21 ± 0.05 m−1 s−14.75 ± 4.35 m−1 s−1a These values were not allowed to vary during the fitting procedure. Open table in a new tab In regimes where [hemoglobin] ≥ [nitrite], both models again provide good fits to the data (not shown). The derived rate constants for Model 1 are similar in both regimes, whereas the derived rate constants for Model 2 are widely variable and differ between the two regimes. These data indicate that Model 1 represents a better fit to the experimental data across the explored concentration range. Although Model 2 fits well to the data, a consistent set of rate constants cannot be found to account for the effect of reactant concentration on the kinetic profile. In this study we have reassessed the kinetics of the reaction between nitrite and deoxyHb and concluded that the product stoichiometry is 1 HbNO:1 metHb as originally determined (1Brooks J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1937; 123: 368-382Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the reaction time course does not fit to a second order reaction model as concluded by Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but exhibits a complex time course that initially has an almost zero order character when nitrite is in molar excess to deoxyHb. When hemoglobin is in large excess to nitrite, the stoichiometry remains 1:1, but the kinetics show a more conventional pseudo-first order profile. Closer scrutiny of the apparent zero order rate reveals that the rate of deoxyHb disappearance slightly increases as a function of time, giving the profile a sigmoidal shape typical of autocatalysis and suggestive of the cooperative behavior of oxygen binding. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the sigmoidal shape is a result of an allosteric conformational change in the protein tetramer leading to enhanced intratetramer deoxyheme reactivity. The most direct evidence is that NEM, a stabilizer of the R state of hemoglobin, accelerates the rate of reaction, whereas inositol hexaphosphate, a stabilizer of the T state, slows the reaction. Under fully deoxygenated conditions, NEM-treated hemoglobin has a significantly faster initial rate of reaction than control hemoglobin (0.40 versus 0.23 m-1 s-1, respectively), a fact which correlates well with the higher oxygen affinity of thiol-modified hemoglobins (16Vandegriff K.D. Bellelli A. Samaja M. Malavalli A. Brunori M. Winslow R.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this regard, the reaction between deoxyHb and nitrite mirrors the reactivity of deoxyHb with S-nitrosoglutathione, a nitrite thioester (17Spencer N.Y. Zeng H. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36562-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of low levels of oxygen, which will increase the population of R state hemes, also accelerates the rate of reaction. We examined whether the oxidation of hemes would have a similar effect and observed that randomly distributed, but not pure tetrameric, metHb enhanced the rate of reaction, strongly suggesting that the oxidation of a single heme of the protein tetramer enhances the reactivity of associated hemes. We have presented two possible models for the reaction of deoxyHb with nitrite. The first is an extension of the mechanism proposed by Doyle et al. (2Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but incorporating the fact that oxidation and nitrosylation of a heme can increase the rate of reaction of neighboring hemes. The second model incorporates the idea that the heme site represents a catalyst for nitrite dehydration to form dinitrogen trioxide (14Robinson J. Giles G. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 37: 88-89Google Scholar). This scheme would allow nitrosation chemistry to occur via the formation of dinitrogen trioxide. Although both of these models incorporate hemoglobin cooperativity, the former model provides a better fit to the experimental data at all tested concentration regimes, whereas with the latter model it was not possible to derive a consistent set of kinetic parameters across the initial concentration ranges. Consequently, we conclude that the nitrite reductase model more closely fits the observed data at all measured concentration regimes. Although, in the fully deoxygenated state, dimer formation is expected to be minimal and very slow (18Turner B.W. Pettigrew D.W. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 596-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the formation of a small percentage of mixed hemoglobin hybrids with significant T state character could occur during the time course of the nitrite reaction. Dimer formation and dimer exchange, which may occur in a matter of seconds in such a situation (19Kiger L. Marden M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), could affect the kinetic profile. This effect may be particularly apparent in partially oxygenated solutions and when NEM modification is used to stabilize the R state. The derived rate constants for the nitrite reductase model indicate that there is a factor of ∼10 difference between the slow and fast reacting hemes. This observation, imposed upon classical models of hemoglobin cooperativity, suggest that the R state hemes react with nitrite 10-fold faster than T state hemes. In addition, the nitrite reductase model gives a rate constant for the reaction of nitrite with T state hemoglobin of 0.064 m-1 s-1, remarkably close to our measured value of 0.087 m-1 s-1 for inositol hexaphosphate-treated Hb. The underlying basis of the conformation-dependent increase in rate is not clear but is likely associated with a change in heme-iron redox potential. It has been previously established that the heme iron is more easily oxidized in the R conformation compared with the T conformation (9Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971: 1-11Google Scholar, 20Faulkner K.M. Bonaventura C. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13604-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is also likely that the distal histidine residue (His-64) is involved in hydrogen bonding nitrite to the heme pocket (21Olson J.S. Foley E.W. Rogge C. Tsai A.L. Doyle M.P. Lemon D.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and also perhaps proton donation to nitrite to facilitate reduction, a heme pocket interaction analogous to the bacterial nitrite reductases (22Williams P.A. Fulop V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 23Einsle O. Kroneck P.M. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The net result of these observations will be that the nitrite/hemoglobin reaction will occur most rapidly in partially oxygenated solutions and the R3 form of hemoglobin (R state with 3 oxygen ligands and one vacant heme) is likely a major target for nitrite. The physiological consequence of this observation is that hemoglobin only needs to be partially deoxygenated before nitrite-dependent NO formation can occur. This agrees well with physiological data implying that nitrite/hemoglobin-dependent vessel relaxation correlates well with the p50 of the hemoglobin and begins to occur before the hemoglobin is fully deoxygenated (3Cosby K. Partovi K.S. Crawford J.H. Patel R.P. Reiter C.D. Martyr S. Yang B.K. Waclawiw M.A. Zalos G. Xu X. Huang K.T. Shields H. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Schechter A. Cannon III, R.O. Gladwin M.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). However, the issue of how nascent NO is able to escape the scavenging power of the red cell remains to be determined and represents an active area of investigation by our laboratories. Note Added in Proof—The absence of a Fe(III) NO species has also recently been reported by another group that conducted spectral analysis of kinetic absorption data (Luchsinger, B. P., Rich, E. N., Yan, Y., Williams, E. M., Stamler, J. S., and Singel, D. J. (2005) J. Inorg. Biochem. 99, 912–921). We thank V. Annavajjhala and Lanlan Lin for helpful laboratory assistance."

The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to yield Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL, two isoforms that have been associated, respectively, with the promotion and the prevention of apoptosis. We have investigated some of the elements and factors involved in the production of these two splice variants. Deletion mutagenesis using a human Bcl-x minigene identifies two regions in exon 2 that modulate Bcl-x 5′-splice site selection in human HeLa cells. One region (B3) is located upstream of the Bcl-xL 5′-splice site and enforces Bcl-xL production in cells and splicing extracts. The other region (B2) is located immediately downstream of the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS and favors Bcl-xS production in vivo and in vitro. A 30-nucleotide G-rich element (B2G) is responsible for the activity of the B2 element. We show that recombinant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F and H proteins bind to B2G, and mutating the G stretches abolishes binding. Moreover, the addition of hnRNP F to a HeLa extract improved the production of the Bcl-xS variant in a manner that was dependent on the integrity of the G stretches in B2G. Consistent with the in vitro results, small interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting hnRNP F and H decreased the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio of plasmid-derived and endogenously produced Bcl-x transcripts. Our results document a positive role for the hnRNP F/H proteins in the production of the proapoptotic regulator Bcl-xS.

Our results document a positive role for the hnRNP F/H proteins in the production of the proapoptotic regulator Bcl-xS. Alternative splicing is a powerful generator of proteomic diversity. It is estimated that as much as 74% of all human genes may use alternative splicing as part of their expression program (1Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z. Loerch P.M. Armour C.D. Santos R. Schadt E.E. Stoughton R. Shoemaker D.D. Science. 2003; 302: 2141-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In the most remarkable example to date, the Drosophila DSCAM gene can potentially yield more than 38,000 different isoforms by alternative splicing (2Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing has the potential to alter protein activity in many important ways. In some cases, the inclusion of sequences carrying a stop codon can trigger non-sense-mediated RNA decay, thereby down-regulating protein expression (3Lewis B.P. Green R.E. Brenner S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 4Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 91-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In other instances, alternative splicing yields protein variants with drastically different and sometimes antagonistic properties. This is the case with the Bcl-x pre-mRNA, which experiences alternative 5′-splice site utilization to produce the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein or the proapoptotic Bcl-xS isoform (5Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Bcl-x is a member of the large bcl-2 family of apoptotic genes. Bcl-x proteins modulate mitochondrial protein release, an event associated with the induction of programmed cell death. In a number of cancers and cancer cell lines, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL is increased, and the ratio of the splice variants is frequently shifted to favor production of Bcl-xL (6Tu Y. Renner S. Xu F. Fleishman A. Taylor J. Weisz J. Vescio R. Rettig M. Berenson J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Lichtenstein A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar, 7Reeve J.G. Xiong J.

The overexpression of Bcl-xL is associated with decreased apoptosis in cancer cells, increased risk of metastasis, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and poor clinical outcome (8Olopade O.I.

When cancer cells expressing high levels of Bcl-xL are treated with an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xL, splicing shifts toward the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS and cells undergo apoptosis (15Mercatante D.R. Mohler J.L. Kole R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49374-49382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although perturbations in alternative splicing have been observed in neoplasia and metastasis (16Philips A.V. Cooper T.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Nissim-Rafinia M. Kerem B.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg2003: 153-185Google Scholar), the identity of the factors that elicit these cancer-specific changes remains poorly documented. One study has uncovered that the progression from preneoplasia to metastasis in a mouse model of mammary tumors correlates with an increase in the abundance of specific SR proteins, a family of proteins involved in generic and alternative splicing (19Stickeler E. Kittrell F. Medina D. Berget S.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3574-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although changes in SR protein expression also correlate with changes in CD44 splicing (19Stickeler E. Kittrell F. Medina D. Berget S.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3574-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), alterations in SR proteins are likely to be only one of several alterations in the expression of splicing regulators during neoplasia and malignancy. For example, exclusion of the α-exon of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is controlled by intronic elements bound by the hnRNP 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; siF, siRNA targeting hnRNP F; siFH, siRNA targeting hnRNP F and H; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. I/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (20Jin W. Huang E.S. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28035-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein expression is increased in malignant glioblastomas (21Jin W. McCutcheon I.E. Fuller G.N. Huang E.S. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1221-1224PubMed Google Scholar). The situation with Bcl-x remains largely unexplored, and little is known about the processes that control Bcl-x alternative splicing in normal and cancer cells. A previous study in human adenocarcinoma A549 cells indicate that ceramide can shift the ratio of Bcl-x isoforms in favor of Bcl-xS (22Chalfant C.E. Rathman K. Pinkerman R.L. Wood R.E. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12587-12595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The activity of ceramide is antagonized by protein phosphatase-1 inhibitors, which are known to alter the phosphorylated state of SR proteins (23Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Two elements flanking the Bcl-xS 5′-splice site, a purine-rich and a pyrimidine-rich region, are required for both basal and ceramide-induced use of the Bcl-xS site (24Massiello A. Salas A. Pinkerman R.L. Roddy P. Roesser J.R. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15799-15804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the direct participation of trans-acting factors in the control of Bcl-x alternative splicing remains to be documented. We have begun to dissect the elements that control the alternative splicing of human Bcl-x. Our study identifies two elements that affect the basal Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS splicing ratio in human HeLa cells. Although the B3 element stimulates Bcl-xL production, the B2 element activates Bcl-xS splicing. We show that hnRNP F/H proteins mediate the activity of the B2 element in vitro and in vivo. Plasmid Constructs—The human Bcl-x gene was obtained from Bacpac Resources. The wild-type minigene used for in vitro splicing assays was created by the sequential PCR amplification of the 5′-portion of the Bcl-x present in the BAC clone RPC1-11-243J16 using primers h1 (CTCAGAGCAACCGGGAGCTGG) and h2 (CACTGGGCAGCTGGCAATTCT). This PCR fragment was cloned in pBluescript K+ linearized at the HincII site to generate pSB5. The 3′-portion of Bcl-x was amplified from the PAC clone RPC1-5-857M17 using primers b1 (ATTATCACCAATGGAGGGTCA) and b2 (TCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGA), and the resulting fragment was cloned in pSB5 linearized at the EcoRV site to generate pS2.13. pX2.13 was produced by cleaving pS2.13 with XhoI, treating with Klenow, and cutting with XbaI. The resulting Bcl-x fragment was then cloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) at the EcoRV and XbaI sites. More upstream portions of the Bcl-x gene were amplified from genomic DNA isolated from 293 cells. Amplification with primers Bx (GTCAGTCTCGAGCTTCAGAATC) and h4 (ATGCCTGATCTCTGAAGCACAG) yielded a fragment that was digested with HpaI and inserted into pX2.13 at the HpaI and Klenow-filled NheI site to yield pX2. pX1 was produced using the same strategy except that the upstream primer was Ex (TTATTACTCGAGGGAGGAGGAAGCAA-GCGAGG). pBcl-xΔB2 was produced by performing a PCR amplification on pS2.13 using primers Nc1 (GAGGTGATCCCCATGGCAGCAG) and Ac1 (ATATATGTCTACCATTCACTACC). The PCR fragment was digested with NcoI and AccI and substituted for the wild-type NcoI-AccI fragment in pS2.13. pBcl-xΔB3 was constructed using the same strategy using primers Ac2 (ATATATGTAGACCGGCGGCTGGGTA) and Hi1 (TCCAAGGAGTTAACCTCTTG). The PCR fragment was digested with AccI and HincII and substituted for the wild-type HincII-AccI fragment of pS2.13. The pX2.13ΔB2 and pX2.13ΔB3 were produced by inserting the XhoI-XbaI fragment of the pS2.13 derivatives into pcDNA 3.1+. To generate pS2.13ΔB2G, a PCR fragment amplified from pS2.13 by primers bH11 (CGCATTGTGGCCTTT) and ds2G (AACCTCTTGTGGTGAAAT) was substituted in pS2.13ΔB2 digested with AccI and HincII. pS2.13ΔB2.1 was produced from a PCR fragment amplified from pS2.13 using primers ds2.1 (CTCTCTGTCTACACCCCAGTTTAC) and NcI. The PCR fragment was substituted for the wild-type AccI-NcoI fragment in pS2.13. pS.13ΔB2.2 was similarly produced by amplifying a fragment from pS2.13 using primers ds2.2 (CACACAGTCTACCCGAAGGAGAA) and NcI. pS2.13ΔB2λ+/– were produced by isolating fragments from genomic λDNA obtained from an AvaII digestion and treated with Klenow. The DNA fragment of 73 bp (from positions 16611 to 16683 in the λ-genome) was isolated and inserted in both orientations (+ and –) into pS2.13ΔB2 digested with AccI. pS2.13ΔB3s was obtained from pBluescript K+ DNA digested with HinfI and treated with Klenow. The 65-bp-long DNA fragment was isolated and inserted into pS2.13ΔB3 digested with AccI and treated with Klenow. Overlap PCR mutagenesis was used to generate pS-Mut1 and pS-Mut2. For pS-Mut1, two PCRs were performed using primers containing the mutation. A first PCR was performed with the primers mut1 (GGGATGGGGTAAACTGCCGTCGCATTGTGGCCT) and Hi1 and a second PCR with primers Nc1 and mut1r (AGGCCACAATGCGACGGCAGTTTACCCCATCCC). The two PCR products were used as template for a third PCR round using the Nc1 and Hi1 primers. This PCR product containing the mutation was cut with NcoI and HincII and substituted for the wild-type NcoI-HincII fragment of pS2.13. For pS-Mut2, primers mut2 (GGGATGCCGTAAACTGCCGTCGCATTGTGGCCT) and mut2r (AGGCCACAATGCGACGGCAGTTTACGGCATCCC) were used. All plasmid constructs were extensively digested and sequenced to confirm their identity. Culture and Transfection of HeLa S3 Cells—HeLa S3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. For transfection, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm2 wells. Transfections were done using 1.5 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. For siRNA treatment, two successive applications of siRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies) at 80 nm using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) were carried out at a 24-h interval. The 20-nucleotide target sequences in hnRNP F and F/H were GCGACCGAGAACGACAUUU and GGAAGAAAUUGUUCAGUUC, respectively. The mismatched siRNA F/Hm contained the sequence GGAGGAGAUUGUUCAGUUC. Twenty-four hours after the last siRNA application, plasmid pX2.13 was transfected using Lipofectamine. RNA was extracted 24 h after the last transfection using TRIzol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was treated with DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C followed by a treatment of 5 min at 70 °C. One-tenth of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the OmniScript RT kit (Qiagen) at 37 °C for 1 h using random hexamers for monitoring the endogenous mRNAs and BT3 (GAAGGCACAGTCGAGGCTG) for plasmid-derived mRNAs. One-tenth of these reactions was used for PCR in a mixture containing 300 nm primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 80 μm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The primers used for endogenous amplification were BX3 (ATGGCAGCAGTAAAGCAAGCG) and BX2 (TCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGA) and BX3 and BT3 for plasmid-derived amplification. For ratio determination, the number of counts per minute in each band was counted directly by scanning the gel on an InstantImager (Canberra Packard). The background value was also established and subtracted from the counts per minute value of each band before calculating the ratio. In Vitro Transcription—Templates used for in vitro transcription were made from the above plasmids by PCR amplification using Pfu-Turbo (Stratagene) and primers bT3 (GACCATGATTACGCCAAGCG) and bc2b (CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC). PCR products were fractionated on agarose gels and purified using the QIAQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Pre-mRNAs used for in vitro splicing were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase (USB) in the presence of a cap analog and [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA was gel-purified as described (25Chabot B. Higgins S.J. Hanes B.D. RNA Processing, A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 1-29Google Scholar). In Vitro Splicing Assays—Two fmol of the various pre-mRNAs were incubated for 2 h in HeLa nuclear extracts (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) under standard conditions (27Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Purified total RNA was resuspended in sterile water. The reverse transcription step was performed using the equivalent of 10 amol of input pre-mRNA using Omniscript (Qiagen) with the bc2b primer and was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was followed by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following procedure: 95 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles at 93 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s (55 °C for the in vivo samples), and 72 °C for 30 s; and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Products were amplified using primers BX2 and BX3. Quantification was performed on an InstantImager, as described above. Production of the Recombinant hnRNP F/H Proteins—pET15b vectors containing the hnRNP F or hnRNP H cDNAs (generously provided by Doug Black, University of California, Los Angeles, CA) were digested using BamHI and XbaI, and the cDNA fragments were cloned into the pVL1392 vector. A baculovirus expression system (BD Biosciences) was used to express the recombinant proteins. The proteins were purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Qiagen). Insect cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication using the same buffer, and the extracts were loaded onto the nickel column. The columns were washed twice with the same buffer containing 10 mm imidazole and then washed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP. Samples were eluted with 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole and dialyzed against buffer D (60 mm HEPES, (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). Gel-shift Assays—RNA oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with the T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 3.5 μl of buffer D and 2.25 μl of splicing mix (1.4 mm riboATP, 9 mm MgCl2, 50 mm creatine phosphate, 7% polyvinyl alcohol, 5.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 units of RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences)) in the presence or the absence of 2.5 μm hnRNP proteins. 1.75 μl of dye containing 40 μg of heparin was added before loading the samples on a 5% native acrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in Tris-glycine buffer. Western Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared by sonication in Laemmli sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Total proteins or recombinant proteins were fractionated onto a 10% polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide)/SDS gel and transferred on a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols using either anti-hnRNP F or anti-hnRNP H antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000, and mixed with anti-hnRNP A1/A2 antibodies diluted 1:5000. The secondary antibody was a anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted to 1:5000. Cis-acting Elements Controlling 5′-Splice Site Selection in Bcl-x—As a first step toward the identification of elements involved in the control of 5′-splice site selection in human Bcl-x, we tested the effect of various deletions introduced in a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven Bcl-x minigene expressed in the human-transformed HeLa cell line. The Bcl-x minigene X1 was constructed by combining the upstream portion of the human gene with its downstream portion. Most of intron 2, which is greater than 55 kb, was left out for convenience (Fig. 1A). However, we kept the first 1.1 kb of intron 2, because this region contains sequences that are highly conserved between human and rodents. The first 110 nucleotides of intron 2 are actually coding and are used to produce the Bcl-xγ isoform (28Yang X.F. Weber G.F. Cantor H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Minigenes were transfected in HeLa cells, and the relative abundance of Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL mRNA isoforms was estimated by RT-PCR with one of the primers corresponding to plasmid-derived sequences (Fig. 1A). In contrast to endogenous Bcl-x expression, which predominantly produces the Bcl-xL mRNA variant in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, lane 2), the X1 minigene yielded considerably more of the Bcl-xS variant (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Although the Bcl-x splicing profile from the minigene did not mimic the splicing profile of the endogenous transcripts, we nevertheless proceeded with our analysis of deletions with the goal of identifying sequences in the minigene that would alter the xS/xL ratio. The additional removal of exon 1 and intron 1 did not change the splicing ratio (Fig. 1C, lane 3, minigene X2). Further removing the first half of exon 2 also did not significantly alter the xS/xL ratio (Fig. 1C, lane 4, X2.13). In different experiments, the endogenous Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio varied between 0.1 and 0.3, whereas the ratio from X2.13-derived transcripts varied between 2 and 8 (not shown). These variations in the Bcl-x splicing ratio are likely because of the status of the cells at the time of the experiment. We next tested two different exonic deletions in plasmid X2.13 (Fig. 1D). Each deletion had a strong but completely different impact on the relative abundance of the Bcl-x isoforms. The first deletion defined the B2 region, which occupies a 77-nucleotide portion downstream from the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS (position +11 to +87 relative to the Bcl-xS splice junction). The deletion of B2 completely abrogated the production of Bcl-xS (Fig. 1D, lane 3), suggesting the existence of an element that is essential for the use of the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS. In contrast, the deletion of the B3 region, which is located upstream of the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xL (position –10 to –95, relative to the Bcl-xL splice junction), completely eliminated the production of Bcl-xL (Fig. 1D, lane 4). The above results point to a role for specific exonic regions in controlling the ratio of the Bcl-x isoforms. However, because the deletions change the structure of the Bcl-xL mRNA without altering the structure of Bcl-xS mRNA, it is possible that the deletions differentially alter the stability of the plasmid-derived Bcl-x mRNAs. To assess more directly the impact of the B2 and B3 elements on splice site selection, we carried out splicing reactions in a HeLa nuclear extract. Pre-mRNA S2.13 and derivatives were produced and incubated in splicing extracts for 2 h. Although the efficiency of splicing for these large intron pre-mRNAs was satisfactory (∼5% of input pre-mRNA), the analysis of splicing products in conventional denaturing splicing gels was complicated by the production of large lariat molecules whose migration partially overlapped when some deletions were tested (not shown). To simplify analysis we relied on performing a RT-PCR assay to selectively amplify the mRNAs produced from the synthetic pre-mRNA substrates. The amplification results indicate that pre-mRNA S2.13 was spliced to produce predominantly Bcl-xL (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Although the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL splicing ratio of pre-mRNA S2.13 varied in different experiments and in different HeLa extracts, it consistently produced more of the Bcl-xL isoform (e.g. Fig. 2B, lane 2; Fig. 2C, lane 2; Fig. 3B, lane 2). In contrast, the B3 deletion was associated with a severe reduction in the relative abundance of the Bcl-xL product (Fig. 2A, lane 4, S2.13ΔB3), consistent with the in vivo splicing profile of X2.13ΔB3. The B2 deletion also reproduced the in vivo effect, resulting in no detectable Bcl-xS mRNA product (Fig. 2A, lane 3, S2.13ΔB2). To demonstrate that the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS remains functional in the ΔB2 construct, an antisense oligonucleotide (X5) complementary to the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xL was added to splicing mixtures. When pre-mRNA S2.13 was incubated with increasing concentrations of oligonucleotide X5, Bcl-xL production decreased to favor Bcl-xS (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–5). The X5 oligonucleotide mixed with the S2.13ΔB2 pre-mRNA also promoted the production of Bcl-xS, although the shift was less efficient at the lowest concentrations of X5 (Fig. 2B, lanes 6–9). The 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS was also activated when we mutated the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xL in the context of a ΔB2 deletion (data not shown). Thus, deleting the B2 region did not irreversibly inactivate the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xS. Moreover, the similar impact of the deletions on in vitro and in vivo Bcl-x splicing suggests that the B2 and B3 elements modulate 5′-splice site selection rather than mRNA stability.Fig. 3The first 30 nucleotides of the B2 element (B2G) enforce Bcl-xS production.A, sequence of the region separating the Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL 5′-splice sites and structure of the deletions tested in splicing.

The sequences deleted in ΔB2G, ΔB2.1, and ΔB2.2 are underlined. B, in vitro splicing assays of the deletion mutants. Pre-mRNAs S2.13 and derivatives were incubated in HeLa nuclear extracts for 2 h. RNA was extracted and submitted to RT-PCR amplification with a specific set of primers. The position of the amplified Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL products is indicated and the xS/xL ratio of the products is shown below the lane numbers. Lane 7 (t = 0) represents an amplification performed on a splicing mixture containing pre-mRNA S2.13 that was kept on ice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also asked whether the effect of the deletions on alternative splicing could be caused by the juxtaposition of more distal control elements in the vicinity of the Bcl-xS or Bcl-xL 5′-splice sites. To answer this question, we substituted the B2 and B3 elements for spacer sequences of similar length. Inserting two different spacers as a replacement for B2 maintained the deficiency in Bcl-xS production (Fig. 2C, compare S2.13 in lane 2 with S2.13ΔB2λ+ and S2.13ΔB2λ– in lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Likewise, substituting the B3 element for a spacer of identical length did not restore the predominant Bcl-xL production (Fig. 2C, lane 5). Thus, our results suggest that the B2 and B3 regions contain sequences that directly affect 5′-splice site selection. A Subregion of B2 Is Bound by hnRNP F and H Proteins—To investigate in more details the identity of the sequences and factors participating in the control of 5′-splice site selection in Bcl-x, we focused on the 77-nucleotide-long B2 element located immediately downstream of the Bcl-xS 5′-splice site. First, we produced pre-mRNAs containing deletions of the last 22 or 48 nucleotides of B2 (S2.13ΔB2.1 and S2.13ΔB2.2, respectively; see Fig. 3A). These substrates displayed an in vitro splicing profile that indicated an impairment in Bcl-xS production, although the Bcl-xS product was still detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). This result suggests that the 30-nucleotide portion located between positions + 10 and +39 (B2G) might make the largest contribution toward enforcing the use of the Bcl-xS 5′-splice site. Consistent with this view, a pre-mRNA substrate carrying a deletion of the B2G element yielded no Bcl-xS products (Fig. 3B, lane 4), a splicing profile identical to S2.13ΔB2 (lane 3). The +10 to +39 region contains the sequence CGGGAUGGGGUAAACUGGGGU (Fig. 3A). Similar G-rich sequences have been identified as signature binding sites for the hnRNP F and H proteins (29Jacquenet S.

https://openalex.org/W2083700541,"According to the World Cancer Report, skin cancer constitutes approximately 30% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the world, and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (particularly, its UVB component; 290-320 nm) is an established cause of approximately 90% of skin cancers. The available options have proven to be inadequate for the management of skin cancers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop mechanism-based novel approaches for prevention/therapy of skin cancer. In this study, we evaluated the chemopreventive effects of resveratrol against UVB radiation-mediated skin tumorigenesis in the SKH-1 hairless mouse model. For our studies, we used a UVB initiation-promotion protocol in which the control mice were subjected to chronic UVB exposure (180 mJ/cm2, twice weekly, for 28 weeks). The experimental animals received either a pretreatment (30 min before each UVB) or post-treatment (5 min after UVB) of resveratrol (25 or 50 micro mole/0.2 ml acetone/mouse). The mice were followed for skin tumorigenesis and were killed at 24 h after the last UVB exposure, for further studies. The topical application of skin with resveratrol (both pre- and post- treatment) resulted in a highly significant 1) inhibition in tumor incidence, and 2) delay in the onset of tumorigenesis. Interestingly, the post-treatment of resveratrol was found to impart equal protection than the pretreatment; suggesting that resveratrol-mediated responses may not be sunscreen effects. Because Survivin is a critical regulator of survival/death of cells, and its overexpression has been implicated in several cancers, we evaluated its involvement in chemoprevention of UVB-mediated skin carcinogenesis by resveratrol. Our data demonstrated a significant 1) up-regulation of Survivin (both at protein- and mRNA- levels), 2) up-regulation of phospho-Survivin protein, and 3) down-regulation of proapoptotic Smac/DIABLO protein in skin tumors; whereas treatment with resveratrol resulted in the attenuation of these responses. Our study also suggests that resveratrol enhanced apoptosis in UVB-exposure-mediated skin tumors. Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that 1) resveratrol imparts strong chemopreventive effects against UVB exposure-mediated skin carcinogenesis (relevant to human skin cancers), and 2) the chemopreventive effects of resveratrol may, at least in part, be mediated via modulations in Survivin and other associated events. On the basis of our work, it is conceivable to design resveratrol-containing emollient or patch, as well as sunscreen and skin-care products for prevention of skin cancer and other conditions, which are believed to be caused by UV radiation."

However, the identity and mechanisms whereby ancillary proteins are recruited by the AHRC to its cognate response element are still, largely, unknown. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying activated transcription by the AHRC is central to our understanding of development, physiological homeostasis, and the complex pathologies responsible for a wide spectrum of human diseases including chemical carcinogenesis and solid tumor growth.Like AHR, the estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand activated transcription factor. ER belongs to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (NR) (27Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

As with most NRs, ER is thought to manifest its main biological function by transducing the transcriptional information contained in its response elements. This has been questioned over the past decade by several independent findings. Investigators in Gunther Schutz's laboratory made the startling observation that DNA-binding/dimerization deficient glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mutant mice were viable (28Reichardt H.M.

Furthermore, the effects of endocrine disruptors and compounds that mimic the activities of endogenous estrogens affect not only ERE-regulated genes but also genes transrepressed by ER and the relative importance of each phenomenon has yet to be established.The mechanisms by which PAH/HAH repress ER signaling are well understood and are attributable to direct protein-protein interactions with liganded AHR and ER at the regulatory regions of ER target genes and non-transcriptional or downstream events. However, the mechanisms by which ER down-regulates aromatic hydrocarbon signaling remain unclear. Furthermore, the general mechanism in which NRs tether to other transcription factors and modulate their activities reveals another level of specificity of NR function. In this report, we provide evidence that ERα represses TCDD-inducible Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 transcription through direct protein-protein interactions with the AHRC in the regulatory regions of these genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Reagents—Polyclonal anti-ERα and CYP1A1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-AHR polyclonal antibody (SA-210) was purchased from Biomol. Affinity-purified anti-acetyl histone H4 (Lys12) was purchased form Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-ARNT polyclonal antibody was the gift of Dr. Oliver Hankinson. HEK-293 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in serum free α-minimal essential medium lacking phenol red with high glucose for at least 48 h prior to any treatment or experimental manipulation to ensure that unnecessary activation/down-regulation of ER or other signal transduction pathways would not confound any experimental parameters.GST Pull-down Assays and Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (18Kumar M.B. Perdew G.H. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286PubMed Google Scholar). Six-well plates containing 293 cells were transfected with 100 ng of the GAL4 upstream activating sequence reporter pG5E4T, CMV-β-Gal (100 ng), and either 200 ng of pGAL-AHR419–805 or pGAL-ARNT, with or without 200 ng of pG5-ERα. A total of 600 ng of DNA was used for each transfection using empty expression vector when necessary. Each transfection was achieved using 15 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Medium was changed 3 h after transfection, and cells were treated with 100 nm E2. Cells were harvested 16–20 h after transfection and assayed as described previously (17Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Prior to treatment with ligand MCF-7 cells were exposed to cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h to halt protein translation. Subsequently, cells where treated either with vehicle (Me2SO), 2 nm TCDD, 100 nm E2, or a combination of TCDD and E2 for 8 h. Cells were harvested in TRIzol, and total RNA was isolated and subjected to reverse transcription using a high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNAs were amplified by real-time PCR using a DyNAmo HS SYBR Green kit (Finnzymes) according to manufacturer's protocols. Oligonucleotide pairs used to amplify human cDNA sequences were: for Cyp1a1, 5′-TCTTCCTTCGTCCCCTTTAC-3′ and 5′-TGGTTGATCTGCCACTGGTT-3′ (forward and reverse, respectively); for Cyp1b1, 5′-CATGCGCTTCTCCAGCTTTGT-3′ and 5′-GGCCACTTCACTGGGTCATGA-3′; for pS2, 5′-AGTGGCCCCCCGTGAAAG-3′ and 5′-TCTGGAGGGACGTCGATGGT-3′; and for GAPDH, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATCAG-3′.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts of MCF-7 cells were used, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (17Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. After incubation with primary antibodies, blots were incubated with a biotin labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were washed and incubated with 125I-labeled strepavidin (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film overnight. Protein levels were quantified using a Cyclone phosphor imaging system and OptiQuant software.Single and Sequential Two-step ChIP Assays—Precipitations for ChIPs and re-ChIPs from fixed MCF-7 cell lysates were performed in quadruplicate. One sample from each set was chosen for analysis by single step chromatin immunoprecipitations, and these reactions were performed as described previously (23Beischlag T.V. Taylor R.T. Rose D.W.

For re-ChIP experiments, complexes from the primary ChIP were eluted in 50 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C, pooled, and precipitated with the indicated antibody.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrenatal, perinatal, as well as long term exposures to estrogens, xenoestrogens, and endocrine disruptors such as TCDD, put individuals at an increased risk of testicular, breast, and prostate cancers and developmental defects of the urogenital tract (36Imaida K.

Bar-Chama N. Smith E. Rauch M.E. Chapin R.E. Perreault S.D. Schrader S.M. Suk W.A. Landrigan P.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Foley S.

Subsequent studies continue to re-iterate these findings (40Ohlson C.G. Hardell L. Chemosphere. 2000; 40: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a result, cross-talk between AHR and NR pathways have been implicated but studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying AHR-NR cross-talk are scarce. Perhaps one of the most important and intriguing problems concerning the mechanism of NR function is how they moderate gene transcription in a DNA-binding-independent fashion.AHR and ARNT Interactions with ERα—Experiments employing GST-AHR/ARNT fusions were performed with radiolabeled in vitro translated 35S-labeled ERα. Consistent with the observations of other investigators (1Brunnberg S. Pettersson K. Rydin E. Matthews J. Hanberg A. Pongratz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Ohtake F. Takeyama K. Matsumoto T. Kitagawa H. Yamamoto Y. Nohara K. Tohyama C. Krust A. Mimura J. Chambon P. Yanagisawa J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kato S. Nature. 2003; 423: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) we were able to demonstrate an interaction between ERα and AHR or ARNT. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that the ERα interaction domain within AHR resides within the P/S/T region of the transactivation domain of AHR (Fig. 1A). GST fusion chimeras of Sp1 and VP16 failed to precipitate in vitro translated ERα.To test the hypothesis, that ER directly repressed AHRC via the P/S/T domain of AHR, we co-transfected HEK-293 cells with a CYP1A1 promoter-driven luciferase plasmid, pGUD-LUC, expression vectors encoding ERα, and wild-type human AHR, or a deletion mutant encoding human AHR deleted for its P/S/T domain. Cells were treated with vehicle or E2 or E2 in combination with TCDD overnight. Both wild-type AHR and AHRΔP/S/T were equally capable of activating transcription from pCYP-GudLuc in a TCDD-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). However, co-transfection of ERα in the presence of 100 nm E2 significantly diminished this activation in each instance (Fig. 1B).To determine whether ERα can repress either AHR, or ARNT transactivation function, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with expression cDNA plasmids encoding either GAL4-DNA-binding domain AHR carboxyl terminus or full-length ARNT and ERα the GAL4-driven luciferase vector, pG5E4T (Fig. 1C). Activated ERα enhanced the GAL4-DBD-AHR chimera harboring the P/S/T putative ERα interaction domain transactivation function significantly (Fig. 1D). However, transcriptional activity driven by the GAL4-ARNT chimera was significantly repressed. This suggests that ERα transduces its repressor function via its interaction with ARNT.GST pull-down and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between AHR and ER (2Ohtake F. Takeyama K. Matsumoto T. Kitagawa H. Yamamoto Y. Nohara K. Tohyama C. Krust A. Mimura J. Chambon P. Yanagisawa J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kato S.

Biophys. 2000; 373: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as well as ARNT and ER (1Brunnberg S. Pettersson K. Rydin E. Matthews J. Hanberg A. Pongratz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dominant negative studies have shown that the AHR transactivation domain and the N-terminal region of ER can reciprocally repress transcription from ERE- and DRE-driven luciferase constructs, respectively (42Reen R.K. Cadwallader A. Perdew G.H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TCDD exposure causes a robust increase in mRNA levels and of DRE-driven reporter gene activity, both of which are significantly decreased by co-treatment with E2 in Hepa-1 and MCF-7 cells (43Kharat I. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10533-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Likewise, in the human endometrial carcinoma cell line ECC-1, E2 again blocked DRE-driven luciferase activity as well as 7-ethoxycoumarin hydroxylation (44Ricci M.S. Toscano D.G. Toscano Jr., W.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This effect was reversed by the addition of the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (TAM). Despite a wealth of evidence suggesting that ER activation represses AHR target genes, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms involved. Furthermore, most experimental efforts to characterize the biochemical pathways involved in ER-AHR cross-talk have focused on the TCDD-inducible repression of ER target genes.ERα Represses TCDD-inducible Transcription—We made the observation that co-transfection of ERα with a Cyp1a1 promoter driven luciferase vector in Hepa1 cells treated with TCDD with or without E2 leads to E2-mediated repression of TCDD-dependent luciferase activity (42Reen R.K. Cadwallader A. Perdew G.H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have confirmed and extended these observations in HEK-293 cells and in an in vitro system. However, these systems cannot distinguish between direct transcriptional events at the target and secondary transcriptional events such as the transcriptional activation/repression of other regulatory genes. Therefore, to assess the direct transcriptional effect of ER activation on AHRC-dependent gene transcription, we employed reverse transcription/realtime PCR of the AHRC target genes Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 in the presence and absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. TCDD but not 100 nm E2 caused a significant increase in Cyp1a1 gene transcription in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). However, E2 (like TCDD, alone) caused a significant increase in Cyp1b1 gene transcription, consistent with reports that the 5′-regulatory region of the Cyp1b1 gene harbors an ERE (45Tsuchiya Y. Nakajima M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Inoue M. Yokoi T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3119-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The addition of 100 nm estradiol significantly reduced TCDD-induced Cyp1a1 gene transcription in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2, A and B) and significantly reduced Cyp1b1 transcription in the presence of cycloheximide. The observation that maximal Cyp1a1 gene induction was repressed by ∼50% in the absence or presence of cycloheximide suggests that both direct transcriptional repression of Cyp1a1 and not secondary E2 mediated downstream events are responsible for the repressive effects of estrogens on AHRC signaling. Furthermore, the E2-mediated decrease in Cyp1a1 mRNA production preceded a concomitant decrease in CYP1A1 protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D) in MCF-7 cells. The observed decrease in corrected CYP1A1 protein levels (∼42%) is consistent with the observed decrease in mRNA levels demonstrating that the observed repression of TCDD-inducible transcription by E2 can have an equally profound physiological outcome.Fig. 217β-Estradiol represses TCDD-inducible endogenous Cyp1a1 (A) and Cyp1b1 (B) transcription in MCF-7 cells. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml cylcoheximide (CHX) for 1 h prior to treatment with either E2 (100 nm) or TCDD (2 nm) or both for 7 h. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, and GAPDH cDNA were amplified by real-time PCR. A paired t test was performed on the indicated parameters: *, p < 0.001; **, p < 0/01. C, MCF-7 cells were treated with Me2SO (lane C), 100 nm 17β-estradiol (lane E2), 2 nm TCDD (lane T), or E2 and TCDD (lane E+T) together for 18 h. Whole cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and relative amounts of CYP1A1 and ARNT protein were assessed by Western blot analysis. D, CYP1A1 protein band intensity levels were normalized to that of ARNT and HSP86 with essentially identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ERα Associates with the Cyp1a1 Promoter in an AHRC-dependent Fashion—We employed the ChIP assay to ascertain the status of ERα at the Cyp1a1 enhancer in the presence and absence of E2 and TCDD. Initially, consistent with other investigators' observations, we observed the presence of AHR and ARNT over the human Cyp1a1 enhancer in a TCDD-dependent fashion (1Brunnberg S. Pettersson K. Rydin E.

ERα was greatly enriched at the Cyp1a1 enhancer only after treatment with a combination of 1 nm TCDD and 100 nm E2 (Fig. 3B). As a control, we monitored the presence of AHR, ARNT and ERα over the pS2 promoter under similar conditions (Fig. 3B) with results similar to those observed by other investigators (2Ohtake F.

Comparison of gene expression patterns from unsorted or isolated sorted bone cell populations at days 7 and 17 of calvarial cultures revealed an increased specificity regarding which genes are selectively expressed in a subset of bone cell types during differentiation. Furthermore, distinctly different patterns of gene expression associated with major signaling pathways (Igf1, Bmp, and Wnt) were observed at different levels of maturation.

From these studies, a generalized pattern of diminished cell proliferation followed by an increase in the expression of genes associated with bone matrix production has been observed. Progression of differentiation has also been associated with the suppression of genes that are required for differentiation into other cell lineages, including myocyte and adipocyte lineages (3Balint E.

Auberval M. Call K. Baron R. Bone. 2003; 32: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The major reason for this has to do with the limited number of cells within the culture that become mature osteoblasts, thereby representing only a small proportion of the total population. Therefore, when changes in gene expression are observed, it is never certain whether these changes occur in fully differentiated osteoblasts or other cell populations (7Roman-Roman S. Garcia T.

Bone. 2003; 32: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The heterogeneity of a primary bone cell culture can be appreciated when different promoter-GFP reporter constructs are used as visual surrogates for osteoblast differentiation. We have previously presented evidence that the GFP driven by a 3.6-kb Col1a1 promoter fragment (pOBCol3.6GFP, referred to as 3.6GFP) becomes visible when alkaline phosphatase-positive cell colonies are detected 5–7 days before the colonies develop into mineralizing multilayered nodules. In contrast, a 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter fragment driving GFP (pOBCol2.3GFP, referred to as 2.3GFP) remains inactive until the nodules begin to mineralize (8Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Based on these expression patterns we have associated the early expression of the 3.6GFP with cells reaching the preosteoblast level of differentiation, which continues during early osteoblast development, whereas the 2.3GFP expression represents a cell that has acquired the ability to form a mineralized matrix. Because the 2.3GFP-positive cells represent less than 15% of the total cell population of a well mineralized osteoblast culture, it is likely that a microarray study based on a heterogeneous cell mixture would not accurately represent the expression of a fully differentiated osteoblast (8Kalajzic I.

Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).This study was designed to contrast the pattern of gene expression of a mixed cell population with one in which two populations from the same sample are isolated based on their stage of differentiation. Mouse calvarial cultures at days 7 and 17 underwent microarray analysis either as a total cell population or as cells separated based on GFP expression. This study demonstrates the importance of using defined and relatively homogeneous cell populations to more completely understand the gene expression profile of cells at a particular stage of development.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Transgenic mice used in this study have been generated and characterized previously (8Kalajzic I.

Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2, and at 1 week of culture, differentiation was induced with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 4 mm β-glycerophosphate.Preparation of Cells for Sorting—7-Day-old cultures were digested using 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA for 5–10 min. Trypsin was inactivated by addition of DMEM, 10% FCS followed by centrifugation at +4 °C. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and filtered using a 70-μm strainer. Following a second centrifugation cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% FCS and filtered through a 45-μm filter. Cells grown for 17 days were digested using a 0.2% collagenase, 0.2% hyalouronidase, 2.5% trypsin. Enzymes were neutralized using DMEM, 10% FCS, and cells were centrifuged and prepared as described above. Cell sorting was done on a FACS Vantage (BD Biosciences) with excitation at 488 nm and 530/30 emission filter. Cells were separated using a 100-μm nozzle and collected into DMEM, 30% FCS media. Prior, during, and following sorting the cell suspensions were kept cold to minimize changes in gene expression.RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted using a TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and Northern blots were prepared using procedures described previously (8Kalajzic I.

Briefly, cRNA was prepared from 10 μg of total RNA. The RNA was denatured at 70 °C with T7-tagged oligo(dT) primers and then reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1 h. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized by adding DNA polymerase I, Escherichia coli DNA ligase, and RNase H, and incubation was carried out for 2 h at 16 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the synthesized cDNA was used for in vitro transcription using the BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences, New York, NY). Labeled cRNA was purified with RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and fragmented before hybridization (10 μg/chip).Affymetrix murine U74A, -B, and -C v2 oligo array cartridges were prehybridized at 45 °C for 10 min and hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C with 60 rpm rotation. After hybridization, the chips were washed and stained in a fluidics station using the antibody amplification protocol from Affymetrix and scanned using a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray scanner. The data were analyzed using GeneChip software MAS4 (Affymetrix). An intensity value and presence/absence call was derived from the hybridization signal for each gene to represent its expression level. Data were normalized with the slope of hybridization intensity of a control sample before comparison. The annotations of Affymetrix chip probe sets were derived from NetAffx (Affymetrix).We applied two statistical methods to select differentially expressed genes. 1) Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) orders the genes by using the modified t statistic and declares a gene to be up-regulated (down-regulated) if the observed modified t statistic is above (below) the global cutoff point (15Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9705) Google Scholar). This procedure allows estimation of the median of false discovery rates. In this study we selected the cutoff points to control this median to be at most 5%. 2) The semiparametric hierarchical (SPH) mixture model was developed by Newton et al. (16Newton M.A. Noueiry A. Sarkar D. Ahlquist P. Biostatistics. 2004; 5: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) to capture the complicated variations observed in microarray data. According to this method, we first estimated the shape parameter in the γ distribution by the moment method. Then we fit the mixture model by a nonparametric expectation and maximization algorithm. Posterior probabilities for the three hypotheses (un-regulated, up-regulated, down-regulated) were computed numerically for each gene. We ranked the genes according to the posterior probabilities for a hypothesis. To determine the cutoff point, a SPH mixture model controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) from the posterior probabilities. The expected FDR was computed by averaging mistake probabilities from the top to subsequent ones. The cutoff gene was selected when the expected FDR reached at most 5%.RESULTSIsolation of the GFP-positive (GFPpos) and GFP-negative (GFPneg) Cells from Primary Calvarial CultureCultures were established from GFP transgenic mice, and the onset of GFP expression during the osteoblast differentiation was obtained by fluorescent imaging. The 3.6GFP signal activates between day 4 and day 7 of culture (Fig. 1A) in forming colonies and associates with the onset of alkaline phosphatase staining (data not shown). The majority of these colonies will develop into bone nodules. Cells lacking the GFP signal are more prevalent at the periphery and between the developing colonies. At this time, FACS analysis shows that ∼30–40% of cells express the 3.6GFP transgene (Fig. 1C). Following induction of osteogenic differentiation (day 7), the culture develops multilayered nodules that will mineralize. By day 15–17 of culture, Ibsp and Bglap1, molecular markers of mature osteoblast differentiation, are expressed. At this time, about 10% of cells within the culture express the 2.3GFP transgene (Fig. 1, B and E), and these cells are restricted to the mineralizing nodules (Fig. 1B, arrows).GFPpos and GFPneg cells were separated by flow cytometry. FACS reanalysis was carried out on isolated cell populations demonstrating that the sorting process highly enriched GFPpos and GFPneg populations. For 3.6GFP, the percentage of positive cells increased from 30 to >97%, whereas 2.3GFP increased from 10 to >85% (Fig. 1, C–F).Prior to microarray analysis, Northern blot analysis was performed to verify the effectiveness of the sorting process and the quality of the RNA. Fig. 2 shows the presence of a strong GFP mRNA band in the 3.6GFPpos and 2.3GFPpos populations and its absence in the GFPneg population. The Northern blot demonstrated that expression of the type I collagen was similar in the 3.6GFPpos and 3.6GFPneg cells, but it was increased in the 2.3GFPpos and 2.3GFPneg population as well as in the day 17 unsorted population. Interestingly, the expression of Igf1, which showed no changes among sorted or unsorted cell types at day 7 of calvaria culture, was substantially reduced in the 2.3GFPpos population at day 17 of calvaria culture. Additionally, intermediate and late markers of bone cell differentiation including Ibsp, Bglap1, and Dmp1 were strongly expressed in the unsorted culture on day 17 and greatly enriched in the 2.3GFPpos-sorted population.Fig. 2Northern blot analysis of bone-associated gene expression. Bone-related genes were analyzed by Northern blot to compare with the microarray data. Purity of sorted cells was detected by hybridization with GFP cDNA. Bone markers (Col1a1, Ibsp, Dmp1, and Bglap1) as well as Igf1 showed a high correlation with microarray results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gene Expression by Microarray AnalysisSeven-day-old cultures were harvested to obtain 3.6GFPpos and GFPneg (at the preosteoblastic stage), and 17-day-old cultures were used to isolate 2.3GFP GFPpos and GFPneg cells at the mature osteoblast stage. The entire process of cell culture, FACS sorting, RNA extraction, probe labeling, and microarray hybridization was performed three times, and the results were analyzed as three replicates. The 74A chip was used to compare the expression profile of the FACS-separated cells with the parental total cell population taken at day 7 and day 17 of culture.3.6GFPpos Versus GFPneg CellsThe two populations of cells were isolated from a 7-day-old culture for RNA extraction. No genes showed higher expression in 3.6GFPpos when compared with GFPneg cells. However, 69 genes showed significant decrease in expression by one or both of the statistical tests, SAM and the SPH mixture model (genes listed in Tables I and II). When genes with lower expression were grouped based on similar decrease in expression in unsorted day 7 to day 17 cell populations, 11 genes were identified, all of which are associated with smooth muscle cells or pericytes (Table I). This type of result has been observed in other microarray studies that use total cell populations (7Roman-Roman S. Garcia T. Jackson A. Theilhaber J. Rawadi G. Connolly T. Spinella-Jaegle S. Kawai S. Courtois B. Bushnell S. Auberval M. Call K. Baron R. Bone. 2003; 32: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and provides supportive evidence that the sorting process separates bone progenitor cells from other cell types that have lost these progenitor cell markers. The remainder of genes with lower expression in the 3.6GFPpos cells showed an increase in expression as the total cell population moved from day 7 to day 17. Many of these genes encode proteins that modify or interact with the extracellular space or are involved in cytokine signaling. A number of genes are associated with dendritic cells or cells within the macrophage/osteoclast lineage (Table II). Of particular interest are Tyrobp, which is a RANKL adaptor molecule that displays the osteopetrotic phenotype when disrupted (17Kaifu T. Nakahara J. Inui M. Mishima K. Momiyama T. Kaji M. Sugahara A. Koito H. Ujike-Asai A. Nakamura A. Kanazawa K. Tan-Takeuchi K. Iwasaki K. Yokoyama W.M. Kudo A. Fujiwara M. Asou H. Takai T. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the Csf1 receptor. This latter group of genes may reflect a population of monocyte/osteoclast progenitor cells that continues to increase in number and level of differentiation explaining their increased expression in day 17 culture. However, their fall in expression in the 3.6GFPpos cells suggests that these cells do not directly contribute to the osteoblast lineage.Table IGenes associated with smooth muscle/pericyte level of differentiationNameSymbolDay 7 unsortedDay 17 unsorted3.6GFPneg3.6GFPposActin, α 1, skeletal muscleActa11,7793091,573420Actin, α, cardiacActc11,116301,10814ClusterinClu1,6049861,569505MyoglobinMb26310324376Matrix metalloproteinase 3, stromelysin-1Mmp35,5631,0125,3811,088Myosin, heavy polypeptide 3, skeletal muscle, embryonicMyh31832412712MLC1F/MLC3F gene for myosin alkali light chainMy111,8682412,068344Myosin light chain, alkali, cardiac atriaMyla1,3602341,406311Nik-related kinaseNrk39712641961Troponin C, cardiac/slow skeletalTncc81155929136Troponin T2, cardiacTnnt2281160294104 Open table in a new tab Table IIGenes associated with dendritic or macrophage/osteoclast lineagesNameSymbolDay 7 unsortedDay 17 unsorted3.6GFPneg3.6GFPposA disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 8Adam81,1205,1201,10546Apolipoprotein EApoe2,49166,3311,698389Complement component 1, q subcomponent, a polypeptideClqa3,05325,2012,801347Complement component 1, q subcomponent, β polypeptideC1qβ99712,05482323Complement component 1, q subcomponent, c polypeptideC1qc2,37924,2341,947480Complement component 3a receptor 1C3ar18703,738828185CD53 antigenCd539396,920844296CD68 antigenCd682,23514,5902,101329Carboxypeptidase ECpe4,9166,7714,2891,950Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptorCsf1r1,1899,4691,047350Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 2 αCt1a2a278898321121Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 2 βCtla2b30397533050Cathepsin CCtsc1,3162,8971,029404Cathepsin SCtss3,13240,0362,286211Adipose fatty acid-binding protein, AP2Fabp4285417369124Glycoprotein 49 AGp49a1,4338,4341,34998Glycoprotein 49 BGp49b7143,63561342Histocompatibility 2, T region locus 18H2-T181,5865,9551,930883Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5Laptm51,89613,2601,938756Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2Lcp228189434182LIM domain only 2Lmo21,0384,0301,159479Lymphocyte antigen 57Ly572211,68914849Lymphoblastomic leukemiaLyl16043,258527139LysozymeLyzs7,58845,3027,414523P lysozyme structuralLzp-s9,08278,7418,163420Matrix metalloproteinase 12Mmp121,48614,665722122Macrophage C-type lectinMpc12712,72935632Macrophage-expressed gene 1Mpeg11,94217,0531,897426Mannose receptor, C type 1Mrc17798,68755922Macrophage scavenger receptor 1Msr16651,263544174Properdin factor, complementPfc3661,390397143Paired Ig-like receptor A3Pira31,4096,6491,286498Plastin 2, LPls21,4556,5281,243395Small inducible cytokine A12Scya12680967797116Small inducible cytokine A9Scya99854,1611,080231Sialyltransferase 8 (α-2, 8-sialytransferase) DSiat8d17788620474Transferrin receptorTrfr6081,405735359TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding proteinTyrobp1,4199,9871,140116 Open table in a new tab 2.3GFPpos Versus 2.3GFPneg CellsA similar comparison of 2.3GFPpos and 2.3GFPneg cells in day 17 cultures was made with total unsorted cultures undergoing differentiation (day 17 versus day 7), yielding a much larger number of differentially expressed genes. Four major patterns of expression were observed.Group A: Genes with Higher Expression in the Unsorted Differentiating Cultures (Day 17 Versus Day 7) That Are Also Highly Expressed in Sorted Mature Osteoblasts (2.3GFPpos Versus 2.3GFPneg)—The expected higher expression of osteoblast-specific genes, Bglap1 and Ibsp, observed in unsorted (day 17 versus day 7) culture was reflected by significantly higher levels in the sorted 2.3GFPpos versus 2.3GFPneg population (supplemental Table 1). Similarly, a number of known osteoblast differentiation-regulated genes such as transcription factor distal-less homeobox 3 (Dlx3), dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1), dickkopf homolog 1 (Dkk1), parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (Pthr1), prostaglandin I2 synthase (Ptgis), and phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidases (Phex) were also found in this category. Interestingly, a few genes with currently no appreciated role in bone biology, such as hepatic lipase (Lipc), bone morphogenetic protein 8a (Bmp8a), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (Lifr), cysteine dioxygenase 1 (Cdo1), the membrane-bound type 13 collagen (Col13α1), and potassium channel, subfamily K (Kcnk1), were highly expressed in mature osteoblasts (2.3GFPpos).Group B: Genes with Unchanged or Lower Expression in the Unsorted (Day 17 Versus Day 7) Population but with Higher Level of Expression in Mature Osteoblasts—In this category are genes with higher expression in the 2.3GFPpos compared with the 2.3GFPneg population, the change in which is not shown by the total cell population analysis (Table III). A role for many of these genes in this osteoblast function is not obvious, and confirmation of their importance will require gene deletion studies. For example, mice with a total deficiency of the Cpe gene are obese, although no analysis of the bone phenotype has been made. Other genes include an ion transfer gene (chloride channel 3) and cationic amino acid transporter, genes involved in cell metabolic activity (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, cytochrome-c oxidase subunit VIa, asparaginase synthetase), a cytoskeletal gene (ankyrin 3 epithelial), and two transcription regulation factors (Fyn proto-oncogene and Kruppel-like factor 4). The increased expression of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase and fatty acid-binding protein 3 is noteworthy because of the beneficial effect of statins on bone mass (18Mundy G. Garrett R. Harris S.

Thus, observing many genes that decrease in expression during osteoblastic differentiation is not unexpected in either the unsorted or 2.3GFPpos-sorted cell population. Msx2, a transcriptional factor with importance in early osteoblastogenesis is a gene with a known reduction in expression during differentiation. Other genes that are suppressed but have roles in the osteogenic lineage that are less recognized include fibulin 2, necdin, cysteine-rich protein 2, and inhibin β-B.Group D: Genes with Unchanged or Higher Expression Levels in Unsorted Differentiating Cultures (Day 17 Versus Day 7) That Show Significantly Lower Expression in Sorted Mature Osteoblasts—The heterogeneity of osteoblastic culture is evident in genes that show either no change or higher expression in unsorted cultures from day 7 to day 17, when in fact their expression is lower in the isolated 2.3GFPpos cell population (Tables IV and V). Examples include extracellular matrix genes more associated with non-osseous tissues such as procollagen IVa1 (endothelium), matrix Gla protein (smooth muscle cells and chondrocyte lineage cells), fibulin 1 (elastic tissue), thrombospondin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (wound repair), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) (endothelial), Meox2 (muscle), Mest (kidney), and osteoglycin (cartilage). This suggests that the 2.3GFPpos cell population is distinguishing itself from a heterogeneous and less differentiated cell population (2.3GFPneg). However, other growth factors sometimes associated with osteoblast differentiation also show lower expression. Included in this category are fibroblast growth factor 7 and two Igf-binding proteins known to affect bone mass. More surprisingly, a group of genes that shows h"

S. (2004) J. Membr. Biol. 200, 93–104). Here we have analyzed the molecular composition of this channel. Both thapsigargin (Tg) and 2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) stimulated similar non-selective cation currents and Ca2+ entry in HSY cells. The effects of Tg and OAG were not additive. HSY cells endogenously expressed TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 but not TRPC5 or TRPC6. Immunoprecipitation of TRPC1 pulled down TRPC3 but not TRPC4. Conversely, TRPC1 co-immunoprecipitated with TRPC3. Expression of antisense TRPC1 decreased (i) Tg- and OAG-stimulated currents and Ca2+ entry and (ii) the level of endogenous TRPC1 but not TRPC4. Antisense TRPC3 similarly reduced Ca2+ entry and endogenous TRPC3. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed an interaction between NTRPC1 and NTRPC3 (CTRPC1-CTRPC3, CTRPC3-CTRPC1, or CTRPC1-NTRPC3 did not interact), which was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays (GST-NTRPC3 pulled down TRPC1 and vice versa). Expression of NTRPC1 or NTRPC3 induced similar dominant suppression of Tg- and OAG-stimulated Ca2+ entry. NTRPC3 did not alter surface expression of TRPC1 or TRPC3 but disrupted TRPC1-TRPC3 association. In aggregate, our data demonstrate that TRPC1 and TRPC3 co-assemble, via N-terminal interactions, to form a heteromeric store-operated non-selective cation channel in HSY cells. Thus selective association between TRPCs generate distinct store-operated channels. Diversity of store-operated channels might be related to the physiology of the different cell types.

Some TRPC species are capable of forming highly Ca2+-selective channels, while others form relatively nonselective cation channels that allow permeation of both mono- and divalent cations. In addition, the presently available data suggest that TRPCs can form two types of cation entry channels (3Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Store-operated channels (SOCs) that are activated in response to depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. These channels can be activated by agonists, thapsigargin, and by intracellular increase in phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. In contrast receptor-operated TRPCs are activated by agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis but not by thapsigargin. The latter TRPCs are also activated by OAG, an analogue of diacylglycerol, the proposed physiological ligand for these channels. TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 have been reported to form receptor-operated Ca2+ entry channels that can be activated by OAG (4Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), while TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 form components of store-operated Ca2+ channels in some cell types (5Freichel M. Suh S.H.

Heteromeric interactions between TRPCs can potentially generate a wide variety of different channels and there are convincing data to substantiate these suggestions.

In aggregate, these previous studies suggest that heteromeric interactions occur between members of two groups of TRPCs: TRPC1/TRPC4/TRPC5 and TRPC3/TRPC6/TRPC7. Interestingly, these two groups also represent receptor-operated and store-operated channels, respectively. The latter group is also suggested to be activated by OAG (4Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Exceptions to these findings have also been reported. Montell and co-workers (14Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) reported that exogenously expressed TRPC1 and TPRC3 co-assemble to form a heteromeric complex. Novel heteromeric associations between endogenous TRPCs were reported by Strubing et al. (10Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

However, there is little information regarding the contribution of endogenous TRPCs, and specifically of heteromeric TRPC channels, to store-operated Ca2+ entry seen in different cell types. Furthermore, the physiological implication of such diverse SOCs is not yet understood. Downstream events regulated by Ca2+ entry likely determine the type of channel that is formed in different cells (1Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re3PubMed Google Scholar, 2Minke B. Cook B.

Liao D. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, internal Ca2+ store depletion activates a non-selective cation current in HSY cells, which is distinct from the relatively Ca2+-selective cation current (ISOC) activated in HSG cells. pCa/pNa was 40 and 4.6 for HSG and HSY cells, respectively. Evidence for anomalous mole fraction behavior of Ca2+/Na+ permeation was obtained with HSG cells but not HSY cells (18Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, our studies have suggested that TRPC1, but not TRPC3, is an integral component of the store-operated channel in HSG cells (7Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J.

In this study we have analyzed the molecular components of the non-selective, store-operated channel in HSY cells and present data to demonstrate that it is formed by selective heteromeric interactions between endogenously expressed TRPC1 and TRPC3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—HSY cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection, 1 μg of DNA was combined with 2.4 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was then added to the cells. 5 h after the start of transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing serum and antibiotics. For functional studies, cells were plated onto glass coverslips or MatTek tissue culture dishes. Cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding antisense TRPC1, antisense TRPC3, NTRPC1, or NTRPC3 and 1 μg GFP-encoding plasmid. GFP-positive cells were selected for the experiment 24 h after transfection.Electrophysiological Measurements—Measurements were made as described earlier (18Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For patch clamp experiments, coverslips with cells were transferred to the recording chamber and perfused with an external Ringer's solution of the following composition (mm): NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; Hepes, 10; Glucose, 10; pH 7.4 (NaOH). The patch pipette had resistances between 3 and 5 mΩ after filling with the standard intracellular solution that contained the following (mm): cesium methane sulfonate, 145; NaCl, 8; MgCl2, 10; Hepes, 10; EGTA, 10; pH 7.2 (CsOH). Osmolarity for all the solutions was adjusted with mannose to 300–315 mmol/kg using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Inc.).Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight-seal whole cell configuration at room temperature (22–25 °C) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Development of the current was assessed by measuring the current amplitudes at a potential of -80 mV, taken from high resolution currents in response to voltage ramps ranging from -90 to 90 mV over a period of 1 s imposed every 4 s (holding potential was 0 mV) and digitized at a rate of 1 KHz. Liquid-junction potentials were less than 8 mV and were not corrected. Capacitative currents and series resistance were determined and minimized. For analysis, current recorded during the first ramp was used for leak subtraction of the subsequent current records. Tg and OAG were purchased from Calbiochem.[Ca2+]i Measurements—Fura2 fluorescence was measured in single HSY cells cultured for 24 h in glass bottom Matek tissue culture dishes. Cells were loaded with Fura2 by incubation with 1 μm Fura2-AM at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence was recorded using a Till Photonics-Polychrome 1V spectrofluorimeter and Metafluor imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.) with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Cells were bathed in external medium (similar to that used for electrophysiology experiments), and where required Ca2+ was omitted from the assay medium (Ca2+-free medium). All conditions and additions are indicated in the text. All experiments were repeated using at least three different passages of cells. Student's t test was used to statistically evaluate the data.Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—NTRPC1 (residues 1–347), NTRPC3 (residues 1–341), CTRPC1 (residues 649–793), and CTRPC3 (residues 642–842) were subcloned into pGBKT7 (GAL4 DNA binding domain; Clontech) or pGADT7 (GAL4 DNA activation domain; Clontech). Plasmids were transformed into the yeast reporter strain AH 109 (Clontech). The cells were grown on SD-trp-,leu- plates to select transformants and subsequently streaked on both of SD-trp-,leu- and SD-trp-,leu-,his-,ade2- plates. Growth on SD-trp-,leu-,his-,ade2- plates indicated protein-protein interaction. β-Galactosidase assay was performed to confirm the interactions as instructed by the Clontech Matchmaker system using control interacting vectors.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST Constructs—The N and C terminus of TRPC1 and TRPC3 were cloned into pGEX5.1 (Amersham Biosciences) vector using PCR-based strategy and expressed as GST fusion proteins. 500 ml of Escherichia coli (BL-21) expressing various GST constructs (log phase culture, OD 0.5–0.6) were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 more h, and GST fusion proteins were purified as described (20Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were lysed using a French press at 1200 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded on a glutathione S-transferase-agarose affinity column, washed, and eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Membrane solubilization, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and ECL reactions were performed as described earlier (20Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude membranes were treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 or with 1.5 mm octyl glucoside + 0.5 m KI, and the solubilizate was collected by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 60 min and precleared by incubation with an excess of the protein A beads and centrifugation. 200 μg of the cleared sample was incubated with the required antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were pulled down with 30 μl of 30% protein A beads at 4 °C. Beads were washed with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vandate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% sucrose, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and treated with SDS solubilization buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were used to detect proteins in the IP fraction as described previously (20Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions for Western blots were as follows: anti-TRPC1, 1:250; anti-TRPC3, 1:500; anti-TRPC4 (Chemicon), 1:100, anti-TRPC5 (Chemicon), 1:200; anti-TRPC6 (Sigma), 1:500. All antibodies were tested against tagged expressed proteins to confirm their activity. Antibodies were diluted 1:50 or 1:100 for IP.Cell Surface Biotinylation—Control and NTRPC3-expressing cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) on ice. Cells were then washed with buffer containing 0.1 m glycine and solubilized with 2 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. Biotinylated proteins were pulled down with NeutrAvidin-linked beads (Pierce). Bound fraction was washed and released with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-TRPC3 or anti-TRPC1 antibodies as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThapsigargin and OAG Stimulate Similar Currents in HSY Cells—In whole cell patch clamp experiments perfusion of HSY cells with 1 μm Tg in the external medium increased membrane currents (Fig. 1A). The Tg-induced cation currents inactivated relatively fast. Consistent with our previous report (18Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 200: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) the I-V relationship was linear with a reversal potential of +5 mV. Perfusion of cells with OAG also generated a current that had similar characteristics (pattern of I-V curve and Erev, see Fig. 1B) as that induced by Tg. Furthermore, when cells were perfused with OAG + Tg-containing medium the current generated was similar in characteristics and magnitude to that seen with Tg alone (Fig. 1C). Maximum current densities (picoampere/picofarad) measured in the three conditions were Tg, 6.3 ± 0.7 (n = 5); OAG, 4.5 ± 0.5 (n = 4); OAG + Tg, 6.4 ± 0.9 (n = 6). Thus, the effects of OAG and Tg on the current were not additive. In addition, both Tg- and OAG-stimulated currents were completely blocked by 1 μm Gd2+ (Fig. 1, D and E).The patch clamp data were substantiated with Fura2 measurements. 1 μm Tg rapidly increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cells incubated in Ca2+-free external medium and addition of 1 mm Ca2+ to the bath induced a rapid significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1F, note that basal Ca2+ entry is minimal in these cells). Peak Fura2 fluorescence (340/380 ratio) was 1.2 ± 0.3 (n = 118). OAG alone did not induce increase in [Ca2+]i until external Ca2+ was replenished (Fig. 1G). Peak 340/380 fluorescence ratio was 1.0 ± 0.3 (n = 121). These data demonstrate that Tg induces internal Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry, while OAG induces only Ca2+ entry. This is consistent with previous reports showing that OAG directly activates some TRPC channels such as TRPC3, -6, and -7 (4Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Venkatachalam K. Zheng F. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Importantly, and consistent with the current measurements, addition of Tg + OAG induced internal Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry that were similar to that induced by Tg alone (Fig. 1H). Peak 340/380 fluorescence ratio was 1.2 ± 0.4 (n = 135). In aggregate, the data in Fig. 1 suggest that OAG and Tg stimulate the same Ca2+ entry mechanism in HSY cells.Expression and Heteromeric Interaction between Endogenous TRPC1 and TRPC3 in HSY Cells—To identify the channels activated by Tg and OAG, we examined the endogenous expression of TRPC proteins in HSY cells. TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 were detected by Western blotting, while TRPC5 and TRPC6 were not detected (Fig. 2A, proteins detected using the respective antibodies are indicated below each blot; TRPC2, which is a pseudogene in human cells, and TRPC7 were not examined). Lane 1 in each blot was loaded with a sample containing crude membrane preparations from cells expressing exogenous TRPCs, as indicated (the expressed proteins were further confirmed using the anti-epitope tag antibodies; data not shown). Lane 2 was loaded with a sample containing crude membrane preparation from HSY cells and demonstrates the presence of endogenous TRPCs. Thus, HSY cells appear to express three different TRPC proteins, TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4. Although distinct store-operated currents have been detected in different cell types, there is little information regarding the molecular composition of the endogenous channels mediating these currents or the role of endogenous TRPC proteins in the generation of these channels.Fig. 2Endogenous expression of TRPC proteins in HSY cells, selective TRPC1-TRPC3 interaction, and antisense-induced decrease in protein expression. A, Western blots showing the presence of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC6 in crude membranes (CM) prepared from HSY cells. Lane 1, CM prepared from cells transfected with respective TRPC-encoding plasmids; lane 2, CM prepared from control HSY cells. Antibody reactivity is confirmed by positive signal for the expressed protein in each blot (the expressed proteins were further confirmed using anti-epitope tag antibody; data not shown). The detected protein is indicated below the blot (respective anti-TRPC antibodies were used for IB. Arrows show the position of the 97-kDa marker. B, IP with anti-TRPC3 (left) pulled down TRPC1 and TRPC3 (IB antibodies: upper blots, TRPC3; lower blots, TRPC1). IP of TRPC1 (right) using anti-TRPC1 antibody pulled down TRPC1, TRPC3 but not TRPC4 (IB antibody indicated). Input (inp) and IP fraction are shown).

Furthermore, heterologous expression of TRPCs has demonstrated that different combinations of TRPCs generate channels with distinct characteristics. These heteromeric TRPC complexes have been shown to form both store-operated and store-independent cation channels (9Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E.

Thus we examined possible heteromerization between the endogenously present TRPCs in HSY cells. When anti-TRPC3 was used to pull down TRPC3, TRPC1 was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B). Reverse IP using anti-TRPC1 pulled down TRPC1 and TRPC3. Furthermore, IP of TRPC1 did not pull down TRPC4 (Fig. 2B). These data suggest a selective interaction between TRPC1 and TRPC3 in HSY cells.Antisense TRPC1 and Antisense TRPC3 Decrease Store-operated Ca2+ Entry in HSY Cells—To examine the contribution of TRPC1 and TRPC3 to the OAG and Tg-stimulated currents described above, cells were transiently transfected with TRPC1-as (C1-as) or TRPC3-as (C3-as), and expression of TRPC1 and TRPC3 was assessed. TRPC3-as induced a decrease in endogenous TRPC3 but did not affect expression of TRPC1 or TRPC4 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, TRPC1-as induced a decrease in TRPC1 but not TRPC3 or TRPC4. These data demonstrate the specificity of the antisense treatments.Consistent with the decrease in TRPC1 expression, TRPC1-as induced a significant reduction in both TG and OAG stimulated membrane currents (Fig. 3, A and C). The current seen with OAG, Tg, or OAG + Tg were all similarly decreased. Importantly, the remaining currents displayed similar I-V relationships as seen in control HSY cells. Similar effects on Tg- and OAG-stimulated currents were seen with TRPC3-astreated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The average current densities, relative to that in control cells, are shown in Fig. 3C. Thus, antisense-induced decrease in specific TRPC proteins does not alter channel characteristics indicating that both TRPC1 and TRPC3 contribute to the OAG- and Tg-stimulated currents. This also suggests that the remaining TRPCs do not reassemble to generate channels with different compositions.Fig. 3Antisense TRPC1 and antisense TRPC3 attenuate Tg- and OAG-stimulated membrane currents in HSY cells. Tg-, OAG-, and Tg + OAG-stimulated membrane currents in cells treated with TRPC1-as (A) and TRPC3-as (B). Currents obtained at -80 mV (see the legend to Fig. 1 for details) and I-V plots are shown in each case. Average data comparing the current densities with that in control cells (see Fig. 1) are shown in C. TRPC1-as and TRPC3-as induce a similar decrease in Tg-, OAG-, and Tg + OAG-stimulated currents. Values marked are significantly different (p < 0.05; n ≥ 7) from unmarked values in the same group but not from each other.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of antisense treatment on the store-operated current was further confirmed by Fura2 measurements. Expression of TRPC1-as or TRPC3-as induced similar decreases in Tg-, OAG-, and Tg + OAG-stimulated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). Fig. 4A shows the responses in control cells which were transfected with vector + GFP. Thus, both TRPC1 and TRPC3 significantly contribute to Tg and OAG-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Together with the data showing their association (Fig. 2), these data strongly suggest that both TRPC1 and TRPC3 co-assemble to generate a heteromeric store-operated Ca2+-permeable cation channel in HSY cells.Fig. 4Antisense TRPC1 and antisense TRPC3 attenuate Tg- and OAG-stimulated Ca2+ entry in HSY cells. Tg-, OAG-, and Tg + OAG-stimulated Ca2+ entry was measured in Fura2-loaded control HSY cells (A) and cells treated with TRPC1-as (B) and TRPC3-as (C). Additions of the agents and Ca2+ concentration in the external medium are indicated in each trace.

Here we show that C5L2 is expressed in human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in both preadipocytes and adipocytes. In mice, C5L2 is expressed in all adipose tissues, at levels comparable with other tissues. Stable transfection of human C5L2 cDNA into HEK293 cells results in ASP stimulation of triglyceride synthesis (TGS) (193 ± 33%, 5 μm ASP, p < 0.001, where basal = 100%) and glucose transport (168 ± 21%, 10 μm ASP, p < 0.001). C3a similarly stimulates TGS (163 ± 12%, p < 0.001), but C5a and C5a des-Arg have no effect. The ASP mechanism is to increase Vmax of glucose transport (149%) and triglyceride (TG) synthesis activity (165%) through increased diacylglycerolacyltransferase activity (200%). Antisense oligonucleotide down-regulation of C5L2 in human skin fibroblasts decreases cell surface C5L2 (down to 54 ± 4% of control, p < 0.001, comparable with nonimmune background). ASP response is coordinately lost (basal TGS = 14.6 ± 1.6, with ASP = 21.0 ± 1.4 (144%), with ASP + oligonucleotides = 11.0 ± 0.8 pmol of TG/mg of cell protein, p < 0.001). In mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, antisense oligonucleotides decrease C5L2 expression to 69.5 ± 0.5% of control, p < 0.001 (comparable with nonimmune) with a loss of ASP stimulation (basal TGS = 22.4 ± 2.9, with ASP = 39.6 ± 8.8 (177%), with ASP + oligonucleotides = 25.3 ± 3.0 pmol of TG/mg of cell protein, p < 0.001). C5L2 down-regulation and decreased ASP response correlate (r = 0.761, p < 0.0001 for HSF and r = 0.451, p < 0.05 for 3T3-L1). In HEK-hC5L2 expressing fluorescently tagged β-arrestin, ASP induced β-arrestin translocation to the plasma membrane and formation of endocytic complexes concurrently with increased phosphorylation of C5L2.

Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to stimulation of TGS, ASP stimulates glucose transport (7Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D.

Furthermore, high affinity binding of both ligands (ASP and C3a) to HSF and 3T3-L1 cells (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 276: E815-E821PubMed Google Scholar) has been demonstrated. On the other hand, both ASP (C3a des-Arg) and C3a have other functions in common in addition to TGS stimulation (13Maslowska M. Wang H.W. Cianflone K. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 70: 309-332Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ASP and C3a influence secretion of a number of hormones, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (14Fischer W.H. Jagels M.A. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 453-459PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fischer W.H. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4279-4286PubMed Google Scholar), as well as prolactin, growth hormone, and adrenocorticotropin in pituitary cells (16Francis K. Lewis B.M. Akatsu H. Monk P.N. Cain S.A. Scanlon M.F. Morgan B.P. Ham J. Gasque P. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2266-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ASP has also been shown to influence insulin secretion in cultured pancreatic islet cells and in vivo (17Ahren B. Havel P.J. Pacini G. Cianflone K. Int. J. Obesity Rel. Metab. Dis. 2003; 27: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By contrast, no binding of ASP to the C3a receptor (C3aR) has been observed in cells that bind C3a, including U937 macrophage, polymorphonuclear monocytes, transfected RBL cells, or transfected HEK293 (11Kalant D. Maslowska M. Scantlebury T. Wang H. Cianflone K. Can. J. Diabetes. 2003; 27: 154-171Google Scholar, 18Klos A. Bank S. Gietz C. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Burg M. Kretzschmar T.

Furthermore, ASP does not exhibit the anaphylatoxic functions of C3a: (i) stimulation of eosinophil chemotaxis (20Daffern P.J. Pfeifer P.H. Ember J.A. Hugli T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), (ii) prostanoid production by guinea pig macrophages or rat Kupffer cells (21Puschel G.P. Nolte A. Schieferdecker H.L. Rothermel E. Gotze O. Jungermann K. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 685-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or (iii) degranulation of U937 cells (18Klos A. Bank S. Gietz C. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Burg M. Kretzschmar T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11274-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The division between ASP and C3a, in binding and function, may be explained by the existence of two receptors: the C3aR, which binds only C3a, and another that binds both ligands. We recently have reported that the orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) C5L2 binds ASP and C3a with high affinity in transfected RBL cells and exhibits saturable binding of ASP in transfected HEK293 cells (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11123-11129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated the expression of C5L2 mRNA in human adipose tissue, HSF, and 3T3-L1 by reverse transcription-PCR and expression of the protein on the cell surface of HSF using anti-C5L2 polyclonal antiserum. These data suggested that C5L2 might mediate the TGS-stimulating effect of ASP. Although C5L2 also binds C5a and C5a des-Arg, these ligands do not stimulate triglyceride synthesis in 3T3-L1 cells (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11123-11129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and in fact, it has recently been demonstrated that C5L2 is a nonfunctional receptor for C5a (22Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence, through both gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays in physiologically relevant cells, that C5L2 not only binds ASP but also is a functional ASP receptor. This is further documented through demonstration of ligand-activated β-arrestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) translocation (23Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The β-arrestin-GFP translocation assay has been used effectively and extensively to study diverse GPCRs that are sensitive to different ligands (24Johnson E.C. Bohn L.M. Barak L.S. Birse R.T. Nassel D.R. Caron M.G. Taghert P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52172-52178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Barak L.S. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Laporte S.A.

It is broadly applicable for GPCR deorphaning because mammalian receptors that couple to different signaling pathways desensitize by using a common set of GPCR kinases and arrestin proteins. Wild type C57BL6 mice were sacrificed at 9-10 weeks of age and dissected, and ~50-100 mg of tissue was stored in 500 μl of RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) at -80 °C. Fatty tissues (adipose tissue and brain) were homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen), all other tissues were homogenized in Buffer RLT (Qiagen) with β-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was isolated using Qiagen minikit spin columns as per the protocol provided by the manufacturer. An additional DNase treatment and RW1 wash was used for the fatty tissues. RNA was quantified using the 260/280 OD with ratios of 1.9-2.0 obtained. RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed and diluted to 100 μl. TAQMAN real time PCR was used for quantification of mouse C5L2 relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with primers designed by Applied Biosystems (Toronto, Canada) for C5L2 (Mm 01267981_s1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (number 4308313). Template cDNA (5 μl of a 1:10 dilution) with Universal Master Mix was used according to the Applied Biosystems protocol with detection on an ABI 7700 system. C5L2 is expressed relative to the brain (where brain is set as 1), with n = 3-5 samples/tissue. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction from freshly isolated samples of tissues. For adipose tissue, mature floating adipocytes and stromal vascular cells (containing preadipocytes) were isolated as described previously (4Walsh M.J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Vu H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9489-9495Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA was produced from 3 μg of RNA by reverse transcriptase, and 4% of the reaction was amplified by PCR with 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.01 mm tetramethyl ammonium chloride, using the following protocol: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. Amplification was linear over the range used. Primers for the human C5L2 gene were as follows: sense, 5′-CCTGGTGGTCTACGGTTCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGCAGGATTTGTGTCTGTT-3′. Primers for human 18 S rRNA were used as an internal control (Ambion, Austin, TX). Reaction products were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by silver staining (Bio-Rad), and a 100-bp ladder (NEB, Pickering, Canada) was used as a standard. ASP and C3a were purified from human plasma as described previously (6Murray I. Parker R.A. Kirchgessner T.G. Tran J. Zhang Z.J. Westerlund J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C5a and C5a des-Arg were prepared as described previously (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse C5L2 was prepared similarly using the N-terminal 23 amino acids of mouse C5L2 (22Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M.

Sniderman A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably transfected with either the human C5L2 cDNA (HEK-hC5L2) or human C3aR (HEK-hC3aR) containing an HA tag were produced as previously described (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11123-11129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the C5L2 stably transfected cells were sorted and selected for cells that demonstrated specific binding and uptake of fluorescently labeled ASP (1Kalant D. Cain S.A.

HSF, 3T3-L1, and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418 for HEK293 stably transfected cells. For all functional assays (triglyceride synthesis, cell surface C5L2, and β-arrestin assays), cells were transferred to serum-free medium 2 h prior to the assay. TGS and glucose transport assays were performed as previously described (6Murray I. Parker R.A. Kirchgessner T.G. Tran J. Zhang Z.J. Westerlund J. Cianflone K. J.

For triglyceride synthesis, cells were incubated with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline), ASP, or insulin (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 100 μm [3H]oleate complexed to albumin (molar ratio 5:1, specific activity 50-70 dpm/pmol oleate) diluted in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37 °C. In double labeling experiments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, supplemented with [3H]glucose (final specific activity 2-5 dpm/pmol) and 100 μm [14C]oleate complexed to bovine serum albumin (molar ratio 5:1, final specific activity 2-5 dpm/pmol). In Vmax/Km experiments, 10-500 μm oleate was used (5Cianflone K. Roncari D.A.K. Maslowska M. Baldo A. Forden J. Sniderman A.D.

Rodriguez M.A. Lipids. 1991; 26: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In some cases, glucose- and pyruvate-free medium was used, and glucose or pyruvate were supplemented directly to the medium (5 mm glucose or 10 mm pyruvate) (9Germinario R. Sniderman A.D. Manuel S. Pratt S. Baldo A. Cianflone K. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 574-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted with isopropyl alcohol/heptane (2:3, v/v). The organic extract was evaporated (lyophilization), resolubilized in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and applied to a thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman LK5D silica gel 150A; Mandel Scientific, Toronto, Canada). Lipids were separated using a solvent system of hexane/ether/acetic acid (75:25:1, v/v/v). Triolein and oleic acid standards were used to visualize the lipid following exposure to iodine (I2) vapor. The lipid spot was scraped into scintillation vials, scintillation fluid was added, and samples were counted in a scintillation counter. Aliquots of the serum-free radiolabeled medium were counted to determine specific activity. For glucose transport, following incubation with ASP and insulin in serum-free medium for the indicated times, cells were rinsed with warm serum-free, glucose-free medium and then incubated for 5 min with 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose (10-500 μm, final specific activity 60-120 dpm/pmol) in serum-free glucose-free medium at 37 °C. Following incubation, the reaction was stopped with rapid washing of the cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell protein was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH. Aliquots were taken for scintillation counting. Cell protein was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). TGS was calculated as pmol of [3H]oleate or [14C]oleate incorporated into TG or [3H]glucose incorporated into TG per mg of soluble cell protein. Glucose transport was measured as pmol of 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose uptake per mg of soluble cell protein. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was measured in cell homogenates (50-150 μg of protein) as [3H]oleate (20 μm) incorporation into triglyceride using diglyceride (0.125 mm) as a substrate in the presence of 0.5 mm CoA and 2.5 mm ATP as described previously in adipocyte (30Yasruel Z.

Following incubation in serum-free medium for 2 h, HSF and 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with anti-human or anti-mouse polyclonal C5L2 antiserum, respectively, at a 1:100 dilution in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 0.25% albumin, 6.5 mm glucose, 1 mm calcium, 1 mm magnesium, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.2 (HAG-CM), for 30 min at room temperature. After two rinses with HAG-CM, cells were incubated with 125I-protein A (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at a 1:1000 dilution in HAG-CM for 30 min at room temperature. After a further two rinses with HAG-CM, cell protein was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH for 1 h, and aliquots were taken for γ-counting and cell protein determination. Nonimmune rabbit serum was used to evaluate background binding. Results were calculated as dpm of [125I]protein A bound/mg of cell protein and expressed relative to basal levels in untreated cells (equal to 100%). One DNA oligonucleotide was made to the translation start site of each of the human and mouse C5L2 mRNAs. Two other oligonucleotides were designed with the Primer3 program (available on the World Wide Web at frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi), using the same default criteria as that for PCR primers. These oligonucleotides target regions in the middle and the last 25% of the translated sequence. Oligonucleotides were all phosphorothioated for stability. Oligonucleotides for the human C5L2 mRNA were as follows: 5′-GCTGACAGAATCGTTCCCCAT-3′ (oligonucleotide 1), 5′-CTGAACCGTAGACCACCAGG-3′ (oligonucleotide 2), and 5′-ACAGGAAGAGCATGGGATTG-3′ (oligonucleotide 3). Oligonucleotides for the mouse C5L2 mRNA were as follows: 5′-CTGGTGGTGTGGTTCATCAT-3′ (oligonucleotide 1), 5′-TAGGAAGAGGTCTCCGCTGA-3′ (oligonucleotide 2), and 5′-CAAATGAAAAACCCCACCAC-3′ (oligonucleotide 3). The reverse complement of oligonucleotide 2 was used as a control oligonucleotide for each C5L2 mRNA, with some manual alterations necessary for the human sequence so that it would not match any sequence in the human genome. The oligonucleotides were as follows: human, 5′-ATCTTAACTAGCTAGCAATC-3′ (control (CTL) oligonucleotide) and mouse, 5′-TCAGCGGAGACCTCTTCCTA-3′ (CTL oligonucleotide). Parallel sets of either HSF or 3T3-L1 cells, at 40-60% confluence in 24-well plates, were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 2.5 or 4 μl of a stock of 20 μm oligonucleotide combined with 1 or 2 μl of Oligofectamine in triplicate (A = 2.5/1, B = 4/1, C = 2.5/2, D = 4/2 μl of oligonucleotide/μl of Oligofectamine). Cells were assayed 2 days post-transfection in parallel for (i) quantitation of C5L2 by Protein A immunoassay and (ii) ASP stimulation of TGS. β-Arrestin Translocation Assay—HEK-hC5L2 cells were seeded onto microscope coverslips placed in 6-well tissue culture plates and transiently transfected with 0.5 μg/well of plasmid containing a cDNA for a fusion protein of GFP-β-arrestin (32Oakley R.H.

Alternately, HEK293 cells were simultaneously transiently transfected with hC5L2 and GFP-β-arrestin. Two days later, cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 2 h and then incubated for the indicated times in serum-free medium with the indicated ligands. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and images were collected using an LSM-510-META confocal microscope as described previously (32Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). HEK cells stably transfected with hC5L2 containing an HA tag were plated in 6-well plates and incubated in serum-free phosphate-free medium for 4 h. Cells were washed once with the same medium and then incubated for 2 h in the same medium with 70 μCi of 32P/well. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 20 μm ASP for the indicated times. Cells were placed on ice, and the medium was replaced with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer containing aprotinin (25 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and orthovanadate (0.1 mm). After lysing for 30 min at 4 °C, cell debris was pelleted at 90,000 × g for 20 min. C5L2 was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of anti-HA-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science). After three washes with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, samples were incubated for 30 min at 65 °C in sample buffer (containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol), electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. Results are indicated as average ± S.E. Significance was determined by t test or by ANOVA (with Bonferroni post hoc test) where significance was set at p < 0.05. We have shown recently that C5L2 mRNA is expressed in human adipose tissue, HSF, and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol.

Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, mC5L2 mRNA is expressed in all adipose tissues examined, with the highest levels in gonadal and inguinal fat depots and lower levels in brown adipose tissue. Whereas spleen clearly had the highest levels of all tissues examined, which may relate to other potential functions of C5L2, the levels in fat depots were similar to those in other tissues (liver and small intestine). RNA was also isolated from human subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue. In addition, in some preparations, adipose tissue was separated into stromal vascular cells (containing preadipocytes) and mature floating adipocytes. Reverse transcription-PCR with primers for human C5L2 mRNA demonstrates expression of C5L2 mRNA in both preadipocytes and mature adipocytes (Fig. 1B), consistent with the ASP stimulation of TGS in both adipocytes and preadipocytes (5Cianflone K.

We have reported previously that HEK293 cells are competent for TGS, but ASP does not stimulate TGS in these cells (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells were stably transfected with hC5L2, sorted based on fluos-ASP binding/uptake, and were shown to highly express C5L2 (1Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K.

As shown in Fig. 2A, stimulation of HEK-hC5L2 cells with increasing concentrations of ASP stimulated TGS severalfold and was maximal at 5 μm ASP (193 ± 33% stimulation, p < 0.001). By contrast, TGS in non-transfected HEK293 was not stimulated even at 10 μm ASP (Fig. 2A). The effect in HEK-hC5L2 cells is comparable with the stimulation seen in HSF and 3T3 cells (1Kalant D.

https://openalex.org/W2160934060,"The off-rate (k(off)) of the T cell receptor (TCR)/peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) interaction, and hence its half-life, is the principal kinetic feature that determines the biological outcome of TCR ligation. However, it is unclear whether the CD8 coreceptor, which binds pMHCI at a distinct site, influences this parameter. Although biophysical studies with soluble proteins show that TCR and CD8 do not bind cooperatively to pMHCI, accumulating evidence suggests that TCR associates with CD8 on the T cell surface. Here, we titrated and quantified the contribution of CD8 to TCR/pMHCI dissociation in membrane-constrained interactions using a panel of engineered pMHCI mutants that retain faithful TCR interactions but exhibit a spectrum of affinities for CD8 of >1,000-fold. Data modeling generates a ""stabilization factor"" that preferentially increases the predicted TCR triggering rate for low affinity pMHCI ligands, thereby suggesting an important role for CD8 in the phenomenon of T cell cross-reactivity."

Here we found that β2 undergoes ectodomain shedding followed by presenilin (PS)-dependent γ-secretase-mediated cleavage. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment or expression of an α-secretase enzyme, ADAM10, resulted in ectodomain cleavage of β2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Subsequent cleavage of the remaining 15-kDa C-terminal fragment (β2-CTF) was independently inhibited by three specific γ-secretase inhibitors, expression of the dominant negative form of PS1, and in PS1/PS2 knock-out cells. γ-Secretase inhibitor treatment also increased endogenous β2-CTF levels in neuroblastoma cells and mouse primary neuronal cultures. In a cell-free γ-secretase assay, we detected γ-secretase activity-dependent generation of a 12 kDa β2 intracellular domain (ICD), which was loosely associated with the membrane fraction. To assess the functional role of β2 processing by γ-secretase, we tested whether N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenylacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butylester (DAPT), a specific γ-secretase inhibitor, would alter β2-mediated cell adhesion and migration. We found that DAPT inhibited cell-cell aggregation and migration in a wound healing assay carried out with Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing β2. DAPT also reduced migration of neuroblastoma cells in a modified Boyden chamber assay. Since DAPT treatment resulted in increased β2-CTF levels, we also tested whether β2-CTFs or β2-ICDs would directly affect cell migration by overexpressing recombinant proteins. Interestingly, elevated levels of β2-CTFs, but not ICDs, also blocked cell migration by 81 to 93%.

Aβ is produced from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential β- and γ-secretase-mediated cleavages. An alternative to the β-secretase pathway is a cleavage mediated by α-secretase, which cuts in the middle of the Aβ region of APP (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). APP has been shown to serially undergo either β-γ and α-γ cleavages. Both Aβ and the β-secretase-mediated C-terminal cleavage product of APP, C99 or CTFβ, have been shown to contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (2McPhie D.L. Golde T. Eckman C.B.

The presenilins are polytopic membrane proteins that constitute either catalytic subunits or necessary cofactors of the γ-secretase complex (5Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J.

All the known substrates, with the exception of GluR3, are type I membrane proteins and require extracellular domain cleavage prior to subsequent γ-cleavage. Interestingly, many γ-secretase substrates (E-, N-cadherin, nectin-1, CD44, APP, ErbB4, p75NTR, APOER2, LRP, syndecan-3, and DCC) share functions in cell adhesion and/or migration, implicating a possible role for PS/γ-secretase in these processes (11Koo E.H.

For example, γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of E-cadherin, a well characterized cell adhesion molecule, promotes disassembly of the E-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex (17Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This results in the release of β-catenin, a key mediator of the Wnt signaling pathway that controls cell migration and cell adhesion (18Barker N. Morin P.J. Clevers H. Adv.

Studies on central nervous system morphogenesis in PS1 knock-out mice also strongly support a function for PS/γ-secretase in neuronal cell migration and/or cell adhesion during brain development (20Handler M.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3093-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). α-Secretase is a generic name for several ectodomain-shedding proteases, primarily of the metalloprotease type, based on their sensitivity to generic metalloprotease inhibitors and inducible activation by phorbol ester treatment (22Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 are among the best characterized α-secretases of APP (23Buxbaum J.D.

Ectodomain shedding of currently reported PS/γ-secretase substrates is likely to be mediated by α-secretase-like metalloproteases. However, the identity of the metalloproteases responsible for each γ-secretase substrate remains to be elucidated. Voltage-gated sodium channels consist of a single pore-forming α subunit and one or two β-subunits (25Isom L.L. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 12-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All β-subunits, β1, 1A, 2, 3, and recently 4, serve as auxiliary subunits of the voltage-gated sodium channel and have been known to be involved both in channel gating and cell surface expression of α subunits (25Isom L.L. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 12-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to nectin-1 and DCC, both substrates for PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavages, the β-subunits belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (26Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The β2-subunit, in particular, is enriched in the central nervous system, covalently linked to an α subunit, and well characterized as a cell-cell adhesion protein (25Isom L.L. Front.

TPA treatment or ADAM10 expression induce ectodomain cleavage of β2. The remaining 15-kDa membrane-anchored β2-CTF undergoes PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage to generate a 12-kDa β2 intracellular domain (β2-ICD). Lack of γ-secretase cleavage of β2, resulting in accumulation of β2-CTFs, inhibits cell-cell adhesion and migration in CHO cells. These data suggest a functional role for PS/γ-secretase in cell adhesion and migration via processing of β2-CTFs. Plasmids, Transfection, and Primary Neuronal Cultures—An expression construct encoding full-length human voltage-gated sodium channel β2 subunit (β2, GeneBank™ accession number gi:21361089) containing a C-terminal V5/His tag (in pcDNA3.1/GS) was purchased from Invitrogen. An expression vector containing human ADAM10 was a kind gift of Dr. Lichtenthaler (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität). Effectene (Qiagen) was routinely used for transfecting cell lines. We produced stably transfected CHO cells with β2, β2-CTF, β2-ICD, nectin, NE-CTF, NE-ICD, wild-type PS1, and PS1(D385A) expression constructs. The sequences of primers used to generate these constructs are available by request. Individual clones with similar expression levels were maintained in selection medium. The PS1/PS2 knock-out ES cell line (BD1) and control wild-type ES cells (BD6) were a generous gift of Dr. Sisodia (University of Chicago). SH-SY5Y cells were routinely grown in DMEM medium (Cambrex) with 10% fetal bovine serum and switched to RPMI 1640 medium (Cambrex) during migration assays. Mouse primary cortical neuronal cultures (DIV16) were prepared as described (8Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49976-49981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were dissected from E16 mouse fetal brains and dissociated by repeated passages through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The dissociated cells were plated on l-polylysine/laminine coated 6-well dishes and maintained in growth media consisting of neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mml-glutamine. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 16 days (DIV16). Western Blot Analysis, Antibodies, and Inhibitors—For immunoblotting, cell extracts were prepared by directly extracting cells in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), followed by a spin at 16,000 × g. Protein levels were quantitated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 20–100 μg of protein were resolved on 4–12% gradient BisTris gels or 12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution (Invitrogen)), anti-sodium channel β2 subunit antibodies (Navβ2, 1:500 dilution (Chemicon) and 1:500 (USBiological)), anti-nectin-1 (1:1000 dilution (a kind gift from Dr. Federoff at the University of Rochester)), anti-transferrin receptor (1:1000 (BD Bioscience)), anti-poly-(d-ribose) polymerase (1:1000 (Pharmingen)), and anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:2000 (Cell Signaling)). The blots were visualized by ECL using Lumiglo (KPL) or SuperSignal CL-HRP substrates (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT and L-685,458 were obtained from Calbiochem, and WPE31C was a kind gift of Dr. M. Wolfe (Brigham and Women's Hospital). The α-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1 (tumor necrosis factor-α processing inhibitor-1, IC-2) was purchased from Biomol. In Vitro Generation of β2-ICD—Membrane preparation and in vitro generation of β2-ICD were performed as described (8Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol.

The P2-P3 fractions were resuspended in Buffer H (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. In vitro cleavage experiments were performed by incubating the membrane fractions at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of the indicated amounts of DAPT and L-685,458. After incubation, the soluble and membrane-associated fragments were separated by centrifugation of the reaction mixture at 120,000 × g for 45 min. To dissociate ICD fragments from the membranes, 1 mm NaOH solution was added to the membrane fraction and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min. Fluorescence Confocal Analysis—For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed, permeabilized, and blocked by using 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1.5% goat IgG (Molecular Probes), respectively. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 3 h with an anti-V5 antibody (1:200, Invitrogen) in PBS containing 1.5% goat IgG. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained using a LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). Cell-Cell Aggregation Assay—In vitro cell-cell aggregation assays were performed as described by Miura et al. (32Miura M. Asou H. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10752-10758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. To induce β2-CTF accumulation, cells were pretreated with DAPT for 12 h. Cells were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 1 mm EDTA/Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 500 nm DAPT and dispersed by gentle pipetting. After washing three times, cells were resuspended in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing DAPT (500 nm), transferred into 35-mm polysterene dishes precoated with bovine serum albumin, and agitated (75 rpm) at room temperature for the indicated time intervals. The number of cell aggregates was counted three times in a hemocytometer. Aggregation was quantified by the index N(t)/N(0), where N(t) and N(0) are the total number of particles at incubation time at t and 0, respectively. Wound Healing Assay—CHO cells expressing β2 were grown in monolayer, scraped with a P200 pipette tip, washed with PBS, and incubated for 18–21 h in the presence and absence of 500 nm DAPT (33Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J.A. Parkinson S.J. Parker P.J. Ng T.T. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For β2-CTF accumulation, cells were pretreated with DAPT for 12 h. Migration of cells into the wound was examined by phase contrast microscopy. Photographic images were obtained immediately after scraping and after 21 h in the same locations. Wound healing activity was quantified by measuring the total area of the wound in each 10× field and the area covered by the migrating cells within the wound by using public image analysis software, NIH image software, Version 1.61. At least three different fields were chosen randomly, and the mean percentage of wound area covered by cells was calculated. Cell Migration Assay with Cell Culture Inserts—SH-SY5Y cell migration assays were performed as described by Pola et al. (34Pola S. Cattaneo M.G. Vicentini L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40601-40606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cell culture inserts with polyethylene terephthalate membranes (8 μm pore, USA Scientific, Inc.) were coated with collagen type IV (Sigma) and placed in 6-well dishes. Confluent SH-SY5Y cells were preincubated with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h in the presence or absence of 500 nm DAPT. Cells were then dispersed with 0.02% EDTA solution in PBS. 4 × 105 cells were replated into cell culture inserts placed in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h to allow for cell migration. PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml, Sigma) was added to the lower chamber as an attractant of SH-SY5Y cells. Cells on the upper surface of the inserts were removed by sterile cell scraper (Falcon), to leave the cells that had migrated across the membrane.

Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar); 4) detection of a PS/γ-secretase-dependent cleavage product, termed ICD; 5) in many cases, modulation of nuclear transcriptional activity by the ICD that is released into the cytosol (36Cupers P.

Although Aβ is released by γ-secretase cleavage of APP-CTFβ, a second intramembraneous clip (ϵ-cleavage) in APP is also PS-mediated, at a site homologous to the S3 cleavage of Notch (31Gu Y.

Similarly, all other PS/γ-secretase substrates harbor a loose consensus sequence at the membrane-cytosol interface, corresponding to the ϵ/S3-cleavage sites in APP/Notch (8Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A.

Using a BLAST search based on the homology between the ϵ/S3-cleavage sites, we found a large number of proteins containing homologous amino acid sequences, including β2. We chose to characterize β2 because, similarly to nectin-1 and DCC, β2 is a cell adhesion protein belonging to the wide family of IgCAMs (25Isom L.L. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 12-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the numerous members of the voltage-gated sodium channel proteins, including α and β subunits, only β2 harbors strong sequence homology to the APP-ϵ and Notch-S3 cleavage sites (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, this putative cleavage site in β2 also contains a lysine residue for potential monoubiquitination, which has recently been reported to control Notch-S3 cleavage (42Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israel A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Previously reported PS/γ-secretase substrates, such as APP, erbB4, LRP, and nectin-1, undergo phorbol ester-inducible ectodomain shedding to produce short CTFs, which are subsequently cleaved in a PS-dependent manner (8Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49976-49981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 43Gandy S. Petanceska S. Biochim. Biophys.

Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To assess whether β2 also yields shorter cleavage products in response to phorbol esters, we treated CHO cells expressing β2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Employing an antibody against the C-terminal V5 epitope tag, Western blot analysis showed that full-length β2 migrated at ∼47 kDa (Fig. 1C). Unlike nectin-1α, but similarly to APP, untreated cells already processed β2 to yield a CTF of ∼15 kDa. This indicates that β2 undergoes constitutive ectodomain shedding similar to APP, in addition to a phorbol ester inducible activity. The size of this fragment was consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the β2-CTF-V5/His cleavage product, ∼14–15 kDa, if ectodomain shedding occurred near the plasma membrane. TPA treatment only slightly increased levels of the 15-kDa fragment, presumably because of immediate PS/γ-secretase processing of the protein. However, DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor, alone or in conjunction with TPA, further elevated cellular levels of the 15-kDa CTF (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that β2 undergoes TPA-inducible ectodomain shedding followed by γ-secretase activity-dependent processing of its CTF. TPA-inducible cleavage as shown in Fig. 1C is characteristic of metalloprotease or α-secretase-mediated protease activities (46Hussain I. Hawkins J. Shikotra A. Riddell D.R. Faller A. Dingwall C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36264-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To test whether an α-secretase activity is involved in ectodomain shedding of β2, CHO cells expressing β2 were treated with 10 μm TAPI-1, a hydroxamic acid-based α-secretase inhibitor (47Slack B.E. Ma L.K. Seah C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DAPT treatment alone induced accumulation of the 15 kDa β2-CTF, and this was blocked by the α-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1 (Fig. 1D). To further assess whether α-secretase was partially responsible for ectodomain shedding of β2, we directly tested a well known α-secretase in our cells. For these experiments, we obtained a hemagglutinin-tagged ADAM10 construct from Dr. Lichtenthaler (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität). Overexpression of ADAM10 alone was sufficient to increase β2-CTF levels in CHO cells expressing β2 (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that α-secretase-like proteases including ADAM10 partially mediate ectodomain cleavage of β2. In Fig. 1, we have shown that DAPT increased the levels of the 15 kDa β2-CTF in CHO cells overexpressing β2. This suggests that γ-secretase activity is responsible for the degradation of the 15-kDa β2-CTF, generated from ectodomain shedding of β2. To confirm that this 15-kDa β2-CTF is a substrate for PS/γ-secretase activity, we treated β2-transfected CHO cells with two additional γ-secretase inhibitors, L-685,458 and WPE31C. These inhibitors independently elevated β2-CTF levels similarly to DAPT, suggesting that specific inhibition of γ-secretase activity is responsible for the increased β2-CTF levels (Fig. 2A). We also found that β2-CTF levels increased with increasing concentrations of DAPT (Fig. 2B). Moreover, β2-CTFs specifically accumulated in CHO cells stably transfected with a construct expressing the dominant negative PS1(D385A), and this was further enhanced by TPA treatment (Fig. 2C). Similarly, β2-CTF levels largely increased in PS1/PS2 knock-out ES cells transfected with full-length β2 (Fig. 2D). These data show that the proteolytic processing of the 15-kDa β2-CTF is PS/γ-secretase-mediated. In neuronal cells, β2 proteins are predominantly associated with voltage-gated sodium channel α subunits (48Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. De Jongh K.S. Westenbroek R.E. Reber B.F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Escherichia coli has three glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3), all containing the classic dithiol active site CPYC. We report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel monothiol E. coli glutaredoxin, which we name glutaredoxin 4 (Grx4). The protein consists of 115 amino acids (12.7 kDa), has a monothiol (CGFS) potential active site and shows high sequence homology to the other monothiol glutaredoxins and especially to yeast Grx5. Experiments with gene knock-out techniques showed that the reading frame encoding Grx4 was essential. Grx4 was inactive as a GSH-disulfide oxidoreductase in a standard glutaredoxin assay with GSH and hydroxyethyl disulfide in a complete system with NADPH and glutathione reductase. An engineered CGFC active site mutant did not gain activity either. Grx4 in reduced form contained three thiols, and treatment with oxidized GSH resulted in glutathionylation and formation of a disulfide. Remarkably, this disulfide of Grx4 was a direct substrate for NADPH and E. coli thioredoxin reductase, whereas the mixed disulfide was reduced by Grx1. Reduced Grx4 showed the potential to transfer electrons to oxidized E. coli Grx1 and Grx3. Grx4 is highly abundant (750–2000 ng/mg of total soluble protein), as determined by a specific enzyme-link immunosorbent assay, and most likely regulated by guanosine 3′,5′-tetraphosphate upon entry to stationary phase. Grx4 was highly elevated upon iron depletion, suggesting an iron-related function for the protein.

Grx1 can reduce the intracellular disulfides of ribonucleotide reductase Ia and 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulphate (PAPS) reductase, whereas Grx3 has 5% of the catalytic activity of Grx1 for ribonucleotide reductase Ia (11Lillig C.H.

The second glutaredoxin category is structurally related to the glutathione S-transferases and contains proteins composed of one N-terminal thioredoxin/glutaredoxin fold domain and one C-terminal highly helical domain (7Vlamis-Gardikas A.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Neither the physiological reductant nor the substrates of these molecules are currently known. Monothiol glutaredoxins were initially discovered in yeast, which has five glutaredoxins, two dithiol (yGrx1 and yGrx2) and three monothiol (yGrx3, yGrx4, and yGrx5) (15Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T.

Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants of the lysates after centrifugation provided the material for the analysis by sandwich ELISA. Protein Concentration Measurements—Total soluble protein was measured using the Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Pure Grx1 and Grx4 were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm with extinction coefficients of 12,500 and 18,140 m–1 cm–1, respectively. Antibody concentration was calculated using the formula: antibody mg/ml = (A280 – A310)/1.4. Cloning of the E. coli Grx4 Gene—A sequence of an open reading frame (ydhD) coding for a protein of 115 amino acids (Grx4) with a monothiol active site (CGFS) (Swiss-Prot accession number P37010) was amplified by PCR using primers Grx4 F-NdeI, 5′-AGC AAG CAT ATG AGC ACC ACT ATC G-3′ (forward 1), Grx4 F-NcoI, 5′-AGC AAG ACC ATG GGC ACC ACT ATC G-3′ (forward 2), and Grx4 RC-EcoRI, 5′-ATT GCA GAA TTC ATT ATT CCG CGT CCG-3′ (reverse 1), Grx4 RC-BamHI, 5′-ATT GCA GGA TCC ATT ATT CCG CGT CCG-3′ (reverse 2). E. coli (strain DHB4) genomic DNA was used as template (95 °C for 4 min, then 30 cycles 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and finally 72 °C for 10 min). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System 1 (Promega) and sequenced. We named the amplified gene grxD. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Grx4—Inserts containing grxD from pGEM-T were subcloned as NdeI and EcoRI or NcoI and BamHI fragments and cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of pET24a or the NcoI/BamHI sites of pET15b. The recombinant plasmids were named pET24a-grxD and pET15b-grxD, respectively, BL21(DE3) strain was transformed with pET24a-grxD whereas BL21(DE3)grxA–grxB–grxC– was transformed with pET15b-grxD. Transformants were grown in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with the relevant antibiotic at 37 °C. Expression of Grx4 was induced at A600 0.5–0.6 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), placed on ice with lysozyme (0.4 mg/ml) for 1 h, and sonicated three times at full power for 1 min on ice. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Total cell lysate supernatants were saturated with 40% ammonium sulfate at room temperature and recentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Ammonium sulfate supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and bound Grx4 was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm). Fractions containing Grx4 (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were concentrated with YM Diaflo ultra filters (cut-off of 3 kDa), incubated for 45 min with 5 mm DTT at room temperature, and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 superfine gel filtration column in 200 mm potassium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD experiments were performed using an AVIV Associates model 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer. Measurements were performed with a 0.1-cm path length cuvette in 5 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were 21 and 17 μm for Grx1 and Grx4, respectively. The mean residue ellipticity [θ] was expressed as units of 103*deg*cm2*dmol–1. Wavelength spectra were recorded from 195 to 260 nm at 25 °C. Data were collected every nanometer, with an averaging time of 2 s and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm averaging over six repeated scans. Thermal denaturations were monitored by measuring the change in ellipticity at 222 nm with increasing temperature from 5 to 90 °C at a speed of 30 °C/h. Data were recorded at every degree, with an 8-s averaging time and a 1.5-nm bandwidth. To estimate thermodynamic parameters, models derived from the van't Hoff equation and the standard equation for Gibbs free energy (24Greenfield N.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 282-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were fitted directly to the experimental data using Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc.). Construction of Grx4 Active Site Mutants—grxD from the pGEM-T vector was amplified using primers Grx4 F-NcoI and Grx4 SGFS RC (5′-CAG AGA AAC CGC TGC TCG-3′) or Grx4 RC-BamHI and Grx4 SGFS F (5′-CAG CGG TTT CTC TGC CCA GGC-3′). For both reactions conditions were 95 °C for 4 min, then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and finally 72 °C for 10 min. The two resulting PCR fragments were used together as templates for Grx4 F-NcoI and Grx4 RC-BamHI (95 °C for 4 min, then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and finally 72 °C for 10 min) to give a new PCR product encoding Grx4 SGFS, which could be subcloned to pET15b after digesting with NcoI and BamHI. The other two mutants were constructed in exactly the same manner using as primer couples for the active site mutations Grx4 CPYC F(5′-CCG AGC TGC CCG TAC TGT GCC CAG G-3′) and Grx4 CPYC RC (5′-CCT GGG CAC AGT ACG GGC AGC TCG G-3′) or Grx4 CGFC F (5′-CGA GCT GCG GTT TCT GTG CCC AGG CAG T-3′) and Grx4 CGFC RC (5′-ACT GCC TGG GCA CAG AAA CCG CAG CTC G-3′). Preparation of Differently Oxidized Grx4 Species—Recombinant Grx4 obtained after purification was fully reduced by treatment with 5 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C, in 200 mm potassium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Reduced Grx4 was oxidized after addition of 2 mm GSSG, 45 min at room temperature in the same buffer. The GSSG-oxidized Grx4 was desalted in 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and served as a substrate for TrxR in a mixture composed of 100 nm TrxR, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (final assay volume of 500 μl). The decrease at A340 was monitored as evidence of reduction of oxidized Grx4 by TrxR. An identical cuvette without Grx4 provided the background control. Similar experiments were performed with TrxR being replaced by 1 mm GSH, 6 μg/ml yeast GR, and 2.5 μm Grx1. Transfer of Electrons to Disulfides—Grx1, Grx1C14S, Grx2, Grx3, and PAPS reductase were oxidized by GSSG as in the previous paragraph. Each oxidized redoxin species was incubated with reduced Grx4 (5 μg) of in a total volume of 10 μl for 5 min in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. The samples were alkylated and labeled with 1.5 mm N-(iodacetaminoethyl)-1-naphthylamine-5-sulfonic acid (I-AEDANS) (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark before they were separated by SDS-PAGE (8–16%), and analyzed on a UV-table (UVP, San-Gabriel). Mass Spectrometry—Reduced Grx1 was prepared by addition of 2 mm DTT, incubation at room temperature for 45 min, and desalting using a Nap-5 Sephadex G25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Oxidized Grx4 was prepared as in the previous paragraph. Oxidized Grx4 (30 μm) was incubated with or without either 30 μm reduced Grx1 or 0.1 μm E. coli TrxR and 250 μm NADPH at room temperature for 90 min. The samples were alkylated by incubation with 1.4 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min and desalted using a C4 reversed phase ZipTip column (Millipore). MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DETM STR BioSpectrometry™ workstation) was performed using a sinapinic acid matrix. The instrument was calibrated using a calibration mix consisting of bovine insulin (5,734.59 Da) and horse apomyoglobin (16,952.5 Da), which gave an uncertainty level on the masses determined of ∼1 Da. Determination of Glutaredoxin Activity (HED Assay)—A mixture of 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm NADPH, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 6 μg/ml yeast GR was prepared. To 500 μl of mixture, HED was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. After 1 min, glutaredoxin-containing samples were added to the mixture, and the decrease in A340 was monitored for 5 min. An identical cuvette without glutaredoxin sample provided the background control. Activity was determined from the decrease in A340 for 5 min (12Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purification of Antibodies and Specific Sandwich ELISA for Grx4— Preparation and purification of antibodies against Grx4 by affinity chromatography and quantification of Grx4 by sandwich ELISA was carried out by methods previously described for E. coli Grx2 (25Potamitou A. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18561-18567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The effect of cell-free extracts on the recovery of Grx4 was examined. Known concentrations of standards were diluted in cell-free extracts, and the measured concentrations were compared with those expected (26Das K.C. White C.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 211: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Parallelism tests between sample and standard curves were performed for all samples (26Das K.C. White C.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 211: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Intra-assay variations were determined by replicates of the same sample in the same plate and inter-assay variation by the same sample analyzed at different days (27Noe G. Riedel W. Kubanek B. Rich I.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 80: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overexpression of relA and rpoS—Cells transformed with plasmids encoding σS (rpoS gene product) or RelA (Table I) were grown at 37 °C in LB (250-ml cultures in 1-liter flasks) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At A600 0.2–0.3, 150 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for the induction of relA. Expression of rpoS was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at late exponential phase (A600 0.7–0.8). Samples were collected and analyzed by ELISA at different time points. Grx4 Sequence Analysis and Comparison—Analysis of the E. coli genome revealed the existence of ydhD, an open reading frame encoding a protein with significant amino acid sequence homology to known monothiol glutaredoxins (Fig. 1). Due to its high homology to yeast monothiol glutaredoxins, we renamed the gene grxD and the putative protein Grx4. The protein displays a 37% sequence identity to the yeast monothiol Grx5 but is less similar to the classic dithiol Grx1 and Grx3 from E. coli. grxD is positioned at 37.33 min in the E. coli chromosome map. The encoded protein is of 115 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 12.7 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.5. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Grx4—The gene sequence used for overexpression of Grx4 was identical to the chromosomal (pET24a-grxD) or with a serine instead of a glycine for the amino acid after the first methionine (pET15b-grxD). The purification method employed resulted in a homogenous, colorless protein (as examined by SDS-PAGE, data not shown) with a routine yield of 20 mg of fully soluble protein per liter of LB culture for strain BL21(DE3)grxA–grxB–grxC– transformed with pET15b-grxD. The experimental results of this work were obtained using the abovementioned strain to avoid interference from the native E. coli glutaredoxins. Grx4 obtained from strain BL21(DE3)pET24a-grxD was only used in preliminary purification and characterization analysis. CD of Grx4—The structure content and stability of purified recombinant Grx4 were investigated by CD. The secondary structure and stability of Grx4 was compared with that of the well characterized Grx1 from E. coli having a known mixed α/β fold (28Xia T.H. Bushweller J.H. Sodano P. Billeter M.

Here we show that Tpl2–/– MEFs exhibit defects in ERK, JNK, and NF-κB activation, or ERK activation only when stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β, respectively. In addition, we show that the activation of Tpl2 by TNF-α depends on signals transduced by both TRAF2 and RIP1. Activated Tpl2 phosphorylates MKK4/SEK1 upstream of JNK and stimulates NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activity by mechanisms that are independent of the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65. Tpl2-transduced TNF-α signals instead promote the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 and modulate the spectrum of proteins associated with p65. Phosphorylation stimulates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB but does not affect its ability to bind DNA, which may be affected by the composition of the nuclear NF-κB complexes. These data confirm that defects caused by a single mutation may be cell-type and signal-specific and delineate the role of Tpl2 in the transduction of TNF-α signals that activate JNK and NF-κB in MEFs.

The physiological role of Tpl2 in the hematopoietic system appears to be more restricted, as macrophages from Tpl2–/– mice stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and anti-CD40 antibodies are defective in ERK activation but not in the activation of other MAPKs and NF-κB (8Dumitru C.D.

Similarly, Tpl2–/– B-cells also exhibit a restricted defect in ERK activation when stimulated with anti-CD40 antibodies (9Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tpl2 regulates both innate and adaptive immunity and plays a critical role in the response to inflammatory signals. Indeed, mice that lack Tpl2 secrete low levels of TNF-α when exposed to LPS and are resistant to LPS/d-galactosamine-induced endotoxin shock (8Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D.

Moreover, ablation of Tpl2 protects from TNF-α-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (10Kontoyiannis D. Boulougouris G. Manoloukos M. Armaka M. Apostolaki M. Pizarro T. Kotlyarov A. Forster I.

It is interesting to note that although Tpl2 is required for the development of full-blown TNF-α-induced arthritis and IBD, the pathobiology of the two syndromes may depend on signals originating in different cell types. Specifically, whereas IBD depends on the activity of CD8+ T-cells (10Kontoyiannis D. Boulougouris G. Manoloukos M. Armaka M. Apostolaki M. Pizarro T. Kotlyarov A. Forster I. Flavell R. Gaestel M.

Instead, it appears to depend on the function of non-lymphoid cells, perhaps the synovial fibroblasts. It is therefore important to define the signaling role of Tpl2 in different cell types. Our previous studies had shown that Tpl2 is required for the transduction of TNF-α signals that are induced via ligation of TNFR1 (9Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Binding of soluble TNF-α to TNFR1 promotes the release of the receptor-bound silencer of death domains and the recruitment of the death domain-containing adaptor protein TRADD (14Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). TNFR1 bound to TRADD then serves as an assembly platform for the binding of the TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and the death domain containing serine-threonine protein kinase RIP1 (receptor-interacting kinase-1) (14Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 15Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). TRAF2 is obligatory for JNK activation as has been clearly demonstrated by measuring the signaling output of TNF-α in TRAF2–/– MEFs (16Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). However, the pathway from TRAF2 to JNK, including the role MAP3Ks may play, remains largely unresolved (17Davis R.J.

Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Regarding NF-κB, TRAF2 is not required but contributes to its activation by TNF-α. This is underscored by the fact that TRAF2 ablation combined with the ablation of TRAF5 dramatically impairs NF-κB activation by TNF-α, despite the fact that the effect of ablation of either TRAF2 or TRAF5 alone on NF-κB activation is minimal (19Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RIP1 is essential for TNF-α-induced NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation, whereas its role in the activation of JNK has been controversial (15Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.

RIP1 recruits MEKK3 and the IκB kinases (IKKs) into a signaling complex that is formed after TNF-α stimulation. Assembly of this complex promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the IKKs and the MAP2Ks that activate p38 MAPK. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκB-α resulting in its degradation via the proteasome. IκB-α degradation releases NF-κB from a trimeric p65·p50·IκB-α cytoplasmic complex. Once released, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus, binds the κB consensus sequences in the promoters of numerous genes, and activates their transcription (14Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

In addition to signals that regulate its translocation into the nucleus, p65 is also regulated by phosphorylation (25Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Nakano H. Okazaki T. Chino A. Doi T. Saiki I. J.

Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies challenged the earlier data (29Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In this paper we present evidence that Tpl2 is obligatory for the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB by TNF-α in MEFs. The differences between hematopoietic cells and MEFs with regard to the TNF-α output suggest that the signaling role of Tpl2 depends on the cell type. In addition, we show that Tpl2 is obligatory only for the activation of ERK in IL-1β-stimulated MEFs, suggesting that its signaling role is also stimulus-specific. Finally, we present data that place Tpl2 downstream of TRAF2 and RIP1 and upstream of MKK4 and p65 in TNF-α-signaling in MEFs. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infections—MEFs from 13.5-day-old wild type and Tpl2–/– C57BL6 embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids as described (22Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). RIP1+/+ and RIP1–/– MEFs were cultured in the same medium. TRAF2–/– and TRAF2+/+ as well as p65–/– and p65+/+ 3T3 fibroblasts were also cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured as previously described (8Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A.

Retrovirus constructs of wild type and kinase-inactive (K167M) Tpl2 in pMSCV were packaged via transient transfection of Phoenix cells. MEFs and 3T3 fibroblasts were infected in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Cells were monitored for infection by scoring the expression of green fluorescent protein that is encoded by a bicistronic viral message, also encoding Tpl2. Experiments were typically carried out using cells infected 60 h earlier. Antibodies—All the phosphoantibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Antibodies against total ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, MKK4/SEK1, MEK1, IκB-α, and p65 were also from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Total MSK1 was from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-p105/p50 antibody was from Delta Biolabs, and the monoclonal anti-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Lysis, Subcellular Fractionation, and Western Blotting—Total lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described (16Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 MEFs or macrophages, seeded 24 h prior to the experiment, were harvested by scraping. Cells were resuspended in low salt buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl). After the addition of Nonidet P-40 (0.5%, final concentration), the cell suspensions were passed through a 21-gauge needle. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation. Nuclear proteins were extracted using high salt buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol). Western blotting was done on 50 ng of total protein using standard protocols. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Immunostaining—IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was purchased from R&D Systems. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, culture supernatants were added to 96-well plates precoated with an antibody specific for mouse IL-6. Following incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the wells were washed and then incubated for 2 more hours at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IL-6 antibody. To measure antibody binding, horseradish peroxidase substrate was added to the wells. Optical density at 450 nm was measured after 30 min of incubation. Immunostaining was carried out as described (31Molestina R.E. Payne T.M. Coppens I. Sinai A.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4359-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, unstimulated and TNF-α-stimulated wild type and Tpl2–/– MEFs, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, were first incubated with an anti-p65 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Stained cells were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE—MEFs were washed twice with methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in the same media for 20 min. Subsequently, cells were cultured for 6 h in the same media in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. p65 was immunoprecipitated by incubating the extracts with an anti-p65 antibody and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, protein complexes bound to the beads were denatured by adding sample buffer, and they were resolved in SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Kinase Assays—JNK in vitro kinase assays were carried out using lysates of TNF-α (50 ng/ml) or anisomycin (10 μg/ml)-treated, wild type and Tpl2–/– MEFs. Cells were lysed using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated by incubating the lysates with a rabbit monoclonal antibody and protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. Beads were washed 3 times with the lysis buffer, 2 times with an LiCl-containing buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and 2 times with the kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Bead-bound kinase was then incubated in the kinase buffer with 5 μg of purified GST-c-Jun fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) and 32P-labeled γ-ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding sample loading buffer. Protein samples were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nylon membranes. Tpl2 kinase assays were carried out using the same general strategy with the following exceptions. Tpl2 was incubated with 0.4 μg of the purified substrate GST-MEK1 (US Biologicals) and cold ATP (0.5 mm, final concentration) at 25 °C for 30 min. After the reactions were terminated, the samples were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with the phospho-specific MEK1 antibody. As MEFs express very low levels of endogenous Tpl2, they were infected with pMSCV retroviral constructs of Tpl2-HA and Tpl2 K167M-HA. Infected cells express HA-tagged Tpl2 at levels sufficiently high to easily detect it, but low enough to prevent its constitutive activation. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—NF-κB EMSAs were carried out using standard protocols (16Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts of MEFs or 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with 32P-labeled κB consensus oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and 3′-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5′) (Promega Inc.) in a binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μg/ml single-stranded DNA) at 30 °C for 30 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 200 volts for 2 h. For supershift and cold oligonucleotide competition, nuclear extracts were preincubated with the respective antibody or with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled cold oligonucleotides prior to incubation with the labeled ones. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase reporter assay was done as described previously (22Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). MEFs were transiently transfected with a κB-luciferase reporter construct (Promega Inc.) using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in media supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Twelve hours later, the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer and the luciferase reporter activity was measured by a luminometer using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega Inc.) Tpl2 Transduces TNF-α Signals That Activate ERK and JNK, but Not p38 MAPK in MEFs—TNF-α activates ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in wild type MEFs (14Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 32Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological role of Tpl2 in MAPK activation by TNF-α in these cells, Western blots of lysates from Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– MEFs harvested before and after TNF-α stimulation, were probed with antibodies against phosphorylated and total ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. The results (Fig. 1A), showed that while the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was impaired in Tpl2–/– cells, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was normal. In vitro kinase assays confirmed that the kinase activity of JNK immunoprecipitated from TNF-α-stimulated Tpl2–/– MEFs is significantly lower. The defect in JNK activation in Tpl2–/– cells was specific for TNF-α as other stress signals such as anisomycin activated JNK equally in both wild type and knock-out cells. To further explore the specificity of Tpl2 in the transduction of TNF-α signals, we examined the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB in TNF-α-stimulated Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– macrophages and the activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB in IL-1β-treated Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– MEFs. Fig. 1B shows that Tpl2 is indeed required only for ERK activation by TNF-α in macrophages. The signaling defect in Tpl2–/– macrophages stimulated with TNF-α is therefore, similar to the signaling defect in Tpl2–/– macrophages stimulated with LPS. Fig. 1C shows that whereas ERK phosphorylation is impaired in IL-1β-treated Tpl2–/– MEFs, IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK and activation of NF-κB is normal in these cells. We conclude that the Tpl2 signaling defect is cell-type and stimulus-specific. Tpl2 Is Required for the Activation of NF-κB by TNF-α in MEFs—TNF-α also activates NF-κB in wild type MEFs (14Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 32Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Tpl2 in NF-κB activation by TNF-α, we performed EMSA using nuclear extracts of unstimulated and TNF-α-stimulated wild type and Tpl2–/– MEFs. The induction of NF-κB DNA-protein complexes resolved on EMSA was significantly weaker in Tpl2–/– MEFs (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of the nuclear extracts with an excess of cold κB consensus oligonucleotides completely obliterated DNA binding, whereas preincubation with a polyclonal p65 antibody supershifted the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2B). To confirm that Tpl2 is required for the activation of NF-κB, we carried out luciferase reporter assays on TNF-α-stimulated Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– MEFs. The results showed that TNF-α induced a 2–4-fold increase in reporter activity in wild type MEFs and a minimal increase in Tpl2–/– MEFs (Fig. 2C). TRAF2 and RIP1 Are Required for the Activation of Tpl2 by TNF-α—TRAF2–/– MEFs exhibit a major block in the activation of JNK and a minor block in the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α (15Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 16Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

RIP1–/– MEFs, on the other hand, exhibit a major block in the activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK (20Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 21Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given that Tpl2 is required for the activation of both JNK and NF-κB, we examined whether it functions downstream of TRAF2 and RIP1. To this end, we carried out Tpl2 in vitro kinase assays using lysates of TRAF2+/+ and TRAF2–/– 3T3 fibroblasts as well as RIP+/+ and RIP1–/– MEFs. Because the endogenous levels of Tpl2 in fibroblasts are low and Tpl2 undergoes rapid degradation following TNF-α stimulation (33Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we expressed low levels of wild type Tpl2-HA from a retroviral promoter construct into wild type as well as the TRAF2–/– and RIP1–/– fibroblasts. A kinase-inactive form of Tpl2 (K167M) was expressed as a control in wild type fibroblasts. Tpl2 immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody from wild type and mutant cells before and 10 min after stimulation with TNF-α was used to carry out in vitro kinase assays using purified GST-MEK1 as the substrate. Phosphorylated substrate was electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with a phospho-specific MEK1 antibody. The results showed induction of MEK1 phosphorylation by wild type Tpl2 pulled down from TNF-α-stimulated wild type fibroblasts but not from similarly treated TRAF2–/– and RIP1–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 3A) The kinase-inactive Tpl2 immunoprecipitated from TNF-α-stimulated wild type fibroblasts failed to phosphorylate MEK1 in the in vitro kinase assay, thus confirming that phosphorylation was not because of a Tpl2-associated kinase (supplemental materials Fig. 2). These results suggest that both TRAF2 and RIP1 are required for the activation of Tpl2 by TNF-α in MEFs. If RIP1 is required for Tpl2 activation, and Tpl2 is required for JNK activation, one would expect that optimal JNK activation will depend on RIP1. Previous studies addressing the role of RIP1 in JNK activation had produced conflicting results (20Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 23Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore revisited its role by probing Western blots of lysates derived from unstimulated and TNF-α-stimulated RIP1+/+ and RIP1–/– MEFs with antibodies against total JNK and JNK phosphorylated at Thr183 and Tyr185. Lysates from cells stimulated with IL-1β were used as controls. The results showed that RIP1–/– cells exhibit a partial defect in JNK phosphorylation in response to TNF-α but not in response to IL-1β (Fig. 3B) and provided support to the study showing that RIP1 contributes to the activation of JNK by TNF-α. Tpl2 Transduces TNF-α Signals That Activate MKK4/SEK1 Upstream of JNK—It was earlier reported that activation of JNK/SAPK in MEFs in response to TNF-α requires two upstream kinases, MKK7, which phosphorylates JNK preferentially on Thr, and MKK4, which phosphorylates JNK preferentially on Tyr (34Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed"

https://openalex.org/W2055137119,"Expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) responsible for leukocyte-endothelium interactions plays a crucial role in inflammation and atherogenesis. Up-regulation of vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular CAM-1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin expression promotes monocyte recruitment to sites of injury and is considered to be a critical step in atherosclerotic plaque development. Factors that trigger this initial response are not well understood. As platelet activation not only promotes thrombosis but also early stages of atherogenesis, we considered the role of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matricellular protein released in abundance from activated platelets and accumulated in sites of vascular injury, as a regulator of CAM expression. TSP-1 induced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on endothelium of various origins, which in turn, resulted in a significant increase of monocyte attachment. This effect could be mimicked by a peptide derived from the C-terminal domain of TSP-1 and known to interact with CD47 on the cell surface. The essential role of CD47 in the cellular responses to TSP-1 was demonstrated further using inhibitory antibodies and knockdown of CD47 with small interfering RNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that secretion of endogenous TSP-1 and its interaction with CD47 on the cell surface mediates endothelial response to the major proinflammatory agent, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Taken together, this study identifies a novel mechanism regulating CAM expression and subsequent monocyte binding to endothelium, which might influence the development of anti-atherosclerosis therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1982455287,"Fibronectin (Fn) is involved in the early stages of bone formation, and prostaglandin E (PGE) is an important factor regulating osteogenesis. Here we found that PGE2 enhanced extracellular Fn assembly in rat primary osteoblasts, as shown by immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PGE2 also increased the protein levels of Fn by using Western blotting analysis. By using pharmacological inhibitors or activators or genetic inhibition by the EP receptor, antisense oligonucleotides revealed that the EP1 receptor but not other PGE receptors is involved in PGE2-mediated up-regulation of Fn. At the mechanistic level, Ca2+ chelator (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)), phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122), or Src inhibitor (PP2) attenuated the PGE2-induced Fn expression. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GF109203X) also inhibited the potentiating action of PGE2. Furthermore, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides of various PKC isoforms, including α, β, ϵ, and δ, demonstrated that α isozyme plays an important role in the enhancement action of PGE2 on Fn assembly. Flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR showed that PGE2 and 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 (EP1/EP3 agonist) increased the surface expression and mRNA level of α5 or β1 integrins. Fn promoter activity was enhanced by PGE2 and 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 in cells transfected with pGL2F1900-Luc. Cotransfection with dominant negative mutants of PKCα or c-Src inhibited the potentiating action of PGE2 on Fn promoter activity. Local administration of PGE2 or 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 into the metaphysis of the tibia via the implantation of a needle cannula significantly increased the Fn and α5β1 integrin immunostaining and bone volume of secondary spongiosa in tibia. Taken together, our results provided evidence that PGE2 increased Fn and promoted bone formation in rat osteoblasts via the EP1/phospholipase C/PKCα/c-Src signaling pathway.

The ECMs produced by osteoblasts are complex and consist of several different classes of molecules that may regulate the modeling and remodeling of bone. The ECMs also serve as a reservoir for growth factors, including members of the prostaglandins (PGEs) and fibroblast growth factor superfamily (1Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar, 2Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Acting either alone or together, these components of the ECM produced by osteoblasts may subsequently regulate the cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, survival, as well as the rate of bone formation. Fibronectin (Fn) is an extracellular matrix component that is also present as a soluble protein in plasma and other body fluids (3Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The matrix form of Fn is believed to support cell adhesion and migration during embryogenesis, tumor growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, and inflammation (4Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Assembly of soluble Fn into matrix is a multistep process under cellular control (5Mosher D.F. Sottile J. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Among the membrane components implicated in Fn matrix assembly, integrins have been demonstrated to have a central role (6Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Integrins, composed of α and β subunits, are a family of transmembrane receptors mediating adhesion to both ECM and cell surface molecules (7Heino J. Ann. Med. 1993; 25: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). The specific adhesion depends on the interaction between the cell-binding domain of Fn and cell surface integrin receptors. However, the mechanisms regarding how integrins modulate Fn assembly are not well understood. Transfection of α5 integrin and expression of α5β1 integrin by Chinese hamster ovary cells results in a large increase in Fn assembly, whereas α5-deficient Chinese hamster ovary B2 cells failed to assemble plasma Fn into the ECM (9Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Osteoblast differentiation is an essential part of bone formation, because active osteoblasts should be recruited at the site of osteoclastic bone resorption to compensate for the continuous loss of bone matrix and to maintain the structural integrity of the skeletal system. The biology of this process is also of considerable interest when applying therapies to promote bone repair after injury or during disease processes. Furthermore, integrins are involved in the signal transduction of translating the strain in the organic matrix to the biochemical signals in the bone cells (11Juliano R.L. Varner J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the role of cytokine in the cell-matrix interactions in osteoblasts has not been extensively studied. PGEs are considered important local factors that modulate bone metabolism through their effects on osteoblastic cells and osteoclasts (12Kaneki H. Takasugi I. Fujieda M. Kiriu M. Mizuoch S. Ide H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PGE2 is a major eicosanoid produced by osteoblasts. To explain the diverse effects of PGE2, the presence of multiple receptors for PGE2 in osteoblasts was postulated. Recent cloning of four subtypes of PGE receptor has made it possible to analyze the PGE receptor subtypes (EP1–EP4) on osteoblasts (13Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubo F.

Bone. 2001; 28: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EP1 is coupled to Ca2+ mobilization; EP2 and EP4 activate adenylate cyclase, and EP3 inhibits adenylate cyclase (15Watabe A.

Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6463-6466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An EP1 agonist stimulated cell growth, whereas an EP4 agonist reduced cell growth and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells (18Suda M. Tanaka K. Natsui K. Usui T. Tanaka I. Fukushima M. Shigeno C. Konishi J. Narumiya S. Chikawa A. Nakao K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that osteoblasts express multiple subtypes of the PGE receptor and that each subtype might be linked to different actions of PGE2. The distribution of Fn in areas of skeletogenesis suggests that it may be involved in early stages of bone formation (19Moursi A.M. Globus R.K. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2187-2196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of PGE2 on Fn fibrillogenesis in osteoblasts is mostly unknown. Here we found that PGE2 enhanced Fn fibrillogenesis of osteoblasts by increasing the synthesis and assembly of Fn. Furthermore, the increase of clustering of α5 and β1 integrins is involved in the action mechanism of PGE2. EP1 receptor, PI-PLC, PKCα, and c-Src-dependent pathways may be involved in the increase of osteoblast Fn expression and bone formation by PGE2. Materials—Mouse monoclonal antibody for PKCα was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibody for α-tubulin was purchased from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). Protein-A/G beads, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for fibronectin, phosphotyrosine residues (PY20), and c-Src were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for α5, β1, and α5β1 integrin and type I collagen were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). PGE2, 17-phenyl trinor PGE2, butaprost, sulprostone, 11-deoxy-PGE1, and SC19220 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). U73122, U73343, D609, and GF109203X were purchased from Calbiochem. Avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system was purchased from Vector Laboratories. The fibronectin promoter construct (pGL2F1900-Luc) was a gift from Dr. I. S. Kim (Kyungpook National University, Korea). The PKCα dominant negative mutant was a gift from Dr. V. Martin (Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg University, France). The c-Src dominant negative mutant was a gift from Dr. S. Parsons (University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA). pSV-β-galactosidase vector and luciferase assay kit were purchased from Promega (Madison, MA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Primary Osteoblast Cultures—Primary osteoblastic cells were prepared by the method described previously (20Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Liou H.C. Fu W.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The calvaria of fetal rats were dissected from fetal rats, divided into small pieces, and then treated with 0.1% type I collagenase solution for 10 min at 37 °C. The next two 20-min sequential collagenase digestions were then pooled and filtered through 70-μm nylon filters (Falcon). The cells were grown on the plastic cell culture dishes in 95% air, 5% CO2 with α-minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) that was supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (pH adjusted to 7.6). The characteristics of osteoblasts were confirmed by morphology and the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Immunocytochemistry—Osteoblasts were grown on glass coverslips. Cultures were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 15 min at room temperature in phosphate buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS. After blocking with 4% BSA for 15 min, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-rat Fn (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed again and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:150, Leinco Technologies, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h. Finally, cells were washed, mounted, and examined with a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 410) as soon as possible. The mean fluorescence under 10–15 cells (3–5 fields per culture) was measured by using a Zeiss confocal microscope. The focus of the z axis was on the substratum of the monolayer cells. The value for contrast and offset adjustment of confocal microscope was fixed so that the variation of the relative fluorescence of control experiments was rather small. Quantification of Extracellular Immobilized Fn by ELISA—The level of extracellular immobilized Fn was also determined by an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After treatment with PGE2 at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed at room temperature with 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the cultures were then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 15 min before being incubated sequentially with rabbit anti-rat Fn antibody (1:150) for 1 h and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1: 1000) for 30 min. After each incubation, the cells were washed two times with PBS. o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (0.4 mg/ml in phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0; 24.3 mm citric acid; 51.4 mm Na2HPO4·12 H2O; 12% H2O2 (v/v)) was then applied to the cells for 30 min, and 3 m sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm by an ELISA reader (Bio-Tek, Burlington, VA). Each assay was performed in triplicate. Oligonucleotide (ODN) Transfection—Osteoblasts were cultured to confluence; the complete medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing the antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (5 μg/ml) that had been preincubated with Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μg/ml) (LF2000; Invitrogen) for 30 min. The cells were washed after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and washed prior to the addition of medium containing PGE2. All antisense ODNs were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by MDBio (Taipei, Taiwan).

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA Analysis by Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from osteoblasts using a TRIzol kit (MDBio Inc.). The reverse transcription reaction was performed using 2 μg of total RNA that was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and then amplified for 33 cycles using two oligonucleotide primers as follows: EP1 (336 bp), CGCAGGGTTCACGCACACGA and CACTGTGCCGGGAACTACGC; EP2 (369 bp), CCGCGCGTGTACCTATTTCGC and GCTCCGAAGCTGCATGCGAA; EP3 (537 bp), GCCGGGAGAGCAAACGCAAAAA and ACACCAGGGCTTTGATGGTCGCCAGG; EP4 (423 bp), TTCCGCTCGTGGTGCGAGTGTTC and GAGGTGGTGTCTGCTTGGGTCAGGAPDH (452 bp) ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC and TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA (21Yamaguchi T.

PCR products were then separated electrophoretically in a 2% agarose DNA gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The cellular lysates were prepared as described previously (20Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Liou H.C. Fu W.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with specific antibody immobilized onto protein-A/G-Sepharose for 12 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, boiled, and microcentrifuged. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 4% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with rabbit anti-rat antibodies against Fn (1:1500) or c-Src (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the blots were subsequently incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using Kodak X-Omat LS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For normalization purposes, the same blot was also probed with mouse anti-rat α-tubulin antibody (1:1000). Quantitative data were obtained by using a computing densitometer and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Cytosolic Ca2+ with Fluo-3-AM—Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3-AM) was used to measure cytosolic free Ca2+. Cells were incubated for 60 min in the dark at room temperature with fluo-3-AM (4 μm), and the cells were then washed, and cytosolic Ca2+ was measured by FACSCalibur (CellQuest software, BD Biosciences). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 530 nm, respectively. Quantification of Integrin Expression—Osteoblasts were plated in 6-well (35-mm) dishes. The cells were then washed with PBS and detached with trypsin at 37 °C. Cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. After rinsing in PBS, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-rat α5or β1 integrin antibody (1:100) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed again, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary IgG for 45 min, and analyzed by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—Osteoblasts were cotransfected with 1 μg of Fn promoter plasmid and 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector. Osteoblasts were grown to 60% confluence in 12-well plates and were transfected the following day by LF2000, premixed DNA with OPTI-MEM, and LF2000 with OPTI-MEM, respectively, for 5 min. The mixture was then incubated for 25 min at room temperature and added to each well. After a 24-h incubation, transfection was complete, and the cells were incubated with the indicated agents. After 24 h of incubation, the media were removed, and cells were washed once with cold PBS. To prepare lysates, 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well, and cells were scraped from dishes. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. Aliquots of cell lysates (10 μl) containing equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were placed into wells of an opaque black 96-well microplate. An equal volume of luciferase substrate was added to all samples, and luminescence was measured in a microplate luminometer. The luciferase activity value was normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector. In experiments using dominant negative mutants, cells were cotransfected with reporter (0.5 μg) and β-galactosidase (0.25 μg) and either the PKCα or c-Src mutant or the empty vector (1.0 μg). Measurement of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Bone Volume—The local injection of young rats was prepared by the method described previously (23Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Liu S.H. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 73–88 g were used. Implantation of a cannula (22-gauge) was done from the posterolateral side into the proximal tibial metaphysis in both limbs of rats anesthetized with trichloroacetaldehyde. The cannula had its outer end in the subcutaneous tissue. PGE2 or 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 (30 μm, 10 μl) was percutaneously injected into the proximal tibia through the cannula (once/day) for 7 consecutive days. The same volume of vehicle was injected into the contralateral side for comparison. On day 14, the rats were sacrificed, and the tibiae were also removed and cleaned of soft tissue. BMD and BMC of the tibia were measured with a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer (DEXA, XR-26; Norland, Fort Atkinson, WI). The mode adapted to the measurements of small subjects was adopted. A coefficient of variation of 0.7% was calculated from daily measurements of BMD on a lumbar phantom for more than 1 year. The whole tibiae were scanned, and BMD and BMC were measured by absorptiometer. At the end of the program, the tibia was fixed, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (5 μm) were cut longitudinally, and endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated by treatment with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 20 min. The sections were then treated with normal goat serum to block nonspecific binding, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-rat Fn, α5β1 integrin, and type I collagen antibody (1:300) overnight at 4 °C. The sections were detected by avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system and diaminobenzidine. For measurement of bone volume, the sections were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and eosin solution. Images of the growth plate and proximal tibia were photographed by using an Olympus microscope IX70. Measurement of bone volume was performed on the secondary spongiosa, which is located 1.0–3.0 mm distal to epiphyseal growth plate and is characterized by a network of larger trabeculae. Bone volume was calculated using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 3.0) and expressed as percent of bone area. All measurements were done in a single-blind fashion. All protocols complied with institutional guidelines and were approved by Animal Care Committee of Medical College, National Taiwan University. Statistics—The values given are means ± S.E. The significance of difference between the experimental groups and controls was assessed by Student's t test. The difference is significant if the p value was <0.05. PGE2 Enhanced Fn Fibrillogenesis in Cultured Osteoblasts— The fibrillogenesis from the endogenously released Fn by the primary cultured rat osteoblasts was studied using immunocytochemistry. Day 3–5 osteoblasts were changed to serum-free medium and incubated with PGE2 (3 μm) for 24 h. Immunostaining of Fn was examined in 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed and nonpermeabilized cells. The mean immunofluorescence intensity underneath a cell group of 10–15 cells was measured using a confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 1A, osteoblasts are able to form Fn network underneath the cell using endogenously released Fn. Fn fibril formation increased in response to the treatment of PGE2 for 24 h (Fig. 1B). The quantitative data showed a dose-dependent increase of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1C). We also used ELISA to detect extracellular immobilized Fn. PGE2 also increased Fn expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Western blotting was used to examine the effect of PGE2 on the protein levels of Fn. Day 3–5 osteoblasts were changed to serum-free culture medium and treated with PGE2 for 24 h. The cultures were then washed with cold PBS, and protein samples were collected by the addition of lysis buffer without trypsin digestion. The result from Western blotting may contain both soluble cytosolic Fn and extracellular immobilized Fn. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F (PGE2 at 3 μm), PGE2 increased protein levels of Fn in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Involvement of EP1 Receptors in PGE2-mediated Increase of Fn Formation—PGEs exert their effects through interaction with specific EP1–4 receptors (14Weinreb M. Machwate M. Shir N. Abramovitz M. Rodan G.A. Harada S. Bone. 2001; 28: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of EP1–4 subtype receptors in PGE2-mediated increase of Fn formation, we assessed the distribution of these EP subtype receptors in rat primary osteoblasts by RT-PCR analysis. The mRNAs of EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 subtype receptors could be detected in primary rat osteoblasts (Fig. 2A). After PGE2 treatment for 6 h, the mRNA level of EP1 subtype receptor was evidently increased, whereas other subtype EP receptor mRNAs remained unchanged (Fig. 2A). We next examined which EP subtype receptors were involved in the PGE2-mediated increase of Fn formation, and specific inhibition of EP1 receptor expression was accomplished with AS-ODN. It was found that EP1 receptor-specific AS-ODN but not other EP receptor AS-ODN or MM-ODN significantly blocked the PGE2-mediated increase of Fn formation in primary rat osteoblasts (Fig. 2B). To determine the role of EP1 receptor-dependent signaling in the regulation of Fn expression in osteoblasts, the cells were treated with EP1–4-specific agonists, and then the expression level of Fn was examined. Of the agonists tested, only the EP1/EP3-selective receptor agonist, 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 (3 μm), significantly increased the protein level of Fn (Fig. 3A). In contrast, butaprost (EP2 agonist; 10 μm), sulprostone (EP3 agonist; 10 μm), and 11-deoxy-PGE1 (EP2/EP4-selective agonist; 10 μm) failed to up-regulate Fn expression. In addition, treatment of EP1 receptor antagonist SC19220 (10 μm) effectively antagonized the potentiating effect of PGE2 on Fn expression (Fig. 3A). It has been reported that sulprostone also acts on the rat EP1 receptor (26Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We then examined the concentration-dependent effect of sulprostone on the expression of Fn. Treatment of osteoblast with sulprostone did not increase the protein level of Fn unless at a higher concentration of 20 μm. Pretreatment of osteoblasts with EP1 AS-ODN but not EP3 AS-ODN antagonized the potentiating action of 20 μm sulprostone (Fig. 3B). The results shown above using pharmacological treatment or genetic inhibition clearly demonstrated a critical role for the EP1 receptor in the PGE2-mediated increase of Fn formation. It has been reported that activation of EP1 augments intracellular calcium mobilization, which is related to downstream signals (15Watabe A. Sugimoto Y. Honda A. Irie A. Namba T. Negishi M. Ito S. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20175-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then investigated the effect of chelating intracellular Ca2+ on the potentiating action of PGE2 on Fn expression. Pretreatment with BAPTA-AM (0.1–10 μm) for 30 min significantly abrogated PGE2-induced Fn formation (Fig. 3C). The quantitative data are shown in Fig. 3C, lower panels. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the effect of PGE2 on the change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. As shown in Fig. 3D, incubation with PGE2 (3 μm), 17-phenyl trinor PGE2 (3 μm), and sulprostone (20 μm) enhanced the fluorescence intensity of fluo-3. However, sulprostone at 10 μm only slightly increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. ELISA detection also showed that pretreatment of osteoblasts with th"
https://openalex.org/W2106376969,"The G protein-coupled Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) is an allosteric protein that responds to two different agonists, Ca2+ and aromatic amino acids, with the production of sinusoidal or transient oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Here, we examined whether these differing patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations produced by the CaR are mediated by separate signal transduction pathways. Using real time imaging of changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in single cells, we found that stimulation of CaR by an increase in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) leads to periodic synthesis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, whereas l-phenylalanine stimulation of the CaR does not induce any detectable change in the level this second messenger. Furthermore, we identified a novel pathway that mediates transient [Ca2+]i oscillations produced by the CaR in response to l-phenylalanine, which requires the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and involves the small GTPase Rho, heterotrimeric proteins of the G12 subfamily, the C-terminal region of the CaR, and the scaffolding protein filamin-A. Our model envisages that Ca2+ or amino acids stabilize unique CaR conformations that favor coupling to different G proteins and subsequent activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways.

Using real time imaging of changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in single cells, we found that stimulation of CaR by an increase in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) leads to periodic synthesis of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, whereas l-phenylalanine stimulation of the CaR does not induce any detectable change in the level this second messenger. Furthermore, we identified a novel pathway that mediates transient [Ca2+]i oscillations produced by the CaR in response to l-phenylalanine, which requires the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and involves the small GTPase Rho, heterotrimeric proteins of the G12 subfamily, the C-terminal region of the CaR, and the scaffolding protein filamin-A. Our model envisages that Ca2+ or amino acids stabilize unique CaR conformations that favor coupling to different G proteins and subsequent activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways.

Specifically, a major physiological role of the CaR is to correct small changes in [Ca2+]o concentration by regulating parathyroid hormone secretion. The CaR is also expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, brain, pituitary, thyroid, skin, breast, pancreas, lung, bone, and heart (reviewed in Ref. 5Quarles L.D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2003; 12: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor plays additional, yet less well defined, physiological roles in the regulation of cell function (6Brown E.M.

Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms that regulate CaR activity are attracting major attention. Recent studies of CaR activation in individual living cells has shown that intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) oscillates upon stimulation of CaR by an elevation in [Ca2+]o (8Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as sensor of [Ca2+]o, the CaR is also stimulated by aromatic amino acids (10Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 401-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that, like [Ca2+]o, induce striking and lasting CaR-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by these agonists are different. Aromatic amino acid stimulation of the CaR induces repetitive, low frequency [Ca2+]i spikes that return to the base-line level, a pattern known as transient oscillations. In contrast, [Ca2+]o-elicited CaR activation produces high frequency sinusoidal oscillations upon a raised plateau level of [Ca2+]i (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The amplitude, frequency, and duration of [Ca2+]i oscillations are increasingly recognized as encoding important information for a variety of biological processes, and, consequently, there is intense interest in understanding the underlying mechanisms (12Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4190) Google Scholar). Our previous results produced several lines of evidence indicating that PKCs negatively regulate the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by activation of the CaR by increases in [Ca2+]o (11Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that periodic phosphorylation of the CaR by PKCs provides the negative feedback needed to cause [Ca2+]o-induced sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations. Intriguingly, the transient [Ca2+]i oscillations produced by the CaR in response to amino acid stimulation appear to be mediated by a different pathway, but the mechanism(s) involved remained poorly understood. In the present study, we examined whether sinusoidal and transient [Ca2+]i oscillations produced by the CaR in response to Ca2+ or l-phenylalanine are mediated by different pathways. Using real time imaging of changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis and generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in single cells, we found that [Ca2+]o-induced CaR activation leads to periodic synthesis of Ins(1,4,5)P3, whereas l-phenylalanine stimulation of the CaR does not induce any detectable changes in the level of this second messenger. Furthermore, we identified a novel pathway that mediates transient [Ca2+]i oscillations produced by the CaR in response to amino acids, which requires the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and involves the small GTPase Rho, heterotrimeric proteins of the G12 subfamily, the C-terminal distal region of the receptor, and the scaffolding protein filamin-A. Our model envisages that Ca2+ or amino acids induce distinct conformational states of the CaR, providing for the possibility of differential coupling to downstream signaling pathways. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cells and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), generated from doubled knock-out mice for rhodopsin kinase (RK) or G12/13–/– were maintained as described previously (11Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Yuan J. Slice L.W. Gu J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4882-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) of human origin were obtained and maintained as suggested by Clonetics, CA. A cell line constitutively expressing the CaR was established by transfecting HEK-293 with an expression vector encoding the human CaR (pCR3.1-CaR), kindly provided by Dr. Allen Spiegel, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. Transfections of the different plasmids were performed using Lipofectin or Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (14Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Analysis of the cells transiently transfected were performed 24 or 72 (in vitro kinase assay) h posttransfection. Single Cell [Ca2+]i Imaging—[Ca2+]i was measured in cells loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2 as described previously (11Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in saline solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) without phenol red, containing with 138 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 5 μm fura-2/AM for 45–60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed and placed in an experimental chamber, which was perfused with saline solution at 1.5 ml/min at 37 °C. The chamber in turn was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope connected to a digital imaging system. Ratios of images (340 nm excitation/380 nm excitation, emission filter 520 nm) were obtained at 1.5-s intervals. A region of interest covering 15 × 15 μm was defined over each cell, and the average ratio intensity over the region was converted to [Ca2+]i using a calibration curve constructed with a series of calibrated buffered calcium solutions (Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit #2, Molecular Probes, OR). Identification of cells transiently expressing Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, Rho G14V, Fil-A14/15, CaRstop907, or CaR (see “cDNAs”) was achieved by cotransfection with a plasmid encoding wild type green (GFP) or red fluorescent protein (RFP) (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 100 cells/experiment, each experiment done in at least duplicate or triplicate were used to measured [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]i, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and Diacylglycerol Imaging in a Single Live Cell—Simultaneous single live cell imaging of the fluorescent biosensors for [Ca2+]i (PKCα-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)), Ins(1,4,5)P3 (GFP-PHD), and diacylglycerol (PKD-RFP) was achieved by emission fingerprinting with a confocal LSM 510 Meta microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) (nm excitation/nm emission PKCα-YFP: 514/527; GFP-PHD: 488/507; PKD-RFP: 543/583). Culture conditions for live cell imaging and quantitative analysis of the relative change in plasma membrane and cytosol fluorescence intensity of individual cells were performed as described previously (14Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), analyzing 50 cells/experiment, with each experiment done in at least duplicate or triplicate. The selected cells displayed in the figures were representative of 90% of the population of positive cells. Western Blot, PKD Kinase Assays, and Exogenous Substrate Phosphorylation—Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (15Sinnett-Smith J. Lunn J.A. Leopoldt D. Rozengurt E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PKD autophosphorylation was determined in an in vitro kinase assay followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and quantification as described previously (13Yuan J. Slice L.W. Gu J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4882-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Exogenous substrate syntide-2 phosphorylation by PKD was assayed and quantified by Cerenkov counting as previously published (16Yuan J. Slice L.W. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38619-38627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). cDNAs—Primers for the synthesis of the cDNA encoding the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of human phospholipase C (PLC)-δ1 and human PKCα were designed with the Primer3 program (17Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Krawetz S. Misener S. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 365-386Google Scholar). The sense primers for PHD and PKCα were 5′-CCGAATTCACGGCCTACAGGATGATGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCGGGGGGGGACCATGGCTGACGT-3′, respectively, whereas the corresponding antisense primers were 5′-CCGAATTCGGAAGTTCTGCAGCTCCTTG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCGCGCTGGTGAGTTTGCTACTGCACTCTG-3′. Total RNA extracted from human pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells was employed as template for the synthesis of the cDNAs encoding the PHD and PKCα using reverse transcription-PCR (18Rey O. Yuan J. Young S.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23773-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PHD and PKCα were cloned into the EcoRI site of vectors encoding the GFP or YFP, pEGFP-C1 or pEYFP-N1. A cDNA encoding human filamin-A, containing amino acids 1530 through 1875 (14 and 15 domains) (Fil-A14/15), was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA extracted form Panc-1 cells (see above) and the forward/reverse primers 5′-CTTAAGCTTCCATGGTACCCCGGAGCCCC-3′/5′-CGGAATTCCGAGGCCAGGCCCATAGGC-3′. The obtained cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1 myc-His C (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a stop codon after amino acid 906 of the CaSR (CaR stop907) was performed as previously described (14Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with the forward and reverse primers 5′-GGAGGCTCCACGTGATCAACCCCCTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGAGGGGGTTGATCACGTGGAGCCTCC-3′, respectively. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and Western blot analysis. The vectors encoding the fusion protein between protein kinase D (PKD) and a red fluorescent protein (pPKD-RFP), untagged PKD and C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme were described previously (14Rey O.

The cDNA for the constitutively active human Rho G14V was obtained from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center, MO. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-Ser(P)744/Ser(P)748, which specifically recognizes the phosphorylated state of those serines within the activation loop of protein kinase D (PKD), was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The anti-PKCμ antibody (C-20), which recognizes PKD, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-RFP antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. The anti-CaR was obtained from Affinity BioReagents. Fura-2/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. All of the other reagents were the highest grade commercially available. Differential Production of Ins (1,4,5)P3 and Diacylglycerol (DAG) Mediated by the CaR in HEK-293 Cells Stimulated byl-Phenylalanine or [Ca2+]e—Several models have been proposed to explain the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to GPCR activation, but definitive evidence identifying the mechanism(s) involved is available in very few instances. A major advance in this field has been the development of probes that allow the monitoring of the intracellular concentration of the two second messengers generated by PLC activation, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG. To determine whether [Ca2+]o and aromatic amino acids differ in their ability to trigger the synthesis of these second messengers via the CaR, we used a set of biosensors to monitor, in real time and in the same cells, the synthesis of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG simultaneously with [Ca2+]i oscillations. The synthesis of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was monitored by examining the dynamic distribution of a fusion protein between GFP and the PHD of PLC-δ1 (GFP-PHD). This PHD binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate in the plasma membrane but translocates to the cytosol in response to PLC-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 synthesis (19Nash M.S. Young K.W. Willars G.B.

Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DAG synthesis was monitored by imaging a fusion protein consisting of PKD and a red fluorescent protein (PKD-RFP) (14Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PKD is a Ca2+-insensitive serine/threonine kinase that rapidly translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to PLC-mediated DAG production in response to GPCR stimulation (14Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As an indication of [Ca2+]i oscillations, we monitored the cytosol to plasma membrane translocation of a chimeric protein between PKCα,aCa2+- and phospholipid-dependent PKC, and a yellow fluorescent protein (PKCα-YFP) (24Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To examine CaR-mediated changes in second messenger generation in single cells, HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human CaR, a cell system widely used to study CaR regulation (6Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PHD, PKD-RFP, and PKCα-YFP. The cells were subsequently stimulated by increasing the [Ca2+]o to 5 mm (Fig. 1A) or by addition of 5 mm l-phenylalanine (Fig. 1B). The intracellular distribution of the biosensors was monitored simultaneously in live cells using emission fingerprinting. In non-stimulated cells, the Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensor GFP-PHD was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, whereas the DAG sensor PKD-RFP was distributed throughout the cytoplasm but excluded from the nucleus. The distribution of PKCα-YFP was similar to PKD-RFP, i.e. throughout the cytoplasm, although in few cells PKCα-YFP was also present in the nucleus. GFP, RFP, or YFP alone localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (data not shown). [Ca2+]o-elicited CaR stimulation induced an oscillatory translocation of GFP-PHD from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, reflecting periodic production of Ins(1,4,5)P3. These changes coincided with the oscillatory translocation of PKCα-YFP from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. DAG synthesis, monitored by the translocation of its sensor from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, peaked after 3 min. Within 5–6 min of decreasing the [Ca2+]o to the basal level (1.5 mm), the sensors returned to the subcellular compartments they occupied before stimulation (data not shown). In striking contrast to the results obtained with [Ca2+]o stimulation, l-phenylalanine-elicited CaR activation did not induce any detectable synthesis of either Ins(1,4,5)P3 or DAG, as revealed by the lack of redistribution of their corresponding sensors (Fig. 1B). The lack of translocation of the DAG sensor to the plasma membrane was not because of a low level of DAG accumulation. Inhibition of DAG conversion to phosphatidic acid by preventing its phosphorylation with 10 μm diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor I (IC50 = 2.8 μm) or II (IC50 = 120 nm) for 10 min, concurrently with 5 mm l-phenylalanine stimulation, failed to promote any plasma membrane translocation of the DAG sensor (data not shown). However, l-phenylalanine stimulation of the CaR induced a distinct and oscillatory translocation of PKCα-YFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that although both an increase in [Ca2+]o or the addition of l-phenylalanine induce [Ca2+]i oscillations via the CaR, only [Ca2+]o induced periodic synthesis of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG production. These experiments provide strong support for the hypothesis that the CaR mediates sinusoidal or transient patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to different agonists through different mechanisms. Differential Regulation of PKD Activation Loop Phosphorylation and Kinase Activity in Response to CaR Activation by [Ca2+]e or l-Phenylalanine—Recently, we demonstrated that the plasma membrane translocation of PKD, in response to GPCR-induced DAG synthesis, is necessary for PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKD, a critical step in the catalytic activation of this enzyme (23Rey O. Reeve Jr., J.R. Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34361-34372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In view of the results presented in Fig. 1, we predicted that [Ca2+]o-elicited CaR activation should lead to the PKC-mediated activation loop phosphorylation of PKD at Ser744 and Ser748, leading to the catalytic activation of this kinase (25Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that [Ca2+]o-elicited CaR activation induced a striking increase in the phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 of PKD. In contrast, l-phenylalanine did not promote any detectable increase in the activation loop phosphorylation of PKD (Fig. 2A), even in the presence of diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor I or II at a 10 μm final concentration (data not shown). Further support for this conclusion was obtained by measuring PKD autophosphorylation. HEK-293 cells expressing the CaR stimulated with [Ca2+]o or l-phenylalanine were lysed and PKD immunoprecipitated from the extracts. The immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography to detect the prominent 110-kDa band corresponding to autophosphorylated PKD. The results presented in Fig. 2B show that [Ca2+]o, but not l-phenylalanine, induced a marked increase in PKD autophosphorylation activity. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, similar results were obtained when PKD activity in the immunocomplexes was determined by phosphorylation of syntide-2 (27Mochizuki H. Ito T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9143-9147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Méry J. Means A. Dorée M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), a synthetic peptide previously demonstrated to be an excellent substrate for PKD (29Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These results support the notion that an increase in [Ca2+]o and amino acids activate different intracellular signaling pathways via the CaR. Comparable results were obtained using COS-7 cells transiently expressing the CaR (data not shown). Differential Intracellular Ca2+Oscillations Mediated by l-Phenylalanine or [Ca2+]e Stimulation of the CaR—The results presented in Figs. 1 and 2, and our previous studies (9Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), support the notion that [Ca2+]o-elicited CaR activation leads to stimulation of the Gq/PLC pathway leading to the production of sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations. In contrast, the signaling pathways emanating from the CaR activated by l-amino acids that generate base-line [Ca2+]i oscillations remain poorly understood. Consequently, we next focused our attention to the mechanism by which l-amino acids induce [Ca2+]i oscillations through the CaR. To examine CaR-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i in single cells, HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human CaR cDNA were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 and imaged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3A, intracellular Ca2+ imaging revealed that addition of 5 mm l-phenylalanine stimulated striking transient [Ca2+]i oscillations that reached, on average, peaks of 300 nm [Ca2+]i and that each [Ca2+]i peak returned to base-line value (mean frequency of 1.3 ± 0.1 min–1). In contrast, an increase in the [Ca2+]o from 1.8 mm to 5 mm induced a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]i to a new base-line level followed by oscillatory [Ca2+]i fluctuations with a mean frequency of 3.8 ± 0.2 min–1. These sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations ceased when [Ca2+]o was returned to 1.8 mm. We also examined whether the differential effects induced by l-phenylalanine or [Ca2+]o on [Ca2+]i oscillations are observed in cells exposed to other concentrations of these agonists. Addition of l-phenylalanine at 15 mm (rather than 5 mm) or a smaller [Ca2+]o increment (to 2.25 mm instead of 5 mm) also elicited transient and sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations, respectively (Fig. 3A). However, an increase in [Ca2+]o to 2.25 mm instead of 5 mm induced a smaller shift in the [Ca2+]i base line followed by oscillatory [Ca2+]i fluctuations that reached almost identical [Ca2+]i peaks, i.e. 300 nm, to those induced by l-phenylalanine. We next determined the effect of a small increase in [Ca2+]o or that of l-phenylalanine at higher concentrations on DAG accumulation and PKD phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3B, an elevation of [Ca2+]o to 2.25 mm promoted both the translocation of the DAG sensor (arrows) as well as the PKC-dependent activation loop phosphorylation of PKD at Ser744 and Ser748. In contrast, addition of 15 mm l-phenylalanine failed to elicit any detectable translocation of the DAG sensor or PKD phosphorylation at Ser744 and Ser748 (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that the difference in the pattern of signaling induced by l-phenylalanine and [Ca2+]o via the CaR was maintained at different concentrations of these agonists, even when the concentrations of these agonists were adjusted to produce equivalent [Ca2+]i peaks. Specifically, DAG synthesis and PKD activation loop phosphorylation occurred in association with sinusoidal but not transient [Ca2+]i oscillations. In addition to the parathyroid gland, the CaR has also been cloned from the kidneys of humans, rabbits, and rats (30Aida K. Koishi S. Tawata M. Onaya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

While some of these proteoglycans have been shown to modulate the kinetics of assembly as well as fibril diameter (28Svensson L. Oldberg Å. Heinegard D.

Biglycan is also important for bone formation (29Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C.

This tolloid-dependent processing has recently gained in significance with the demonstration that the cleaved propeptide of proLOX accounts for the ras-recision gene activity of this protein (31Palamakumbura A.H.

In addition, four lysyl oxidase-like enzymes are now known, including LOXL, which seems to be essential for elastogenesis (32Liu X. Zhao Y. Gao J. Pawlyk B. Starcher B. Spencer J.A. Yanagisawa H. Zuo J. Li T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and whose precursor has also been shown to be a substrate for BMP-1 in vitro (16Borel A. Eichenberger D.

Another molecule displaying structural homology with the LG domains of laminins is endorepellin, the C-terminal fragment of perlecan. Release of the LG3 domain of endorepellin, which accounts for most of its angiostatic activity, seems to involve tolloid proteinases (25Gonzalez E.M. Reed C.C. Bix G. Fu J. Zhang Y. Gopalakrishnan B.

Also, one of the known ligands of laminin 5 is collagen VII (33Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. van der Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and tolloid proteinases have been shown to cleave the C-propeptide of procollagen VII (18Rattenholl A. Pappano W.N. Koch M. Keene D.R. Kadler K.E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Burgeson R.E. Greenspan D.S. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The tolloid proteinase in Drosophila melanogaster, after which this family of proteinases is named, has been shown to be essential for dorso-ventral patterning during embryogenesis (11Marques G.

The corresponding processing event involves short gastrulation (Sog) protein or its human orthologue chordin (3Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L.

A similar mechanism governs the control of skeletal muscle growth, except that here the tolloid proteinase target is the transforming growth factor-β-like protein itself, myostatin, where the propeptide blocks activity in a latent complex (21Wolfman N.M. McPherron A.C. Pappano W.N. Davies M.V. Song K. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Zhao L. Sebald S.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Moschcovich L. Bernocco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J.S. Kessler E. Eur. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These proteins are devoid of intrinsic enzymatic activity and are thought to act via a direct interaction with substrate, reaching a maximum at approximately one molecule of PCPE per molecule of procollagen (36Moschcovich L. Bernocco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J.S. Kessler E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This mechanism is rather unusual for enzyme activators and raises the question of the specificity of PCPEs, in view of the growing number of functions now attributed to the tolloid proteinases. To address this question, we have characterized the effect of PCPE-1 on a large panel of tolloid proteinase substrates. We demonstrate that C-propeptide cleavage of the fibrillar procollagens is the only BMP-1-dependent activity to be controlled by PCPE-1. In addition, we have probed the structural requirements for the action of PCPE-1 using one of its targets, procollagen III.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we focus on the conditions required for enhancement of BMP-1 activity by PCPE-1. Previously, we and others (36Moschcovich L. Bernocco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J.S. Kessler E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Res. 1986; 6: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have shown that tolloid proteinases and PCPEs act synergistically during C-terminal processing of fibrillar procollagens I and II. Here, we show that this is also the case for procollagen III, at least in the case of BMP-1 and PCPE-1. In contrast, among the other known substrates of BMP-1, we show that cleavage of the pNcollagen α1(V) homotrimer, mini-procollagen VII, the laminin 5 γ2 chain, osteoglycin, prolysyl oxidase, and chordin is not affected by the presence of PCPE-1.The strong specificity of PCPE-1 gives several insights into the mechanisms by which PCPEs enhance the activities of tolloid proteinases. First, it shows that unlike most enzyme activators, PCPE-1 does not enhance BMP-1 through a direct effect on the enzyme. If this were the case, processing of all substrates would be enhanced by PCPE-1, or BMP-1 would have to act through different mechanisms when processing different substrates, which seems unlikely. Data presented here and elsewhere (35Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 52Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggest that a direct substrate-enhancer interaction is a prerequisite for stimulating activity. They do not, however, eliminate the possibility that the enhancer also binds to BMP-1. It should also be noted that there appears to be no link between the catalytic efficiency of BMP-1 and the enhancing activity of PCPE-1, since qualitatively prolysyl oxidase seemed to be the best BMP-1 substrate, while processing was not enhanced by PCPE-1.Second, the observation that PCPEs specifically stimulate C-terminal processing of the fibrillar procollagens suggests that these substrates share common PCPE recognition motifs. Our observation that processing of mini-procollagen VII was unaffected by PCPE-1 shows that the presence of a triple-helical region per se is not sufficient for enhancing activity. This was confirmed by the observed lack of effect of PCPE-1 on N-terminal processing of the procollagen α1(V) homotrimer. We have previously shown (52Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that PCPE-1 binds to sites in both the C-propeptide region as well as elsewhere in the procollagen molecule. Our observation that PCPE-1 continued to enhance BMP-1 processing of mini-procollagen III even when all but the last three Gly-X-Y triplets were removed by bacterial collagenase suggests that one site is located within the region spanning these triplets and the non-helical C-telopeptide region. To investigate possible sequence motifs involved in PCPE-1 binding, amino acid sequences at the triple helix/C-telopeptide/C-propeptide junction were compared for procollagens I, II, and III (Fig. 7). Several possible PCPE-1 binding sites can be identified. These include the proline-rich region at the end of the collagen triple helix, the hydrophobic region at the beginning of the telopeptide region (53Malone J.P. Veis A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15358-15366Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the hydrophilic region containing the cross-linking lysine (absent from the proα2(I) chain), and the tyrosine-containing region immediately N-terminal to the BMP-1 cleavage site. Future studies will address the relative contributions of these sequences to PCPE-1 binding.Third, we demonstrate here that enhancing activity, unlike BMP-1 activity, requires a native three-dimensional structure of the substrate. PCPE-1 therefore recognizes not only a specific region of the amino acid sequence but also structural features in the substrate that are lost on denaturation. Whether these features are contained in individual procollagen chains or imply a trimeric organization is another interesting question. Also, since the C-telopeptide sequence of the proα2(I) chain is shorter than the α1 chains of procollagens I-III (Fig. 7), it is possible that not all α chains in heterotrimeric procollagens are equivalent for PCPE action.Finally, we previously suggested (52Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that PCPE-1 induces a conformational change in the substrate molecule which makes it more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by tolloid proteinases. Another hypothesis has been put forward by Steiglitz and coworkers (37Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), based on electron microscopy and binding data, whereby PCPEs prevent nonspecific binding of tolloid proteinases to unproductive sites (remote from the cleavage site) within the main triple-helical region of the procollagen molecule. This was based on the observation that PCPEs seem to bind to multiple sites throughout the procollagen molecule and displace tolloid proteinases bound to the collagenous region. Our observation that both mini-procollagen III and collagenase-treated mini-procollagen III behaved like full-length procollagen III, in terms of BMP-1 processing and enhancement by PCPE-1, argues against the latter hypothesis. According to this theory, mini-procollagen III with supposedly fewer unproductive sites than full-length procollagen III would be cleaved at a higher rate by BMP-1 and be little affected by PCPE-1. Also, maximum enhancement activity appears to occur at a PCPE: procollagen molar ratio of 1:1 (35Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 52Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), while the multiple binding site displacement hypothesis (37Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) would presumably require a large molar excess of PCPE for maximum enhancement.To our knowledge, the use of a specific enhancer/inhibitor to modulate the substrate choice of a proteinase with broad substrate specificity is rather unique in the field of enzymology. Another example linked to tolloid proteinases is twisted gastrulation (Tsg) that has been shown to enhance activity as well as to modify the pattern of chordin cleavage by BMP-1/mTld (47Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Maas S.A. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). While Tsg appears to have a specific role in stabilizing the chordin/growth factor complex, whether it affects cleavage of other tolloid proteinase substrates is unknown. Although we found no evidence that PCPE-1 modifies the site of BMP-1 cleavage in the different substrates tested, the complementary functions of Tsg and PCPEs emphasize the need to adjust tolloid proteinase activity in different morphogenetic processes such as embryonic growth or wound healing. In bacteria, an equivalent but unrelated system has been described for the ClpXP protease that belongs to a family of ATP-dependent proteases related to the 26 S proteasome of eukaryotes (54Sauer R.T. Bolon D.N. Burton B.M. Burton R.E. Flynn J.M. Grant R.A. Hersch G.L. Joshi S.A. Kenniston J.A. Levchenko I. Neher S.B. Oakes E.S. Siddiqui S.M. Wah D.A. Baker T.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In this system, which is designed to prevent the unwanted degradation of cellular proteins, the proteinase selects its substrates through the recognition of a specific amino acid sequence and through adaptor proteins that up- or down-regulate degradation of defined proteins. The use of adaptor proteins to finely tune action of multisubstrate proteinases might thus be more widespread than has been recognized so far.In conclusion, PCPEs therefore define a new class of extracellular enzyme adaptors that enhance the activity of a multisubstrate proteinase in a substrate-specific manner. Future work will focus on the elucidation of this unique mechanism of enhancement and on the identification of sites involved in the interaction with major fibrillar procollagens. IntroductionIn recent years, it has become clear that members of the tolloid family of metalloproteinases (BMP-1, 1The abbreviations used are: BMP-1, bone morphogenetic protein-1; mTld, mammalian tolloid; mTLL, mammalian tolloid-like; PCP, procollagen C-proteinase; PCPE, PCP enhancer; LOX, lysyl oxidase; Tsg, twisted gastrulation. mTld, mTLL-1, mTLL-2) are key players in morphogenesis through their ability to control and synchronize the processing of multiple extracellular substrates (1Kessler E.

Also called procollagen C-proteinases, tolloid proteinases trigger collagen fibril formation in the extracellular matrix (26Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem.

While some of these proteoglycans have been shown to modulate the kinetics of assembly as well as fibril diameter (28Svensson L. Oldberg Å. Heinegard D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: S23-S28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), functional differences between mature and precursor forms are not yet clearly established (24Ge G.

Biglycan is also important for bone formation (29Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and more recently, dentin matrix protein-1, a protein involved in mineralization, has been found to be a substrate for tolloid proteinases (22Steiglitz B.M. Ayala M. Narayanan K. George A. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 980-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Another important function early attributed to tolloid proteinases is the maturation of the precursor form of lysyl oxidase (LOX) (5Panchenko M.V.

This tolloid-dependent processing has recently gained in significance with the demonstration that the cleaved propeptide of proLOX accounts for the ras-recision gene activity of this protein (31Palamakumbura A.H.

In addition, four lysyl oxidase-like enzymes are now known, including LOXL, which seems to be essential for elastogenesis (32Liu X. Zhao Y. Gao J. Pawlyk B. Starcher B. Spencer J.A. Yanagisawa H. Zuo J. Li T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and whose precursor has also been shown to be a substrate for BMP-1 in vitro (16Borel A. Eichenberger D.

Another molecule displaying structural homology with the LG domains of laminins is endorepellin, the C-terminal fragment of perlecan. Release of the LG3 domain of endorepellin, which accounts for most of its angiostatic activity, seems to involve tolloid proteinases (25Gonzalez E.M. Reed C.C. Bix G. Fu J. Zhang Y. Gopalakrishnan B.

Also, one of the known ligands of laminin 5 is collagen VII (33Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. van der Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and tolloid proteinases have been shown to cleave the C-propeptide of procollagen VII (18Rattenholl A. Pappano W.N. Koch M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11434-11442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The tolloid proteinase in Drosophila melanogaster, after which this family of proteinases is named, has been shown to be essential for dorso-ventral patterning during embryogenesis (11Marques G.

The corresponding processing event involves short gastrulation (Sog) protein or its human orthologue chordin (3Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L.

A similar mechanism governs the control of skeletal muscle growth, except that here the tolloid proteinase target is the transforming growth factor-β-like protein itself, myostatin, where the propeptide blocks activity in a latent complex (21Wolfman N.M.

These proteins are devoid of intrinsic enzymatic activity and are thought to act via a direct interaction with substrate, reaching a maximum at approximately one molecule of PCPE per molecule of procollagen (36Moschcovich L.

This mechanism is rather unusual for enzyme activators and raises the question of the specificity of PCPEs, in view of the growing number of functions now attributed to the tolloid proteinases. To address this question, we have characterized the effect of PCPE-1 on a large panel of tolloid proteinase substrates. We demonstrate that C-propeptide cleavage of the fibrillar procollagens is the only BMP-1-dependent activity to be controlled by PCPE-1. In addition, we have probed the structural requirements for the action of PCPE-1 using one of its targets, procollagen III."

In tracheal smooth muscle, agonist-induced actin polymerization is mediated by activation of neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp) and the Arp (actin-related protein) 2/3 complex, and activation of the small GTPase Cdc42 regulates the activation of N-WASp. In the present study, the role of the adapter protein CrkII in the regulation of N-WASp and Cdc42 activation, actin polymerization, and tension development in smooth muscle tissues was evaluated. Stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle tissues with acetylcholine increased the association of CrkII with N-WASp. Plasmids encoding wild type CrkII or a CrkII mutant lacking the SH3 effector-binding ability, CrkII SH3N, were introduced into tracheal smooth muscle tissues, and the tissues were incubated for 2 days to allow for protein expression. Expression of the CrkII SH3N mutant in smooth muscle tissues inhibited the association of CrkII with N-WASp and the activation of Cdc42. The CrkII SH3N mutant also inhibited the increase in the association of N-WASp with Arp2, a major component of the Arp2/3 complex, in response to contractile stimulation, indicating inhibition of N-WASp activation. Expression of the CrkII SH3N mutant also inhibited tension generation and actin polymerization in response to contractile stimulation; however, it did not inhibit myosin light chain phosphorylation. These results suggest that CrkII plays a critical role in the regulation of N-WASp activation, perhaps by regulating the activation of Cdc42, and that it thereby regulates actin polymerization and active tension generation in tracheal smooth muscle.

CrkII is a member of a family of adapter proteins, which are composed of one Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; N-WASp, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; Arp, actin-related protein; PBD, p21-activated kinase binding domain; ACh, acetylcholine; G-actin, globular actin; F-actin, filamentous actin; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MLC, myosin light chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; N-WASp, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; Arp, actin-related protein; PBD, p21-activated kinase binding domain; ACh, acetylcholine; G-actin, globular actin; F-actin, filamentous actin; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MLC, myosin light chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. and various numbers of SH3 domains and have no functional motifs (1Birge R.B.

The SH2 domain of these proteins recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and the SH3 domain associates with poly-proline (PXXP) containing motifs (3Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

These adaptor proteins, which also include the proteins Nck and Grb2, are thus capable of forming selective multiprotein complexes that couple distinct signal transduction proteins to protein complexes that mediate core functions of the cell (4Feller S.M.

These studies suggest that both actin polymerization and contractile protein activation are required for tension development in smooth muscle.The actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex, a 7-component protein complex, promotes the nucleation of new actin filaments in vitro and in a number of motile cell types (19Rohatgi R.

We have found that contractile stimulation of smooth muscle increases the association of N-WASp with Arp2, a major component of the Arp2/3 complex, and that the activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASp regulates actin polymerization in smooth muscle (15Zhang W.

Grb2 has also been shown to act as an N-WASp effector in systems of purified proteins in vitro, leading to actin assembly via the N-WASp·Arp2/3 complex (28Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I.

We have previously shown that contractile stimulation of smooth muscle tissues induces tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and that tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin increases its association with the adapter protein CrkII (12Tang D.D.

Physiol. 2001; 91: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression of non-phosphorylatable paxillin mutants in smooth muscle inhibits the association of endogenous paxillin with CrkII and inhibits actin polymerization in response to contractile stimulation (12Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which paxillin phosphorylation mediates actin polymerization in smooth muscle, and the possible role of CrkII in this process in smooth muscle in particular, or in eukaryotic cells in general, is not understood.The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of CrkII in the regulation of N-WASp activation, actin polymerization, and force generation in smooth muscle tissues. We hypothesized that CrkII may couple phosphorylated paxillin to N-WASp and thereby provide a mechanism for the initiation of actin polymerization by external stimuli in smooth muscle. Our results demonstrate that CrkII plays an essential role in regulating N-WASp activation, actin polymerization, and tension development during the contractile stimulation of smooth muscle tissues with acetylcholine. We also found that CrkII regulates the activation of Cdc42 and the association of Cdc42 with N-WASp. These observations suggest that CrkII may regulate N-WASp activation in this tissue by regulating the activation of Cdc42.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Smooth Muscle Tissues—Mongrel dogs (20–25 kg) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg, intravenously) and quickly exsanguinated. A 12- to 15-cm segment of extra-thoracic trachea was immediately removed and immersed in physiological saline solution at 22 °C (composition in mm: 110 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 25.8 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 5.6 glucose). The solution was aerated with 95%O2-5%CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.4. Rectangular strips of tracheal muscle 0.6–0.7 mm in diameter and 8–10 mm in length were dissected from the trachea after removal of the epithelium and connective tissue layer. The use of an appropriately sized strip was critical for maintaining muscle contractility during the incubation period and for the successful introduction of plasmids throughout the muscle strip. Each muscle strip was placed in physiological saline solution at 37 °C in a 25-ml organ bath and attached to a Grass force transducer. At the beginning of each experiment, maximal force development was determined by increasing muscle length progressively during successive contractions until the force of active contraction in response to a contractile stimulus reached a maximum.Plasmids encoding recombinant proteins or oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were introduced into muscle strips according to the experimental procedures described below. Muscle strips were then incubated for 2 days with plasmids in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The strips were then returned to physiological saline solution at 37 °C in 25-ml organ baths and attached to Grass force transducers for the measurement of isometric force. For biochemical analysis, muscle strips were frozen using liquid N2-cooled tongs and then pulverized under liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle.Introduction of Plasmids Encoding Recombinant Proteins or ODNs into Tracheal Smooth Muscle Tissues—Plasmids encoding wild type CrkII or SH3N CrkII mutant (cysteine is substituted for tryptophan 109) have been previously described (35Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). cDNA constructs for wild type Cdc42 and the Asn-17 Cdc42 dominant negative mutants have been previously described (36Allen W.E.

Escherichia coli (Bluescript) transformed with these plasmids were grown in LB medium, and plasmids were purified by alkaline lysis with SDS (maxipreparation) or by a kit from Invitrogen (S.N.A.P. #K1910-01).Antisense ODNs with the following sequence were designed to suppress endogenous CrkII expression in canine tracheal muscle tissues: 5′-TCACTCCACTACCCTGCC-3′. The following sequence of sense oligonucleotides was used as a control: 5′-GGCAGGGTAGTGGAGTGA-3′. Based on sequence-matching results obtained from The National Center for Biotechnology Information, these sequences are not homologous to sequences of any other contractile proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, or adapter proteins. The ODNs were fully phosphorothiolated to enhance their intracellular stability in smooth muscle cells and were synthesized and purified by GenoMechanix, L.L.C., Gainsville, FL.Plasmids carrying recombinant proteins or ODNs were introduced into the smooth muscle strips by reversible permeabilization (also referred to as chemical loading) using methods we have previously described (12Tang D.D.

The strips were placed in 0.5-ml tubes and incubated successively in each of the following solutions: Solution 1 (at 4 °C for 120 min) containing 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2 ATP, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm TES; Solution 2 (at 4 °C overnight) containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm TES, and 10 μg/ml plasmids; Solution 3 (at 4 °C for 30 min) containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Na2ATP, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm TES; and Solution 4 (at 22 °C for 60 min) containing 110 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 25.8 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, and 5.6 mm dextrose. Solutions 1–3 were maintained at pH 7.1 and aerated with 100% O2. Solution 4 was maintained at pH 7.4 and aerated with 95%O2-5%CO2. After 30 min in Solution 4, CaCl2 was added gradually to reach a final concentration of 2.4 mm. The strips were then incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm Na2ATP, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml plasmids or 10 μm ODNs. We have previously shown that transfection efficiencies of >90% are achieved in smooth muscle tissues using this reversible permeabilization method (12Tang D.D. Turner C.E. Gunst S.J. J.

Each sample was centrifuged for the collection of supernatant, and the supernatant was then boiled in sample buffer (1.5% dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose, after which the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 2% gelatin for 1 h and probed with monoclonal antibody to CrkII (clone 22, BD Biosciences) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with metavinculin/vinculin polyclonal antibody (custom-prepared by BABCO, Richmond, CA).Assessment of Cdc42 Activation—The activation of Cdc42 was determined by using an assay kit (BK034) from Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO. Pulverized muscle tissues were mixed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sucrose, and 50% glutathione beads for 15 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm, 5 min, and 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were reacted with GST-tagged p21-activated kinase-PBD (p21-activated kinase binding domain) in a binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 2% Nonidet P-40) followed by the addition of 50% glutathione beads. Active and GTP-bound Cdc42 selectively binds to p21-activated kinase-PBD tagged with GST, which can be affinity-precipitated by glutathione beads. The pelleted beads were collected after centrifugation at 7,000 rpm, 3 min, and 4 °C. The pellet was boiled in sample buffer (1.5% dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Blots of the samples were incubated with Cdc42 antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by ECL.Permeabilization of Muscle Tissues with α-Toxin and Measurement of Tension in Response to Stimulation with Ca2+—Muscle tissues were permeabilized with α-toxin as previously described (39Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C874-C883Crossref Google Scholar). For the measurement of isometric force in response to intracellular Ca2+, α-toxin-permeabilized muscle strips were mounted in tissue baths in relaxing solution (pCa 9), attached to force transducers (model GM-2, Gould), and stimulated for 15 min with a contracting solution containing 10-5m free Ca2+ (pCa 5) of the following composition: (in mm) 8.5 Na2ATP, 4 K+-Ca2+-EGTA, 1 DTT, 10 sodium creatine phosphate, 20 imidazole, 8.9 magnesium acetate, 100.5 potassium acetate, and 1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (pH 7.1).Analysis of Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—Muscle strips were rapidly frozen at desired time points after contractile stimulation and then immersed in acetone containing 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm DTT that was precooled with dry ice. Strips were thawed in acetone-trichloroacetic acid-DTT at room temperature and then washed 4 times with acetone-DTT. Proteins were extracted for 60 min in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris base, 22 mm glycine, and 10 mm DTT. Myosin light chains (MLCs) were separated by glycerol-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk and incubated with polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit MLC 20 antibody. The primary antibody was reacted with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (ICN). Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated bands of MLCs were visualized by ECL and quantified by scanning densitometry. MLC phosphorylation was calculated as the ratio of phosphorylated MLCs to total MLCs.Assessment of Paxillin Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (ICN) (33Tang D.

Briefly, each of the smooth muscle strips was homogenized in 200 μl of F-actin stabilization buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% antifoam C, 1 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.015 mm leupeptin, 0.01 m benzamidine, 0.004 mm tosyl arginine methyl ester). The supernatants of protein extracts were collected after centrifugation at 151,000 × g for 60 min at 30 °C. The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold distilled H2O plus 10 μm cytochalasin D and then incubated on ice for 1 h to dissociate F-actin. The resuspended pellets were gently mixed every 15 min. The supernatant of the resuspended pellets was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 rpm, 2 min at 4 °C. Equal volumes of the first supernatant (G-actin) or second supernatant (F-actin) were subjected to analysis by immunoblot using anti-actin antibody. The amount of F-actin and G-actin was determined by scanning densitometry.Assessment of Protein Interactions by Co-immunoprecipitation— Muscle extracts containing equal amounts of protein were precleared for 30 min with 50 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The precleared extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. The extracts were incubated 2–3 h with goat polyclonal antibody against N-WASp (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated for 2 h with 125 μl of a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads conjugated to rabbit anti-goat Ig. Immunocomplexes were washed four times in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. All procedures of immunoprecipitation were performed at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were divided into two parts; the lower part was probed with monoclonal antibody for CrkII (BD Biosciences), stripped, and reprobed with polyclonal Arp2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal Cdc42 antibody (BD Biosciences). The upper part was probed with N-WASp antibody. Proteins were quantitated by scanning densitometry of immunoblots.Statistical Analysis—All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Comparison among multiple groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by post test (Tukey's multiple comparison test). Differences between pairs of groups were analyzed by Student-Newman-Keuls test or Dunn's method. Values of n refer to the number of experiments used to obtain each value. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.RESULTSContractile Stimulation Increases the Interaction of CrkII with N-WASp in Smooth Muscle Strips—We evaluated the effect of contractile stimulation on the interaction of CrkII with N-WASp in smooth muscle tissues. Tracheal smooth muscle strips were stimulated with 10-5m ACh for 5 min, or they were unstimulated. Extracts of these smooth muscle strips were immunoprecipitated with N-WASp antibody. Blots of N-WASp immunoprecipitates and corresponding supernatants were probed using CrkII antibody, stripped, and reprobed with N-WASp antibody. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the other signaling molecules protein kinase Cα and Rho are not found in the N-WASp immunoprecipitates, indicating that the immunoprecipitates have relatively high selectivity for CrkII (25Tang D.D.

https://openalex.org/W2160218726,"Conkunitzin-S1 (Conk-S1) is a 60-residue neurotoxin from the venom of the cone snail Conus striatus that interacts with voltage-gated potassium channels. Conk-S1 shares sequence homology with Kunitz-type proteins but contains only two out of the three highly conserved cysteine bridges, which are typically found in these small, basic protein modules. In this study the three-dimensional structure of Conk-S1 has been solved by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The solution structure of recombinant Conk-S1 shows that a Kunitz fold is present, even though one of the highly conserved disulfide cross-links is missing. Introduction of a third, homologous disulfide bond into Conk-S1 results in a functional toxin with similar affinity for Shaker potassium channels. The affinity of Conk-S1 can be enhanced by a pore mutation within the Shaker channel pore indicating an interaction of Conk-S1 with the vestibule of potassium channels.

(1Pardi A. Wagner G. Wuthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) or the dendrotoxins (2Dreyer F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 115: 93-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are small, basic proteins that contain three highly conserved disulfide bonds. The three disulfide cross-links make these extracellular proteins extremely stable. Two different general functions are known for the different Kunitz proteins. One group, including BPTI, consists of potent protease inhibitors. The complex of BPTI and trypsin is exceptionally stable, with an association constant >1013 m–1 (3Vincent J.P. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2967-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The dendrotoxins belong to another group of Kunitz peptides found in the venom of the black mamba, which block different potassium channels with a high degree of specificity and selectivity (4Imredy J.P. MacKinnon R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In snake and scorpion venoms a diverse set of different potassium channel blockers have been characterized (2Dreyer F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 115: 93-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the great variety of toxins from the venoms of the predatory cone snails, relatively few have been identified so far that interact with potassium channels (5Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Most conotoxins are small, peptidic toxins that typically contain 10–30 amino acids and bind with high affinity and specificity to various ligand- or voltage-gated ion channels. One striking feature of these peptides is that they usually contain a diverse complement of posttranslational modifications, like C-terminal amidation, hydroxyprolines, or glycosylation of serine or threonine (6Craig A.G. Bandyopadhyay P. Olivera B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Conotoxins can be broadly divided into two groups, the non-disulfide-rich peptides and the disulfide-rich conotoxins. The latter conotoxins are further separated into several families based on cysteine bridge pattern and biological activities (5Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The potassium channel-targeted toxin conkunitzin-S1 (Conk-S1) from the venom of Conus striatus is the first member of a new family of polypeptides. Recently it has been shown that Conk-S1 blocks Shaker potassium channels with an IC50 of less than 100 nm. 2J. S. Imperial, N. Silverton, B. M. Olivera, P. K. Bandyopadhyay, A. Sporning, M. Ferber, and H. Terlau, submitted for publication. Compared with most toxins from Conus venoms, Conk-S1 is unusually long (60 amino acids). The only post-translational modification of this peptide is the amidation of the C-terminal carboxylic acid. Conk-S1 shares 33% sequence identity with BPTI and 35% with dendrotoxin I, indicating that it belongs to the Kunitz domain family of proteins (see Table I). Therefore we do not use the term “conotoxin” for Conk-S1, which is restricted to smaller disulfide-rich peptide toxins from cone snails.Table IAmino acid sequence of Conk-S1 and alignment with selected Kunitz domain proteins Open table in a new tab One striking difference between Conk-S1 and other native Kunitz-type proteins is that it contains only four cysteine residues, resulting in only two disulfide bridges instead of the three found in all other native proteins that have been biochemically characterized in this group. The homologous cysteine residues of BPTI and dendrotoxin I are replaced by Gly16 and Gln40 of Conk-S1. Therefore, Conk-S1 is a Kunitz domain protein in which one of the highly conserved disulfide bridges is missing. Here we present the NMR-derived solution structure of recombinant Conk-S1; these data demonstrate that structurally, Conk-S1 is a Kunitz domain protein. We show that the heterologously expressed peptide with a free carboxylic acid at the C terminus is fully functional compared with the natural amidated form of Conk-S1. Conk-S1 represents the first three-dimensional structure of a native Kunitz-type protein with only two disulfide bonds. To evaluate the functional importance of the “missing” third disulfide bond, these cysteine residues have been introduced into Conk-S1. The functional data obtained indicate that this third disulfide bond does not affect the biological function of Conk-S1, i.e. blocking of its target potassium channel. Protein Preparation—Conk-S1 and Conk-S1 with an additional C–C bridge, Conk-S1CC, were expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble intein fusion proteins. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride and refolded by removal of the denaturant via dialysis. After intein cleavage triggered by a pH change (7Mathys S. Evans T.C. Chute I.C. Wu H. Chong S. Benner J. Liu X.Q. Xu M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) the released peptides were further purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Mass Spectrometry—For electrospray quadrupole mass spectrometry the source capillary was set to 2.94 kV. Scans were acquired in positiveion mode at m/z 500–2500. NMR Sample Preparation—NMR spectra were recorded from two samples, which contained either 0.5 mm15N-labeled or 1 mM 15N/13C-labeled Conk-S1 in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, with 10% 2H2O. Dipolar couplings were measured from an anisotropic sample, in which the peptide was partially aligned. It contained 0.5 mm15N/13C-labeled Conk-S1 in 85.5% 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, 9.5% 2H2O, 4.3% pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E5), and 0.7% n-hexanol. The nematic phase was formed after vigorous mixing (8Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). NMR Resonance Assignment and Structure Calculation—All spectra were recorded at 27 °C on Bruker 600, 700, 800, or 900 MHz spectrometers equipped with shielded gradient triple resonance probes. For the backbone and side chain assignment the standard heteronuclear (1H, 13C, 15N) strategy based on three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HCCNH-TOCSY, CCONH-TOCSY, and HCCH-TOCSY experiments was used (9Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 542-553Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The backbone resonance assignment was achieved automatically with the assignment program MARS (10Jung Y.S. Zweckstetter M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). 3JHN-HA coupling constants were obtained using two-dimensional CT-HMQC-J spectra and were converted to Φ torsion angles with the empirical Karplus equation (11Pardi A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). χ1 torsion angles were gained from two-dimensional HNCG spectra (12Hu J.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The program TALOS was used to obtain the backbone dihedral angles (Φ and ψ) on the basis of chemical shift information (13Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY (120 ms mixing time) and 13C-edited NOESY spectra (128 ms mixing time). The NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe, NMRDraw (14Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar), and SPARKY. 3T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CA. The NOE spectra were automatically peak picked and integrated with SPARKY. NOE cross-peaks were assigned both manually and automatically by the programs ARIA2alpha (15Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and CYANA (16Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Unambiguous cross-peak assignments with a range of 1.8 to 5 Å set by CYANA were used for the final structure calculations. Residual 1DN-H, 1DCA-HA, 1DN-C, and 1DC-CA dipolar couplings were gained from the difference between the J couplings measured in the aligned and isotropic media. 1JN-H and 1JN-C couplings were measured simultaneously from interleaved three-dimensional TROSY-HNCO spectra and 1J and 1CA-HA JCA-C were obtained simultaneously from interleaved three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH spectra. 4Vijayan, V., and Zweckstetter, M. (2005) J. Magn. Reson. 174, 245–253. The magnitude (normalized to 1DN-H) and rhombicity of the alignment tensor were 13.0 Hz and 0.38, respectively, as determined from the histogram of dipolar couplings by the program PALES (17Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Initially, a medium resolution structure was calculated with the program Rosetta NMR (18Simons K.T. Kooperberg C. Huang E. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) based on dipolar couplings and chemical shift information and applying the ITAS approach (19Jung Y.S. Sharma M. Zweckstetter M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 3479-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This structure was used as a starting point for calculation of a high-resolution structure using either CNS Solve 1.1 (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), interfaced with ARIA2alpha or CYANA 2.0.32. Finally a simulated annealing protocol with 7 iterations were performed with CYANA. In the last a total of 20 structures were calculated. The 20 structures were further refined in explicit water (21Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and were used for the statistics. A total of 551 NOEs, 365 of them short range (|i – j| ≤ 1), 73 medium range (1 < |i – j| < 5), and 113 long range (|i – j| ≥ 5) NOEs, 201 dipolar couplings, 126 dihedral angles, and two disulfide bridge constraints were used in structure calculations. Electrophysiological Measurements—To study the effects of the wild type and mutants of Conk-S1 with the Shaker potassium channel the Xenopus oocyte expression system was used. Oocyte preparation and Shaker RNA injection were performed as described by Jacobsen et al. (22Jacobsen R.B. Koch E.D. Lange-Malecki B. Stocker M. Verhey J. Van Wagoner R.M. Vyazovkina A. Olivera B.M. Terlau H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24639-24644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp control using a Turbo-Tec amplifier (NPI Instruments, Tamm, Germany). The intracellular electrodes were filled with 2 m KCl and had a resistance between 0.4 and 1 mΩ. Current records were low-pass filtered at 1 KHz (–3 db) and sampled at 4 kHz. The bath solution was normal frog Ringer's containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 (NaOH). All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (19–22 °C). Toxin-containing solutions were applied continuously during the whole experiment from a reservoir through a silicon tube directly into the bath chamber. Whole-cell currents at a test potential of 0 mV were measured every 15 s during toxin application. The IC50 values of Conk-S1 and of Conk-S1CC were calculated from the reduction of whole-cell currents at a test potential of 0 mV obtained from oocytes expressing Shaker potassium channel according to the relationship IC50 = fc/(1 – fc)[Tx], where fc is the fractional current and [Tx] is the toxin concentration. Data are given as means ± the standard deviation (r.m.s.d.). The kon and koff values were obtained by an exponential fit [y = y0 + A*exp(–k*x)] to the experimental data during decrease and increase of the current, obtained during the wash-in and wash-out of the peptide. This is possible because the “on” reaction is pseudo first order, due to the constant toxin concentration, and the “off” reaction is first order. Resonance Assignment and Tertiary Structure—The 15N HSQC of Conk-S1 displayed an excellent chemical shift dispersion indicative of a well folded, rigid protein (data not shown). Backbone resonances for all residues except Gly39 and Tyr51 could be identified in the 15N HSQC spectrum. In total 96.97% of the backbone resonances and 91.63% of the side chain chemical shifts have been assigned. The superposition of the 20 structures with the lowest total energy is shown in Fig. 1. The quality of the solution structures is summarized in supplemental Table 1. In the Ramachandran plot 88.2% of the dihedral angles appear in the most favorable region and 9.8% in the additionally allowed region. For all heavy atoms the root mean square deviation to the mean structure is 1.4 Å, and for the backbone atoms it is 0.7 Å. Side chains are well defined, as can be seen from Fig. 1b. Steady state heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs for most of the Conk-S1 backbone amides are above 0.6 indicating that the backbone of Conk-S1 is well ordered in solution (data not shown). Only Thr60 and Ala19 are flexible with 15N{1H} NOE values of 0.22 and 0.15, respectively, and the three N-terminal residues are affected by motion. Ala19 is located in the region homologous to the antiprotease loop of BPTI and is close to the “missing” third disulfide bond, which would be between the position Gly16 and Gln40. The solution structure of Conk-S1 resembles the typical Kunitz-type fold. It consists of a 310-helix of residues 6–8, a twisted β-hairpin of residues 20–36, and an α-helix of residues 50–56. The two helices are connected by the disulfide bridge between Cys7 and Cys57. The C-terminal helix is also connected to the β-sheet by the disulfide bridge between Cys32 and Cys53. The disulfide bridge 7–57 was confirmed by four direct NOE contacts between these residues. For the other S–S pairing no direct contact could be observed. In this case NOEs between Cys32 and Gln54, and other long range NOEs between residues close to the cysteines were used to confirm the cysteine bridge. To verify that the disulfide bonds were actually formed, electrospray quadrupole mass spectra were recorded. The theoretical masses of Conk-S1 and Conk-S1CC without disulfide bridge formation would be 6933.6 and 6954.7 Da, respectively. The masses measured for Conk-S1 and Conk-S1CC were 6929.3 ± 0.8 Da and 6948.2 ± 0.9 Da, consistent with the formation of two disulfide bonds in the wild type and three disulfide bonds in the mutant Conk-S1. Functional Characterization with Voltage Clamp Experiments—Since the recombinant Conk-S1 does not contain the amidated C terminus observed in the native peptide, the affinity of the recombinant peptide on Shaker potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes was measured. The functionality of the Conk-S1 with the free acid at the C terminus was assayed by two-electrode voltage clamp measurements. For these experiments the Shaker potassium channel with removed N-terminal inactivation (Shaker-Δ6–46) was used. Fig. 2 shows that this channel was blocked by Conk-S1 with an IC50 value of 502 ± 140 nm (n = 3). Since it has been reported that κ-conotoxin PVIIA and κM-conotoxin RIIIK, which are both also blocking Shaker potassium channels, showed an increase in affinity when tested on a are pore mutant of this channel (K427D), the functional effects of Conk-S1 on this mutated Shaker channel was also investigated. Most interestingly the affinity of Conk-S1 for this mutant was 0.22 ± 0.08 nm (n = 4), which is more than 2000-fold higher than for the wild type channel (see Fig. 2). This result indicates that Conk-S1 blocks potassium channels by interacting with the ion channel pore. Furthermore it underscores the importance of residue 427, located in the outer vestibule of the ion permeation pathway, for the binding of different conotoxins to potassium channels. All Kunitz domain proteins functionally analyzed so far contain three disulfide bridges. To evaluate the importance of the “missing” disulfide bridge in Conk-S1 a double cysteine mutant (Conk-S1CC) carrying an additional cysteine bridge between the positions 16 and 40 was constructed and the activity of this peptide on potassium channels was measured. Most interestingly the affinity of Conk-S1CC to Shaker-Δ6–46 was 385 ± 58 nm (n = 3) showing that within the accuracy of measurements wild type and mutant Conk-S1 displayed the same inhibitory potential for Shaker channels. In addition, the affinity of Conk-S1CC to Shaker-Δ6–46 K427D channels is 0.22 ± 0.05 nm (n = 3), which is also identical to the binding affinity of Conk-S1 to this channel mutant. Therefore, for both the wild type sequence and Conk-S1CC an increase in affinity by a factor of ~2000 is observed. For Conk-S1 and Conk-S1CC dose response measurements with the wild type and K427D potassium channels were performed as well, resulting in almost identical IC50 values (see Fig. 2). The Hill coefficients for the block of both channels by both peptides were all about 1, indicating no cooperativity for the binding of both peptides to the channels. The kinetic analysis of the block of Shaker channels by Conk-S1 and Conk-S1CC resulted in kon values (for the forth reaction) of 17 ± 5s–1 μm–1 for Conk-S1 and 7 ± 3s–1 μm–1 for Conk-S1CC. The koff values (for the back reaction) were 0.0041 ± 0.0006 s–1 for Conk-S1 and 0.0029 ± 0.0023 s–1 for Conk-S1CC. This analysis revealed that although the steady state affinity of Conk-S1 and Conk-S1CC is virtually identical there are some differences in the kinetics of binding of both peptides to the ion channel. In this work, we solved the structure of a Kunitz domain polypeptide toxin from the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail, C. striatus. Proteins with Kunitz domains can be divided into two general classes: the “heterogeneous Kunitz domain-containing proteins,” with one or more Kunitz domains, but in combination with other structural motifs, and the “homogeneous Kunitz domain polypeptides” (which we have referred to above simply as “Kunitz domain proteins”) that are exclusively composed of Kunitz domains. Such polypeptides may contain one or more Kunitz domains but have no other domain motifs. Conkunitzin-S1 clearly belongs to the latter class. Conkunitzin-S1 is the first natural Kunitz domain protein with only two disulfide bonds (all other natural Kunitz domain proteins such as BPTI or the dendrotoxins have three disulfide cross-links). Only among the heterogeneous Kunitz domain-containing proteins Kunitz domains with only two disulfides have been reported (the trophoblast Kunitz domain proteins (23MacLean II, J.A. Roberts R.M. Green J.A. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). These appear to function as protease inhibitors, and their structure has not been solved. We have demonstrated that, despite containing only two cysteine bridges, the structure of Conk-S1 is very similar to that of other Kunitz domain peptides like BPTI (backbone Cα r.m.s.d. = 1.3 Å) and the dendrotoxins (backbone Cα r.m.s.d. to dendrotoxin I = 2.2 Å). Comparison of Conk-S1 with BPTI and Dendrotoxins Structures—Native BPTI with three disulfide bonds is extremely stable. It has been demonstrated that removing any one of these cysteine bridges still results in the native conformation, which is stable under normal conditions (24Kortemme T. Hollecker M. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The most productive BPTI folding pathway includes a cysteine bridge rearrangement of non-native disulfide intermediates. This rearrangement facilitates the folding process under most experimental conditions. The most important of these intermediates of BPTI are Cys30–Cys51, Cys5–Cys14 and Cys30–Cys51, Cys5–Cys38 (25van Mierlo C.P. Kemmink J. Neuhaus D. Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1044-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This folding pathway is not possible for Conk-S1 because the cysteines 14 and 38 (corresponding to 16 and 40 in Conk-S1) are replaced by glycine and glutamine, respectively. The folding of dendrotoxin I and dendrotoxin K uses similar folding pathways as BPTI but with important energetic and kinetic differences. In particular, a direct pathway, without disulfide rearrangements, is significantly more populated than in BPTI folding (24Kortemme T. Hollecker M. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The existence of a native Kunitz domain with two replaced cysteines, as determined in this study, confirms that non-native disulfide intermediates are not necessary for the folding of Kunitz domains. This is also consistent with other studies, where mutants of BPTI, which lack Cys14 and Cys38, still folded properly (26Marks C.B. Naderi H. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Anderson S. Science. 1987; 235: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another mutant of BPTI with only two disulfide bridges (Cys30–Cys51, Cys14–Cys38) also shows a native fold, while the corresponding mutant in dendrotoxin K is only partly folded. This is due to the generally lower stability of dendrotoxins compared with BPTI (24Kortemme T. Hollecker M. Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Conk-S1 is structurally and functionally similar to the dendrotoxins. Considering the compromised folding of cysteine mutants in dendrotoxins, it is surprising that Conk-S1 still attains the typical Kunitz fold. Functionality of Conk-S1—Recently it has been shown that the native, C-terminally amidated Conk-S1 blocks Shaker potassium channels with an IC50 of about 60 nm.2 In our study a recombinant Conk-S1 has been used, which is lacking the C-terminal amidation. The functional consequence of this difference was studied by measuring the affinity of the recombinant Conk-S1 on Shaker-Δ6–46 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The IC50 value of the recombinant Conk-S1 used in this study is 6–7 times higher than that of the native Conk-S1, indicating a reduced inhibitory potential of the recombinant toxin. Despite this contribution of C-terminal amidation of Conk-S1 for potassium channel inhibition, our results demonstrate that recombinant Conk-S1 is functional. This provided the opportunity to use this recombinant neurotoxin for investigating structure, dynamics, electrophysiological properties, and the effects of mutations. Most interestingly the electrophysiological measurements revealed that there is no difference in the affinity between Conk-S1 with two disulfide bonds and the three-disulfide-bonded mutant Conk-S1CC. Furthermore, both peptides exhibit an ~2000 fold higher affinity to the K427D mutant of the Shaker potassium channel than to the wild type channel. This demonstrates clearly the importance of the region around residue Lys427 in Shaker potassium channel for the binding to Conk-S1 and indicates that Conk-S1 is interacting with the pore region of the ion channel. In addition, it suggests that the missing cysteine bridge is not of critical functional importance for the block of the potassium channel by Conk-S1. Despite the identical steady state values, the kinetic analysis revealed some differences in the binding of both toxin analogues. The kon and the koff values for Conk-S1 were approximately two times higher than for Conk-S1CC. Thus, Conk-S1 binds twice as fast to the channel as Conk-S1CC, but it is also released twice as fast from its binding site. Therefore, the two effects compensate, resulting in identical IC50 values of Conk-S1 and Conk-S1CC. From the kinetic point of view, this indicates that for Conk-S1CC the formation of the complex with the channel as well as the dissociation of this complex might have a higher energy barrier. This is likely related to the number of disulfide bonds; the additional cysteine bridge makes Conk-S1CC more rigid. For binding of the toxin to the channel, flexibility within Conk-S1 may enhance the rate of binding to the channel by allowing the toxin to adjust more easily into the binding pocket within the ion channel pore. Interestingly, experiments with dendrotoxins resulted in the reverse situation (27Hollecker M. Marshall D.L. Harvey A.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When the disulfide bond homologous to the missing third disulfide bond of Conk-S1cc was selectively removed from dendrotoxins I and K with iodoacetamide, derivatized dendrotoxins showed a 5–10 times lower affinity than the unmodified toxins. One possible explanation for this effect could be steric hindrance by the acetamide group. On the other hand, the different results obtained for dendrotoxins and Conk-S1 may indicate a different binding mode of Conk-S1 and dendrotoxins, even though these peptides both target voltagegated potassium channels. In another report it was shown that by selectively reducing the cysteine bridge in BPTI, which is homologous to the one introduced into Conk-S1CC, with borohydride, no change in activity was observed (28Kress L.F. Laskowski Sr., M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4925-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Conk-S1 more closely resembles BPTI than the dendrotoxins with respect to the importance of this disulfide bond for the functional activity of the protein. In conclusion, we have determined the structure of Conk-S1, an unusual potassium channel-targeted toxin that has a consensus Kunitz domain amino acid sequence but which lacks one of the three disulfide bonds that are conserved in all natural Kunitz domain peptides characterized to date. The structure does not strongly diverge from those of standard Kunitz domains with three disulfide bonds. A Conk-S1 analog with the third disulfide bond had similar potassium channel blocking activity, indistinguishable from that of the native peptide. Both the two- and three-disulfide-cross-linked toxins had much higher affinity for the K427D Shaker potassium channel mutant, suggesting that they interacted equally avidly with the vestibule of the ion channel pore.

One mechanism by which shear stress achieves this is through the induction of transcription factors including Krüppel-like factor 2(KLF2). We have previously reported that a 62-bp region of the KLF2 promoter is responsible for its shear stress-induced expression via the binding of nuclear factors. In this study, we find that the 62-bp shear stress response region contains a 30-bp tripartite palindrome motif. Electrophoretic mobility supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that PCAF (P-300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein-associated factor)) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D bind this region as components of the shear stress regulatory complex. We have also characterized a PI3K-dependent/Akt-independent pathway responsible for shear stress-induced KLF2 nuclear binding, promoter activation, and mRNA expression. Furthermore, the shear stress response region of the KLF2 promoter was specifically immunoprecipitated by antibodies against acetylated histones H3 and H4 in shear-stressed but not static hemangioendothelioma cells. The acetylation of these histones was blocked by PI3K inhibition. Finally, we have found that KLF2 increases endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression in murine endothelial cultures, an effect that is also blocked by PI3K inhibition. These results define the DNA regulatory element, signal transduction pathway, and molecular mechanism activating the flow-dependent expression of a vital endothelial transcription factor.

Mechanical forces influence endothelial phenotypes through signal transduction and gene activation. Hemodynamic shear stress, the frictional force that results from viscous blood flow (1Barakat A. Lieu D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 38: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is of primary importance to the endothelium. It stimulates an adaptive response to generate antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-atherosclerotic patterns of gene expression (2Wasserman S.M. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G.

In addition to being a potent vasodilator (4Palmer R.M. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9261) Google Scholar), NO inhibits inflammation (5Berk B.C. Abe J.I.

NO levels are increased, in part, through the activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) by phosphorylation on Ser1177 via the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which plays an integral role in the response to fluid shear stress (9Dimmeler S.

It is also responsible for the induction of eNOS mRNA by shear stress (12Malek A.M. Jiang L. Lee I. Sessa W.C. Izumo S. Alper S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although Akt is the canonical immediate target of PI3K activation, PI3K-dependent/Akt-independent shear stress signal transduction pathways have been reported (13Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N.

However, little is known regarding the effectors of the PI3K mechano-transduction pathway or the molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling events from shear stress to gene expression in endothelial cells.The application of shear stress up-regulates mRNA levels of vasoprotective genes by acetylating histones to facilitate DNA unwinding and increase the accessibility of chromatin to transcription factors (15Illi B.

Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). Shear stress also increases the expression of transcription factors themselves, such as KLF2 (lung Krüppel-like transcription factor (LKLF)) (17Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D.

KLF2 is important in critical aspects of differentiation and function in a variety of cell types, including T lymphocytes, adipocytes, and lung cells (19Wani M.A. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 231: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).In vitro and in vivo experiments with human endothelial cells indicate that KLF2 exhibits sustained induction under physiological levels of pulsatile and laminar shear stress (17Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). KLF2 is found throughout the aorta with the exception of branch points, which experience complex flow patterns and decreased shear stress. Because these sites are also more prone to atherosclerotic plaque formation, this finding suggests that KLF2 may have atheroprotective functions. Subsequent work (27SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp.

Res. 2005; 96: e48-e57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has found that KLF2 overexpression up-regulates eNOS in human and bovine endothelial cells and is anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic. These findings suggest that KLF2 gene expression is crucial for the prevention of vascular diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its induction by shear stress have been largely unexplored.Our laboratory has recently shown that a 62-bp region of the KLF2 promoter (from -157 to -95 nucleotides from the start site of transcription) mediates KLF2 flow induction via the binding of specific shear stress-induced nuclear factors in murine microvascular endothelial cultures (18Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that the 62-bp flow response region contains a 30-bp motif of three sequential palindromes. Our studies also indicate that P-300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNP D) bind this region as components of a shear stress-specific regulatory complex that functions in a PI3K-dependent pathway to acetylate histones, providing a molecular mechanism for the flow-dependent expression of KLF2.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—EOMA cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) at 5% CO2. This cell line maintains characteristic endothelial cell properties with behaviors similar to microvascular endothelial cells (29Obeso J. Weber J. Auerbach R. Lab. Investig. 1990; 63: 259-269PubMed Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) were cultured in supplemented endothelial growth medium 2 media (Cambrex) containing 10% FBS. All of the HUVECs were used at less than the fifth passage.Shear Stress Apparatus and Experiments—A CELLMAX QUAD® artificial capillary cell culture system (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominquez, CA) was used as described previously (18Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to shear cells at 19 dyne/cm2 (30Redmond E.M. Cahill P.A. Sitzmann J.V. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For HUVEC experiments, the artificial capillaries were coated in 10 μg/ml human fibronectin (Sigma) prior to the addition of cells. For the signal transduction inhibitor experiments, pharmacological inhibitors (Calbiochem) for PI3K (LY294002), ERK1/2 (PD98059), or inactive analog control (SB202474) were dissolved in Me2SO and then added to the media reservoir at the specified concentration, accounting for the total amount of liquid in the reservoir plus the capillary tubing. After the inhibitors were added, the medium was allowed to circulate over the cells at a minimal shear level of ≤1 dyne/cm2 for 30 min before exposing the cells to a full shear force of 19 dyne/cm2. During PD98058 treatment, the medium FBS concentration was reduced to 2%.Transfection Protocol And Reporter Gene Assays—All of the transfections were carried out in 100-mm plates, except as otherwise noted. EOMA cells and HUVECS were grown to 70% confluence, washed with PBS, bathed in serum-free media, and transfected with 4 μg of DNA and 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). FBS was added back to the plates 4 h after transfection. For deletion analysis experiments, cells were trypsinized from the plates 12 h after transfection and seeded into the artificial capillary system as described previously (18Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The highest expressing construct (-924 to +14) was arbitrarily set at 100%, and all other expressions are presented as a percentage of that value. For experiments testing transactivation of the KLF2 promoter, transfections were carried out in 6-well plates. 0.5 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the KLF2-157 promoter was co-transfected into static EOMA cells along with 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase vector and 0.5 μg of expression plasmid for PCAF (a kind gift of Dr. Yoshiro Nakatani, Dara Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), hnRNP D (a kind gift from Dr. Arao Yukimoto, Jicki Medical School, Tochigi, Japan), or empty vector controls. Additional control experiments were done in identical fashion with a cyclic AMP-response element luciferase plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) substituted for the KLF2 luciferase plasmid. The KLF2 expression vector was constructed by cloning the coding region of KLF2 cDNA into a pBK-cytomegalovirus phagemid vector (Stratagene). The constitutively active Akt expression construct was a gift from Dr. Richard Roth (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) (31Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative Akt expression vector (dominant-negative Akt (protein kinase B-CAAX)) was a gift from Dr. Boudewijn M. Th. Burgering (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands) (32van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol.

Hughes M.J. Anderson K.P. Croyle M.L. Lingrel J.B Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was isolated from EOMA cells subjected to 24 h of fluid shear stress. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. EMSAs were performed as described previously (18Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). For experiments with the 62-bp promoter region, 2 μg of nuclear extract was used. In experiments with the 30-bp element, 20 μg of nuclear extract was used. For competition reactions, cold oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extract for 15 min prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. For antibody supershifts, 5 μg of nuclear extract were used with either PCAF antibody (a gift from Dr. Yoshiro Nakatani, New York Medical School, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or hnRNP D antibody (a gift from Dr. Robert Schneider, New York, NY).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—EOMA cells were exposed to shear stress for 12 h or kept in static conditions. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (34Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar) using primer pairs to amplify a 139-bp segment encompassing the KLF2 promoter shear stress response region: forward 5′-GGCTTGAGGAGCGCAGTCCGGGCTCCCGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGGGCTAGGAGGCGTCGACGGAAACGCGT-3′. Anti-H3AcK14 and anti-H4AcK12 antibodies (Up-state Biotechnology), anti-RNA polymerase II antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and transcription factor II B (TFIIB) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to immunoprecipitate their corresponding proteins and bound DNA.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Static or sheared EOMA cells were lysed with non-ionic cell lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed essentially as described previously (35Dostanic I. Schultz J.J. Lorenz J.N. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54053-54061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse hnRNP D antibody incubated with magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-rabbit antibody (Dynabeads M-280). Beads were incubated with lysate for 4 h at 4 °C. Western blots were performed according to standard procedures with PCAF antibody (36Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rabbit primary antibodies against eNOS, Akt, and phospho-Akt (Ser473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-GAPDH (Advanced ImmunoChemical, Long Beach, CA) and rabbit anti-hemagglutinin probe (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were also used. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (Calbiochem) or goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) IgG antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, immunoreactivity was visualized following treatment with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and developed with Kodak Biomax MR x-ray film. Densitometric analyses were performed by ImageQuant 5.0, and results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of static empty vector control cells to 1.0.Semi-quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Relative quantification of changes in KLF2 and eNOS expression following shear stress and transfection were determined by real-time RT-PCR, as described previously (18Huddleson J.P. Srinivasan S. Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fold changes in mRNA expression were calculated using the Δ-Δ Ct method (37Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45--e50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24916) Google Scholar). GAPDH levels, which are not influenced by shear stress (38Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1515-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), were used as an internal control. For HUVEC experiments, primers for human KLF2 were described previously (17Dekker R.J. van Soest S. Fontijn R.D. Salamanca S. de Groot P.G. VanBavel E. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). 18 S rRNA served as an internal control as follows: forward 5′-CGTTCAGCCACCCGAGATT-3′ and reverse 5′-GACCCGCACTTACTGGGAATT-3′.Statistical Analysis—For comparisons between the means, independent experiments were performed and analyzed using Student's t tests. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSThe KLF2 Promoter Contains a 30-bp Minimal Shear Stress Response Element with a Palindrome Motif—We have previously reported that KLF2 is regulated by fluid flow through a 62-bp promoter region. Deletion analyses in HUVECs verified the importance of this region in primary human endothelial cells (Fig. 1A) and demonstrated its evolutionary conservation. In EOMA cells, we continued our deletion analysis through the KLF2 promoter and found that, although the whole 62-bp region from -157 to -95 nucleotides is required for maximal shear induction, a minimal shear promoter exists within the 62-bp region between -138 and -95 nucleotides that continues to generate a significant shear response compared with static controls (Fig. 1B).This region contains a 30-bp element from -138 to -108 that is 100% conserved between mouse and human promoters and has been shown to regulate KLF2 transcriptional activity in LA-4 mouse lung cells (33Schrick J.J. Hughes M.J. Anderson K.P. Croyle M.L. Lingrel J.B Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Wani M.A. Conkright M.D. Jeffries S. Hughes M.J. Lingrel J.B Genomics. 1999; 60: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The interesting feature of the 30-bp element is a motif of three palindromes occurring in tandem (Fig. 2A, I–III). Such palindrome motifs have been shown to be important for endothelial gene regulation but not in the context of shear stress induction (40Cowan P.J. Tsang D. Pedic C.M. Abbott L.R. Shinkel T.A. d'Apice A.J. Pearse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11737-11744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41Tsai J.C. Zhang J. Minami T. Voland C. Zhao S. Yi X. Lassalle P. Oettgen P. Aird W.C. J. Vasc. Res. 2002; 39: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The palindrome motif is also noticeably AT-rich (100% AT in palindrome I; 80% AT in palindrome III) within a proximal promoter of ∼70% GC content. An oligonucleotide spanning the -138 to -108 sequence was sufficient to bind additional shear stress nuclear factors above static base-line levels in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 2B). The presence of two complexes is clearly visible under shear stress when using the 30-bp minimal promoter element (Fig. 2B, marked I and II) compared with our previous work that shows three shear stress-specific complexes binding the whole 62-bp region. No binding was evident when individual palindrome oligonucleotides were used in EMSAs (Fig. 2A, I alone and so on; data not shown). Interestingly, the protein binding within the 30-mer is best visualized at higher concentrations of nuclear extract (20 μg) than required to see flow-specific binding using the full 62-bp region (2 μg). These findings suggest that the full length of the KLF2 shear stress response region is required for stability of the shear-induced activating complex, although the palindrome motif of the KLF2 promoter sufficiently displays dynamic flow-induced alterations in nuclear binding. In and of itself, however, the palindrome motif is insufficient to impart significant shear stress response compared with the -157 reporter plasmid in both EOMA cells and HUVECs (Fig. 2C). Therefore, transactivation of the KLF2 promoter by fluid flow depends significantly, but not exclusively, on the tripartite palindrome motif.Fig. 2The KLF2 shear stress response element contains a tripartite palindrome motif that exhibits shear stress-induced binding.A, diagram of the mammalian KLF2 gene and conserved 30-mer promoter region. The start site of transcription and the three exons are marked. The conserved 30-mer sequence is amplified, and the positions of three consecutive palindromes within are marked (I–III). B, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extract isolated from EOMA cells subjected to 24 h of fluid shear stress (19 dyne/cm2) and static cultured control cells. Isolated nuclear extract was incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe spanning the -138 to -108 region of the KLF2 promoter. The two flow-enhanced nuclear binding complexes are marked (I and II). Competition assays for specificity were carried out with 1,000× cold oligonucleotide. C, diagrammed above, a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 30-mer sequence linked to the minimal -31 promoter (-U31) was constructed. This plasmid and a wild-type-U31 construct were subjected to 24 h of shear stress as above, and the luciferase activity was calculated. Reported relative luciferase units values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PCAF and hnRNP D Are Components of the Shear Stress Induction Complex on the KLF2 Promoter—Using DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we have identified several proteins that regulate the -138 to -108 region of the KLF2 promoter in macrophages, including the transcriptional acetyltransferase PCAF and the RNA/DNA-processing factor hnRNP D (AUF1) (34Ahmad N. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). We reasoned that these proteins might be components of the endothelial shear stress KLF2 induction complex. Electromobility supershift assays were performed with oligonucleotide probes of the KLF2 palindrome motif and antibodies against PCAF and hnRNP D under static and flow conditions.PCAF is a member of the GCN-5-related acetyltransferase family and has been proposed to play diverse roles in coactivation of gene expression (42Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 43Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Wolffe A.P. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the addition of PCAF antibody resulted in no change in the pattern of static binding (Fig. 3A) but caused the immunodepletion of the shear-specific band (Fig. 2B, band I) (Fig. 3B). Therefore, PCAF binds the KLF2 promoter only under flow conditions. To confirm the results of the supershift assay in endothelial cells, we investigated the ability of PCAF to transactivate the KLF2 promoter through transient transfection of static cultured EOMA cells. As expected, ectopic PCAF expression resulted in an increase in KLF2 promoter activity (Fig. 3C). Transient transfection of PCAF did not influence the activity of empty pGL3 luciferase vector or a control cyclic AMP-response element luciferase plasmid, demonstrating the specificity of induction. Empty vector for PCAF also did not activate the KLF2 promoter. Therefore, our results indicate that PCAF is one component of the KLF2 shear stress induction complex able to activate the promoter in static cultures.Fig. 3PCAF is a component of the shear stress induction complex on the KLF2 promoter.A and B, EMSAs were conducted with EOMA nuclear extract from static (A) and shear-stressed (B) cells. No antibody was used in positive controls (+Control), and nonspecific IgG antibody was used as a negative control. 1000× cold probe was used for competition. The addition of anti-PCAF antibody caused the disappearance of the band only in shear extract (B, marked by arrow). C, transactivation of the KLF2 promoter with PCAF expression clone.

All MEF2 gene products have a common DNA binding and dimerization domain, but MEF2 transcripts are alternatively spliced among coding exons to produce splicing isoforms. In vertebrate MEF2A, -C, and -D, a splice versus no-splice option gives forms that include or exclude a short domain that we designate β. We show that mRNAs containing β are expressed predominantly in striated muscle and brain and that splicing to include β is induced during myocyte differentiation. MEF2 β+ isoforms are more robust than β- forms in activating MEF2-responsive reporters despite similar expression levels. One-hybrid transcription assays using Gal4-MEF2 fusions show similar distinctions in the transactivation produced by β+ versus β- isoforms in all cell types tested, including myocytes. β function is position-independent and exists in all MEF2 splicing variant contexts. The activity is not due to cis effects on MEF2 DNA binding or dimerization nor are established transcription factor or coactivator interactions involved. Each MEF2 β domain contains multiple acidic residues, mutation of which abolishes function. Despite a location between the p38 MAPK docking domain and Thr phosphoacceptors of MEF2A and MEF2C, inclusion of β does not influence responses of these factors to this signaling pathway. Thus, a conserved pattern of alternative splicing in vertebrate MEF2 genes generates an acidic activation domain in MEF2 proteins selectively in tissues where MEF2 target genes are highly expressed.

MEF2 was originally recognized as a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity at conserved elements in the promoters of various genes encoding muscle structural proteins and as products of cDNAs encoding proteins related to serum response factor (4.Yu Y.T.

Initial studies of MEF2 largely considered a role in myogenesis and muscle structural protein expression, but a wider province is now appreciated. Thus, MEF2 target genes include those encoding transporters and metabolic enzymes of striated muscle (10.Mora S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Finally, critical roles for MEF2 factors in leukocyte functions have been established, including T lymphocyte apoptosis (25.Youn H.D. Liu J.O.

Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The four MEF2 genes are differentially expressed spatially and temporally during development and in mature tissues (30.Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Subramanian S.V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MEF2 isotype functions partially overlap, but distinct roles for the different genes remain to be fully elucidated. Murine gene disruption studies provide genetic evidence in support of discrete MEF2 isotype-specific functions (32.Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 33.Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, mef2-c null mice die at embryonic day 9 due to failure of cardiac development, and the animals also exhibit vascular defects (34.Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the other mef2 isotype genes are expressed at normal or supraphysiological levels in the mef2-c null animals, lack of compensation by these forms indicates a unique role for mef2-c in cardiac and vascular development. mef2-a null mice survive to the neonatal period, or in some cases to adulthood, but severe myocardial mitochondrial defects are present that predispose to sudden death (33.Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Expression of the other mef2 genes is also up-regulated in these animals, again indicating lack of compensation in vivo for selective MEF2 gene loss. At present it is not clear whether MEF2 isotype-selective functions relate solely to distinctions in temporospatial expression, or to unique features of the MEF2 protein forms encoded by the different genes, although we have provided recent evidence to suggest that the latter is likely (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Regulation of MEF2 function is complex and occurs at many levels.

Some of this discordance clearly involves one or more of these regulatory mechanisms, but additional conditions may also be pertinent, including regulated expression of splicing isoforms with distinct functions (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each vertebrate MEF2 gene gives rise to multiple isoforms through alternative splicing patterns that are conserved among vertebrates (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3B. Ramachandran and T. Gulick, submitted for publication. These splicing patterns include use of bona fide alternative exons, a splice versus no-splice option, and use of alternative splice acceptors within one exon. In contrast to extensive work on MEF2 gene and MEF2 protein regulation at the various levels noted above, the differential expression and unique roles and responses of MEF2 splicing variants has only recently been explored (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 67.Janson C.G. Chen Y. Li Y. Leifer D. Brain Res. Mol.

No MEF2 protein-protein interactions or MEF2 protein modifications have been identified that involve domains unique to the splicing variants. One genetic study of splicing variants of the sole Drosophila MEF2 gene, DMef2, has been reported (68.Gunthorpe D. Beatty K.E. Taylor M.V. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). No significant differences were noted in the ability of the various DMEF2 splicing forms to rescue muscle differentiation defects in a DMef2 mutant. However, distinctions in splicing variant function may have been obscured by the particular conditions in this study. Furthermore, DMef2 gene structure and alternative splicing patterns are not analogous to those of the vertebrate MEF2 genes, such that these findings do not specifically inform function of the vertebrate MEF2 splicing forms. Previously, we have shown that the MEF2C gene is unique in having alternative splice acceptors at the last exon that generate MEF2C variants that either have or lack a phosphoserine-dependent transrepressor domain called γ (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3B. Ramachandran and T. Gulick, submitted for publication. In the present report, we show a second distinction among MEF2 splicing isoforms that involves an autonomous acidic transactivation domain that is selectively included in MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D proteins expressed in muscle and nerve. Expression of the β domain is governed by tissue-selective inclusion of a short exon in MEF2 mRNAs. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid sequences are available from the corresponding author. All construct sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing (69.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 4.1.1-4.1.5Google Scholar). [MEF2CPT-IB]3-tk-Luc, [-150/+75]-jun-Luc, and G5Luc were described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MEF2 coding regions were obtained using reverse transcription-PCR with human or murine heart, brain or skeletal muscle RNA as templates. pET-MEF2A α1 containing the human MEF2A α1 isoform coding region was described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Combination PCR on a pET-MEF2A α1 template was used with vector- and gene-specific mutagenic complementary primers for introduction of the β domain with an XhoI restriction site signature. Primers used were 5′-CGGAGGAAGAGGAAcTcGAGTTGAACACCCAAAGGATCAGTAG-3′ and 5′-GTTCAACTCgAgTTCCTCTTCCTCCGATAGTGGAGGCATCATGCC-3′. The BglII- and HindIII-restricted amplicons were substituted into similarly restricted pET-MEF2A α1 to give pET-MEF2A α1.β. Substitution of a NheI to SphI fragment from expressed sequence tag IMAGE clone 3896491 into these plasmids gave pET-MEF2A α2 and α2.β. pET-MEF2C α1 and pET-MEF2C α1.γ, containing the human MEF2C α1 and α1.γ isoform coding regions, were described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additional MEF2C isoform coding regions were obtained by swapping a PstI to Acc65I fragment of an reverse transcription-PCR amplicon, obtained using a human skeletal muscle RNA template, to give α1.β and α1.β.γ forms. The MEF2C β SalI site served as a signature. pM-MEF2D α1 was described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The MEF2D α1.β coding region was obtained by swapping a PstI to XmaI fragment of an reverse transcription-PCR amplicon, obtained using a human skeletal muscle RNA template. The MEF2D β BglII site served as a signature. MEF2 isoform coding regions from pET28 were introduced into pCDNA3.hygro (Invitrogen) (pCDNA-MEF2C) and pM (Clontech) (pM-MEF2C) for expression of native factor isoforms and Gal4DBD fusions, respectively. pM-ΔN86 MEF2C α1 and α1.γ were described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PstI to NotI fragments from the full-length MEF2C constructs were substituted to give pM-ΔN86 MEF2C α1.β and α1.β.γ. Acc65I to EcoRI segment swapping from a previously described MEF2C γ mutant gave α1.γS388A and α1.β.γS396A inserts in this ΔN86 MEF2C context. The initial MEF2C β domain mutant was created in the pM-ΔN86 MEF2C α1.β background using PCR with a forward vector primer and reverse primer 5′-gggcgcGTCGACATCCTCAGcCACTGATGGCATCGTATTCTTGgatCCTGGTG-3′, installing a BamHI site 5′ to β by silent mutation. The PstI- and SalI-digested amplicon was substituted into the vector to give pM-ΔN86 MEF2C α1.βS271A. BamHI- and NotI-restricted PCR amplicons were substituted into this construct to make additional MEF2C β domain mutants. Amplicons were created using a reverse vector primer with forward primers 5′-gggcgcGGatcCAAGAATACGATGCCATCAGTGTCTcAGGATG-3′ (α1.βE272Q), 5′-gggcgcGGatcCAAGAATACGATGCCATCAGTGTCTGAGaATGTtGACCTG-3′ (α1.βD273N), 5′-gggcgcGGatcCAAGAATACGATGCCATCAGTGTCTGAGGATGTtaACC TGCTTTTG-3′ (α1.βD275N), and 5′-gggcgcGGatcCAAGAATACGATGCCATCAGTGTCTcAGaATGTtaACCTGCTTTTG-3′ (α1.βDEβNQ), with AlwNI, SalI, and HpaI serving as MEF2C β mutant signatures. Human MEF2D sequence 3′ of the MADS box/MEF2S domain was amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-cccgcgccATGgtgACCCTGAGGAAGAAGGGCTTC-3′ and reverse vector primer on a pM-MEF2D α1 template. The NcoI- and PstI-digested amplicon was reintroduced into similarly restricted pM-MEF2D α1 and α1.β to give pM-ΔN86 MEF2D α1 and α1.β, respectively. A forward vector primer was used with reverse primers in PCR to generate MEF2D β domain mutants. Primers were 5′-cccgcgAGATCTAAATGGTCCTCAGcCAAGTGATGCATTAggCCtTTTCCTGC-3′ (α1.βT286A) and 5′-cccgcgAGATCTAAAgcGTCCTCAGTCAAGTGgTGCATTAACC-3′ (α1.βH289A), and the PstI- and BglII-restricted amplicons were swapped into pM-ΔN86 MEF2D α1. Combination PCR with vector primers and complementary gene-specific mutagenic primers was used to generate an amplicon for PstI to XmaI fragment swapping to give pM-ΔN86 MEF2D α1.βDEβNQ. Primers were 5′-TCACTTGACTcAGaACCATTTAaATCTGAAC-3′ and 5′-TTGTTCAGATtTAAATGGTtCTgAGTCAAG-3′. BglII, NsiI, StuI, and DraI served as MEF2D β mutant signatures. pM-βMEF2D was constructed using PCR with primer 5′-gccgtggcggccgctttaCAGATCTAAATGGTCCTCAGTcatgaggaattccggcgatacagtc-3′ in combination with a forward SV40 promoter primer on a pM template, followed by introduction of an XhoI- and NotI-restricted amplicon into pM. Complimentary oligonucleotides (5′-aattcACTGAGGACCATTTAGATCTGggcggaACTGAGGACCATTTAGATCTGggcggaACTGAGGACCATTTAGATCTGtaagc-3′ and 5′-ggccgcttaCAGATCTAAATGGTCCT CAGTtccgccCAGATCTAAATGGTCCTCAGTtccgccCAGATCTAAATGGTCCTCAGTg-3′) were annealed and inserted into EcoRI- and NotI-restricted pM to give pM-(βMEF2D)3. The reverse primer 5′-gccgtggcggccgctttaCAGATCTAAATGGTCCTCAGTtccacctgcaggCTTTAATGTCCAGGTATCAAGC-3′ was used with a forward vector primer on a pET-MEF2D α1 template, followed by introduction of the BamHI- to NotI-restricted amplicon into pM-MEF2D α1 to give pM-ΔN86 MEF2D α1.βCOOH. The reverse primer 5′-gtggaggcggccgctttaCAAAAGCAGGTCGACATCCTCAGAtcctgcaggTGTTGCCCATCCTTCAG-3′ was used with a forward vector primer on pET-MEF2C α1 template, followed by introduction of the EcoRI- to NotI-restricted amplicon into pM-MEF2C α1 to give pM-ΔN86 MEF2C α1/βCOOH. Cultured Cell Transfection—C2C12 cells were maintained and differentiated as described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HeLa, COS7, and 293 cells were maintained in DME with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were split into 12-well plates 1 day prior to transfection with Superfect (Invitrogen). Triplicate wells received 1.0 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 or 0.3 μg of control reporter, and 1.0 μg of expression vector(s) except where otherwise indicated, and cells were harvested for reporter activity determinations 24-48 h after transfection. Luciferase readings were corrected for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity from pSV40βGal or Renilla luciferase activity from pRL-tk (Promega). Protein Analyses—Western blotting of PAGE-separated proteins was performed with horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence assays (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies recognized skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (70.Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J.

RNA was harvested from C2C12 myoblasts daily during growth to confluence in DME with 20% fetal calf serum, and daily during differentiation after cell confluence in DME with 2% horse serum. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) and radio-labeled cRNA probe syntheses were carried out as described (35.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2097608048,"Together with other Golgi matrix components, GRASP65 contributes to the stacking of Golgi cisternae in interphase cells. During mitosis, GRASP65 is heavily phosphorylated, and in turn, cisternal stacking is inhibited leading to the breakdown of the Golgi apparatus. Here we show that GRASP65 is phosphorylated on serine 277 in interphase cells, and this is strongly enhanced in response to the addition of serum or epidermal growth factor. This is directly mediated by ERK suggesting that GRASP65 has some role in growth factor signal transduction. Phosphorylation of Ser-277 is also dramatically increased during mitosis, however this is mediated by Cdk1 and not by ERK. The microinjection of recombinant GRASP65 without N-terminal myristoylation or a peptide fragment containing Ser-277 into the cytosol of normal rat kidney cells inhibits passage through mitosis. This effect is abolished when Ser-277 is replaced with alanine suggesting the phosphorylation of Ser-277 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation. The convergence of cell cycle regulation and growth factor signals on GRASP65 Ser-277 suggests that GRASP65 may function as a signal integrator controlling the cell growth.

The Golgi apparatus is composed of flattened cisternal membranes connected and further organized to produce a juxtanuclear ribbon-like structure in most mammalian cells. During mitosis, the Golgi apparatus is fragmented to produce clusters of vesicles that disperse throughout the cytoplasm. These mitotic Golgi fragments are equally partitioned into the daughter cells during mitosis, and then the perinuclear Golgi apparatus is reconstituted simultaneously with the reformation of the nuclear envelope upon mitotic exit (for a review, see Ref. 1Shorter J. Warren G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 379-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cdk1-cyclin B promotes the events of mitosis and was shown to be necessary for mitotic Golgi fragmentation by in vitro reconstitution experiments using purified Golgi stacks (2Misteli T. Warren G. J.

Mallabiabarrena A. Acharya J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1998; 92: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is also a report that both Cdk1-cyclin B and MEK1 take part in different stages of the mitotic disassembly of the Golgi apparatus using a similar permeabilized cell system (6Kano F. Takenaka K. Yamamoto A. Nagayama K. Nishida E. Murata M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Whether either of these kinases or both are responsible for the mitotic disassembly of the Golgi apparatus remains to be confirmed. GRASP65 (golgi reassembly stacking protein 65) is a peripheral membrane protein enriched on the cis-face of the Golgi apparatus. It was identified as an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor required for the stacking of Golgi cisternae from mitotically disassembled Golgi fragments in a cell-free system (7Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). GRASP65 is myristoylated at the N terminus and has two PDZ-like domains. The second PDZ-like domain binds to GM130, a protein thought to function in vesicle tethering with p115 and giantin (8Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The myristoylation and the GM130 binding were shown to be necessary for the targeting of GRASP65 to the Golgi apparatus (11Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that newly synthesized GRASP65 is directly targeted to the Golgi apparatus soon after the synthesis in the cytoplasm. The specific binding of GRASP65 to the Golgi membrane is partly supported by pre-existing GM130 and by Golgi membrane components (12Yoshimura S. Nakamura N. Barr F.A. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Ohno H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4105-4115PubMed Google Scholar, 13Barr F.A. Preisinger C. Kopajtich R. Körner R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GRASP65 is heavily phosphorylated on multiple site during mitosis, and this is thought to promote cisternal unstacking (7Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 14Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Of the mitotically activated kinases, only Cdk1-cyclin B and polo-like kinase (Plk) have been proposed to phosphorylate GRASP65 (14Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Lin C-Y. Madsen M.L. Yarm F.R. Jang Y.-J. Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 9128-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the one or more exact phosphorylation sites responsible for the regulation of GRASP65 function remain to be elucidated. Two major models have been proposed to explain how the structure of the Golgi relates to its function (for a review, see Ref. 17Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1099-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). First is the vesicular transport model. In this model, only exocytic materials are transported to downstream cisternae by transport vesicles. Each Golgi cisterna forms a stable compartment, and Golgi resident proteins stay in certain cisternae and are excluded from transport vesicles. Therefore, the stacked cisternae are stable and do not have to be unstacked for exocytic transport. Second is the cisternal maturation model. In this model, Golgi resident proteins are continuously transported back to an upstream cisterna by transport vesicles, so that cis-cisterna eventually “matures” to become medial- and then trans-cisterna. Exocytic cargo is thus transported in these maturing cisternae from cis to trans. The Golgi cisternae have to be unstacked and fragmented after reaching the trans position, and their content delivered to the plasma membrane, endosomes, or regulated secretory granules. It is still under debate which of these models or a mixed intermediate model is correct. Importantly, the function and dynamics of GRASP65 are predicted to be completely different in the above two models. In the vesicular transport model, GRASP65 stays at the cis-cisternae and constantly functions for cisternal stacking. In the cisternal maturation model, the function of GRASP65 has to be switched off when a cis-cisterna reaches the medial position and reactivated upon retrieval back to the cis position. In this latter scenario, the function and the dynamics of GRASP65 may be regulated by some biochemical modification, for example, a post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. Interestingly, we noticed during the course of our previous work that GRASP65 shows a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE after synthesis and targeting to the Golgi apparatus in interphase cells (12Yoshimura S. Nakamura N. Barr F.A. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Ohno H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4105-4115PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yoshimura S. Yamamoto A. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Barr F.A. Fujii G. Shakoori A. Ohno H. Mihara K. Nakamura N. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We, therefore, sought to identify the cause of this mobility shift to gain insight into the dynamics of the stacked Golgi cisternae in interphase cells. Expression Vector Constructions—GRASP65 mutant fragments were produced by PCR with pairs of appropriate primers or site-specific single primer mutagenesis using GRASP65 cDNA and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) (7Barr F.A.

Cell Culture and Enrichment of Mitotic Cell—HeLa, COS7, NRK, and NRK-E52 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS) (Equitec-Bio, Inc., Ingram, TX). For epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, NRK cells were first incubated with DMEM containing 0.05% FCS for 48 h. After that, 50 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for the indicated times. To enrich mitotic NRK cells, the cells were incubated with DMEM (10% FCS) containing 2.5 μg/ml aphidicolin for 12 h, then washed three times by DMEM (10% FCS) and incubated for 7 h. The mitotic cells were then shaken off from the culture dish with vigorous tapping. To inactivate MEK and ERK, 20 μm U0126 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added during the incubation after the removal of aphidicolin. The cells were finally collected and lysed by SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Peptides and Antibodies—Oligonucleotide-peptide (>90% purity) and anti-phosphorylated peptide antibody were supplied from Asahi Techno Glass Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, a peptide corresponding to the GRASP65 sequence from 270 to 284 residues and phosphorylated at serine 277 was chemically synthesized and used for immunizing rabbits. The antiserum was affinity-purified on a phosphorylated peptide column and adsorbed with a corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide column. Rabbit anti-rat GRASP65 antibody (12Yoshimura S. Nakamura N.

Pulse-chase Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—1 × 105 of HeLa cells were grown in 3.5-cm dishes and transfected with GRASP65 mutants. After 24 h, cells were incubated with methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) (10% FCS, dialyzed) for 60 min. The cells were then labeled with 7.4 MBq/ml 35S-Express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min, washed, and chased with DMEM with 10% FCS for 30 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) containing protease inhibitors mixture (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 20 μm leupeptin, 15 μm pepstatin, and 15 μm chymostatin). The lysate was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rat GRASP65 antibody. The immunoprecipitated materials were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with NEB buffer 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and treated by 50 units/ml of calf intestine alkali phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) for 60 min at 37 °C. After the treatment, the materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—This was performed as described previously (18Yoshimura S. Yamamoto A. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Barr F.A. Fujii G. Shakoori A. Ohno H. Mihara K. Nakamura N. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated by first antibodies (anti-PS277 antibody and 7E10), washed, treated with secondary antibodies, and finally stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. Antibody was preincubated with 1 mg/ml synthetic oligonucleotide-peptide for 60 min at room temperature where indicated. The cells were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and observed with an LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously with slight modifications (19Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). MAPKs were immunoisolated as follows. For ERK2, pFLAG-CMV2-ERK2 was transfected solely (control) or co-transfected with pcDNA3-myc-Raf-C (activated) in COS7 cells and incubated for 30 h. For JNK1, pFLAG-CMV2-JNK1 was transfected in COS7 cells and incubated for 30 h (control), and culture medium was removed and irradiated by UV (105 μJ/cm2) using a Spectrolinker XL-1500 UV Crosslinker (Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY) (activated). For p38α, pFLAG-CMV2-p38α was transfected in COS7 cells and incubated for 30 h (control) and treated with OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) containing 0.6 m sorbitol for 15 min (activated) (23Sudo T. Maruyama M. Osada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were collected and lysed by a lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The kinases were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) from the lysate, washed three times with the lysis buffer, and incubated with 3 μg of substrates in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Cold reactions were performed in the same condition without radioactive ATP. Myelin basic protein was purchased from Sigma. GST-c-Jun and Trx-ATF2 were prepared as previously described (20Kuboki Y. Ito M. Takamatsu N. Yamamoto K.I. Shiba T. Yoshioka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39815-39818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). His-GRASP65 was produced with pET-28a(+) vector and BL21(DE3) Rossetta-pLysS (Novagen, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and purified by using TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. The reactions were terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Rat liver Golgi membranes and mitotic HeLa-S3 cytosol were prepared as previously described (8Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 9Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To inhibit ERK activation, HeLa-S3 cells synchronized in mitosis were treated with 20 μm U0126 for 30 min before homogenization. 50 μl of cytosol (8 mg/ml) was desalted and incubated with 10 μg Golgi membranes for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to precipitate the membranes. The membranes were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GM130, anti-PS25, anti-GRASP65, and anti-PS277 antibodies. Microinjection—NRK cells were seeded at 1.5 × 104/cm2, grown on glass coverslips for 24 h, and incubated with DMEM (10% FCS) containing 2.5 μg/ml aphidicolin for 12 h. The cells were then washed with DMEM (10% FCS) and incubated for 2 h. The cells were microinjected with 10 mg/ml recombinant His6-tagged GRASP65 or 0.3 mg/ml peptide over 30 min and further incubated for indicated time. 10 mg/ml Alexa-488-conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes) was co-injected as an injection marker. The cells were fixed and stained by mouse anti-GM130 antibody followed by Cy3-anti-mouse antibody and finally with Hoechst 33258. For all the cells showing Alexa-488 fluorescence (more than 200 cells, typically ∼300 cells), the number of the cells showing chromosomal condensation was counted and the ratio (%) was shown as a mitotic index. GRASP65 Is Phosphorylated in Interphase NRK Cells—As previously shown (12Yoshimura S. Nakamura N. Barr F.A. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Ohno H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4105-4115PubMed Google Scholar), a single 65-kDa band was detected when NRK cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 5 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-GRASP65 antiserum (Fig. 1, lane 1). By using a lower percentage gel (8%), we noticed that an extra lower mobility band appeared after the chase incubation with cold methionine/cysteine for 30 min (Fig. 1, lane 2). The lower mobility band disappeared when the immunoprecipitate was incubated with alkaline phosphatase (lane 5). This was not caused by the degradation of the protein, because the band was still detected after the mock incubation (lane 6). Therefore, this suggests that the lower mobility band is a phosphorylated form of GRASP65. The targeting of GRASP65 to the Golgi membrane is very rapid, and >80% of GRASP65 is bound to the Golgi membrane just after the 5-min pulse labeling (12Yoshimura S. Nakamura N. Barr F.A. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Ohno H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4105-4115PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GRASP65 is likely to be phosphorylated after binding to the Golgi membranes. Interestingly, the lower mobility band was not seen when the cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) before the pulse labeling and chase (lane 3). In the presence of BFA, the Golgi apparatus is disassembled and the anterograde transport is blocked. Most of the medial- and trans-Golgi proteins are transported back to the ER, whereas many cis-Golgi proteins, including syntaxin 5 and GRASP65, remain in distinct cytoplasmic punctate structures with ERGIC53 (8Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 25Seemann J. Jokitaro E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that the one or more kinases responsible for the GRASP65 phosphorylation localize to the Golgi apparatus in untreated interphase cells, and this is segregated together with other Golgi proteins from GRASP65 after BFA treatment such that it can no longer efficiently phosphorylate GRASP65. Determination of the Phosphorylation Site Responsible for the Mobility Shift—We have found a similar mobility shift of GRASP65 in HeLa cells. 2S. Yoshimura and N. Nakamura, unpublished observation. Therefore, we took advantage of the higher transfection efficiency of HeLa cells to determine the phosphorylation site of GRASP65 responsible for the mobility shift. A further advantage of this approach is that only the transfected rat GRASP65 and its mutants were precipitated using the anti-rat GRASP65 antiserum, thus simplifying the analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with various mutants of rat GRASP65 (Fig. 2, A and B), and the cells were pulse-labeled, chased, and analyzed as before. The mobility shift was observed for the transfected full-length GRASP65 and for ΔC372 (C-terminal residues from 373 onward were deleted) and ΔC292 mutants (C-terminal residues from 293 onward were deleted) but not for ΔC202 (C-terminal residues from 203 onward were deleted) (Fig. 2C, lane 3). The shift was abolished by the treatment of immunoprecipitated material with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2C, lane 4). Therefore, this suggests that residues between 203 and 292 are responsible for the mobility shift. Correspondingly, an internal deletion mutant Δ (203–292), lacking residues between 203 and 292, did not show a mobility shift (Fig. 2D, lane 3). On the other hand, an internal deletion mutant Δ (203–240), lacking residues between 203 and 240, showed a mobility shift suggesting that residues between 241 and 292 are responsible for the mobility shift (Fig. 2D, lane 7). There are 9 residues that are potentially phosphorylated between residues 241 and 292 (Fig. 2B; 6 serines, 1 threonine, and 2 tyrosines). To pinpoint the residues responsible for the mobility shift, we mutated some of these residues to alanine to prevent the phosphorylation. Mutants where both serines 244 and 245 were replaced with alanine (S244A, S245A) or both serines 251 and 254 were replaced with alanine (S251A, S254A) still showed the mobility shift (Fig. 2E, lanes 3 and 7). In contrast, a mutant where serine 277 was replaced with alanine (S277A) did not show a mobility shift (Fig. 2 E, lane 11). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of serine 277 (Ser-277) is responsible for the mobility shift of GRASP65. Phosphorylation of Ser-277 in Interphase Cells—To further characterize the phosphorylation of Ser-277, we produced an anti-phospho-Ser-277 antibody using a chemically synthesized phosphorylated peptide shown in Fig. 3A (PS277). When purified rat liver Golgi membranes were probed with the affinity-purified anti-PS277 antibody, a 65-kDa band was detected (Fig. 3B, lane 1). This corresponded to the lower mobility band detected by anti-GRASP65 antibody (lane 4). The reaction with the anti-PS277 antibody was abolished after the treatment of Golgi membranes with alkaline phosphatase (lane 3). Consistently, the lower mobility band detected by anti-GRASP65 antibody also disappeared after phosphatase treatment (lane 6). The reactivity with the antibodies was preserved after the mock incubation confirming that disappearance of the signal was caused specifically by the added phosphatase activity (lanes 2 and 5). These results indicate that the anti-PS277 antibody specifically recognizes GRASP65 phosphorylated at Ser-277 and reinforce that the mobility shift is indeed caused by phosphorylation of Ser-277. The anti-PS277 antibody was then used to stain NRK cells by indirect immunofluorescence. A GRASP65 monoclonal antibody was also used for double staining the cells (Fig. 3C). The anti-PS277 antibody clearly stained a juxtanuclear ribbon-like structure, and the staining pattern was almost completely coincident with that of anti-GRASP65 monoclonal antibody (top panels). The staining with anti-PS277 antibody was abolished after the pretreatment of the antibody with PS277 peptide (bottom panels) but not with non-phosphorylated Ser-277 control peptide (middle panels) confirming the specificity of the staining. These results confirmed that GRASP65 is phosphorylated at Ser-277 in interphase cells. The surrounding sequence of Ser-277 (see Fig. 3A) matches the consensus sequence for MAPKs (especially for ERKs) (PX(S/T)P) and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) ((S/T)PX(K/R)) (26Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We therefore, decided to find out whether Ser-277 is actually phosphorylated by these kinases. Ser-277 Is Phosphorylated by ERK after EGF Stimulation— It is well known that ERK is activated by EGF stimulation (28Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we first analyzed whether the phosphorylation of Ser-277 is increased after stimulation with EGF. NRK cells were cultured in low serum conditions for 48 h. EGF was then added to the medium, and the cells were further incubated up to 180 min. After the incubation, the cells were either fixed and processed for immunofluorescence (Fig. 4A) or lysed and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C) using the anti-PS277 antibody. The PS277 signal decreased after serum starvation but persisted at a low level (Fig. 4, A and C, 0 min). The signal greatly increased in the 5 min after addition of EGF and remained at a similar level for a further 5 min. The signal was then reduced by 30 min to a level lower than that before EGF addition and persisted at this level for up to 180 min. As shown in Fig. 4C, the change in PS277 signal correlates well with that of activated ERK monitored by ERK phosphorylation (pERK). When cells were pretreated with U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, ERK was not activated by EGF treatment (Fig. 4D, pERK). Correspondingly, the PS277 signal was greatly reduced and did not increase in response to EGF (Fig. 4, B and D). These results suggest that Ser-277 is phosphorylated by ERK in response to the EGF treatment. To confirm Ser-277 is directly phosphorylated by ERK, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using three major MAPKs, ERKs, JNK1, and p38α, that are known to operate in signal transduction cascades (for a review, see Ref. 28Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant GRASP65 or control substrates (myelin basic protein for ERK2, c-Jun for JNK1, and ATF2 for p38α) were incubated with affinity-purified ERK2, JNK1, or p38α in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 5, GRASP65 was only significantly phosphorylated by ERK2. When a similar kinase assay was performed in the presence of cold ATP and the reaction was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PS277 antibody, a PS277 signal was only detected in the reaction with ERK2. Consistent with these results, the phosphorylation of Ser-277 was not significantly increased by UV irradiation,"

Excessive inflammation due to overabundant production of proinflammatory cytokines by airway epithelial cells is considered an important factor in disease pathogenesis. Here we report that influenza A virus induced IκB kinase (IKK) activity in human airway epithelial A549 cells, resulting in persistent activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a critical regulator of the inflammatory response. Although lung epithelial cells are highly sensitive to stimulation of the IKK/NF-κB pathway by influenza virus infection, NF-κB was not activated in several non-pulmonary cells permissive to the virus, indicating a cell-specific response. Moreover, NF-κB was not essential for virus replication but triggered the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in infected lung cells and was directly responsible for production of high levels of interleukin-8, a chemokine associated with influenza-induced inflammation and airway pathology. We also report that 9-deoxy-Δ9,Δ12-13,14-dihydro-prostaglandin D2, a cyclopentenone prostanoid with therapeutic efficacy against influenza in preclinical studies, was a powerful inhibitor of influenza virus-induced IKK activity and interleukin-8 production by human pulmonary cells.

The results identify IKK as an important factor in triggering influenza virus-induced inflammatory reactions in pulmonary epithelium, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of influenza. Influenza, a highly contagious acute respiratory illness that affects all age groups, is responsible for an average of 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States alone (1Bridges C.B. Harper S.A. Fukuda K. Uyeki T.M. Cox N.J. Singleton J.A. Morbid. Mortal. Weekly Report. 2003; 52: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar). The etiological agents of the disease, the influenza viruses or orthomyxoviruses, are enveloped, negative-stranded RNA viruses classified in three types (A, B, and C), of which the A type is clinically the most important. In recent history, highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus with elevated case fatality rate have suddenly emerged (2Cheung C.Y. Poon L.L.M. Lau A.S. Luk W. Lau Y.L. Shortridge K.F. Gordon S.

Influenza A virus replicates throughout the respiratory tract, where the viral antigen is found predominantly in the epithelial cells. The clinical responses range from mild disease to fatal viral pneumonia. Although the mechanisms underlying the expression of symptoms and the development of secondary complications that may result in respiratory failure are still not well understood, excessive inflammation due to overabundant production of proinflammatory cytokines and lung inflammatory infiltrates is considered an important factor in disease pathogenesis (2Cheung C.Y.

Intense infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung epithelial layer has been associated with the release of chemotactic cytokines, in particular, interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; PG, prostaglandin; Δ12-PGJ2, 9-deoxy-Δ9,Δ12-13,14-dihydro-prostaglandin D2; IKK, IκB kinase; WSN, influenza A/WSN/33; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HAU, hemoagglutinating unit; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; p.i., post-infection; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. -8, by virus-infected airway epithelial cells (5Hayden F.G.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of most cytokines induced by influenza A virus is regulated by the cellular nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). NF-κB is a critical regulator of the immediate early pathogen response, playing an important role in promoting inflammation and viral gene expression (7Santoro M.G. Rossi A. Amici C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2552-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). NF-κB normally exists as an inactive cytoplasmic complex bound to inhibitory proteins of the IκB family and is induced in response to a variety of pathogenic stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines and viral infection. In the case of proinflammatory cytokines, induction requires the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex containing two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and the IKKγ regulatory subunit, which phosphorylates IκBs, triggering their ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (8Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). Release of IκBs results in nuclear translocation of NF-κB and its binding to DNA at specific κB sites, rapidly inducing a variety of genes encoding, among others, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, cytokine receptors, and enzymes that produce inflammatory mediators (9Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). It is well known that infection with different DNA and RNA viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, can trigger NF-κB activation via different signaling mechanisms (7Santoro M.G. Rossi A. Amici C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2552-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In the case of influenza virus infection, however, little is known regarding both the signaling pathway utilized by the virus and the role of the nuclear factor in the infection process. In the present report, we show that influenza A virus induces a persistent (up to 48 h) activation of NF-κB in human airway epithelial A549 cells. Influenza A virus mimics proinflammatory cytokines inducing NF-κB by activation of the IκB kinase, followed by IκBα and IκBβ degradation. Interestingly, although lung cells are highly sensitive to influenza-induced NF-κB activation, NF-κB induction is not a general response of the infected cell to influenza virus and was not detected in a variety of non-pulmonary cells permissive to the virus. Furthermore, IKK-mediated NF-κB activity is not essential for virus replication but triggers the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and is directly responsible for inducing IL-8 production by infected lung cells. Finally, we have previously shown that cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGs) of the A and J type block TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by direct inhibition and modification of the IKKβ subunit (10Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). We now show that 9-deoxy-Δ9,Δ12-13,14-dihydro-PGD2 (Δ12-PGJ2), a natural cyclopentenone metabolite of prostaglandin D2 that is physiologically present in human body fluids (11Kikawa Y. Narumiya S.

Influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (WSN) was grown in the allantoic cavity of 8-day-old embryonated eggs. After 48 h at 37 °C, the allantoic fluid was harvested and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to remove cellular debris, and virus titers were determined by hemagglutinin titration and plaque assay, according to standard procedures (12Pica F. Palamara A.T. Rossi A. De Marco A. Amici C. Santoro M.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One hemoagglutinating unit (HAU) corresponded to 106 plaque-forming units in this model. Confluent cell monolayers were infected with WSN for 1 h at 37 °C at a multiplicity of infection of 5 HAU/105 cells. After the adsorption period, the viral inoculum was removed, and cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in culture medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Virus yield was determined at different times post-infection by hemagglutinin titration, according to standard procedures (12Pica F. Palamara A.T. Rossi A. De Marco A. Amici C. Santoro M.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whole-cell extracts were prepared from mock-infected or WSN-infected cells as described previously (16Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 748-750Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) from whole-cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose, and filters were incubated with polyclonal anti-IκBβ antibody (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) or monoclonal anti-IκBα antibody (Imgenex, San Diego, CA), anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-IKKα antibody (BD Biosciences-PharMingen, San Jose, CA), followed by decoration with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) (15Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive IL-8 was quantitated in cell supernatants by ELISA (17Copper J.A.D. Parks J.M. Carcelen R. Kahlon S.S. Sheffield M. Culbreth R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), using a double antibody and standards obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Total RNA was extracted using RNA-Bee reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed (1 μg of RNA) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). The sequences of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, and β-actin primers (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) were as follows: TNFα sense, 5′-TGAGCACTGAAAGCATGATC-3′; TNFα antisense, 5′-TTATCTCTCAGCTCCACGCC-3′; IL-1β sense, 5′-GACACATGGGATAACGAGGC-3′; IL-1β antisense, 5′-ACGCAGGACAGGTACAGATT-3′; IL-6 sense, 5′-TGAACTCCTTCTCCACAAGC-3′; IL-6 antisense, 5′-ATCCAGATTGGAAGCATCCA-3′; IL-8 sense, 5′-ATTTCTGCAGCTCTGTGTGAA-3′; IL-8 antisense, 5′-TGAATTCTCAGCCCTCTTCAA-3′; RANTES sense, 5′-CGCTGTCATCCTCATTGCTA-3′; RANTES antisense, 5′-CTGGTCTCGAACTCCTGACC-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GCGCTCAGGAGGAGCAAT-3′; and β-actin antisense, 5′-GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCC-3′. Amplification was performed using the following parameters: 95 °C for 45 s, 61.2 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 33 cycles for TNFα; 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 33 cycles for IL-1β; 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 28 cycles for IL-6; 94 °C for 40 s, 50 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 25 cycles for IL-8; 95 °C for 45 s, 63.5 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles for RANTES; and 94 °C for 40 s, 62 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 26 cycles for β-actin. PCR products were electrophoresed alongside DNA Molecular Weight Marker IX (Roche Applied Science) in 2% agarose gels and then stained with ethidium bromide. Whole-cell extracts were prepared after lysis in a high-salt extraction buffer, containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.35 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin (16Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 748-750Google Scholar). Aliquots of total extracts (12 μg of protein) were incubated with 32P-labeled NF-κB- or AP-1-binding element probes (15Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) followed by analysis of DNA binding activity by EMSA. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (15Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specificity of protein-DNA complexes for NF-κB was verified by immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies specific for p65. Quantitative evaluation of NF-κB-DNA or AP-1-DNA complex formation was determined by Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager analysis (Typhoon 8600). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) in the presence of 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 12 h. After extensive washing, endogenous IKK activity was determined using glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (1-54) as a substrate (10Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis for IKKα was performed as kinase loading control. For determination of in vitro IKK activity, A549 cells were stimulated with TNFα for 30 min. Endogenous IKK was immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα antibody, and kinase activity was determined in the presence of different concentrations of Δ12-PGJ2 or PGF2α. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D.; p values of <0.05 were considered significant. As reported for several human viral pathogens, orthomyxoviruses are also able to activate NF-κB in infected cells (7Santoro M.G. Rossi A. Amici C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2552-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 18Ludwig S. Planz O. Pleschka S. Wolff T. Trends Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8307-8314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanisms involved in NF-κB activation by influenza virus have not yet been elucidated. To investigate the effect of influenza A virus on NF-κB activity in pulmonary epithelial cells, confluent monolayers of human alveolar epithelium-like A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with WSN (5 HAU/105 cells) for 1 h at 37 °C. At different times p.i., whole-cell extracts were analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA, and the levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A (top panel), WSN infection induced NF-κB activation in A549 cells starting at 12 h p.i. and reaching maximal levels (>4-fold above control) at 24 h p.i. To investigate the molecular pathway involved in NF-κB activation by influenza virus, the levels of the NF-κB inhibitory proteins IκBα and IκBβ were determined in uninfected and WSN-infected A549 cells by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A (bottom panels), WSN infection caused IκBα degradation starting at 12 h p.i. The inhibitory protein appeared to be completely degraded at 16 h p.i. A similar pattern of proteolysis was observed for the IκBβ isoform. To determine whether WSN infection induced IKK activity in human pulmonary cells, extracts from mock-infected controls or A549 cells infected for 9, 12, 16, and 24 h were processed for kinase assay and immunoblot analysis to determine IKK activity and recovery, respectively. The levels of phosphorylated IκBα were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, influenza virus infection induces IKK in A549 cells with a pick of maximal activity (>3-fold above control) at 12 h p.i. Several viral pathogens, including HIV and herpes simplex viruses, utilize NF-κB to enhance viral transcription and replication (15Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). Recently, based on the fact that influenza virus propagation was slightly impaired in cell lines that stably express a dominant-negative mutant of IKKβ, it was suggested that NF-κB signaling could be important for efficient influenza virus production (21Wurzer W.J. Ehrhardt C. Pleschka S. Berberich-Siebelt F. Wolff T. Walczak H. Planz O. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30931-30937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that influenza virus replication could be dependent on its ability to activate NF-κB in the infected cell, confluent monolayers of human lung A549 cells, kidney 293 cells, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and HaCaT keratinocytes were mock-infected or infected with WSN virus (5 HAU/105 cells) for 1 h at 37 °C. In parallel, confluent monolayers of canine kidney MDCK cells, which are commonly used for studies on influenza virus replication, were treated identically. At different times p.i., whole-cell extracts were analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA, and the levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Virus titers were determined at 24 h p.i. As expected, in A549 cells, WSN virus induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1, C and D) and caused a productive infection, with high levels of viral particles produced at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1E). However, WSN infection was unable to induce NF-κB up to 24 h p.i. in human kidney 293 cells, which are equally permissive to the virus. In addition, WSN did not induce NF-κB activation in other human non-pulmonary cell lines susceptible to viral infection, including SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. Finally, no activation of NF-κB could be detected in MDCK cells, in which virus yield was higher than that in any of the other cell lines tested (Fig. 1, C-E). In addition, WSN infection did not alter NF-κB-dependent gene expression in MDCK cells transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter 2xNF-κB-LUC (15Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) up to 16 h p.i. (data not shown). These results indicate that activation of NF-κB is not required for influenza virus replication. NF-κB is considered to be a critical regulator of the inflammatory response because it can rapidly induce transcription of a variety of genes encoding proinflammatory proteins, including several inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines (9Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). To investigate whether influenza virus-induced NF-κB could turn on proinflammatory gene expression in pulmonary epithelial cells, A549 cells were infected with WSN virus or mock-infected, and at 12, 24, and 48 h p.i., extracts were assayed for NF-κB activity by EMSA. In parallel samples, total RNA was harvested and analyzed for transcription of the NF-κB-dependent cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, activation of NF-κB by influenza virus persisted at high levels for 48 h in infected cells and was associated with an increase in the level of cytokine mRNAs, which was already evident at 12 h p.i. RNA levels of all cytokines examined continued to be elevated up to 48 h p.i., a time at which the virus-induced cytopathic effect is evident and cell viability decreases. Because the production of the chemotactic cytokine IL-8 has been associated with influenza virus-induced inflammation and airway pathology (5Hayden F.G. Fritz R.S. Lobo M.C. Alvord W.G. Strober W. Straus S.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 6Choi A.M.K. Jacoby D.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Mukaida N. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2003; 284: L566-L577Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we analyzed the role of NF-κB in WSN-induced IL-8 transcription in A549 cells. Cells were infected with WSN virus or mock-infected and then analyzed for NF-κB activity by EMSA, IL-8 transcription by RT-PCR, and IL-8 production by ELISA. As expected, NF-κB DNA binding activity and accumulation of IL-8 transcript were strongly induced by WSN infection (Fig. 3A). IL-8 level in uninfected cells was <0.5 ng/ml, whereas it was greatly increased (>8 ng/ml) in the supernatant of WSN-infected cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that the IL-8 mRNA is efficiently translated. Previous studies have identified in the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene consensus binding sites for NF-κB as well as for AP-1, OCT-1, and NFAT-1 transcription factors (23Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 24Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To investigate whether influenza virus-induced IL-8 production was dependent on NF-κB activation by the virus, we utilized the IκBα super-repressor IκBα-AA, in which Ser32/36 residues critical for phosphorylation by IKK have been replaced by alanine (14Di Donato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). A549 cells were transiently transfected with the IκBα-AA expression vector or with an “empty” vector. After 18 h, cells were mock-infected or infected with WSN virus. At 24 h p.i., whole-cell extracts were assayed for NF-κB activity by EMSA, and the supernatant of the same samples was analyzed for IL-8 production by ELISA and virus yield by hemagglutinin titration. As shown in Fig. 3C, expression of IκBα-AA prevented WSN-induced NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activation had no effect on virus production in cells expressing IκBα-AA in quadruplicate samples (empty vector-transfected cells, 64 ± 0 HAU/ml; IκBα-AA vector-transfected cells, 64 ± 0 HAU/ml), confirming that the nuclear factor is not required for influenza virus replication in lung cells. On the other hand, expression of IκBα-AA prevented IL-8 production by infected cells, indicating that activation of NF-κB is essential for WSN-mediated IL-8 induction. Inhibition of virus-induced IL-8 production was also detected after treatment of infected A549 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-κB activation by blocking IκBα degradation; moreover, as determined by RT-PCR, WSN infection did not induce IL-8 mRNA synthesis in 293 and SH-SY5Y cells, in which influenza virus was unable to activate NF-κB (data not shown). We next examined the effect of WSN on IL-8 gene promoter activity, utilizing luciferase constructs containing the 133-bp sequence upstream from the transcription start site of the human IL-8 gene (IL-8-luc) or the same sequence mutated in the NF-κB site (IL-8-(NF-κB-mut)-luc). A549 cells were transiently co-transfected with IL-8-luc or IL-8-(NF-κB-mut)-luc reporter plasmids, together with empty or IκBα-AA vectors. After 18 h, transfected cells were infected with WSN and assayed for luciferase activity at 24 h p.i. As shown in Fig. 3D, WSN infection stimulated IL-8-luc promoter activity, whereas it had no effect on IL-8-(NF-κB-mut)-luc activity. Expression of IκBα-AA resulted in a significant decrease of WSN-induced IL-8-luc promoter activity, and it had no effect in cells cotransfected with the IL-8-(NF-κB-mut)-luc reporter. Taken together, these results confirm that NF-κB is essential for IL-8 induction during influenza virus infection. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins PGA1 and 15-deoxy-Δ12-14-PGJ2 are potent inhibitors of TNFα-induced IKK activity (10Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Because the natural cyclopentenone PG Δ12-PGJ2 was shown to possess therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of lethal influenza A virus infection (12Pica F. Palamara A.T. Rossi A. De Marco A. Amici C. Santoro M.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of Δ12-PGJ2 treatment on influenza virus-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in human pulmonary cells. A549 cells were infected with WSN and then treated with Δ12-PGJ2 (20 μm) or control diluent. As previously reported in canine kidney cells (12Pica F. Palamara A.T. Rossi A. De Marco A. Amici C. Santoro M.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), Δ12-PGJ2 also inhibited influenza virus replication in human cells (control, 56 ± 0; Δ12-PGJ2-treated cells, 6 ± 0 HAU/ml) and partially protected A549 cells by WSN-induced cytopathic effect. At different time intervals, whole-cell extracts were analy"

The activity of many of these genes is controlled by MAPKs and the IκB kinase-NFκB pathway. To reveal the effects of blocking these pathways simultaneously, fibroblasts were infected with retroviruses encoding TAK1K63W, an inactive mutant of the protein kinase TAK1. Expression of this protein inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NFκB, JNK, and p38 MAPK and sensitized the cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. 23 different microarray experiments were used to analyze the expression of >7000 genes in these cells. We identified 518 genes that were regulated by TNF in both TAK1K63W-expressing cells and control cells, 37 genes induced by TNF only when TAK1K63W was present, and 48 TNF-induced genes that were suppressed by TAK1K63W. The TNF-inducible genes that were most strongly suppressed by TAK1K63W, ccl2, ccl7, ccl5, cxcl1, cxcl5, cxcl10, saa3, and slpi also had much lower basal levels of expression, indicating that TAK1 also played a role in their normal expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies on four of these genes suggested that inactivation of TAK1 activity led to direct suppression of expression at the transcriptional level because of impaired recruitment of RNA polymerase II to their promoters. ccl2 induction by TNF or interleukin-1 was also suppressed in cells that expressed TAK1 antisense RNA or that were genetically deficient in JNK1/2 or p65 NFκB. These data suggest that regulation of the expression of a selected group of inflammation-related genes is funneled through TAK1, making it a potentially useful target for more specific anti-inflammatory drug development.

These data suggest that regulation of the expression of a selected group of inflammation-related genes is funneled through TAK1, making it a potentially useful target for more specific anti-inflammatory drug development. Inflammation is a component of the innate immune system that produces a local protective response to microbial invasion or injury. One hallmark of inflammation is a profound change in the expression of a large number of secondary inflammatory proteins such as chemokines, cytokines, proteases, and metabolic enzymes (e.g. cylooxygenases 1 and 2 and nitric-oxide synthase) (1Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These genes are induced by molecular pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL-1, interleukin 1; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TIR, Toll/IL-1R; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinases; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TAB, TAK1-binding protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; luc, luciferase; IKK, IκB kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TAK1, transforming growth factor β-activated protein kinase 1. that detect viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF (2Dinarello C.A. Chest. 2000; 118: 503-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6743) Google Scholar). The signaling receptors for IL-1 and TLR have a conserved cytoplasmic domain called the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain and, therefore, form the TIR superfamily (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6743) Google Scholar, 4Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci. STKE. 2003. 2003; : RE3Google Scholar). The principal activation mechanism of these receptors is ligand-induced oligomerization, resulting in the homophilic interaction with cytoplasmic adaptors such as MYD88 and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6. TIR receptors then couple to and activate IL-1-receptor-associated protein kinases 1-4 (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6743) Google Scholar, 4Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5Dunne A.

Similarly, TNF receptors trimerize and then interact with the adaptors TRADD and TRAF2 followed by recruitment of the protein kinase RIP (7Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). All of the TIR receptors and TNF receptors activate the IκB kinase (IKK)-NFκB, JNK, p38, and ERK MAPK signaling pathways. These kinases regulate the nuclear activation of subunits of the NFκB and AP-1 families of transcription factors (1Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). NFκB- and AP-1-binding sites have been found in the promoters of many genes that are induced during inflammation, which has led to the view that a large number of specific receptors of the innate immune system exert their manifold gene activations principally through the MAPK and the IKK-NFκB pathways (1Kracht M. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 2002; 20: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Lewis A.J. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As expected from this conclusion, IL-1, TNF, and TLRs induce common sets of genes such as cyclooxygenases, chemokines, and other cytokines (2Dinarello C.A. Chest. 2000; 118: 503-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). However, these three mediators of inflammation induce quite distinct biological responses, e.g. apoptosis is induced by TNF but not by IL-1, and many genes are uniquely induced in response to TLRs (10Huang Q. Liu D. Majewski P. Schulte L.C. Korn J.M. Young R.A. Lander E.S. Hacohen N. Science. 2001; 294: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). One important and unresolved question concerning inflammatory signal transduction is into which gene regulatory response pattern(s) activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways by the TIR and TNF receptors is actually translated. Three types of molecules specifically couple these receptors to their downstream signaling pathways: 1) adaptors such as TICAM, TIRAP/MAL, and TRIF (11O'Neill L.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G.

Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and 3) the large number of MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK) (13Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). The MAPKKK TAK1 was originally found to be activated by transforming growth factor-β (14Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K.

Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar); however, there is increasing evidence that it is also activated by a variety of proinflammatory stimuli such as IL-1 (15Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

TAK1 is constitutively associated with at least three TAK1-binding proteins (TAB1-3). Upon activation of the IL-1 receptor complex, the TAK1·TAB complex binds to TRAF6 and TAK1 becomes activated, a process that requires ubiquitination of TRAF6 and the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 (21Takaesu G.

Rather than targeting these molecules to proteasomes for destruction, ubiquitination stabilizes the TRAF6·TAK1·TAB (1Kracht M. Saklatvala J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation then activates TAK1, which in turn activates the IKK-NFκB, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways via key phosphorylations. Considerably less information exists on the mechanism of TAK1 activation by the TNF receptor, although suppression of TAK1 by RNAi recently suggested that this kinase is also important for TNF-mediated NFκB activation (27Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Nakano H. Okazaki T. Chino A. Doi T. Saiki I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36916-36923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 28Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite the large body of biochemical evidence implicating TAK1 in signaling of proinflammatory stimuli, virtually no information exists on the specific aspects of inflammation that require TAK1 activity. We have recently shown using a dominant negative TAK1 mutant, TAK1K63W, that TAK1 controls the transcription and mRNA stabilization of the human chemokine interleukin-8. To extend these results, we decided to investigate the impact of this mutant on inflammatory gene responses utilizing a large number of comparative microarray experiments. Here we report that TAK1 controls the basal and inducible expression levels of a specific set of inflammatory genes. We further provide evidence that TAK1K63W affects chemokine gene expression by a complex transcriptional mechanism that involves mainly the NFκB and JNK pathways. These results contribute substantially to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which MAPKKK selectively couple receptors of the nonspecific immune system to gene regulatory responses. They also suggest approaches that may have the potential for designing targets for therapeutic intervention in inflammation. Cells and Materials—NIH3T3 cells were obtained from DSMZ (German collection of microorganisms and cell culture) (DSMZ no. ACC 59). GP+E86 cells were obtained from A. Berns. NIH3T3tTA cells stably expressing the tet transactivator protein were a kind gift of H. Bujard, respectively. Fibroblasts deficient for JNK1/2, p38 MAPKα, and p65 NF-κB were kind gifts of Erwin Wagner (Vienna, Austria), Angelo Nebreda (Heidelberg, Germany), and Hiroyasu Nakano (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. All of the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Antibodies against the following proteins were used in this study: polymerase II (sc-899, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); GFP (clones 7.1 and 13.1, Roche Applied Science), AKT, and phospho-AKT (Pharmingen). Human recombinant IL-1α and rabbit antisera made to synthetic peptides for the C terminus of JNK2 (peptide DSSLDASTGPLEGR, amino acids 409-423) or p38 MAPK (peptide ISFVPPPLDQEEMES, amino acids 346-360) were kind gifts of J. Saklatvala (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The expression plasmid for GST-JUN (amino acids 1-135) was a kind gift of J. R. Woodgett (Ontario, Canada). GST-JUN was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by standard methods. Recombinant bacterially expressed His epitope-tagged MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 was a kind gift of M. Gaestel (Hannover, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and protein A/G-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. TNF-α was from H. Wajant (Wuerzburg, Germany). FASL-containing medium was a kind gift of David Wallach (Rehovot, Israel) and was used in a 1:2 dilution for all of the experiments. Z-VAD-fmk was from Calbiochem, and wortmannin was from Alexis. The cDNA Northern probes for ccl2 (268 bp), ccl7 (365 bp), saa3 (320 bp), slpi (366 bp), and gapdh (1400 bp) were produced by reverse transcription-PCR. Other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher and were of analytical grade or better. Plasmids and Transfections—The cDNAs of GFP-TAK1 or GFP-TAK1K63W were amplified from pEGFP-TAK1 expression plasmids (29Holtmann H. Enninga J. Kalble S. Thiefes A. Dorrie A. Broemer M. Winzen R.

Wirth, unpublished data. The plasmids were stably transfected into GP+E86-packaging lines, and virus-containing supernatants were used to infect NIH3T3 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Additionally, GP+E86 cells were transfected with pM5Xneo without TAK1 cDNAs and retroviruses derived thereof were used to stably infect “empty virus” control cells. Stably infected cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. The GFP-TAK1 cDNA fragment was also cloned in antisense orientation into the ClaI site of pBI-L (Clontech). SalI was used to remove a 775-bp fragment containing the GFP cDNA to generate pBI-LTAK1as. In this vector, a tetracycline-responsive bidirectional promoter controls the expression of luciferase and TAK1as cDNA. Stably transfected cell lines were generated by cotransfection of pBI-LTAK1as and pBSPACΔP, a derivative of PSV2PAC (30Nourbakhsh M. Kalble S. Dorrie A. Hauser H. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4501-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), into NIH3T3tTA. Cellular clones were obtained by limiting dilution in selection medium (0.75 μg/ml puromycin, 2 ng/ml tetracycline) and identified by luciferase expression. Transient transfections by the calcium phosphate method and determination of luciferase reporter gene activity were essentially performed as described (29Holtmann H. Enninga J. Kalble S. Thiefes A. Dorrie A. Broemer M. Winzen R. Wilhelm A. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3508-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For determination of NFκB-driven promoter activity, cells (seeded at 5 × 105/well of 6-well plates) were transfected with 0.25 μg of pNFκB(3)luc or with 0.5 μg of pGAL4(2)luc and 0.5 μg of pGAL4p65 that encodes for p65 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. These vectors were a kind gift of Lienhard Schmitz (Bern, Switzerland). Empty pCS3MT vector was added to bring the total DNA per well to 5 μg. For normalization of transfections, 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) was cotransfected and β-galactosidase activity was measured using reagents from Clontech. For the experiments shown in Fig. 7, equal molar amounts of luciferase reporter plasmids according to Wagner et al. (31Wagner K. Dendorfer U. Chilla S. Schlondorff D. Luckow B. Genomics. 2001; 78: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were transfected together with 2.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase. Equal amounts of plasmid DNA within each experiment were obtained by adding empty vector. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Three 175-cm2 flasks of confluent NIH3T3 cells, treated as described in the figure legends, were used for each condition. Proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked in vivo by replacement of the medium with warm phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, this solution was replaced by cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.125 m glycine to stop the cross-linking. The supernatant then was removed, and the cells were washed in and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were collected at 500 × g at 4 °C, washed again in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and freshly added 1% aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by sonication (4 × 1 min on ice) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were collected and stored in aliquots at -80 °C for subsequent ChIP. 10 μl of antibodies were added to 500 μl of lysates, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight. 40 μl of a protein A/G mixture preequilibrated in ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer then was added to the lysates, and incubation continued for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in 1.4 ml of ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, once in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), once in ChIP-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (cold), and once in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature, and finally resuspended in 55 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Samples were vigorously mixed for 15 min at 25 °C and then centrifuged. 50 μl of supernatant was diluted to 200 μl with TE buffer including RNase A (50 μg/ml). Similarly, 50 μl of the initial lysate (input samples) were diluted to 200 μl with TE buffer containing 1% SDS and 50 μg/ml RNase A. After 30 min at 37 °C, proteinase K was added (0.5 mg/ml) and both input and immunoprecipitates were incubated for at least 6 h at 37 °C followed by at least 6 h at 65 °C. Samples were diluted to 500 μl in loading buffer (Qiagen), and DNA was purified using QIAQuick spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was eluted with TE buffer and stored at -20 °C until further use. PCR was performed on input and immunoprecipitated DNA using 2.5 units of hotstart Taq polymerase (Qiagen), 0.5 μm sense and antisense primer, 2.5 μl of template DNA, and 0.2 mm dNTPs in a total volume of 30 μl. PCR cycles were as follows: 15 min at 95 °C and 30-35 cycles of 94 °C (20 s), 55-60 °C (20 s), and 72 °C (20 s) followed by a final extension reaction at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and fluorescence intensities of bands were quantified using a Biometra TI5 system (Biometra) and the BioDocAnalyse software, version 1.0 (Biometra). ChIP primers were as follows: ccl2 promoter, sense 5′-CAACTTCCACTTTCCATCACTTATC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCACTTCTGGCTGCTCTGAG-3′; ccl7 promoter, sense 5′-GACAGAGTCACCACCTCATTTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-ATAGGCAGCCGATAGGGAG-3′; saa3 promoter, sense 5′-TTATGGGTAAGTGGGATTATGC-3′ and antisense 5′-TGAGTGGCTTCTGTCCTTTG-3′; and slp1 promoter, sense 5′-GCAAGAGCCACAGGGAGGG-3′ and antisense 5′-CCAGAGCAAGGAGCACCGTG-3′. Immune Complex Protein Kinase Assays—Whole cell extract (250-500 μg protein) was diluted in 500 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100). Samples were incubated for 3 h with 2 μl of rabbit antibodies against JNK or p38 MAPK followed by the addition of 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubation for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Beads were spun down, washed three times in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer A, and resuspended in 10 μl of the same buffer. 1 μg of recombinant protein substrates (GST-JUN1-135 or HIS-MAPK-activated protein kinase-2) in 10 μl of H2O and 10 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were then added. After 30 min at room temperature, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were separated on 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 30 mm NaPPi, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, freshly added 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 400 nm okadaic acid). Cell extract proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). After blocking with 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline overnight, membranes were incubated for 4-24 h with primary antibodies, washed in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated for 2-4 h with the peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by using the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence system. Determination of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was determined using Hoechst 33342 dye and fluorescence microscopy as described previously (32Holzberg D. Knight C.G. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Schneider H. Dorrie A. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40213-40223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by measuring the uptake of Neutral Red (33Flick D.A. Gifford G.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 68: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed exactly as described previously (34Krause A. Holtmann H. Eickemeier S. Winzen R. Szamel M. Resch K. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23681-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). cDNA Microarray Experiments—Fluorescent cDNA copies of the mRNAs of cells treated as indicated in the figure legends were prepared by reverse transcription of 5-10 μg of total RNA (24Cheung P.C. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in the presence of allyl amino dUTP using the Atlas Indirect labeling kit (Clontech). The resulting cDNA was coupled with reactive Cy-3 and Cy-5 (Amersham Biosciences). In each microarray experiment, two cDNA mixtures from different experimental situations, as indicated in the figure legends, were labeled with Cy5 or Cy3, respectively, and hybridized onto the same microarray. The NCI microarray Mm-FCRF-GEM2-v3p1_110601 used in this study contained PCR-generated copies of 9596 mouse cDNA clones (Incyte) including ∼15% “expressed sequence tag” clusters and 85% “named” cDNAs (representing genes involved in numerous cellular processes) that had been spotted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Hybridized arrays were scanned at a 10-μm resolution on a GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments) at variable photomultiplier voltage settings to obtain maximal signal intensities with <1% probe saturation. The resulting tiff images were analyzed via GenePix Pro version 3.0.6.41 software (Axon Instruments) and Web-based algorithms on the NCI/National Institutes of Health microarray (mAdb) Web site. Signals were calculated as median intensity minus median background. Sample intensities were normalized by the 50th percentile (median) method using all of the spot-filtered genes. Spots flagged bad or not found were excluded from further analysis. The spot data then were extracted according to spot diameter (between 0 and 400 μm) and signal/background ratios (supplemental Fig. 2). Scatter plot analysis for each of the two duplicate experiments shown in Fig. 3 indicated that the correlation coefficient for ratios of all of the measured genes was 0.877 for the two experiments with RNA from control cells and 0.834 for the two experiments with RNA from the TAK1K63W-expressing cells, respectively (supplemental Fig. 3). Identification of regulated genes and Boolean comparisons were performed using the Web-based mAdb software. The clustering of genes was performed using self-organizing map algorithms for selected gene sets. Genes were clustered by correlation (uncentered), arrays were not clustered, and 100,000 iterations were used by the algorithm. Original spot images were used to validate regulation of genes clustered into the same groups. Further information on the cDNAs contained on the array used in this study can be found by entering IMAGE NNNNNN at nciarray. nci.nih.gov/CR_query.shtml or by using the UniGene accession number. Oligonucleotide DNA Microarray Experiments—The Inflammation Array (MWG Biotech) used in this study contains 155 validated oligonucleotide probes for 136 inflammatory and 19 “housekeeping” genes. Total RNA from cells treated as indicated in the legend of Fig. 5 was purified with a Qiagen RNeasy kit followed by “on-column” DNase I digestion (Qiagen). RNA was used to prepare Cy3-labeled cRNA by oligo(dT-T7)-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis (cDNA synthesis system, Roche Applied Science) followed by in vitro transcription with T7-polymerase (MEGAscript T7 kit, Ambion) as directed by the manufacturers. The cRNA yield was determined photometrically. Equal amounts of cRNAs derived from ∼2.5 μg of total RNA were hybridized individually to microarrays in pre-prepared hybridization solution (MWG Biotech) at 42 °C overnight and then washed sequentially in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC, and 0.5× SSC. Hybridized arrays were scanned at maximal resolution on an Affymetrix 428 scanner at variable photomultiplier voltage settings. Fluorescence intensity values from Cy3 channels were processed using Imagene 4.2 software (Biodiscovery). To obtain maximal signal intensities without saturation effects, intensity values from Tiff images were integrated into one value per probe by the MAVI software (Version Pro 2.5.1, MWG Biotech). A negative control threshold was calculated from the mean fluorescence intensities obtained for five control Arabidopsis oligonucleotides. Fluorescence intensity values for cellular genes that exceeded this threshold by two standard deviations (corresponding to values of at least 104 arbitrary fluorescence units) were regarded as significant expression signals.

https://openalex.org/W2015353371,"Dynamin function is mediated in part through association of its proline-rich domain (PRD) with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of several putative binding proteins. To assess the specificity and kinetics of this process, we undertook surface plasmon resonance studies of the interaction between isolated PRDs of dynamin-1 and -2 and several purified SH3 domains. Glutathione S-transferase-linked SH3 domains bound with high affinity (KD ∼10 nm to 1 μm) to both dynamin-1 and -2. The simplest interaction appeared to take place with the amphiphysin-SH3 domain; this bound to a single high affinity site (KD ∼10 nm) in the C terminus of dynamin-1 PRD, as predicted by previous studies. Binding to the dynamin-2 PRD was also monophasic but with a slightly lower affinity (KD ∼25 nm). Endophilin-SH3 binding to both dynamin-1 and -2 PRDs was biphasic, with one high affinity site (KD ∼14 nm) in the N terminus of the PRD and another lower affinity site (KD ∼60 nm) in the C terminus of dynamin-1. The N-terminal site in dynamin-2 PRD had a 10-fold lower affinity for endophilin-SH3. Preloading of dynamin-1 PRD with the amphiphysin-SH3 domain partially occluded binding of the endophilin-SH3 domain, indicating overlap between the binding sites in the C terminus, but endophilin was still able to interact with the high affinity N-terminal site. This shows that more than one SH3 domain can simultaneously bind to the PRD and suggests that competition probably occurs in vivo between different SH3-containing proteins for the limited number of PXXP motifs. Endophilin-SH3 binding to the high affinity site was disrupted when dynamin-1 PRD was phosphorylated with Cdk5, indicating that this site overlaps the phosphorylation sites, but amphiphysin-SH3 binding was unaffected. Other SH3 domains showed similarly complex binding characteristics, and substantial differences were noted between the PRDs from dynamin-1 and -2. For example, SH3 domains from c-Src, Grb2, and intersectin bound only to the C-terminal half of dynamin-2 PRD but to both the N- and C-terminal portions of dynamin-1 PRD. Thus, differential binding of SH3 domain-containing proteins to dynamin-1 and -2 may contribute to the distinct functions performed by these isoforms.

The dynamin family of GTPases participates in a variety of cell behaviors (for reviews, see Refs. 1McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem.

While they are best known for their role as “pinchases” in endocytotic events at the plasma membrane, it is clear that interactions with other sub-cellular structures widen the influence of this group of proteins. For example, the discovery of dynamin participation in phenomena like endosomal “rocketing,” membrane ruffling, and podosomes have highlighted the potential role of dynamin in regulating actin-based structures (4Orth J.D.

Dynamin-1, -2, and -3 are multidomain proteins with an N-terminal GTPase domain, central association and pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; PRD, proline-rich domain; SH3, Src homology 3; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RU, arbitrary response units; GST, glutathione S-transferase; amph-SH3, GST·amphiphysin-SH3 domain. 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; PRD, proline-rich domain; SH3, Src homology 3; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RU, arbitrary response units; GST, glutathione S-transferase; amph-SH3, GST·amphiphysin-SH3 domain. domains, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD). The latter plays a vital role in targeting dynamin to a diverse set of binding partners that may cooperatively enable it to fulfill its function. Whereas dynamin isoforms were initially thought to have redundant functions, particularly in endocytosis, it is now apparent that isoform-specific functions exist. For example, we have shown that dynamin-1 regulates clathrin-independent rapid endocytosis, whereas dynamin-2 mediates clathrin-dependent slow endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells (5Artalejo C.R. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, the PRD of dynamin is the least conserved part of the protein, and dynamin-2 is only ∼50% identical to dynamin-1 in this domain, whereas in other domains identity runs to >75%.The list of putative dynamin partners is long and includes amphiphysin, endophilin, intersectin, c-Src, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cδ, cortactin, and several others. All of these proteins contain SH3 domains and interact with dynamin by binding to the PRD. The PRD contains several motifs characteristic of a type II polyproline helix, a specialized structural element that repeats every 3 amino acids, forming a triangular structure in cross-section (7Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 8Musacchio A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 211-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : RE8Google Scholar). Such motifs fall into two classes, dependent on whether critical basic residues are N-terminal (as in RXXPXXP; class I) or C-terminal (as in PXXPXR; class II) to the core PXXP motif. SH3 domains bind in opposite orientations to these two motifs, because the basic residue forms a key salt bridge with appropriate acidic residues in the SH3 domain (10Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions make up the predominant binding forces in the remainder of the binding interface. Clearly, the specificity and affinity of SH3 domain binding to proline-rich sequences plays a key role in determining the functional association of dynamin with its partner proteins.Gout et al. (11Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate specificity in the binding of SH3 domains to dynamin using a GST pull-down approach. They found that SH3 domains from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 subunit), phospholipase Cδ, c-Src, and Grb2 were able to precipitate full-length dynamin but that SH3 domains from spectrin, N-Src, Crk, NADPH oxidase, or Csk could not. Attempts were made using peptides derived from the dynamin PRD to map the sites of interaction of various SH3 domains, but these only covered one potential region of interaction (residues 778–795). Subsequently, Okamoto et al. (12Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) mapped the binding sites of several SH3 domains in the dynamin PRD using deletion constructs. They established three binding regions: region 1 (residues 785–794 in dynamin-1) contains a type II polyproline helix class I consensus sequence and binds c-Src SH3, whereas regions 2 (residues 809–826) and 3 (residues 827–839) have a class II conforming sequence. Region 2 bound p85, whereas region 3 bound to both amphiphysin and Grb2 SH3 domains. Few differences between dynamin-1 and -2 were apparent (12Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further work confirmed that amphiphysin-SH3 bound exclusively to region 3 within the sequence PXRPXR (13Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and that endophilin-SH3 probably bound at two sites, one overlapping that of amphiphysin and another site possibly within region 1 (14Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These studies have been largely qualitative, although it was shown that the amphiphysin-SH3-dynamin interaction was of relatively high affinity (KD ∼190 nm) based on pull-down titration (13Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Alongside these observations, it has been suggested that phosphorylation regulates the interaction between members of endocytotic complexes, particularly those involving dynamin-1, amphiphysin, endophilin, and synaptojanin (14Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y.

Since dynamin-1 is principally phosphorylated in its PRD, this modification could affect the binding of SH3 domains, but few quantitative studies have analyzed this possibility.In this study, we have determined the kinetics and specificity of SH3 binding to the dynamin PRD using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This method enables accurate measurement of association and dissociation kinetics from which determinations of KD and stoichiometry can be readily derived (17Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 18Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We show that SPR can detect occlusion and the effects of phosphorylation on binding to the dynamin PRD. In addition, we demonstrate significant differences between the binding properties of dynamin-1 and -2. These results have a bearing on protein-protein interactions in endocytosis and the role of phosphorylation in the process.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsDynamin-1 PRD—The dynamin-1 PRD (b splice variant; residues 751–851) was excised by PCR from a pSVL-dynamin 1 plasmid obtained from Drs. P. Okamoto and R. B. Vallee (University of Massachusetts) using the primers D1-PRD forward (5′-GACATCAACACGACAGATCTCAGCCCC-3′) and D1-PRD reverse (5′-CGTAGCTGAGTCGACTCAGGGGTCACT-3′) complementary to nucleotides 2230–2259 and 2545–2571, respectively, of the rat coding sequence. BglII and SalI restriction sites were introduced at the N and C termini of the PRD, respectively, and the PCR product was inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO-TA shuttle vector (Invitrogen) and amplified. The dyn-1 PRD was cut out with BglII-SalI and inserted into the BglII-XhoI sites of pET30a(+) vector (Novagen), resulting in a N-terminal His6 tag-dynamin-1 PRD (pET-D1-PRD).To obtain the N terminus of the dynamin-1 PRD (dyn-1 PRD(N)), a cassette encoding amino acids 751–805 in rat dynamin-1 was cloned into pET30a(+) using BglII and BamHI restriction sites. Nucleotides at 2416–2418 were mutated into a stop codon at the C terminus of dyn-1-PRD (N) using the primers D1-PRD(N) stop forward (5′-CCTCCGCCTGCTTGATCCGAATTCGAGC-3′) and D1-PRD(N)stop reverse (5′-GCTCGAATTCGGATCAAGCAGGCGGAGG-3′). To obtain the C terminus of dynamin-1 PRD (dyn-1 PRD(C) coding for amino acids 806–851), the dyn-1 PRD was cut with BamHI-XhoI and ligated into pET30a(+) using similar sites. All mutations and final constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Dynamin-2 PRD—A plasmid encoding His6-tagged PRD of dynamin-2 (residues 742–871) was obtained from Dr. P. Westermann (19Dong J. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Westermann P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To obtain the N terminus of the dynamin-2 PRD (dyn-2 PRD(N) encoding amino acids 742–798), PCR with the primers 5′-CCT GAT TCC TGT TCC CGT GTA GGA GCT CGC CTC CTT CTC GGC G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGC CGA GAA GGA GGC GAG CTC CTA CAC GGG AAC AGG AAT CAG G-3′ (reverse) was used. This resulted in the insertion of a stop codon and a SacI restriction site complementary to nucleotides 2376–2418. The product was ligated into pET30a(+) for expression. To obtain the C terminus of dynamin-2 PRD (dyn-2 PRD(C)) coding for amino acids 801–871) the relevant cassette was excised from the full-length dyn-2 PRD plasmid with the inserted SacI restriction site using SacI-XhoI. The product was ligated into pET30a(+).Plasmids encoding these constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21A1. After growth to an appropriate density, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.2% l-arabinose. The cultures were grown for 4 h and then processed for protein purification by affinity chromatography. Briefly, bacterial pellets were sonicated in 5 volumes of a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μm leupeptin. A cytoplasmic fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g (two 30-min spins in an SS-34 rotor) and directly loaded onto a Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). The resin was sequentially washed with 10 volumes each of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm NaCl, and the same buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. Bound protein was then eluted with 0.3 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0. The eluate was dialyzed against BIAcore buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) and stored in the presence of 10% glycerol at -80 °C.SH3 Domains—pGEX plasmids encoding SH3 domains were obtained from the following colleagues: amphiphysin I and Grb2 (P. DeCamilli, Yale), c-Src (L. Robertson, Cornell), endophilin I and intersectin (Dr. P. McPherson, McGill). Each plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21A1 cells, and protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 0.2% l-arabinose for 4 h. After induction, cells were pelleted, washed, and stored at -80 °C prior to processing.For the isolation of GST-tagged proteins, pelleted cells were sonicated in a lysis buffer, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μm leupeptin, and clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min (twice). The supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-agarose affinity beads (Sigma). The beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The eluate was dialyzed against BIAcore buffer and stored in the presence of 10% glycerol at -80 °C. The purity of protein samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assessed to be >95% by Coomassie Blue staining.To obtain the Grb2-SH3(N) domain free of GST, the fusion protein was cleaved on the glutathione column matrix. An aliquot of GST-SH3-beads was extensively washed with 100 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of thrombin cleavage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2). Thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) was added at a concentration of 0.2 units/μg protein, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 5 min. The supernatant was separated from the beads and applied to p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) to remove thrombin. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the supernatant containing free SH3 domain was separated from the beads by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C or dialyzed versus HBS running buffer and used immediately. The purity of cleaved protein was confirmed by analysis on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE.Phosphorylation of Dynamin-1 PRD Domains by Cdk5 KinaseDynamin-1 PRD domain was phosphorylated with recombinant Cdk5. Both Cdk5 and its regulatory subunit p25 (plasmids obtained from Dr. H. Pant, National Institutes of Health) were expressed and purified separately and then recombined prior to phosphorylation assays, as previously described (20Sharma P. Sharma M. Amin N.D. Albers R.W. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11156-11160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cdk5 kinase was activated for 3 h by the addition of p25 at a 1:2 ratio in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm β-glycero-phosphate, 100 nm calyculin A. The standard assay mixture for dynamin phosphorylation (final volume of 100 μl) contained the same buffer plus 5 μg of Cdk5, 10 μg of p25, and 10 μg of dynamin PRD. To assess the progress of the reaction and stoichiometry, reactions were initiated by adding 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100 cpm/pmol) and were carried out at 30 °C for up to 60 min. Reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and phosphate incorporation was determined by autoradiography of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by scintillation counting of labeled bands. Up to 0.41 mol of P/mol of dynamin-1 PRD was incorporated. For the BIAcore analysis of phosphorylated PRD, reactions were scaled up 10-fold and conducted without labeled ATP. Samples were then processed by IMAC phosphoprotein affinity chromatography (using columns and reagents from Qiagen) under native conditions. The reaction mixture was dialyzed versus phosphoprotein lysis buffer in the presence of 0.25% Chaps prior to the addition to the column. The column was washed three times with 3 volumes of lysis buffer, and the phosphorylated dynamin-1 PRD was recovered with phosphoprotein elution buffer in the presence of 0.25% Chaps. The separation of phosphorylated from unphosphorylated proteins was checked using 32P-labeled PRD and autoradiography and was found to be >95% complete (i.e. <5% of applied labeled protein passed through the column).Surface Plasmon ResonanceThe affinity and the rates of interaction between dynamin and different SH3 domains were measured with a BIAcore 3000 biosensor through SPR. Various dynamin constructs were bound to the dextran matrix of a sensor chip containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid to immobilize the His6-tagged dynamin PRD domain as target (21Nieba L. Nieba-Axmann S.E. Persson A. Hamalainen M. Edebratt F. Hansson A. Lidholm J. Magnusson K. Karlsson A.F. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). All steps in the immobilization process were carried out at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The control surface was prepared similarly except that running buffer was injected instead of NiCl2 solution. All kinetic experiments were performed at 4 °C in HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20) using flow rates of 5–20 μl/min. These conditions prevented significant leakage of bound target protein from the chip. Different SH3 domains (analyte) at various concentrations (see “Results”) were added in the flow during the binding phase. The amount of protein bound to the sensor chip was monitored by the change in refractive index (given in arbitrary response units (RU)). For the measurements of kinetic parameters, the amount of immobilized His6-PRD was minimized to avoid saturation as well as avidity effects and generally did not exceed 260 RU (except in the case of free Grb2-SH3(N) measurements; see below). For stoichiometry determination, a small amount of His6-dynamin PRD resulting in a reading of ∼20–50 RU was immobilized, and SH3 domains were injected at concentrations of 1–5 μm. The association phases were monitored for 10–25 min until equilibrium was reached. After each binding experiment, the sensor chip was regenerated by sequential washing with 80 μl of 0.3 m imidazole/0.5 m NaCl followed by 80 μl of 0.35 m Na-EDTA in HBS. Duplicate or triplicate injections of each concentration of SH3 domains were performed.Data Preparation and Kinetic AnalysisThe estimation of kinetic parameters was performed by repetitive injections of a range of SH3 domain concentrations over different densities of immobilized dynamin PRD. The data were prepared by the method of “double referencing” (22De Crescenzo G. Pham P.L. Durocher Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this method, parallel injections of each SH3 domain sample over a control dextran surface were performed as well as running buffer injections over both the immobilized PRD domain and control dextran surfaces. Subtraction of these sensorgrams yielded the control; this was then subtracted from the experimental sensorgram. Each data set, consisting of sensorgrams of increasing SH3 domain concentration over the same level of immobilized PRD domain, was then analyzed using various kinetic models.The interactive software BIAevaluation (version 4.1) was used for data analysis. Sensorgram association and dissociation curves were locally or globally fit to one- and two-site models. The rate of complex formation during sample injection is described by equations of the following type, dR/dt=kaC(Rmax−R)−kdR(for a 1:1 interaction)(Eq. 1) where R represents the SPR signal in RU, C is the concentration of analyte, Rmax is the maximum analyte binding capacity in RU, and dR/dt is the rate of change of SPR signal. The early binding phase (<250 s) was used to determine the association constant (ka) between dynamin PRD and different SH3 domains. The dissociation phase (kd) was measured using the rate of decline in RU on introduction of free buffer at the end of SH3 injections. Data were simultaneously fit by the software program (global fitting algorithm), and the dissociation constant (KD) of the complexes was determined as the ratio kd/ka. For quantitative analysis, 30 independent replicate runs were performed for each sample. Data are expressed as KD ± S.E.For stoichiometry assessment, a comparison was made between the calculated binding maximum (Rmax) of SH3 domains to the full-length, N, or C termini of both PRD domains and the actual response observed. The theoretical maximum binding (Rmax) in RU is given by the following, Rmax=MWGST−SH3MWPRD⋅n⋅RPRD(Eq. 2) where MWGST-SH3 is the molecular weight of GST-SH3 domain, MWPRD is the molecular weight of dynamin PRD or N- and C-terminal fragment, n is the stoichiometry of binding, and RPRD is the level of immobilized His6-PRD domain expressed in RU.RESULTSMonophasic Binding of GST-Amphiphysin-SH3 to Dynamin PRDs—Sequence alignment of the primary structure of dynamin-1 and -2 PRDs reveals the presence of several canonical PXXP sequences that can be distinguished as class I or class II type II polyproline helix motifs (Fig. 1A; see also Ref. 12Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Note that dynamin-2 lacks a typical PXXP sequence in its N-terminal half and has additional motifs in its C-terminal tail that are not present in dynamin-1. Of the motifs identified in both dynamins, one with high conservation is the class II sequence PSRPNR in dynamin-1 and PSRPVR in dynamin-2. The former has been identified as the major amphiphysin interaction site in dynamin-1 (13Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To confirm this result and test the ability of dynamin-2 to bind amphiphysin, we assessed the kinetics of association and dissociation of GST-amphiphysin-SH3 to both PRDs using the BIAcore 3000 SPR system. Typical sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 1, B–E. Quantitative analysis of binding as in Fig. 1, B and C, revealed monophasic association and dissociation kinetics for both PRDs with calculated KD values of 9 and 25 nm, respectively (Table I). The apparent affinity is ∼20-fold higher than that previously estimated using pull-down methodology (13Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The higher KD for dynamin-2 was predicated on much slower uptake and release kinetics. Qualitative analysis, such as that shown in Fig. 1D, revealed that GST alone or a mutant amphiphysin-SH3 domain that lacks affinity for dynamin was unable to bind to the PRD. In addition, amphiphysin bound well to the isolated C-terminal fragments of each PRD but exhibited no interaction with the N-terminal fragments (Fig. 1E). These results confirm that amphiphysin-SH3 binds to a single site in the C terminus of the PRD of dynamin-1 and show that this is also true of dynamin-2, albeit with a lower affinity.Table IKinetic analysis of the interactions between dynamin-1 (and -2) PRD with endocytosis-related proteins amphiphysin-, endophilin-, and intersectin-SH3 domains ka is the association rate constant; kd is the dissociation rate constant; and KD is the equilibrium binding constant. S.E. values for ka and kd were derived from global analysis fits. S.E. values for KD were calculated using the propagation error equation. To define the equilibrium binding constants for N- and C-terminal sites, a series of SH3 domain concentrations were independently run for dynamin-1 and -2 PRD(N) and (C). Sensorgrams were fitted globally, and the rate constants and affinities were compared. —, no binding observed.SH3 domainN-terminal siteC-terminal sitekakdKDkakdKDm–1 s–1s–1nmm–1 s–1s–1nmDynamin-1 PRDAmph–––1.9 ± 0.7 × 1051.7 ± 0.6 × 10–39.9 ± 2.1Endo1.5 ± 0.3 × 1042.2 ± 0.4 × 10–413.9 ± 1.95.5 ± 0.5 × 1043.2 ± 0.3 × 10–359.2 ± 5.7Inters2.6 ± 0.4 × 1054.3 ± 0.1 × 10–2164.5 ± 2.95.5 ± 0.4 × 1044.1 ± 0.1 × 10–373.5 ± 7.4Dynamin-2 PRDAmph–––1.7 ± 0.7 × 1045.4 ± 1.8 × 10–425.7 ± 0.5Endo7.9 ± 0.4 × 1039.3 ± 0.8 × 10–4117.7 ± 11.74.0 ± 0.2 × 1042.9 ± 0.1 × 10–372.5 ± 5.1Inters–––1.5 ± 0.01 × 1055.9 ± 0.1 × 10–339.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Binding of Other Endocytosis-related SH3 Domains to Dynamin PRDs—Two other proteins that are thought to participate in dynamin-mediated endocytosis are endophilin and intersectin.

https://openalex.org/W1988935712,"Treatment with the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 12-acetate (TPA) enables radiation-resistant LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to undergo radiation-induced apoptosis, mediated via activation of the enzyme ceramide synthase (CS) and de novo synthesis of the sphingolipid ceramide (Garzotto, M., Haimovitz-Friedman, A., Liao, W. C., White-Jones, M., Huryk, R., Heston, D. W. W., Cardon-Cardo, C., Kolesnick, R., and Fuks, Z. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 5194–5201). Here, we show that TPA functions to decrease the cellular level of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein, known to repress CS activation (Liao, W.-C., Haimovitz-Friedman, A., Persaud, R., McLoughlin, M., Ehleiter, D., Zhang, N., Gatei, M., Lavin, M., Kolesnick, R., and Fuks, Z. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17908–17917). Gel shift analysis in LNCaP and CWR22-Rv1 cells demonstrated a significant reduction in DNA binding of the Sp1 transcription factor to the ATM promoter, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed a 50% reduction of ATM mRNA between 8 and 16 h of TPA treatment, indicating that TPA inhibits ATM transcription. Furthermore, treatment of LNCaP, CWR22-Rv1, PC-3, and DU-145 human prostate cells with antisense-ATM oligonucleotides, which markedly reduced cellular ATM levels, significantly enhanced radiation-induced CS activation and apoptosis, leading to apoptosis at doses as a low as 1 gray. These data suggest that the CS pathway initiates a generic mode of radiation-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells, regulated by a suppressive function of ATM, and that ATM might represent a potential target for pharmacologic inactivation with potential clinical applications in human prostate cancer. Treatment with the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 12-acetate (TPA) enables radiation-resistant LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to undergo radiation-induced apoptosis, mediated via activation of the enzyme ceramide synthase (CS) and de novo synthesis of the sphingolipid ceramide (Garzotto, M., Haimovitz-Friedman, A., Liao, W. C., White-Jones, M., Huryk, R., Heston, D. W. W., Cardon-Cardo, C., Kolesnick, R., and Fuks, Z. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 5194–5201). Here, we show that TPA functions to decrease the cellular level of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein, known to repress CS activation (Liao, W.-C., Haimovitz-Friedman, A., Persaud, R., McLoughlin, M., Ehleiter, D., Zhang, N., Gatei, M., Lavin, M., Kolesnick, R., and Fuks, Z. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17908–17917). Gel shift analysis in LNCaP and CWR22-Rv1 cells demonstrated a significant reduction in DNA binding of the Sp1 transcription factor to the ATM promoter, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed a 50% reduction of ATM mRNA between 8 and 16 h of TPA treatment, indicating that TPA inhibits ATM transcription. Furthermore, treatment of LNCaP, CWR22-Rv1, PC-3, and DU-145 human prostate cells with antisense-ATM oligonucleotides, which markedly reduced cellular ATM levels, significantly enhanced radiation-induced CS activation and apoptosis, leading to apoptosis at doses as a low as 1 gray. These data suggest that the CS pathway initiates a generic mode of radiation-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells, regulated by a suppressive function of ATM, and that ATM might represent a potential target for pharmacologic inactivation with potential clinical applications in human prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is regarded as relatively resistant to the lethal effects of radiation (3Crook J.M. Perry G.A. Robertson S.

Prostate. 1993; 23: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the androgen-responsive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells manifest resistance to both radiation-induced apoptosis (5Algan O. Stobbe C.C. Helt A.M. Hanks G.E. Chapman J.D.

Our previous studies showed that the apoptotic resistance of LNCaP cells to radiation can be reversed by pretreatment with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 12-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 12-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; CS, ceramide synthase; FB1, fumonisin B1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; AT, ataxia telangiectasia; siRNA, small interfering RNA; S-ATM ODN, sense sequence to ATM mRNA; AS-ATM ODN, antisense sequence to ATM mRNA; Gy, gray(s); DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar), TPA was reported to induce and/or enhance the apoptotic response rather than signal antiapoptosis. The apoptotic response to TPA is mediated via protein kinase C (PKC) activation, substituting for endogenous diacylglycerol (20Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When PKC activity was compared in TPA-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3, DU-145) prostate cancer cell lines, it was found that PKC activation was markedly enhanced and prolonged in LNCaP cells (21Henttu P. Vihko P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1998; 244: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Garzotto et al. (19Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar) defined a mechanism for the proapoptotic effect of TPA, reporting that treatment of LNCaP cells with TPA at maximally effective doses induces a weak apoptotic response via activation of the regulatory enzyme ceramide synthase (CS) and de novo synthesis of the sphingolipid ceramide. Ceramide is an established second messenger in signaling pathways of apoptosis induced by cytokines (i.e. Fas or tumor necrosis factor), and environmental stresses (e.g. heat shock (22Schutze S. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), serum starvation (23Puranam K.L. Guo W.X. Qian W.H. Nikbakht K. Boustany R.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 66: 294-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and radiation (14Haimovitz-Friedman A. Balaban N.A. McLoughlin M. Ehleiter D. Michaeli J. Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2591-2597PubMed Google Scholar)). CS catalyzes the condensation of the sphingoid base sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoA to form dihydroceramide, which is rapidly oxidized to form ceramide (24Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Consistent with CS conferring an apoptotic response in LNCaP cells, Garzotto et al. (19Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar) showed that TPA-mediated generation of ceramide and apoptosis were abrogated by fumonisin B1 (FB1), a specific natural inhibitor of CS activation. Subsequent studies by Garzotto et al. (1Garzotto M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Liao W.C. White-Jones M. Huryk R. Heston D.W.W. Cardon-Cardo C. Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5194-5201PubMed Google Scholar) showed that TPA also converted the radiation resistance of LNCaP cells, conferring radiosensitivity. The mechanism by which TPA enables CS activation remains unknown. Studies by Liao et al. showed that radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks signaled in bovine aortic endothelial cells post-translational activation of CS, whereas the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, also activated by DNA double strand breaks, down-regulated this response (2Liao W-C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Persaud R. McLoughlin M. Ehleiter D. Zhang N. Gatei M. Lavin M. Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17908-17917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the balance between CS activation and ATM-mediated CS repression may determine the apoptotic outcome. ATM is a nuclear 350-kDa protein kinase with a carboxyl-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase domain (25Shiloh Y. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It functions as a member of a coordinated system that detects DNA breaks; arrests the cells temporarily at G1, S, or G2 checkpoints; and activates DNA repair (26Sommer S.S. Jiang Z. Feng J. Buzin C.H. Zheng J. Longmate J. Jung M. Moulds J. Dritschilo A. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2003; 145: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ATM mutations produce the genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT), characterized by dysfunction of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems (27Sedgwick R.P. Boder E. Vianney De Jong J.M.B. Hereditary Neuropathies and Spinocerbellar Atrophies. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 347-423Google Scholar, 28Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the AT phenotype manifests chromosomal instability (29Aurias A. Dutrillaux B. Buriot D. Lejeune J. Mutat. Res. 1980; 69: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), increased frequency of malignant transformation (30Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. D.,B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), defective G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints (31Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Lavin M. J. Biol.

Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (33Chen C.Y. Lavin M. Kidson C. Moss D. Nature. 1978; 274: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Transfection with full-length ATM cDNA (34Zhang N. Chien P. Khanna K.K. Scott S. Gatei M. Kozlov S. Watters D. Spring K. Yen T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8021-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or with cDNA fragments that contain its carboxyl-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain (35Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) restored normal radiosensitivity and radiation-induced cell cycle checkpoints in AT cells, indicating that the AT radiation hypersensitivity is mediated via its protein kinase activity. Under resting conditions, there is evidence that ATM is a functionally inactive dimer (36Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Radiation induces rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of serine 1981 that leads to dimer dissociation and ATM kinase activation (36Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). The downstream signaling pathways are only partially known (37Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and details of the ATM repressive effect of CS activity are lacking. The present studies show that TPA-mediated radiosensitization of human prostate cell lines is mediated via suppression of ATM activity. TPA induces a reduction in ATM protein levels due to attenuation of the Sp1 transcription factor binding to the ATM promoter. Reduction of ATM protein enables radiation to increase CS activity, generating ceramide to induce apoptotic cell death. Conclusive evidence for the role of ATM in this response was obtained by the use of antisense ATM ODNs that depleted human prostate cells of ATM. Antisense ATM-ODNs conferred hypersensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, enabling radiation-induced apoptosis at doses as low as 1 Gy. Thus, the present studies define the mechanism of TPA-mediated radiosensitization in human prostate cell lines, providing further evidence that the balance between CS and ATM activation regulates a generic form of radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells. Materials—The human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145 were obtained from ATCC. The androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line CWR22-Rv1 was kindly provided by Dr. Jacobberger from Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH) (38Sramkoski R.M. Pretlow II, T.G. Giaconia J.M. Pretlow T.P. Schwartz S. Sy M.S. Marengo S.R. Rhim J.S. Zhang D. Jacobberger J.W. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Unless otherwise stated, all cell culture products were obtained through Mediatech (800-Cellgro). The prostate cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2; Cellgro). For experiments, cells were cultured in the same medium, except 0.2% human albumin was substituted for fetal calf serum. TPA (Sigma) was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in Me2SO and stored in 30-μl aliquots at -20 °C in the dark until use. Polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (Sp1pEp2) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Quantification of Apoptosis—Morphologic changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by staining with the DNA-binding fluorochrome bis-benzimide trihydrochloride (Hoechst-33258), as previously described (19Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scored as apoptotic when they displayed at least 3 apoptotic bodies/nucleus. CS Assay—CS activity was assessed in microsomal membranes, as described by Bose et al. (39Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were disrupted on ice by sonication in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The microsomal fraction was purified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the microsomal membrane pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. A total of 75 μg of microsomal membrane fraction was incubated with 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 μm defatted bovine serum albumin, 70 μm unlabeled palmitoyl coenzyme A, 3.6 μm (0.1 μCi) [1-14C]palmitoyl-coenzyme A, and escalating amounts of dihydrosphingosine (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm). This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The lipid fraction was dried under N2 and resuspended in 50 μl of a chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) solution containing 1 mg/ml ceramide and diacylglycerol. Lipids were resolved on a silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman) in a solvent consisting of chloroform, methanol, 3.5 n NH4OH (85:15:1, v/v/v). The ceramide band was localized by iodine vapor staining based on comigration with commercially available ceramide (Sigma Type III) and quantified using liquid scintillation counting. Under the conditions used, the substrate was not rate-limiting, and the reaction was linear for the time and enzyme concentration. Determination of Km and Vmax was performed using Eadie-Hofstee analysis as described by Bose et al. (39Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Ceramide Levels—Ceramide was quantified using the diacylglycerol kinase assay as previously described (1Garzotto M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Liao W.C. White-Jones M. Huryk R. Heston D.W.W. Cardon-Cardo C. Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5194-5201PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LNCaP cells were detached from the monolayer by gentle pipetting. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. Further extraction was performed with 600 μl of buffered saline solution (135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)) with 10 mm EDTA. Lipids in the organic phase extract were dried under N2 and subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis (0.1 n methanolic KOH for 1 h at 37 °C) to remove glycerophospholipids. Samples were re-extracted, and the organic phase was dried under N2. Ceramide was quantified by the DG kinase assay as described (1Garzotto M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Liao W.C. White-Jones M. Huryk R. Heston D.W.W. Cardon-Cardo C. Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5194-5201PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of ATM Protein Expression—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min to remove membranes and nuclear DNA. The concentration of protein in the samples was determined using the BCA technique, purchased from Pierce, and performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were then boiled in 4× denaturing Laemmli sample buffer and stored at -80 °C. ATM was resolved using a 5% low cross-linked SDS gel. Monoclonal anti-ATM antibody MAT3 was kindly given by Prof. Y Shiloh (Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel), whereas the anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a 1:1000 dilution. The bands were revealed using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the loading controls, the membranes were first stripped using 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 1 h at 50 °C, and then the membranes were washed three times in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20. The membrane was reprobed using an anti-DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibody (Neomarkers) at a 1:200 dilution, and the bands were revealed using the same protocol as used for anti-ATM. For densitometry, the bands corresponding to ATM were scanned and analyzed using ImageJ version 1.29 image analysis software. mRNA Analysis—Levels of mRNA were analyzed by quantitative PCR as described (40Keating K.E. Gueven N. Watters D. Rodemann H.P. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, during the PCR process, known amounts of 402-bp DNA fragments corresponding to a mutation of ATM lacking exon 38 were used in 2-fold dilutions as a competitor for the amplification of the same region in normal ATM, which gave a 544-bp fragment. A DNA fragment (402 bp) corresponding to an ATM mutation (G5319A) lacking exon 38 was employed as a competitor of ATM cDNA amplification (nucleotides 5122–5665, 544 bp in size) in a series of 2-fold dilutions from LNCaP cells. When the amplified bands showed the same intensity, this provided the concentration of ATM mRNA. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding of Sp1 to its consensus sequence was determined by a modification of a method described previously (40Keating K.E. Gueven N. Watters D. Rodemann H.P. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 106 cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before resuspension in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a 15-min incubation on ice, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, then the sample was vortexed for 10 s before centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 1 min. The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C to elute the nuclear proteins. After further centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 15-μl aliquots and stored at -70 °C. Approximately 35 fmol of 32P-labeled (using T4 polynucleotide kinase) double-stranded Sp1 consensus sequence (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) was added to 10 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 1 μg of herring sperm DNA, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and binding buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Binding was at room temperature for 25 min, and then the bands were resolved using a native 5% polyacrylamide gel. Transfection Studies—FLAG-tagged wild type and kinase-dead ATM, which has a deletion of 200 bp in the 3′ region in the pcDNA3 vector, were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Kastan (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and have been previously described (41Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The plasmids were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h following transfection, cells were selected in normal medium containing 200 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen), and G418-resistant colonies were expanded. Cells expressing the highest level of transfected ATM (WT8.4) by Western blot were selected for experiments. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against Sp1 and the control sequence were derived from sequences previously published (42Li T. Chen Y. Liu T. Jia J. Hampson S. Shan Y. Kibler D. Wang P. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A 100 nm concentration of either siRNA against Sp1 or control was transfected into LNCaP using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The efficacy of the siRNA was determined by Western blot against Sp1 protein, which showed significant reduction in Sp1 protein levels 24 h after treatment. Antisense Inactivation of ATM—For antisense experiments, morpholino oligonucleotides (ODNs) purchased from Gene Tools LLC (Philomath, OR) were used. Morpholino ODNs have the advantage of being more stable and more resistant to endonucleases and have a better sequence specificity than phosphorothioate ODNs (43Taylor M.F. Paulauskis J.D. Weller D.D. Kobzik L. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 44Summerton J. Stein D. Huang S.B. Matthews P. Weller D. Partridge M. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For targeting of ATM mRNA, the first 25 bases of the mRNA sequence (ACTAGACTCATGGTTCACAATTTCA) were used as recommended by the manufacturer (Gene Tools LLC). Morpholino ODNs were delivered to the cell using the “Special Delivery” system (Gene Tools LLC), which is a method for coupling the nonionic morpholino to complementary DNA bound electrostatically to a partially ionized, weakly basic ethoxylated polyethyleneimine. A total of 3 μmol of morpholino ODN was used, and after 3 h of treatment with the morpholino/ethoxylated polyethyleneimine mixture, the supernatant was removed and replaced with normal medium. The cells were subsequently left in culture for either 4 days for LNCaP cells or 3 days for CWR22-Rv1, PC-3, and DU-145 cells before use, which represented the time of maximal reduction in ATM protein level when analyzed by Western blot. Studies using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ODNs showed the efficiency of transfection to be at least 65%. Cell Cycle Studies—To determine the cell cycle distribution of the preconfluent LNCaP cultures used in the present studies, a modification of the protocol published by Pozarowski and Darzynkiewicz (45Pozarowski P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 301-311PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Cells were incubated in 0.2% human albumin-containing medium 16 h before irradiation, at which time TPA was added at 10 ng/ml. Cells were exposed to 20 Gy and collected every 12 h for 48 h. At the different time points, cell were trypsinized and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and then stored at -20 °C. 1 h before fluorescein isothiocyanate analysis, the cells were centrifuged, and the ethanol solution was replaced with a 3.8 mm sodium citrate (Sigma) solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 100 units/ml RNase. The DNA content of the nuclei was measured using FACScalibur, with 10,000 gated events counted, and data were analyzed using Flowjo version 6.1.1. To determine the duration of cell traversal through the different cell cycle phases, cells were blocked at the G1/S border using aphidicolin (50 μg/ml) and washed out 24 h later. The cells were left to cycle for 2 h before being pulse-labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (10 μm) for 45 min as per the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen Flow Kit, San Diego, CA). Cells were irradiated, and samples were taken every 4 h over a period of 28 h and then fixed in 70% cold ethanol. LNCaP cells were then incubated with anti-bromodeoxyuridine fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody, and total DNA was stained using 7-amino-actinomycin D, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was examined along with total DNA fluorescence using flow cytometry (FACScalibur). 10,000 gated events were counted, and the data were analyzed with Flowjo version 6.1.1. Colony-forming Assay—LNCaP cells were either untreated or treated with sense or antisense ATM ODNs as described above. LNCaP cells were then irradiated with 0, 1, 2, and 3 Gy, trypsinized, and replated in triplicate at various cell concentrations for colony formation. Colonies were cultured for 2 weeks at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in complete medium to allow for at least six cell divisions. The surviving colonies were fixed and stained with 1% crystal violet in 0.2 m citric acid. Colonies with at least 50 cells were scored, and the results were analyzed by the CellFit version 2.5 program (46Albright N. Radiat. Res. 1987; 112: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the effect of TPA represents a LNCaP cell-specific phenomenon, we carried out experiments with another androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, CWR22-Rv1. TPA induced a time- and dose-dependent apoptotic response in these cells (Fig. 1A), although induction of apoptosis was slower than that reported in LNCaP cells (1Garzotto M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Liao W.C. White-Jones M. Huryk R. Heston D.W.W. Cardon-Cardo C. Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5194-5201PubMed Google Scholar). At 10 ng/ml, apoptosis became detectable by 32 h and peaked at 35–40% by 66 h (p = 0.005). As little as 300 pg/ml TPA was effective, and a maximal effect was achieved with 10–50 ng/ml (data not shown). Pretreatment with a 40 μm concentration of the CS inhibitor FB1 markedly attenuated apoptosis to 12 ± 0.55% at 72 h from 30.1 ± 1.15% observed with 10 ng/ml TPA alone (Fig. 1B). These studies indicated that, similar to LNCaP, CWR22-Rv1 cells respond to phorbol ester stimulation with CS-mediated apoptosis. A kinetic analysis of CS activity disclosed maximal activation from 26 to 32 h post-TPA treatment (Fig. 1C), which corresponded to the time when ceramide levels were rising significantly (Fig. 1D). Eadee-Hofstee transformation of the data revealed that the maximal"

The kinetics and extent of cytochrome b reduced by quinol in the presence of variable concentrations of antimycin decreased non-linearly and could only be fitted to a model in which electrons entering through one center N can equilibrate between the two cytochrome b subunits of the bc1 complex dimer. The bH heme absorbance in a bc1 complex inhibited at center P and preincubated with substoichiometric concentrations of antimycin showed a red shift upon the addition of substrate, which indicates that electrons from the uninhibited center N in one monomer are able to reach the bH heme at the antimycin-blocked site in the other. The extent of cytochrome b reduction by variable concentrations of menaquinol could only be fitted to a kinetic model that assumes electron equilibration between center N sites in the dimer. Kinetic simulations showed that non-rate-limiting electron equilibration between the two bH hemes in the dimer through the two bL hemes is possible upon reduction through one center N despite the thermodynamically unfavorable bH to bL electron transfer step.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), the cytochrome bc1 complex is able to move charges across the membrane in which it is embedded by using one of the two electrons obtained from quinol oxidation at center P to reduce quinone bound at center N. A key feature of this cycle is that the semiquinone formed at center N after one center P turnover needs to be stabilized until the second electron from another QH2 oxidation at center P can arrive. A stable SQ at center N has been detected by EPR spectroscopy in the bc1 complex from different sources (3Siedow J.N. Power S. de la Rosa F.F. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2392-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5De Vries S.

Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8702-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this stabilization helps to explain why superoxide formation at center N is virtually non-existent when center P is blocked with stigmatellin (7Sun J. Trumpower B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, considering that reactions at center N are fully reversible, stabilizing SQ at center N should also favor the one electron transfer from QH2 to heme bH. When heme bH is reduced, center P catalysis is slowed down, as has been observed when antimycin blocks cytochrome b reoxidation or when there is no Q available to oxidize heme bH (9Snyder C.H. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13535-13541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, a mechanism should exist that avoids bH reduction through center N without destabilizing SQ at that site. Crystal structures of the bc1 complexes from various sources (10Xia D. Yu C.A.

According to electron tunneling calculations, such distance should allow electron transfer at a rate in the order of 104-105 s–1 (14Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Before this structural information was available, kinetic and spectroscopic evidence was used to propose direct electron equilibration between the two center N sites of the dimer (15De Vries S. Albracht A.S.J. Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Marres C.A. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, such equilibration was assumed to occur by direct electron transfer between the Q molecules bound at the two center N sites and not by electron communication between the bL hemes. Crystal structures have since shown such transfer to be impossible due to distance constraints. We have recently provided evidence that two bH hemes per bc1 dimer can be reduced through one center P when both center N sites are blocked with antimycin and that the stimulation of steady state catalysis by low concentrations of antimycin requires both monomers to use only one center N for Q reduction (17Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, rapid mobility of an antimycin molecule between the two N sites of the dimer has also been proposed to account for non-linear inhibition of steady state activity (18Bechmann G. Weiss H. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have analyzed the pre-steady state kinetics of reduction through center N and conclude that electron equilibration between cytochrome b subunits through the bL hemes of the dimeric bc1 complex is the only model consistent with the experimental data. We also suggest that a possible function of this intermonomer electron communication is to use the stabilization of SQ at center N to maintain the bH hemes in the oxidized state, ensuring a maximal rate of QH2 oxidation at center P. Materials—Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Roche Applied Science. DEAE-Bio-Gel was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Stigmatellin was from Fluka. Antimycin, myxothiazol, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, horse heart cytochrome c, decylubiquinone, sodium ascorbate, sodium dithionite, and sodium borohydride were purchased from Sigma. MQ was synthesized in the laboratory. DBH2 and MQH2 were prepared as described before (19Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol.

Antimycin, myxothiazol, stigmatellin, and DBH2 were quantified by UV spectroscopy (21Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by using reported extinction coefficients (22Von Jagow G. Link T.A.

MQH2 was quantified by determining the amount of cytochrome c reduced by 50 nmbc1 complex, assuming two cytochrome c molecules reduced per MQH2 oxidized. Purification of Cytochrome bc1 Complex—Cytochrome bc1 complex was isolated from Red Star cake yeast as described previously (19Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by using extinction coefficients of 17.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 553–539 for cytochrome c1 (25Yu C.A. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1012-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 25.6 mm–1 cm–1 at 563–579 for the average absorbance of the bH and bL heme in cytochrome b (26Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Quantification of Endogenous Ubiquinone in Purified bc1 Complex— A modification of the procedure reported by Kröger (27Kröger A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, 100 μlofa30–80 μm solution of purified bc1 complex was mixed with 2.4 ml of a mixture of 60% methanol: 40% cyclohexane (v/v) in a 10-ml glass tube with screw cap. The upper phase containing cyclohexane was collected, and the lower layer was re-extracted with 1 ml of cyclohexane. The cyclohexane phases were evaporated under an argon gas flow, and the yellowish residue was dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol. UV spectra of these samples were recorded in the range of 240–340 nm by using an Aminco DW-2 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded before and after the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m sodium borohydride. The reduced spectra were subtracted from the oxidized spectra, and Q content was calculated from these difference spectra by using an extinction coefficient of 12.9 mm–1cm–1 at 275 nm. The average content of endogenous Q in three different purified bc1 complex preparations was found to be 1.08 ± 0.08 Q/monomer. Pre-steady State Reduction of bc1 Complex—Pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS rapid scanning monochromator (20Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 3 μm enzyme (expressed as monomers of bc1 complex) in assay buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 6 μm stigmatellin or myxothiazol, and variable concentrations of antimycin (between 0 and 3 μm) against an equal volume of the same buffer, without enzyme and inhibitors, containing different concentrations of DBH2 or MQH2. For each experiment, 6–8 data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted. The time course of absorbance change at 563 and 578 nm was extracted by using software from OLIS. Kinetic Modeling—The Dynafit program (Biokin, Ltd.) used for kinetic modeling calculates and solves a system of differential equations that correspond to the time-dependent change in concentration for each species involved in a given reaction mechanism, including substrates and products, as well as any other ligands (28Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The mechanism is described as a series of individual reaction steps. A family of kinetic traces in which one or more ligand concentrations are changed can be fitted globally to one or more kinetic models. An extinction coefficient can be assigned to some of those species that contribute to observed absorbance changes. In the models used in the present work, extinction coefficients of 36 and 15 mm–1cm–1 were used for hemes bH and bL, respectively. These values come from the reported extinction coefficient of 51.2 mm–1cm–1 for a fully reduced cytochrome b monomer (usually expressed as 25.6 mm–1cm–1 for the average absorbance of both b hemes), taking into consideration that bH contributes ∼70% of this value (26Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 29Rich P.R. Jeal A.E. Madgwick S.A. Moody A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since the mixing chamber in the OLIS-rapid scanning monochromator has a path length of 2 cm, full bH reduction of the bc1 complex present in the reaction (1.5 μm) would result in a Δ absorbance value at 563–579 of ∼0.108, whereas full bH and bL reduction should yield Δ absorbance = 0.154. Dynafit also allows modeling of an equilibration phase in which two or more ligands interact before dilution and the addition of other reactants. A simplified explanation of the models used in fitting and simulating data is provided below. The complete script files are provided as Supplemental Data. For fitting of pre-steady state kinetics of cytochrome b reduction by QH2 through center N in the presence of variable antimycin concentrations, two models were used. One of the models assumed that the dimeric oxidized enzyme (E) bound tightly one or two inhibitor (I) molecules in a random, non-cooperative manner before the addition of substrate to form three possible complexes (E.I, I.E, and I.E.I). Then, binding of QH2 was allowed to form five possible productive complexes (E.QH2,QH2.E, QH2.E.QH2, I.E.QH2, and QH2.E.I). Electron transfer reactions were assumed to occur for each of these complexes as shown in Fig. 2, Scheme 1, in which reactions for only two of all possible complexes (I.E.QH2 and QH2.E.I) are depicted. This model assumed that an electron in the bH heme of one monomer (EbH or bHE) could be transferred to the bH heme in the other monomer reversibly in a single step (with k3 = k-3), which would include intermediate reactions occurring through the bL hemes not explicitly considered in this particular model. The result of this intradimer equilibration is that both bH hemes can be reduced through only one center N in the dimer. This is illustrated in Scheme 1, in which both bH hemes in QH2.E.I and I.E.QH2 can be reduced to yield Q.bHEbH.I and I.bHEbH.Q. In this model, SQ was considered to be a tightly bound ligand, not dissociating from E. The second model omitted the intermonomer electron transfer step and included instead the movement of I from one monomer to the other (18Bechmann G. Weiss H. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2, Scheme 2. In this model, QH2 (Em = 90 mV) is not able to reduce heme bL (Em = –30 mV, see Ref. 30Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) significantly to form Q, which would then be able to leave center N. Thus, SQ had to be assumed to dissociate, allowing the inhibitor to move from the oxidized to the reduced bH monomer. This made it possible for QH2 to bind and reduce the second bH in the dimer, as illustrated in Fig. 2, Scheme 2, in which I.bHEbH.SQ and SQ.bHEbH.I can only be formed after SQ dissociates from SQ.bHE.I and I.EbH.SQ. This dissociation was considered to be irreversible due to the reactivity of the highly reducing SQ molecule outside center N. Movement of I between monomers was described by a rate constant (kim) different from the dissociation rate constant that would result in the formation of free I (kdI). Reduction of cytochrome b by MQH2 through center N in the absence of antimycin was also fitted to two different models. One of them was a modified version of the mechanism explained in Fig. 2, Scheme 1 in which equilibration of one molecule of endogenous Q per bc1 complex monomer was allowed before dilution and mixing with MQH2. For simplicity, no distinction was made between the monomers, as was done in the models described above. Electron transfer between monomers was implicitly included by making ligands in either site exchange electrons with either one of the bH hemes. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, Scheme 3, in which some of the possible reactions included for E.MQH2.Q are shown. The same sequence of possible reactions would apply for E.MQH2 and E.MQH2.MQH2, with additional binding and dissociation of ligands from any of the two center N sites of the dimer. Only the semiquinones SQ and MSQ were assumed not to dissociate from the enzyme. Reduction of bL was included in additional reaction steps from EbHbH complexes. To reduce script size, binding of MQ and QH2 were not written as separate reactions but were instead included in the corresponding electron transfer step in which they participated. This is reasonable considering that the reactions involving these two ligands will be mostly unidirectional, with MQ (Em = –70 mV) rarely taking electrons from bH (Em = 120 mV) and QH2 being formed in low concentrations from the two-electron reduction of only 1 eq of endogenous Q per monomer. The second model used considered E to be only a monomeric bc1 complex, with no possibility of intermonomer electron transfer. This linear model describes a transhydrogenation reaction in which electrons from MQH2 can only be transferred to Q after both bH and bL hemes in a monomer have been reduced so that MQ leaves center N and Q binds to oxidize the fully reduced cytochrome b. This mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 2, Scheme 4. The only rate constants that were fixed during the fitting procedure were kb and k–b, which describe the electron transfer between the bL and bH hemes. Considering that equilibration between both hemes occurs within a few μs, the rate from bL to bH (kb) was set to 105 s–1. To fix the value for the reverse rate constant from bH to bL (k–b), the following thermodynamic considerations were made. The equilibrium constant (Keq) for electron transfer between both hemes can be calculated from the Nernst equation at 25 °C. ΔEm=59.2mVlog[oxbH][redbL][redbH][oxbL](Eq. 1) Keq=[oxbH][redbL][redbH][oxbL]=10ΔEm59.2mV(Eq. 2) Using a difference in redox potential (ΔEm) between the two b hemes in yeast of –150 mV (30Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 722: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), an equilibrium constant (Keq) of 0.0029 for the electron transfer from bH to bL is obtained. However, to calculate the ratio of [redbL]/[redbH] when only one electron is moving between the two hemes, the following applies [oxbH]=[redbL][redbH]=[oxbL](Eq. 3) As a result of these assumptions, the Nernst equation can be expressed as ΔEm=59.2mVlog[redbL]2[redbH]2(Eq. 4) Rearranging, we obtain [redbL][redbH]=10ΔEm2(59.2mV)(Eq. 5) For ΔEm = –150 mV, the [redbL]/[redbH] ratio when one electron is equilibrating within a cytochrome b monomer is 0.054. Therefore, a ratio of k–b/kb = 0.054 was also used for those reactions in Fig. 2, Scheme 4 describing electron transfer between bH and bL. Since kb was chosen to be 105 s–1, k–b was set to 5400 s–1. It is noteworthy that the ratio of these unimolecular rate constants is not the same as the value obtained for the formal Keq from Equation 2 (0.0029) but is equal to Keq. This comes from the fact that the kb/k–b ratio was used to express the [redbL]/[redbH] ratio as deduced from Equations 3, 4, 5 and not the complete ratio of [oxbH][redbL]/[redbH][oxbL], which would require bimolecular constants (in units of M–1s–1) to be used. Determination of the Antimycin-induced Red Shift of Heme bH Absorbance—Red shifts induced by antimycin upon reduction with substrate after inhibitor addition were determined after incubating 3 μm yeast enzyme for at least 2 min with 6 μm stigmatellin and different concentrations of antimycin in assay buffer before rapid mixing against an equal volume of buffer containing 24 μm MQH2 by using the OLIS rapid scanning monochromator. The kinetic traces showed no further change in cytochrome b absorbance measured at 568–579 nm after 1.2 s of collection. Therefore, the 800 spectra collected between 1.2 and 2.0 s were averaged by using the OLIS software. The absorbance values for all spectra were exported and analyzed with the Origin 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.). The averaged spectrum without antimycin cannot be used directly as a reference for the spectra with antimycin because of its larger absorbance. Therefore, a normalization procedure was followed to generate a calculated reference spectrum for each of the spectra with antimycin. First, the absorbance of all spectra was made equal to zero at the reference wavelengths for cytochrome b (579 nm) by subtracting the absorbance of all wavelengths from the value at 579 nm. Then, the absorbance of each of the spectra at the reference wavelength for cytochrome c1 (539 nm) was also made equal to zero while maintaining the absorbance value at 579 nm fixed, applying the following equation. Absλf=Absλi−(579−λ579−539)Abs539(Eq. 6) Absλf is the final absorbance value at a particular wavelength (λ), and Absλi is the initial absorbance at that same wavelength. This equation in effect changes the slope of an imaginary line between 539 and 579 nm to a value of zero. Therefore, the final result is that all spectra will have zero absorbance at both wavelengths while preserving the shape of the spectra, similar to a baseline correction. The final step involves normalizing the absorbance of the spectrum taken with no antimycin to each of the other spectra separately. Since the maximum absorbance of the spectrum without antimycin was at 563 nm, this wavelength was used for the normalization according to the following equation. AbsλfnI0=AbsλiI0(Abs563InAbs563iI0)(Eq. 7) AbsλfnI0 corresponds to the final absorbance at each wavelength of the spectrum with zero antimycin that is used as reference for the spectrum taken with n equivalents of antimycin per bc1 complex monomer. This generated a unique reference spectrum for each of the spectra with inhibitor. AbsλfnI0 is the initial absorbance at each wavelength of the spectrum with no antimycin (after applying Equation 6 above). Abs563In is the absorbanceIat 563 nm of the spectrum taken with n equivalents of antimycin. Abs563iI0 corresponds to the initial absorbance at 563 nm of the spectrum with no antimycin that resulted from applying Equation 6. For example, if the absorbance at 563 Inm of a spectrum taken with a certain concentration of antimycin (Abs563In) was 0.03, and the absorbance at that same wavelength in the spectrum with no antimycin (Abs563iI0) was 0.06, the absorbance at all wavelengths of the spectrum with no antimycin (AbsλiI0) would be multiplied by 0.5 to obtain the reference spectrum. The normalized absorbance at each wavelength this reference spectrum of (AbsλfnI0) was then subtracted from the absorbance at each wavelength Iof the spectrum with that particular concentration of antimycin (AbsλIn), as expressed in Equation 8. ΔAbsλIn=AbsλIn−AbsλfnI0(Eq. 8) The difference spectra for each n antimycin concentration (ΔAbsλIn) had zero absorbance at 539, 563, and 579 nm because of the normalization procedure described above. This resulted in red shift spectra with larger absolute absorbance values for the peak than for the trough. However, the absolute absorbance difference between peak and trough is independent of this asymmetry, and therefore, the magnitude of the red shift can still be taken as a direct measure of antimycin bound to a center N, where the bH heme underwent reduction after the addition of the inhibitor. Titration of the Pre-steady State Reduction of Cytochrome b through Center N with Antimycin—When center P was blocked, increasing concentrations of antimycin at intervals of 0.1 mol/mol of bc1 monomer modified the kinetics of cytochrome b reduction by DBH2 as shown in Fig. 3. A good fit to the experimental data (Fig. 3A) was obtained by using a model that allowed electrons to move between monomers as described in Fig. 2, Scheme 1, and under “Experimental Procedures.” A fitted value of 21.1 s–1 was obtained for the intradimer electron transfer rate (k3 in Fig. 2, Scheme 1, see Supplemental Data for fitted values of all other rate constants). In contrast, fitting to a model assuming fast antimycin movement between monomers and no intradimer electron transfer yielded sharply biphasic kinetics and a larger extent of reduction than experimentally observed, especially at low antimycin concentrations (Fig. 3B). This was a consequence of the SQ dissociation step (fitted value of k1 dSQ = 3.4 s–) included in the model, which was needed to allow movement of an inhibitor molecule from an oxidized to a reduced monomer (Fig. 2, Scheme 2). According to this model, the excess of QH2 present (16 mol of DBH2/monomer) should result in full bH reduction in both monomers (ΔAbs ∼0.1) when little or no inhibitor is present, which was clearly not the case. Furthermore, the fitted value for the rate of intermonomer movement of antimycin (kim = 1.9 × 109 s–1) had a standard error several orders of magnitude higher than the fitted value. This means that any value for this constant could be used with little effect on the overall kinetics because movement of antimycin from one monomer to the other would be limited by the rate of SQ dissociation (kdSQ). Modifying the model by allowing SQ dissociation to be reversible by including an association rate constant (kaSQ) with a separate irreversible step describing SQ autoxidation to Q outside center N did not improve the fitting (data not shown). When the total extent of cytochrome b reduction was plotted as a function of antimycin concentration, non-linear titration curves were obtained (Fig. 4). This occurred independently of the substrate (DBH2 or MQH2) or center P inhibitor (stigmatellin or myxothiazol) used. Titrating center N with another inhibitor such as ilicicolin (31Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) yielded the same results (not shown). These non-linear titration curves could be fitted by assuming that the same extent of reduction could be obtained when either one or both center N sites per dimer were not bound by antimycin (Fig. 4, solid lines). This implies that both bH hemes in a dimer can equilibrate with the substrate through only one center N, as assumed in the model used for fitting in Fig. 3A. In contrast, if each bH heme is assumed to be reducible only through its adjacent center N in the same monomer, linear inhibition would be expected (Fig. 4, dashed lines). Linear binding of antimycin to center N was observed by measuring the red shift induced in the spectrum of dithionite-reduced bH upon binding of the inhibitor (not shown), as has been reported in other bc1 complexes (32Van den Berg W.H. Prince R.C. Bashford L. Takamiya K. Bonner W.D. Dutton P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8594-8604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This eliminates the possibility that non-linearity in the extent of cytochrome b reduction was due to poor accessibility of antimycin to center N at low inhibitor concentrations due to the presence of detergent. Reduction of bH Heme in the Antimycin-blocked Center N— Hydrophobic tightly bound inhibitors similar to antimycin dissociate very slowly from their binding sites, with dissociation rates in the order of at least minutes (33Zhang L.

This means that antimycin bound at a particular center N will not dissociate within the 1–2 s needed to reduce cytochrome b with QH2 or MQH2, thus preventing bH reduction at that ce"

IRF-8 induced in peritoneal macrophages by interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide was degraded rapidly, and degradation of IRF-8 was blocked by MG132, the proteasome inhibitor, but inhibitors of calpain and lysosomal enzymes had no effect. The ubiquitination of IRF-8 was shown by co-immunoprecipitation from RAW264.7 macrophages retrovirally transduced with IRF-8 and hemagglutinin-ubiquitin.

Ten members of this family have been identified thus far: IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, IRF-4/Pip/ISCAT, IRF-5, IRF-6, IRF-7, IRF-8/interferon consensus sequence-binding protein, IRF-9/p48, and IRF-10. In addition, there are at least four distantly related viral homologues encoded by human herpes virus 8 (2Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J.

The IRF family is defined by a highly conserved amino-terminal DNA-binding domain characterized by a repeat containing five tryptophan residues, which is homologous to the c-myb proto-oncogene DNA-binding domain (4Veals S.A.

In addition, IRF-8 expression has also been reported in the mouse lens, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and embryonic fibroblasts (12Egwuagu C.E. Sztein J. Chan C.C. Mahdi R. Nussenblatt R.B.

IRF-8 inhibits IRF-1-mediated transcriptional activation and acts as co-repressor with IRF-2. The domain responsible for IRF-8 repression has been mapped to the carboxyl terminus (17Sharf R.

However, IRF-8 can also activate gene expression required for the development and function of macrophages (5Tamura T. Ozato K. J.

Immunol. 1995; 146: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Both IRF-8- and IRF-1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to several pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Leishmania major (20Scharton-Kersten T. Contursi C.

Macrophages from these mice do not produce IL-12 in response to IFN-γ and LPS. These results indicate the essential nature of IRF-8 and IRF-1 for the generation of a Th1 immune response.It has been clearly demonstrated that an unregulated Th1 immune response and subsequent overproduction of Th1 cytokines lead to autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and type I diabetes (23Neurath M.F. Finotto S. Glimcher L.H. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 24Rosloniec E.F. Latham K. Guedez Y.B.

There is thus intense interest in understanding the regulation of the Th1 immune response, with the goal of developing therapeutic strategies. The regulated expression of IRF-8 and IRF-1 controls the character of immune responses, and the expression level of a transcription factor reflects the balance between synthesis and degradation. Although much is known about the mechanism regulating the synthesis of IRF-8 and IRF-1, little is known about the mechanism of degradation of IRF-8 and IRF-1 and its role in regulating IL-12 expression. In the present study we report that ubiquitination of IRF-8 by the E3 ligase Cbl targets IRF-8 for degradation, which results in down-regulation of IL-12 expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Antibodies—N-Carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (MG132), leupeptin, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-4-guanidino butane, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and LPS were from Sigma. Lactacystin was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. IFN-γ was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against IRF-8, IRF-1, IRF-4, β-actin, and ubiquitin were obtained from Santa Cruz. HA mAb 12CA5 was from Roche Applied Science, and FLAG mAb M2 was obtained from Sigma.Plasmid Constructs—Full-length IRF-8 cDNA and IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The IRF-1 expression plasmid was a gift from T. Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The HA-ubiquitin plasmid and HA-ubiquitin mutant plasmids K48R, K29R, and K63R were kindly provided by Dr. Ze'ev Ronai (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The Cbl dominant negative plasmid was a gift from Dr. Reuben Siraganian (National Institutes of Health).Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C3H/OUJ, C57BL/6, and Cbl–/– mice 3 days after injection (intraperitoneal) of 2 ml of thioglycollate medium. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.Cell Lines—The RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cbl+/+ and Cbl–/– fibroblast cells were obtained from Dr. H. Band (Harvard Medical School) and maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.Transfection—293T cells were transiently transfected using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate as described previously (28Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). For each transfection, 10–20 μg of plasmid was used.IL-12 p40 Promoter Assay—RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid was mixed with 100 μl of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of Superfect reagent. After 10 min at room temperature, 600 μlof DMEM complete medium was added, and the mixture was added to cells in 6-well plates. Luciferase activity was measured 16–24 h later. When indicated, murine IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) or LPS (1 μg/ml) was added to the culture for 6–12 h before harvest. The cells were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of extract was assayed for luciferase as described previously (11Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to normalize experiments for transfection efficiency.IL-12 p40 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—RAW264.7 cells transduced with retrovirus-encoded IRF-8 and dominant negative Cbl or green fluorescent protein were activated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. In addition, peritoneal macrophages from wild type and Cbl–/– mice were activated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The supernatants were collected for quantification of IL-12 p40 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems).Retroviral Transduction—For retroviral transduction we used a derivative of the Moloney murine leukemia virus vector pMMP412 (29Pickl W.F. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7175-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To prepare pseudotyped virus, human 293 EbnaT cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish. The next day, cells were transfected using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate containing 2.5 μg of plasmid pMD.G encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, 7.5 μg of plasmid pMD.OGP encoding gag-pol, and 10 μg of the retroviral expression construct. 48 h after transfection, the viral supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 800 × g, and used to infect cells. RAW264.7 cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in 12 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of Polybrene (4 μg/ml), aliquoted into 6-well plates, and spun at 800 × g in a microtiter rotor at room temperature for 1 h.Immunoblotting—Cell lysates and pre-stained molecular mass markers were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST; incubated with anti-IRF-8, anti-ubiquitin, anti-IRF-1, anti-IRF-4, anti-β-actin, or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies (1:2000) for 1–2 h; washed with TBST; and stained with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:5000). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Santa Cruz).Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (4 °C, 15 min, 14,000 rpm), aliquots (500 μg) were incubated with 5 μg of normal goat IgG for 4 h, and IgG was collected with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and incubated with 2 μg of IRF-8 antibody (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking, after which immune complexes were collected as described before with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose. After washing five times with lysis buffer, immunoblotting was performed as described.RESULTSIRF-8 in Peritoneal Macrophages Is Degraded by the Proteasome—We have shown previously that IFN-γ and LPS synergistically induce IRF-8 protein expression in macrophages (11Xiong H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and we now examine the stability of IRF-8. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages from C3H/OUJ mice activated for 6 h with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) were incubated with fresh medium in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm), and at various time intervals cell lysates were assayed by immunoblotting for IRF-8. The expression of IRF-8 decreased with a t½ between 2 and 5 h, but in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132, IRF-8 became stable (Fig. 1A). Equivalent results were obtained with cells pretreated with cycloheximide (10 μm) for 30 min (Fig. 1B). We have also examined two other members of the IRF family, IRF-1 and IRF-4. IRF-1 was degraded in a pattern similar to that of IRF-8, and the degradation was again blocked by MG132 (Fig. 1B). However, IRF-4, which is constitutively expressed in macrophages, was stable (Fig. 1B). Inhibitors of calpains and lysosomal enzymes had no effect on IRF-8 degradation (Fig. 2). Notably, lactacystin, a more specific proteasome inhibitor than MG132, blocked degradation of IRF-8 to the same extent as MG132 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the proteasome is involved in the degradation of IRF-8 and IRF-1.Fig. 2IRF-8 degradation is blocked by proteasome inhibitors. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were activated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated with fresh medium in the presence of calpastatin (5 μm), Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK; 50 μm), trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-4-guanidinobutane (E64; 50 μm), leupeptin (50 μm), MG132 (10 μm), and lactacystin (10 μm) for 5 h. Cell lysates were analyzed for IRF-8 and β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ubiquitination of IRF-8 in RAW264.7 Murine Macrophages—We next addressed the pathway leading to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitin has diverse cellular functions, including marking proteins for degradation by the proteasome. As a model for peritoneal macrophages, we used the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, in which IRF-8 is also degraded rapidly (Fig. 3A). Cell lysates from IFN-γ- and LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells were immunoprecipitated with IRF-8 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody. A high molecular mass smear typical of multi-ubiquitinated proteins was detected, which was increased following incubation with MG132 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, IRF-4, which is stable, was not ubiquitinated. To confirm the ubiquitination of IRF-8 in RAW264.7 cells, 48 h after co-transduction with retroviruses encoding IRF-8 and HA-ubiquitin, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRF-8 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Ubiquitinated protein was present only in samples in which IRF-8 was expressed (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that both endogenously and exogenously expressed IRF-8 in RAW264.7 cells are subject to ubiquitination.Fig. 3Ubiquitination of IRF-8 in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. RAW264.7 cells were activated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added for 30 min, and the cells were incubated with fresh medium in the presence or absence of MG132 (10 μm). Cell lysates were analyzed for IRF-8 and β-actin (A). Cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRF-8 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin antibody (B). RAW264.7 cells were incubated for 48 h after co-transduction with retrovirus encoding IRF-8 and HA-ubiquitin, and cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRF-8 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA mAb (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Carboxyl-terminal Region of IRF-8 Controls Degradation—The stability of IRF-1 is controlled by carboxyl-terminal domain (30Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The homology between IRF-1 and IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal domains suggests that the stability of IRF-8 might also be controlled by the carboxyl terminus. To examine this, we first had to show that IRF-8 degraded in 293T cells comparably to macrophages, which was found to be the case (Fig. 4A), and IRF-4 was stable in both cell types (Fig. 4A). Ubiquitination of IRF-8 in 293T cells transfected with IRF-8 and HA-ubiquitin was then analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-IRF-8 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-HA mAb. A high molecular mass smear typical of ubiquitinated protein (Fig. 3B) was detected only in samples co-transfected with IRF-8 and HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 4B). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of the same lysates with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotting with anti-IRF-8 antibody also showed association of ubiquitin with IRF-8 (data not shown). These results confirm that macrophages and 293T cells possess the same cellular machinery responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of IRF-8.Fig. 4Ubiquitination of IRF-8 in 293T cells. 293T cells were transfected for 36 h with IRF-8 or IRF-4 plasmids. Cells were then pretreated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 30 min and incubated in the presence or absence of MG132 (10 μm) as indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for IRF-8 and IRF-4 (A). 293T cells were co-transfected for 48 h with IRF-8 and HA-ubiquitin. Cell lysate (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRF-8 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA mAb (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we constructed two amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged carboxyl-terminal truncation expression plasmids and transfected them into 293T cells (Fig. 5A). Both carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants were stable, showing that the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids are required for rapid IRF-8 degradation (Fig. 5B). We then co-transfected 293T cells with full-length IRF-8 or the two carboxyl-terminal truncated expression plasmids and HA-ubiquitin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of 293T cells co-transfected with IRF-8 constructs and HA-ubiquitin showed that the IRF-8 truncation mutants were not ubiquitinated (Fig. 5C). The stability and lack of ubiquitination of IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants indicate that elements in this domain are required for E3 recognition and targeting for proteasome.Fig. 5IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants are stable in 293T cells. Schematic of IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal truncations (A). 293T cells were transfected for 36 h with FLAG-tagged IRF-8 or carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants. Cells were then treated with cycloheximide as indicated, and cell lysates were analyzed for expression of full-length IRF-8 or IRF-8 truncation mutants with anti-FLAG mAb (B). 293T cells were co-transfected for 48 h with full-length IRF-8 or IRF-8 truncation mutants and HA-ubiquitin expression plasmids.

Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys-29 have also been identified both in cells and in vitro and also target proteins for degradation (32Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In contrast, ubiquitin Lys-63 is involved in endosomal trafficking and in activation of TLR pathways. K48R and K29R ubiquitin mutants act as ubiquitin dominant negatives, resulting in premature termination of ubiquitin chains and inhibition of degradation by the proteasome. We have shown that degradation of IRF-8 is proteasome-dependent, whereas IRF-4 is not ubiquitinated proteasome-independent. To confirm that ubiquitination is required for degradation, we co-transfected into 293T cells IRF-8 and IRF-4 together with ubiquitin mutants K48R, K29R, and K63R. Co-transfection of K48R or K29R ubiquitin mutants resulted in higher expression of IRF-8 but had no effect on IRF-4 (Fig. 6). There was no change of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is degraded by the lysosomal pathway. These data confirm that ubiquitination of IRF-8 is required for degradation.Fig. 6Dominant negative ubiquitin mutants K48R and K29R inhibit IRF-8 degradation. IRF-8 or IRF-4 was co-transfected into 293T cells for 36 h with and ubiquitin dominant negative mutants K48R or K29R. The molar ratio of IRF-8 plasmid to ubiquitin plasmid was 1:5. 20 μg of cell lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-IRF-8, anti-IRF-4, anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cbl Is an E3 Ligase That Targets IRF-8 Degradation—Members of the Cbl family are ubiquitin ligases that function as negative regulators of activated tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors. Cbl proteins contain, in addition to a typical E3 ring domain, a conserved amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding PTB domain, which targets the ubiquitination of activated protein tyrosine kinases and other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (33Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 34Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported that IRF-8 is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo (17Sharf R. Meraro D. Azriel A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper F. Hauser H. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we speculated that Cbl may also be involved in IRF-8 degradation. We first confirmed that Cbl was expressed in macrophages and 293T cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 7A). Co-transfection of IRF-8 and Cbl dominant negative plasmids into 293T cells resulted in increased expression of IRF-8 as predicted if Cbl were the E3 ligase mediating ubiquitination of IRF-8 (Fig. 7B). If Cbl is involved in the degradation of IRF-8, there should be direct physical interaction between IRF-8 and Cbl. To test this, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged IRF-8 or IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants (IRF-8-(1–390) and IRF-8-(1–356)) with Cbl into 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-IRF-8 from cell lysates resulted in co-precipitation of Cbl, demonstrating that a complex was formed between the two proteins. However, neither IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant interacted with Cbl (Fig. 7C). We further analyzed the interaction between Cbl and IRF-8 by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration of lysates from 293T cells co-transfected with Cbl and IRF-8 showed two proteins co-eluting over a wide range of molecular mass (Fig. 7D).Fig. 7Cbl interacts with IRF-8.A, cell lysates from peritoneal macrophages, RAW264.7 cells, and 293T cells were subject to immunoblotting with anti-Cbl antibody. B, 293T cells were transfected for 48 h with IRF-8 and dominant negative Cbl plasmids. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for IRF-8 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. C, 293T cells were co-transfected with IRF-8 or IRF-8 carboxyl-terminal mutants (IRF-8-(1–390) and IRF-8-(1–356)) and Cbl (wt) plasmids for 36"
https://openalex.org/W2069160356,"Fibrate drugs improve cardiovascular health by lowering plasma triglycerides, normalize low density lipoprotein levels, and raise high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in patients with dyslipidemias. The HDL-raising effect of fibrates has been shown to be due in part to an increase in human apolipoprotein AI gene expression. However, it has recently been shown that fibrates can affect HDL metabolism in mouse by significantly decreasing hepatic levels of the HDL receptor scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI) and the PDZ domain containing protein PDZK1. PDZK1 is essential for maintaining hepatic SR-BI levels. Therefore, decreased SR-BI might be secondary to decreased PDZK1, but the mechanism by which fibrates lower SR-BI has not been elucidated. Here we show that feeding PDZK1-deficient mice fenofibrate resulted in the near absence of SR-BI in liver, definitively demonstrating that the effect of fenofibrate on SR-BI is PDZK1-independent. Metabolic labeling experiments in primary hepatocytes from fenofibrate-fed mice demonstrated that fenofibrate enhanced the degradation of SR-BI in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Moreover, fenofibrate-induced degradation of SR-BI was independent of the proteasome, calpain protease, or the lysosome, and antioxidants did not inhibit fenofibrate-induced degradation of SR-BI. Using metabolic labeling coupled with cell surface biotinylation assays, fenofibrate did not inhibit SR-BI trafficking to the plasma membrane. Together, the data support a model in which fenofibrate enhances the degradation of SR-BI in a post-ER, post-plasma membrane compartment. The further elucidation of this novel degradation pathway may provide new insights into the physiological and pathophysiological regulation of hepatic SR-BI."
https://openalex.org/W2107335002,"T cell activation requires the cross-talk between the CD3-signaling complex and the T cell receptor (TCR). A synthetic peptide coding for the TCRalpha transmembrane domain (CP) binds CD3 molecules, interferes with the CD3/TCR cross-talk, and inhibits T cell activation. Intermolecular interactions are sterically constrained; accordingly no sequence-specific interactions are thought to occur between D- and L-stereoisomers. This argument was recently challenged when applied to intra-membrane protein assembly. In this paper we studied the ability of a D-stereoisomer of CP (D-CP) to inhibit T cell activation. L-CP and D-CP co-localized with the TCR in the membrane and inhibited T cell activation in a sequence-specific manner. In vivo, both L-CP and D-CP inhibited adjuvant arthritis. In molecular terms, these results suggest the occurrence of structural reorientation that facilitates native-like interactions between D-CP and CD3 within the membrane. In clinical terms, our results demonstrate that D-stereoisomers retain the therapeutic properties of their L-stereoisomers, while they benefit from an increased resistance to degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2143459609,"The non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and long-lived proteins in vivo results in the formation of glycation and advanced glycation end products, which alter the properties of proteins including charge, helicity, and their tendency to aggregate. Such protein modifications are linked with various pathologies associated with the general aging process such as Alzheimer disease and the long-term complications of diabetes. Although it has been suggested that glycation and advanced glycation end products altered protein structure and helicity, little structural data and information currently exist on whether or not glycation does indeed influence or change local protein secondary structure. We have addressed this problem using a model helical peptide system containing a di-lysine motif derived from human serum albumin.

Using NMR analysis, we have confirmed that the synthetic peptide constituting this helix does indeed form a α-helix in solution in the presence of 30% trifluoroethanol. Glycation of the model peptide resulted in the distortion of the α-helix, forcing the region of the helix around the site of glycation to adopt a 310 helical structure.

Non-enzymatic glycation describes the initial products arising from the formation of Maillard reaction adducts due to the reaction between primary amino groups on a protein surface and reducing sugars such as glucose and fructose (1Lapolla A.

These non-enzymatic reactions are initiated with the reversible formation of a Schiff base adduct that undergoes rearrangement to form a more stable Amadori product (for glucose) (5Bucala R. Diagn.

AGEs are naturally formed in vivo on a variety of proteins and are implicated in the pathologies associated with aging, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and long-term diabetic complications (7Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). More recently, glycation has been shown at the N terminus of the pathogenic prion protein in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a group of transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally folded prion protein (8Choi Y-G. Kim J.-I. Jeon Y.-C. Park S.-J. Choi E.-K. Rubenstein R. Kascsak R.J. Carp R.I. Kim Y.-S. J. Biol.

Allergy. 2001; 56: 56-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of AGEs with a variety of pathologies has resulted in much scientific interest in the role played by glycation products and AGEs in the pathology of these disease states. For example, in recent years, the receptor for advanced glycation end products has been described and it has since been reported to be a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface proteins (10Hanford L.E. Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Petersen S.V. Schaefer L.M. Schaefer T.M. Reinhart T.A. Oury T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50019-50024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products has also been implicated as a developmental factor in several pathologic conditions including chronic inflammation, cancer, and Alzheimer disease (10Hanford L.E. Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Petersen S.V. Schaefer L.M. Schaefer T.M. Reinhart T.A. Oury T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50019-50024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of AGE products and cross-links have now been described (11Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54173-54184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, despite much attention, the exact role that these modified protein forms play in the associated disease states remains to be fully elucidated. The process of glycation and the formation of AGEs are known to promote protein aggregation and insolubilization (12Blakytny R. Carver J.A. Harding J.J. Kilby G.W. Sheil M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein glycation and the formation of subsequent AGE products are thought to be involved in structural and functional changes in vivo in proteins during aging and the long-term complications of diabetes (12Blakytny R. Carver J.A. Harding J.J. Kilby G.W. Sheil M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Neglia C. Cohen H. Garber A. Thorpe S. Baynes J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5406-5410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although glycation has been shown to inactivate a number of enzymes (12Blakytny R. Carver J.A. Harding J.J. Kilby G.W. Sheil M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), little information, if any, currently exists regarding the effects these modifications have on protein secondary or tertiary structure. This is largely due to the problem of obtaining sufficient homogeneous material for structural studies, because glycation usually occurs at one or more residues on a protein structure and gives rise to multiple AGEs. Notwithstanding these apparent problems, Blakytny et al. (12Blakytny R. Carver J.A. Harding J.J. Kilby G.W. Sheil M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) used mass spectrometry and NMR to study the effect of glycation with galactose on the C-terminal extension of α-crystallin, investigating both the intact protein and a synthetic C-terminal peptide (12Blakytny R. Carver J.A. Harding J.J. Kilby G.W. Sheil M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although these studies categorically identified the sites and level of glycation, both the intact protein and synthetic peptide exhibited great conformational freedom and adopted no preferred structure in solution and therefore no conclusions could be drawn regarding the effect of glycation on the secondary and tertiary structure of α-crystallin (12Blakytny R. Carver J.A. Harding J.J. Kilby G.W. Sheil M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NMR has also been used recently to detect the presence of glycated protein in the saliva of patients with diabetes (14Yoon M.S. Jankowski V. Montag S. Zidek W. Henning L. Schluter H. Tepel M. Jankowski J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas others (15Zigrovic I. Kidric J. Horvat S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have used it to study the effect of glycation on a tetrapeptide and its N-terminal amide bond stereochemistry and tautomeric distribution. Despite these studies, little information currently exists on whether or not glycation does indeed influence or change local protein secondary structure. A previous study (16Shaklai N. Garlick R. Bunn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3812-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on human serum albumin suggests that glycation does indeed result in conformation change, although the nature of this change was undetermined. Others (11Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54173-54184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have reported that glycation and AGE product formation alter the helicity of proteins. In the present study, we have addressed this problem using a model peptide system derived from human serum albumin (HSA). Human serum albumin (ExPASy primary accession number P02768) is a helical protein that is the main protein constituent of plasma. Although the exact function of HSA is unknown, its primary function is thought to be to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood (17Bunk D.M. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The primary site of glycation in human albumin, both in vitro and in vivo, is known to be Lys525 (16Shaklai N. Garlick R. Bunn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3812-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several other lysine residues in albumin are known to be glycated both in vitro and in vivo, including Lys548 as shown in a study of bovine albumin (18Wada Y. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lysine residue, Lys548, resides in the same helix and in the same peptide motif in both human and bovine serum albumin. Lys548 is of particular interest, because it lies in a di-lysine motif (Lys548-Lys549) that is part of a helix on the surface of the molecule (helix 28), which is held in place relative to the rest of the molecule via a salt bridge. Furthermore, glycation is thought to be accelerated at di-lysine motifs due to local acid-base catalysis. Therefore, the model peptide used in this study corresponds to helix 28 of HSA, corresponding to residue numbers 543–557 in accordance with Swiss-Prot numbering. We have shown that, in the presence of glucose, one of the lysine residues in the di-lysine motif (Lys548-Lys549) within this peptide is preferentially glycated. As in the intact protein, the lysine equating to Lys548 was preferentially glycated in the model peptide system. Furthermore, using NMR analysis, we have confirmed that the synthetic peptide constituting this helix (residues 543–557) does indeed form a α-helix in solution in the presence of 30% trifluoroethanol (TFE). Glycation of the model peptide resulted in the distortion of the α-helix, forcing the region of the helix around the site of glycation to adopt a 310 helical structure. This is the first reported evidence that glycation can indeed influence or change local protein secondary structure. The implications for such changes on protein function are discussed. Materials—All of the materials were of analytical reagent grade or better and were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Synthesis and Purification of Peptide HSA543–557—The peptide RERQIKKQTALVELV was synthesized with an acetylated N-terminal amino group using a Shimadzu PSSM-8 multiple peptide synthesizer and an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/HBTu (O-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate) synthesis strategy. The resulting peptide was then purified by reverse phase HPLC using a preparative C18 10 × 250 mm column linked to a Hewlett Packard 1100 series HPLC. The sample to be analyzed was injected onto the column, and salts were washed out with an isocratic gradient of 2% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was then eluted from the column using a linear gradient from 2 to 40% acetonitrile (containing 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) over 50 min. The peptide peak was collected and then freeze-dried overnight. Multiple runs were combined to purify all of the synthesized peptide. The authenticity of the purified peptide was then confirmed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode using the extended mass range (m/z 250–4000) on a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. Generation and Isolation of Glycated Peptide HSA543–557—To generate glycated peptide, the peptide was dissolved in sterile PBS containing 50 mm glucose at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The resulting solution was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 week. Prior to further experiments, salts and sugar components were then removed from the peptide solution by reverse phase HPLC as described above. Glycated peptide was then isolated from non-glycated peptide for NMR and mass spectrometric analysis using commercially available Glyco Gel™ columns (1-ml bed volume) from Pierce (Rockford, IL). The incubated peptide sample from which the salt/sugar components had been removed previously by reverse phase chromatography was then redissolved in 0.05 m HEPES (pH 8.5) and loaded onto the columns preequilibrated in the equilibration/wash buffer provided by Pierce. The column was then washed (5-column volumes), and the glycated peptide was eluted (in 3-column volumes) using the procedure previously described by Zhao et al. (19Zhao H.R. Smith J.B. Jiang X.Y. Abraham E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The glycated fraction was then desalted by reverse phase chromatography, as described above, and freeze-dried. Control, non-glycated peptide for NMR analysis was generated by heating the synthesized and purified peptide at 5 mg/ml for 1 week at 37 °C in PBS (i.e. in the absence of glucose), desalted by reverse phase HPLC, and freeze dried. Both the glycated and non-glycated HSA543–557 peptides were then subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry (as described above) and NMR analysis. NMR Sample Preparation—All of the NMR samples were prepared to a final volume of 300 μl for use in a Shigemi BMS005V NMR tube by dissolving purified, freeze-dried peptide to provide a final concentration of 2 mm peptide in PBS at pH 6.4 (phosphate concentration 25 mm and saline concentration of 100 mm). To this system, TFE-d3 was added as a helix stabilizer to provide a final concentration of 30% (v/v) in the system. TFE was used following AGADIR (20Munoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 21Munoz V. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) analysis of the peptide that identified the helical propensity of the standard peptide as 0.21. Peptides with this level of propensity will only highlight regions of helical tendency with the addition of TFE (20Munoz V. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). 30% (v/v) TFE was considered the lowest proportion of TFE that could be used to give rise to a helical structure. This was confirmed from the NMR NOE contacts observed for the standard helix. To make a meaningful comparison, all of the Amadori modified peptide data were obtained under identical conditions to those used for the standard peptide. NMR Spectroscopy—All of the experiments were recorded at 10 °C on a Varian UnityINOVA 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with a z-shielded gradient triple resonance probe using standard procedures. For each peptide sample, a two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments were recorded with mixing times of 250 and 68.4 ms, respectively. These experiments were collected with 512 and 1024 complex points with acquisition times of 64 and 128 ms in the indirectly and directly acquired 1H dimensions, respectively. The maximum theoretical NOESY enhancement was estimated to be between 70 and 90% theoretical maximum, whereas our projected ROESY enhancements were expected to be 60%. Therefore, NOESY experiments were chosen in this analysis and validated by obtaining build-up curves that also confirmed 250 ms as the most appropriate mixing time. In addition, a two-dimensional double-quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQFCOSY) experiment was collected for each peptide with 1024 and 2048 complex points with acquisition times of 128 and 256 ms in the indirectly and directly acquired 1H dimensions, respectively. Amides in slow exchange and deemed capable of being hydrogen bond donors were identified from a NOESY experiment that was collected with 256 and 1024 complex points with acquisition times of 32 and 128 ms in the indirectly and directly acquired 1H dimensions, respectively, obtained from a peptide sample resuspended in 2H2O. Data processing and analysis were carried out on Sun Blade 100 and Transtec X2100 Linux workstations using NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) to view processed data. Structural Calculations and Analysis—All of the structural calculations were obtained using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS), version 1.1 (25Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar, 38), running on Silicon Graphics O2+ and Transtec X2100 Linux workstations. CNS parameter files were modified to incorporate the topology of the modified lysine residue for calculations. All of the NOE contacts were classified into one wide classification between 1.8 and 5.0 Å with final structures calculated from extended coordinates using the standard CNS NMR anneal protocol with the sum averaging for dynamic annealing with NOEs from both extended and folded precursors (24Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). A final structural ensemble of 40 structures for each peptide was produced with all of the structures used to produce statistical energy and root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation structural information. Backbone and heavy atom r.m.s. deviation values were obtained using MOLMOL, version 2k.2 (25Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), on a computer running Microsoft Windows 2000. The structural integrity of each ensemble was evaluated using PROCHECK-NMR (26Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) run on a Transtec X2100 Linux workstation. Energy comparisons between structures created from the NMR constraint data and the equivalent human serum albumin helix were made using GROMOS96 43Bl parameter set (27van Gunsteren W.F. Brunne R.M.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis, Glycation, and Purification—The peptide sequence corresponding to HSA α-helix 28 (residues 543–557) was successfully synthesized on a Shimadzu PSSM-8 multiple peptide synthesizer as determined by mass spectrometry (Table I). The peptide sequence was identical to that found in the native HSA molecule with the exception that the N-terminal lysine residue was replaced with an arginine residue to prevent glycation on the lysine amino side chain of this residue (Lys543). The peptide was synthesized with the N-terminal amino group blocked with an acetyl group to prevent potential glycation at this site in the synthetic peptide. Following incubation with glucose and purification of the glycated peptide from non-glycated peptide using a Glyco Gel column, mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the peptide was glycated with one glucose residue per peptide molecule (i.e. not di-glycated), as indicated by an increase in the [M+H]+ ion by 162 Da (Table I). From these data, it was not possible to confirm whether glycation had occurred entirely at one lysine residue, preferentially at one of the two-lysine residues in the di-lysine motif, or whether there was an equal distribution between the two. This was resolved during the NMR analysis (see below). We note that it has previously been shown that the sugar moieties in glycated human serum albumin occur as an equilibrium of the β-pyranose (59%), α-furanose (19%), and β-furanose (24%) anomers (29Rohovec J. Maschmeyer T. Aime S. Peters J.A. Chemistry. 2003; 9: 2193-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phenylboronate purification of Amadori products selectively binds β-furanose sugar anomers; however, because the confirmations are in rapid equilibrium, the yield of glycated peptide is likely to be close to quantitative.Table IMass spectral characterization data of the unmodified and glycated HSA543–557 synthetic peptidePeptideTheoretical [M+H]+aMonoisotopic mass.Measured [M+H]+aMonoisotopic mass.Theoretical [M+2H]2+aMonoisotopic mass.Measured [M+2H]2+aMonoisotopic mass.Unmodified1853.11853.2927.1927.5Glycated2015.12015.21008.11008.2a Monoisotopic mass. Open table in a new tab NMR Resonance Assignments—Spin systems were identified by analysis of two-dimensional DQFCOSY and TOCSY NMR spectra, and all of the observed 1H chemical shifts are listed in Table II. Assignments for the majority of 1H spin systems were possible for both the standard and Amadori-modified peptide with the exception of amino acid Ile547 in the standard peptide. The Hα shift of the N-terminal amino acid Arg543 was not observed in either standard or modified peptide. The assignment of the modified Amadori lysine was possible following the observation of a duplicated set of resonances in the HN region of the TOCSY spectrum for the modified lysine side chain (Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, and Hϵ). The first set of resonances are correlated from the backbone HN of the lysine, but chemical modification transforms the side chain lysine NH3+ group to a HN group (Hζ) and provides a second HN correlation and duplication of the lysine side chain 1H resonances. Resonances of the Amadori peptide were achieved from both the DQFCOSY and TOCSY data together with Hη protons identified by the NOESY through-space correlation to Hζ.Table IINMR assignment list of observed 1H chemical shifts for the standard and Amadori-modified peptide in PBS, 30% (v/v) TFE at 10 °C All of the chemical shifts are referenced externally to 100 μm solution of dimethylsilapetane sulfonic acid in PBS, 30% (v/v) TFE.ResidueHNHαOthersStandard PeptideArg543Hβ2/β3 1.703; Hγ2/γ3 1.845; Hδ2/δ3 3.220Glu5448.4854.385Hβ2/β3 2.132; Hγ2/γ3 2.440Arg5458.2614.235Hβ2/β3 1.843; Hγ2/γ3 1.682; Hδ2/δ3 3.222Gln5468.9814.182Hβ2/β3 2.04; Hγ2/γ3 2.315; Hϵ21/ϵ22 6.879/7.624Ile547Lys5488.5164.160Hβ2/β3 1.685, 1.828; Hγ2/γ3 1.438/1.516; Hδ2/δ3 1.700/1.858; Hϵ2/ϵ3 2.988Lys5498.2054.412Hβ2/β3 1.663/1.865; Hγ2/γ3 1.901; Hδ2/δ3 1.706; Hϵ2/ϵ3 3.279Gln5508.4164.306Hβ2/β3 2.118; Hγ2/γ3 2.416; Hϵ21/ϵ22 6.823/7.512Thr5518.1294.269Hβ 4.238; Hγ2 1.229Ala5528.1394.333Hβ 1.446Leu5538.0694.310Hβ2/β3 1.616; Hγ 1.677; Hδ1/δ2 0.888/0.944Val5547.8334.098Hβ 2.121; Hγ1/γ2 0.961Glu5558.2754.322Hβ2/β3 1.957/2.086; Hγ2/γ3 2.320Leu5568.1544.416Hβ2/β3 1.708; Hγ 1.627; Hδ1/δ2 0.889/0.943Val5577.518Hβ 2.109; Hγ1/γ2 0.913Amadori peptideArg543Hβ2/β3 1.681/1.753; Hγ2/γ3 1.869; Hδ2/δ3 3.246Glu5449.0624.145Hβ2/β3 2.094; Hγ2/γ3 2.380Arg5457.3834.215Hβ2/β3 1.686, 1.764; Hγ2/γ3 1.924; Hδ2/δ3 3.285Gln5468.4114.269Hβ2/β3 2.190, 2.190; Hγ2/γ3 2.480; Hϵ21/ϵ22 6.784/7.413Ile5478.1183.991Hβ 1.474; Hγ2 1.217; Hγ12/γ13 0.946; Hδ1 0.886Lys*5488.2754.213Hβ2/β3 1.587, 1.931; Hγ2/γ3 1.473; Hδ2/δ3 1.772; Hϵ2/ϵ3 3.260; Hζ 8.556; Hη2/η3 3.260/4.173; Hι2 4.678; Hκ2 3.290; Hλ2 3.480; Hμ2/μ3 3.444/3.528Lys5498.0394.193Hβ2/β3 1.923; Hγ2/γ3 1.678, 1.772; Hδ2/δ3 1.772; Hϵ2/ϵ3 3.283Gln5508.0424.257Hβ2/β3 2.181; Hγ2/γ3 2.435; Hϵ21/ϵ22 6.840/7.558Thr5518.1484.323Hβ 4.244; Hγ2 1.281Ala5528.0544.325Hβ 1.502Leu5538.0124.305Hβ2/β3 1.790; Hγ 1.656; Hδ1/δ2 0.945Val5547.7784.089Hβ 2.201; Hγ1/γ2 1.018Glu5558.1144.383Hβ2/β3 2.058/2.168; Hγ2/γ3 2.388/2.470Leu5568.0784.450Hβ2/β3 1.688/1.790; Hγ 1.764; Hδ1/δ2 0.913/0.960Val5577.5314.123Hβ 2.166; Hγ1/γ2 0.963 Open table in a new tab Structural Assignments and Additional Restraints— Through-space assignments were achieved using two-dimensional NOESY spectra of both standard and Amadori-modified peptide (see Fig. 1). Amides in slow exchange and deemed capable of being hydrogen bond donors were identified from a NOESY experiment obtained from a peptide sample resuspended in 2H2O. Additional ϕ restraints were obtained from the application of the Karplus relationship to 3JHNHα that were obtained from high resolution DQFCOSY spectra. 3JHNHα values <5 Hz were used to constrain ϕ for that residue to –60 ± 30°. A cut-off value of 5 Hz was used to allow for the fact that 3JHNHα values obtained by DQFCOSY are always larger than those obtained by more accurate heteronuclear NMR methods (30Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996Google Scholar). With the exception of Ile547 in the standard peptide where an NOE distribution was not observed, the NOE distribution was uniform across all of the residues in both peptides. A total of 23 NOEs were found between the modified Lys548 and residues Arg545, Gln546, and Ile547 that were crucial in defining the structural changes upon modification. A summary of the number of contact types and additional restraints are shown in Table III with the distribution of restraints across each peptide shown in Fig. 2, a and b. NOE contact types observed in Fig. 2a for the standard peptide support a standard helix conformation with NOEs observed between Hα:i and HN:i + 3 as well as Hα:i and Hβ:i + 3. Additionally, slow HN exchange and 3JHNHα values <5 Hz were observed for the majority of residues within the standard peptide with the exception of Ile547, as the resonances from this residue were not observed in our system. The resonances from Ile547 were difficult to assign because of placement of the Hα resonance directly over the water resonance. This was confirmed by observing and assigning Ile547 resonances in the absence of TFE (data not shown). Fig. 2b highlights the NOE contact types for the Amadori-modified peptide and defines a region from Lys549 to Glu555 that shows similar helix NOE contacts to those observed throughout the standard peptide. This is also confirmed from the observed HN exchange and 3JHNHα values obtained for the modified peptide. The N-terminal region of the Amadori peptide gave rise to reduced Hα:i and HN:i + 3 but increased Hα:i and Hβ:i + 3 together with Hα:i and HN:i + 2 and i + 3 contacts. In this region, there was a single retarded HN exchange and no 3JHNHα values <5 Hz.Table IIIList of NOE, hydrogen bond, and torsion angle"
https://openalex.org/W2085298875,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been proposed to be a potent stimulator of bone resorption. However, PGE2 itself has been shown to directly inhibit bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. We examined the role of PGE2 in the function of mouse osteoclasts formed in vitro. Bone marrow macrophage osteoclast precursors expressed PGE2 receptors EP1, EP2, EP3β, and EP4, and the expression of EP2 and EP4 was down-regulated during osteoclastic differentiation induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, functional EP1 was continuously expressed in mature osteoclasts. PGE2 as well as calcitonin caused intracellular Ca2+ influx in osteoclasts. However, PGE2 and 17-phenyltrinol-PGE2 (an EP1 agonist) failed to inhibit actin-ring formation and pit formation by osteoclasts cultured on dentine slices. When EP4 was expressed in osteoclasts using an adenovirus carrying EP4 cDNA, both actin-ring and pit-forming activities of osteoclasts were inhibited in an infectious unit-dependent manner. Treatment of EP4-expressing osteoclasts with PGE2 further inhibited their actin-ring and pit-forming activities. Such inhibitory effects of EP4-mediated signals on osteoclast function are similar to those that are calcitonin receptor-mediated. Thus, osteoclast precursors down-regulate their own EP2 and EP4 levels during their differentiation into osteoclasts to escape inhibitory effects of PGE2 on bone resorption."

Upon apoptotic stimuli,ARTS is released from mitochondria, binds XIAP, and decreases its proteinlevels. As a result, caspase inhibition is removed and apoptosis can beexecuted (11Gottfried Y. Rotem A. Lotan R. Steller H. Larisch S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). More recently,it has been shown that ARTS functions as a tumor suppressor in leukemia(15Elhasid R. Sahar D. Merling A. Zivony Y. Rotem A. Ben-Arush M. Izraeli S. Bercovich D. Larisch S.

In particular, thisstudy supports an important physiological role of ARTS in caspase regulationthrough IAP-inhibition. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a central role in the regulation ofessential cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis(17Ciechanover A. Iwai K.

In this study, we demonstrate that high levels of ARTS protein aresufficient to induce apoptosis and that elevated ARTS levels can sensitizecells toward apoptosis. This suggests that healthy cells may employ regulatorymechanisms that keep ARTS protein levels low for survival. Moreover, we showthat the ARTS protein is tightly regulated through proteasome-mediatedubiquitination. Upon proapoptotic stimuli, inhibition of ubiquitinationresults in increased levels of ARTS. Elevated ARTS, in turn, leads todecreased levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins and to cytochromec release and apoptosis.

Cell Death Detection Assay—An apoptosis assay was performedaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, an equal amount ofcells was taken for each experiment (determined by cell count). The cells werelysed, and 20 μl were transferred to a 96-well plate precoated withanti-histone together with antibody to DNA. The binding reaction was performedat room temperature for 2 h. The wells were washed three times, and substratewas added for 10 min allowing a color reaction to develop. The color reactionlevels were measured using a 405-nm filter. The color level was in directcorrelation with the apoptosis level in each sample (Roche AppliedScience). Caspase 9 Activity Assay—Apoptosis assay was performedaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, an equal amount ofcells was taken for each experiment (determined by cell count). The cells werelysed, and 20 μl were taken for further analysis. 10 μl of LEHD-AMC (aspecific synthetic substrate for caspase 9 covalently attached to AMCmolecule) was added, and after 2 h at 37 °C, the amount of free AMC wasmeasured using a spectrophotometer at excitation filter 370–425 nm andemission filter 490–530 nm. The free AMC levels were in directcorrelation to caspase 9 activity in each sample (R&D Systems). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For the Immunofluorescencemicroscopy, 24-h pretransfection 2 × 105 cells were seeded oncover slides (2 × 2 cm) covered with fibronectin inside 6-well plates.Cells were treated with different apoptotic stimulations at the indicatedtimes and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 20 min at roomtemperature. Fixed cells were washed with 1× PBS and then permeabilizedwith 0.5% Triton-X in 1× PBS for 5 min. The cover slides were treatedwith primary antibody, diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS for2 h at room temperature. They were then washed three times with 1×PBS/0.1% Triton-X and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugatedanti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and RhodamineTX-conjugatedanti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at roomtemperature. The cells were washed three times with 1× PBS/0.1% Triton-Xand mounted with mounting medium containing4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Cells were examinedwith a laser-scanning microscope, Provis AX70 (Olympus), and counted in ablind manner, 200 cells each time. The assay was repeated independently threetimes. Caspase 3 Activity Assay—Cells attached to cover slides werefixed and double probed with antibodies against ARTS or AU5 and against theactive form of caspase 3. For each experiment, 200 ARTS/AU5-positive cellswere counted, and the cells that were positive for active caspase 3 wereconsidered as apoptotic cells. In Situ TUNEL-TMR—In the apoptotic process, the DNA strandsbreak in a unique fashion exposing a 3′-OH end and serve as a marker.Cells attached to cover slides were fixed and permeabilized. The apoptoticcells were labeled by enzymatic reaction between nucleotides attached to TMRand the DNA broken strands. The cells were then probed to antibody againstARTS/AU5. For each experiment, 200 ARTS/AU5-positive cells were counted, andthe cells that were TMR-positive were considered as apoptotic cells (RocheApplied Science). Cell Lysates—In all of the experiments cell lysates wereprepared from floating dead cells and adherent cells harvested together. 40 h after the transfection, the cells were treated with different reagentsaccording to the indicated assay. The cells were harvested by scraping theplate, washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS, and lysed using radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl(pH 8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate containingprotease inhibitors) (mini complete, Roche Applied Science). The cells wereallowed to remain on ice for 30 min followed by four cycles of freeze andthaw. The cell extract was centrifuged for 20 min at maximum speed (13,000rpm) 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration wasdetermined using the BCA kit (Promega). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were harvested by scraping,washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 600 μl of homogenizingbuffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmsodium-EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mmsucrose and a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and mini complete protease mixture). After 30min of incubation on ice, cells were homogenized in the same buffer using aglass homogenizer (Dounce tissue grinder, at least 80 strokes). Unbrokencells, large plasma membrane pieces, and nuclei were removed by centrifugationat 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant wascentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain amitochondria-containing pellet. The remaining supernatant was considered asthe cytosolic fraction. The mitochondria pellet was washed three times inhomogenizing buffer, and 50 μl of TNC buffer (10 mm Trisacetate, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm CaCl2)containing protease inhibitors was added(24Chandra D. Liu J.W. Tang D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50842-50854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Protein concentrationwas determined using a Micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Western Blotting Analysis—Proteins were separated on 12%SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &Schuell). The membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat milk in 1×Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween for 1 h at room temperature,incubated with the primary antibody at room temperature for 3 h, and washedthree times with 1% nonfat milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline containing0.05% Tween followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugatedsecondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was developedusing the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). To quantifythe protein levels, the blots were analyzed using a densitometer and comparedwith the level of a house-keeping gene (β-actin). Calculations werecarried out using densitometry-analyzing software (Vilber Lourmat, Marne laVallée, France). Half-life Assay—COS-7 cells were transiently transfectedwith pEF1-AU5-ARTS and were plated in 100-mm plates. 40 h after thetransfection, the cells were treated with 120 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0,15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min. The cells were harvested, and 50 μg ofprotein lysate were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto anitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-AU5 monoclonal antibodies. Themembrane was then stripped using the Re-prob kit (Chemicon) and probed withanti-actin antibodies. The protein levels were calculated as mentioned above,and the values of ARTS-AU5 were plotted against the values of actin. The valueof ARTS/actin at time 0 was taken as 100%. Pulse-Chase Analysis—COS-7 cells were transientlytransfected with pEF1-AU5-ARTS and plated on 60-mm plates until they reachedfull confluency. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' solution at 37°C, and 1 ml of “starvation medium” at 37 °C (withoutMet/Cys, containing dialyzed fetal calf serum and antibiotics) was added for 1h. 10 μl of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys were added for 1 hfollowed by two washes with Hanks' solution at 37 °C. Complete medium(containing 300 μg/ml Met/Cys) was added to the cells for the indicatedtimes. Cells were harvested by scraping in 1 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS andcollected into an Eppendorf tube followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2min at 4 °C. 200 μl of cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer wasadded, and lysates were put on ice for 30 min with stirring. Aftercentrifugation (16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), equalamounts of protein were taken for immunoprecipitation with monoclonalanti-ARTS antibodies (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation Assay—For each time point, an equalamount of protein was taken with 10 μl of anti-ARTS antibodies and placedon ice for 4 h. 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences;20% slurry washed five times with 1× PBS) was added to the reaction andplaced at 4 °C for 2 h with constant rotation. The beads were collected byspinning at maximum speed for 20 s, the supernatant was aspirated, and thebeads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Allof the washing steps were performed at 2000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Thebound proteins were separated from the beads by adding 20 μl of 1.5×loading sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 100 °C. The proteins wereseparated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, andvisualized by exposing the membrane to film sensitive to 35S. Ubiquitination in Vivo—COS-7 cells were transientlytransfected with pEF1-AU5-ARTS and plated on 100-mm plates. 40 h after thetransfection, half of the plates were treated with 20 μg/ml MG132(Calbiochem) for 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 h. The cells were harvested andlysed as described above. The protein levels were calculated as mentionedabove, and the values were plotted against the values of actin. The value ofARTS/actin at time 0 was taken as 1. “Hot Lysis” Immunoprecipitation Assay—COS-7cells were transiently transfected with pEF1-AU5-ARTS and treated with MG132(20 μm) for 6 h. The medium was aspirated and the cells washedthree times with 1× PBS (37 °C). The cells were scraped in 500 μlof HLB buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA in 1× PBS) at 37 °C,boiled for 5 min, and cooled on ice for 3 min. The cells were homogenized bypassing through a 25-gauge needle (3–5 times), boiled for 3 min andcooled on ice, vortexed, and centrifuged for 5 min (maximum speed) at roomtemperature. The supernatant was transferred into clean Eppendorf tubes, and 1volume of IMS buffer (2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% bovine serumalbumin, 1 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors; mini complete, RocheApplied Science) and 10 μl of monoclonal anti-ARTS antibodies (Sigma) wereadded. The mixture was incubated for 2 h on ice and added to 25 μl of A/GSepharose mix (50% slurry; Amersham Biosciences). The mix was incubated for 2h at 4 °C and spun down (20 s at 14,000 rpm). After two washes with IMbuffer (1% Triton X 100, 1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% bovine serumalbumin, 1 mm EDTA in 1× PBS) and two washes with 0.1×PBS, the proteins were eluted by adding 15 μl of sample 1× buffer andboiled for 5 min. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—In vitro conjugation of ARTSwas carried out in a total volume of 12.5 μl containing 50 μg of wholecell lysate proteins, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg of ubiquitin, 0.5 μgof Ub-Al, and 2 mm ATPγS. For depletion of ATP, 0.5 μg ofhexokinase and 20 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose were added. Thereaction mixtures were carried out at 37 °C for 50 min. Reactions wereterminated by the addition of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. ARTS Promotes Apoptosis Induced by Various ProapoptoticStimuli—ARTS was initially found to be important for TGF-βinduced apoptosis (10Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Tony Parks W. Gottfried Y. Birkey Reffey S. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J. Roberts A.B. Nat.Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Totest whether ARTS promotes apoptosis in response to other proapoptoticinducers, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either ARTS expressionvector or empty control plasmids were treated with TGF-β, etoposide, orSTS. In the absence of transfected ARTS, COS-7 cells were basically resistantto both TGF-β and etoposide. Cells over-expressing ARTS showed a 9-foldincrease of “background” apoptosis (i.e. without anyadditional apoptotic stimuli), and these cells showed even higher levels ofapoptosis upon treatment with apoptotic inducers(Fig. 1A). Similarresults were obtained for a variety of tumor cell lines(Fig. 2A).Over-expression of ARTS in RCC, A549, and HeLa cells all caused significantlyincreased apoptosis. Therefore, over-expression of ARTS increases thesusceptibility of cells toward apoptotic inducers, and high levels of ARTS aresufficient to induce cell death in a variety of cultured cell lines. ARTS wasoriginally found to promote apoptosis induced by TGF-β(10Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Tony Parks W. Gottfried Y. Birkey Reffey S. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J. Roberts A.B. Nat.Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Here we show thatelevated levels of ARTS promote apoptosis in response to other apoptoticinducers, including etoposide and STS.Fig. 2High protein levels of ARTS are sufficient to induce apoptosis invarious tumor cells. A, four different cell lines, COS-7, RCC,A549, and HeLa, were transfected with either control vector or AU5-ARTSconstructs. Cells were treated with TGF-β, and apoptosis levels weredetermined using a cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) for COS-7and RCC cell lines or the caspase 9 activity assay kit (R&D Systems) forA549 and HeLa cell lines. High levels of apoptosis were found in all cellstransfected with AU5-ARTS. Results are presented as -fold increase relative toresults obtained in nontreated vector transfected cells (calculated as 1).B, COS-7 cells stably transfected with pE control vector or pE-ARTSwere incubated with medium containing 2 or 6 μg/ml puromycin. The higherdose of puromycin resulted in cell death only in pE-ARTS cells and not in pEcontrol cells. C, ARTS expression is in direct correlation withincreased puromycin levels. COS-7 cells stably transfected with pE controlvector or pE-ARTS, were incubated with media containing 2 or 6 μg/mlpuromycin. Cells stably expressing pE-ARTS show three times higher levels ofARTS when grown in the presence of higher levels of puromycin (6 μg/ml) ascompared with cells grown in the presence of low levels of puromycin (2μg/ml). ARTS expression in control pE cells treated with puromycin wasbelow detection. D, apoptosis rate increases with elevation of ARTSlevels. COS-7 cells stably transfected with pE control vector or pE-ARTS wereincubated with medium containing 2 or 6 μg/ml puromycin. In control pEcells, the H2Ax apoptotic marker is seen only when treated with 6 μg/ml.Apoptosis is evident in pE-ARTS cells even with treatment of 2 μg/mlpuromycin and increases with 6 μg/ml treatment. E, COS-7 cellsstably transfected with pE-ARTS show different ARTS expression levels. Cellsthat show high levels of ARTS exhibit typical morphological changes associatedwith apoptosis. Cells that show mild or low expression levels of ARTS appearintact.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that ARTS promotes caspase activation in responseto TGF-β treatment and that the ARTS protein translocates frommitochondria to the nucleus under these conditions (Ref.10Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Tony Parks W. Gottfried Y. Birkey Reffey S. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J. Roberts A.B. Nat.Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar andFig. 1C). Likewise,etoposide treatment of HeLa cells over-expressing ARTS resulted in caspase 3activation and translocation of ARTS to the nucleus(Fig. 1B). Virtuallyidentical results were obtained for arabinoside-C and STS (data not shown).Thus, the apoptotic response of cells over-expressing ARTS was overall verysimilar for TGF-β, etoposide, and STS. In all cases, ARTS promoted theactivation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, the release of cytochrome cfrom the mitochondria, and translocation of ARTS to the nucleus. We concludethat different apoptotic stimuli converge to activate a common pathway inwhich ARTS is released from mitochondria and promotes caspase activation andcell death. ARTS Can Induce Apoptosis in Stably Transfected COS-7Cells—To further investigate the effect of ARTS protein levels onapoptosis, we established a stably transfected COS-7 cell line expressing ARTSunder a puromycin-inducible promoter (COS-7 pE ARTS; see “Materials andMethods”). As a control, we also established a COS-7 cell line stablytransfected with empty pE vector (COS-7 pE cells). Treatment of COS-7 pE ARTScells with low levels of puromycin (2 μg/ml) resulted in a modest increaseof ARTS protein, but these levels were not sufficient to induce a significantincrease of apoptosis compared with controls(Fig. 2, B andC). On the other hand, elevated levels of puromycin (6μg/ml) resulted in higher ARTS protein levels(Fig. 2C) andprominent cell death (Fig.2B). Immunofluorescence assays were used to confirm thatcells expressing high levels of ARTS exhibited condensed nuclear DNA typicalfor apoptosis, whereas cells with low ARTS levels showed morphologicallyintact nuclei (Fig.2E). Similarly, an increase in levels of thephosphorylated histone H2Ax, an apoptotic marker(25Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr.Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar), was seen in response toinduction of ARTS in COS-7 pE ARTS cells(Fig. 2D). Stablytransfected COS-7 pE ARTS cells treated with 2 or 6 μg/ml puromycineventually acquired the ability to grow, but they displayed high steady statelevels of background apoptosis (Fig.2D). These results provide additional support for theidea that ARTS sensitizes cells toward apoptosis. High Levels of ARTS Lead to a Decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xLLevels, Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria, and Apoptosis—Therelease of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol is an eventoften considered as a commitment of the cell toward apoptotic death(6Green D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2056952220,"Here we tested the effect of interleukin-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, on cAMP accumulation and chloride efflux in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells in response to ligands binding to adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors such as the β2 adrenoreceptor and EP prostanoid receptors. Interleukin-1β significantly increased isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation by increasing β2 adrenoreceptor numbers via a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism. In contrast, interleukin-1β significantly impaired prostaglandin E2-induced cAMP accumulation by induction of cyclo-oxygenase-2, prostaglandin E2 production, and a resulting down-regulation of adenylyl cyclase. The cAMP changes were all mirrored by alterations in chloride efflux assessed using the fluorescent chloride probe N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide with interleukin-1β increasing chloride efflux in response to isoprenaline and reducing the response to prostaglandin E2. Studies with glibenclamide confirmed that chloride efflux was via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Calu-3 expresses EP4 receptors, but not EP2, and receptor expression is reduced by interleukin-1β. Collectively, these results provide mechanistic insight into how interleukin-1β can differentially regulate cAMP generation and chloride efflux in response to different adenylyl cyclase-coupled ligands in the same cell. These findings have important implications for diseases involving inflammation and abnormal ion flux such as cystic fibrosis.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) 1The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator; IL, interleukin; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; COX 2, cyclo-oxygenase 2; MQAE, N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide; ISO, isoprenaline; PKA, protein kinase A. is a multisystem disorder and the most commonly occurring lethal autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in Caucasian populations. It is caused by mutations in a 230-kb gene located on chromosome seven that codes for CFTR (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). CFTR functions in the main as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel but also regulates the activity of other ion channels and transporters such as apical Enac, basolateral Na/K ATPase (2Schweibert E.M.

Progression of lung disease due to chronic infection is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF (6Davis P.B. Pediatr. Rev. 2001; 22: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alterations in ion flux in cystic fibrosis lungs is thought to be central in the pathogenesis of lung disease, although the mechanism is debated. Several hypotheses have been suggested with the biochemical defect being linked to impaired antibacterial activity of β-defensins (7Zahm J.M. Gaillard D. Dupuit F. Hinnrasky J. Porteous D. Dorin J.R. Puchelle E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C853-C859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mucociliary clearance (8Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), and altered sialisation of bacterial receptors (9Poschet J.F. Boucher J.C. Tatterson L. Skidmore J. Van Dyke R.W. Deretic V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13972-13977Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although defective CFTR predisposes to inflammation, the reverse situation, namely whether inflammation can impair CFTR function, has not been extensively studied. This would be important as it would set up a cycle that would further damage the defense properties of the bronchial epithelium. Several pieces of evidence would be consistent with this hypothesis. Residual chloride efflux declines as lung function falls (10Thomas S.R. Jaffe A. Geddes D.M. Hodson M.E. Alton E.W. Lancet. 1999; 353: 984-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), there is considerable variation in clinical outcome among patients with the same genotype (11Lester L.A. Kraut J. Lloyd-Still J. Karrison T. Mott C. Billstrand C. Lemke A. Ober C. Pediatrics. 1994; 93: 114-118PubMed Google Scholar), and variable chloride conductance in rectal epithelium has been observed between monozygotic and dizygotic twins (12Bronsveldm I. Mekusm F. Bijmanm J. Ballmannm M. de Jonge H.R. Laabs U. Halley D.J. Ellemunter H. Mastella G. Thomas S. Veeze H.J. Tummler B. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies raise the intriguing possibility that the airway environment can modify the underlying biochemistry. The airways in CF are characterized by neutrophil-dominated inflammation with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor α in sputum, serum, and bronchial lavage samples (13Osika E. Cavaillon J-M. Chadelat K. Boule M. Fitting C. Tournier G. Clement A. Eur. Respir. J. 1999; 14: 339-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β is particularly interesting as studies from our own group and others have shown that it can reduce cAMP accumulation in response to ligands that bind to adenylyl cyclase-linked receptors in other biological systems (14Pang L. Holland E. Knox A.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Few studies have looked at the functional consequences of these changes. Here we have shown that IL-1β alters cAMP-mediated chloride efflux in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. IL-1β had differential effects depending on whether cells were stimulated with an EP prostanoid or β adrenoreceptor receptor ligand. IL-1β reduced chloride efflux in response to PGE2 but enhanced the response to isoprenaline, a β2 adrenoreceptor agonist. Mechanistic studies showed that the effect was mediated by IL-1β having differential effects on cAMP accumulation to the two agents. The down-regulation of cAMP accumulation and chloride efflux in response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was mediated by an autocrine loop involving induction of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) and endogenous PGE2 production. In contrast, the up-regulation of isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation was prostanoid-independent, was at least in part mediated by protein kinase A, and involved increased expression of β2 adrenoreceptors. These studies provide important mechanistic and functional insights into how different adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the same cell type. These effects may play an important role in the pathophysiology of CF lung disease and may have relevance to its therapy. Similar biochemical processes may be important in diseases of other mucosa such as the gut. Experiments were performed on cultured Calu-3 cells, a transformed bronchial epithelial cell line originally derived from a 25-year-old male in 1975 (obtained from LGC Ltd., Teddington, UK). This cell line shows cAMP-dependent chloride flux through CFTR that is expressed in high levels (15Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J.

Cells were incubated in 24-well plates (at passage 3–7) in 10% fetal calf serum-Eagle's minimum essential medium, supplemented with non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate, in humidified 5% CO2-95% air at 37 °C, and the medium was changed every 2–3 days. Cells were cultured to confluence (typically 7–10 days) and growth arrested in fetal calf serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium for 24 h prior to each experiment. Cells were then treated with either 200 pm IL-1β or 1 μm PGE2 for a further 24 h. Appropriate controls were performed in all experiments; cells were treated with vehicle-only for the same times. Inhibitors were added to the treated cells at the same time as the cytokines and mediators in certain experiments. To examine the role of cyclo-oxygenase isoforms, we used 1 μm indomethacin, a broad spectrum COX inhibitor, and 1 μm NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. The role of protein kinase A was examined using the specific and selective inhibitor H-89. Cyclic AMP Accumulation—Immediately before each experiment, medium was removed and the cells washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. This was then replaced by 500 μl of serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine to prevent cAMP breakdown by phosphodiesterases. Isoprenaline, PGE2, forskolin, and the selective EP2 (ONO-AE1 259) or EP4 (ONO-AE1 329) agonist was then added to control and treated cells and incubated for 10 min. This time was chosen based on our previous studies. Experiments were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of ice-cold 30% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting solution was transferred to centrifuge tubes kept at 4 °C, and the trichloroacetic acid removed by amine-freon extraction. The cAMP content of the extract was determined using a protein binding assay (17Pang L. Holland E. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L322-L329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bound 3H cAMP was measured using the Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Bioscience LTD., Pangbourne, Berkshire, UK). PGE2 Assay—Cell supernatants were stored at –20 °C until the determination of PGE2 content by radioimmunoassay as previously described (17Pang L. Holland E. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L322-L329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β2 Adrenoreceptor Assay—β2 adrenoreceptor numbers were measured using a radioligand binding assay (18Baker J.G. Hall I.P. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]CGP12177 (doubling concentrations from 0.0625 to 8 nm), a β2 adrenoreceptor ligand, in serum-free medium for 1 h. At the end of this time supernatant was removed and the cells washed twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed with 0.5 m sodium hydroxide, and the bound [3H]CGP12177 was measured using the Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer. These results were taken to indicate the total binding of [3H]CGP12177. The procedure was repeated with 0.1 μm ICI 118551, a potent specific β2 adrenoreceptor antagonist, added to all the ascending concentrations of [3H]CGP12177 to specifically occupy all available β2 adrenoreceptor sites. The resulting measurements of [3H]CGP12177 binding are therefore representative of nonspecific binding. Specific binding was calculated from the difference between the total and nonspecific binding at each concentration of [3H]CGP12177. Protein content was measured using the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Assay of Chloride Flux—Chloride flux was measured using the fluorescent chloride probe MQAE (20West M.R. Malloy C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 96-well flat-bottomed and black-walled plates (Costar, UK). Once confluent, half the cells were treated with serum-free medium plus IL-1β and half with serum-free medium plus vehicle alone. After 4 h, 5 μl of 8 mm MQAE was added to each well to bring the total well volume to 100 μl. 20 h later the medium was removed, and each well was washed three times with chloride-containing buffer, tipping onto blotting paper as before. The plates were incubated with 100 μl of chloride-containing buffer (to induce chloride channel activation before initiating chloride efflux) for 10 min at room temperature. During experiments with glibenclamide (200 μm), glibenclamide was added to selected wells during this period. The plates were then read on a Wallac Victor fluorescence plate reader (LKB Wallac, Turku, Finland) to give a baseline reading before agonists were added (excitation wavelength 360 nm, emission wavelength 460 nm). The buffer was then removed as before and replaced by 100 μl of chloride-free buffer ± agonists to be tested. The plate was then read every minute for 16 min at the same settings. Results are expressed as change in fluorescence from baseline against time. Increasing fluorescence represents increasing chloride efflux from cells. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction—Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates, and growth was arrested for 24 h and then treated for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h with 200 pm IL-1β. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) following the manufacturer's protocol; 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 25 μl, including 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 25 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 200 units of oligo(dT)15 primer, 0.5 mm of each dNTPs and 1× first-strand buffer provided by Promega. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min. PCR was carried out by adding 2 μl of cDNA to a total reaction volume of 50 μl, giving final concentrations of 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1× PCR buffer, 200 μm of each dNTPs (Promega), and 0.5 μm of both the upstream and downstream primers (Sigma). The primer sequences were as follows: EP2-R sense, 5′-TCC AAT GAC TCC CAG TCT GAG GA-3′; EP2-R antisense, 5′-TCA AAG GTC AGC CTG TTT AC-3′; EP4-R sense, 5′-TCT GAC CTC GGT GTC CAA AAA TCG-3′; EP4-R antisense, 5′-TGG GTA CTG CAG CCG CGA GCT A-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense, 5′-CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense, 5′-TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC-3′. 2.5 μl of RED Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma) was then added to each reaction mixture. Amplification was carried out with a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA) after an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min. This was followed by 35 cycles of PCR using the following times and temperatures: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized using ultraviolet illumination and the GeneGenius gel documentation and analysis system (Syngene). Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting for COX-2 and β2 adrenoreceptor was performed as previously described (17Pang L. Holland E. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L322-L329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Materials—Recombinant human IL-1β, PGE2, isoprenaline, indomethacin, forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cAMP, and ICI 118551 were all obtained from Sigma. NS-398 was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). [3H]CGP12177 and 3H cAMP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and MQAE was obtained from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, UK). Glibenclamide was obtained from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK). ONO-AE1 259 and ONO-AE1 329 were obtained from ONO Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan). Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. H-89 was obtained from Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, UK); COX-2 and β2 adrenoreceptor antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as means and S.E. from n determinations. Statistical analysis was performed with the software program GraphPad Prism 4. For experiments measuring cAMP and PGE2 release, unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences between means. For experiments measuring chloride efflux, representative experiments are shown. Three time points were chosen for subsequent analysis as summary statistics. Statistical significance was determined by efflux for each condition at these time points. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were used to determine significance between these sets of observations. In assays measuring β2 adrenoreceptor numbers, Bmax (a measure of receptor number) and the dissociation constant Kd were calculated using non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism 4). In all experiments p values <0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. IL-1β Increases cAMP Formation in Response to Isoprenaline (ISO) but Reduces the Response to PGE2—Basal cAMP levels were low in both control cells and cells pretreated with IL-1β. Isoprenaline caused a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation, significant in control cells from 0.1 μm. Prolonged treatment with IL-1β (200 pm) for 24 h increased cAMP synthesis in response to all concentrations of ISO tested (Fig. 1A). PGE2 also caused a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP production in control cells significant from 0.01 μm. IL-1β (200 pm) pretreatment for 24 h markedly attenuated the response to all PGE2 concentrations (Fig. 1B). We next went on to determine the role of prostanoids in the effects of IL-1β. IL-1β Induces COX-2 and Increases PGE2 Production in Calu-3 Cells—IL-1β (200 pm) caused a marked increase in PGE2 production that was time dependent and significant (Fig. 2A). The increase in PGE2 was abolished when cells were pretreated with the broad spectrum COX inhibitor indomethacin (1 μm) or the COX-2-selective agent NS-398 (1 μm) (Fig. 2B). We have previously shown that this concentration of NS-398 abolishes COX-2-mediated PGE2 production with no effect on COX-1 in airway cells. Western blotting showed that IL-1β induced COX-2 with protein levels that increased from 4 h and remained increased at 24 h (Fig. 2C). Inhibitors of Prostanoid Synthesis Inhibit the Effects of IL-1β on PGE2-induced cAMP Accumulation but Not ISO-induced cAMP Accumulation—To determine whether prostanoids were responsible for the effects of IL-1β on ISO- and PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation, we studied the effect of the broad spectrum COX inhibitor indomethacin and selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 on IL-1β-induced changes in cAMP production. These agents (both at 1 μm) had no effect on the increase in ISO-stimulated cAMP production seen after IL-1β (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this effect occurs via a prostanoid-independent mechanism. In contrast, COX inhibitors completely abolished the down-regulation of PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation seen with IL-1β (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the attenuated cAMP response to exogenous PGE2 produced by IL-1β occurs via induction of COX-2 and production of endogenous PGE2. Exogenous PGE2 Mimics the Effect of IL-1β on PGE2-mediated cAMP Accumulation but Not ISO-mediated cAMP Accumulation—Further evidence was sought for a prostanoid-dependent mechanism by applying exogenous PGE2 (1 μm for 24 h) to mimic the effects of IL-1β. Exogenous PGE2 down-regulated PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation in a similar manner to IL-1β (Fig. 4A), thus providing further evidence that the effects of IL-1β on PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation are via COX-2 induction and endogenous PGE2 production. In contrast to the effects of IL-1β, exogenous PGE2 decreased ISO-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4B). This provided further evidence that the effects of IL-1β on ISO-mediated cAMP synthesis are prostanoid independent. IL-1β Reduces cAMP Accumulation in Response to Forskolin—To study the site of the effect of IL-1β on PGE2-induced cAMP accumulation, we studied the effect of forskolin, a direct adenylyl cyclase activator that bypasses G protein-coupled receptors. Forskolin concentration dependently increased cAMP accumulation in control cells significant from 0.1 μm. IL-1β (200 pm) for 24 h significantly attenuated the response to 1 μm forskolin (Fig. 5A), suggesting that adenylyl cyclase is down-regulated by IL-1β. Consistent with this, exogenous PGE2 also decreased forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 5B). IL-1β Increases ISO-induced cAMP Accumulation by Increasing β2 Adrenoreceptor Numbers—To determine the mechanism whereby IL-1β increases ISO-induced cAMP accumulation, we studied the effects of IL-1β on β2 adrenoreceptor numbers. There was a consistent 3–4-fold increase in receptor number after incubation with IL-1β for 24 h. The mean Bmax for untreated cells was 26.5 (± 7.2) fmol/μg protein. This rose to 76.1 (± 10.5) fmol/μg protein after 24 h of treatment with IL-1β. Representative whole cell binding data are shown in Fig. 6, A and B. Fig. 6C shows the receptor density for each condition. These observations were confirmed by Western blotting. Fig. 6D shows the time-dependent increase in β2 adrenoreceptor protein. Calu-3 Cells Express EP4 but Not EP2 Receptors; EP4 Expression Is Reduced by IL-1β—PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation occurs via stimulation of the Gs-coupled prostanoid receptors EP2 and EP4. We therefore examined the effects of agonists and antagonists at these receptors on PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Stimulation with EP4 agonist (10 nm) led to a marked increase in cAMP accumulation after 10 min that was equivalent to that seen in response to PGE2 stimulation. Exposure to the same concentration of EP2 agonist did not lead to an increase in cAMP accumulation. Pretreatment of cells for 1 h with a selective EP4 antagonist abolished cAMP accumulation in response to both PGE2 and EP4 agonist (Fig. 7A). These experiments were repeated using chloride efflux as the end point. The same effects were observed (data not shown). We then examined the expression of EP2 and EP4 receptor messenger RNA in these cells using reverse transcription PCR. Cells were treated for between 0 and 24 h with IL-1β prior to RNA extraction. EP2 receptor mRNA was not detected at any time point. EP4 receptor mRNA was present at all time points and was reduced by IL-1β treatment after 24 h (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7C shows densitometry data from three separate experiments. The PKA Inhibitor H-89 Abolishes the Effect of IL-1β on ISO-induced cAMP Accumulation but Has No Effect on That Caused by PGE2—Experiments were performed to determine whether the effects of IL-1β on cAMP accumulation were mediated by protein kinase A. We used the inhibitor H-89 at a concentration of 10 μm and found that it abolished the increase in cAMP accumulation due to IL-1β when cells were stimulated with ISO (Fig. 8A). In contrast, H-89 had no effect on the attenuated response to PGE2 (Fig. 8B). These results suggest IL-1β enhances cAMP accumulation to β2 adrenoreceptor agonists via PKA but that the attenuated response to prostanoids is PKA independent. IL-1β Increases Chloride Efflux from Cells in Response to ISO but Reduces Efflux in Response to PGE2—We next went on to determine whether the effects of IL-1β on cAMP were mirrored by effects on cAMP-mediated chloride flux. Isoprenaline and PGE2 both caused concentration-dependent increases in chloride efflux (Fig. 9, A and B). From these time course experiments, time points of 3, 5, and 16 min were chosen for summary analysis. Chloride efflux was blocked at all summary time points by 200 μm glibenclamide, confirming that it was CFTR-mediated (data not shown). IL-1β (200 pm) pretreatment for 24 h increased 10 μm ISO-induced chloride efflux but reduced 1 μm PGE2-mediated chloride efflux. These changes mirrored those seen in experiments where cAMP production was measured. The effects of IL-1β on ISO- and PGE2-mediated chloride efflux are shown at these points (Figs. 10 and 11).Fig. 10The effect of IL-1β on isoprenaline-induced chloride efflux mirrors those on cAMP accumulation. IL-1β increased chloride efflux at all summary time points: 3 min (A), 5 min (B), and 16 min (C). Data expressed as mean ± S.E.

The COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398 was able to completely abolish the attenuated response at all summary time points (Fig. 12). The broad spectrum COX inhibitor indomethacin had the same effect (data not shown). Furthermore, PGE2 pretreatment mimicked the effect of IL-1β (Fig. 13).Fig. 13The effect of 24 h of pretreatment with exogenous PGE2 on subsequent PGE2-induced chloride efflux. Exogenous PGE2 reduced subsequent PGE2-induced chloride efflux at all time points: 3 min (A), 5 min (B), and 16 min (C), mimicking the effect of IL-1β. Data expressed as mean ± S.E.

There was no significant difference between treated and control cell populations (data not shown). The main findings of these studies are that IL-1β has differential effects on ISO- and PGE2-mediated cAMP accumulation and chloride efflux in Calu-3 cells. IL-1β enhanced ISO-mediated cAMP accumulation via an increase in β2 adrenoreceptor numbers. In contrast, IL-1β reduced PGE2-mediated cAMP accumulation by induction of COX-2, production of endogenous PGE2, down-regulation of adenylyl cyclase, and down-regulation of EP4 receptor expression. These findings are novel in showing that IL-1β can differentially effect the responses to different adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptor ligands in the same cell. Furthermore, these findings have important functional consequences. The effects of IL-1β on ISO- and PGE2-mediated chloride flux mirrored its effects on cAMP accumulation with the response to ISO being enhanced and the response to PGE2 being attenuated. These findings have implications for the understanding of the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis lung disease and may also be relevant for disease processes at other mucosal surfaces such as the gut. Our results suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β present in CF airways may reduce PGE2-mediated chloride flux. This might further impair defective chloride flux in cystic fibrosis and exacerbate the abnormalities in airway surface liquid composition that occur as a result of CFTR dysfunction. This effect could also cause abnormal fluid movement in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis that might worsen the disease. It is well established that CF lungs contain high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β (13Osika E. Cavaillon J-M. Chadelat K. Boule M. Fitting C. Tournier G. Clement A. Eur. Respir.

https://openalex.org/W2029540605,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) is comprised of non-covalently associated gp120/gp41 subunits that form trimeric spikes on the virion surface. Upon binding to host cells, Env undergoes a series of structural transitions, leading to gp41 rearrangement necessary for fusion of viral and host membranes.

Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Env is synthesized as a fusion-inactive precursor (gp160) that is cleaved by a host cell convertase in the Golgi compartment to generate a mature trimer of gp120/gp41 subunits (2Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The gp120 first binds to CD4 and then a chemokine receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). The binding triggers a series of conformational changes in the gp120/gp41 complex that leads to the insertion of the fusion peptide located at the N terminus of the transmembrane-anchored gp41 subunit into the target cell membrane, and ultimately to virus-cell fusion (3Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar).The structure of the ectodomain of gp41 (e-gp41) in its fusogenic state has been solved by both x-ray crystallography and NMR (for HIV-1 and SIV, respectively) and consists of a central parallel trimeric coiled-coil of N-terminal helices surrounded by C-terminal helices of gp41 in an antiparallel hairpin fashion, forming a six-helix bundle (4Chan D.C.

The formation of the fusogenic state of e-gp41 provides the driving force for the apposition of the virus and cell membranes, thereby promoting membrane fusion. Several peptides that mimic the sequence of the N- and C-helices have been found to inhibit fusion in a dominant negative way by blocking the interaction between the C- and N-helices, respectively, and thus, preventing the formation of the gp41 fusogenic state (8Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 9Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that native gp41 may exist as a “prefusion” structure and/or convert to a transient intermediate prior to formation of the fusogenic hairpin trimer structure. In the prefusion state, the C-region of e-gp41 must not yet be fully associated with the N-helices, such that both N- and C-regions of gp41 are accessible to peptide inhibitors.On the virion surface, e-gp41 is thought to exist in a metastable state through association with gp120. The sites of gp120-gp41 contact have been mapped by in vitro mutagenesis and deletion studies to conserved residues within the disulfide-bonded loop region between N- and C-helices of gp41 as well as in the N-terminal (C1) and C-terminal (C5) regions of gp120 (10Cao J.

Structural information on the native gp120/gp41 complex trimer on the virion surface prior to receptor binding should be extremely valuable in guiding attempts at pharmacologic and immunologic intervention. However, achieving this goal has been impeded in part, due to the extensive glycosylation, heterogeneous conformation, and lability of the gp120/gp41 complex. To circumvent these issues, we now have designed a truncated “topless” gp140 variant in which most parts of gp120 have been removed, while maintaining e-gp41 in a prefusion configuration.MATERIALS AND METHODSDesign, Expression, and Purification of the Topless gp140 Constructs—All constructs were expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen). The ADA HIV-1 gp160 gene was used as the template for constructs in Fig. 1B (15Zhang C.W. Chishti Y. Hussey R.E. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39577-39585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For clarity, residues of ADA HIV-1 gp160 were numbered according to the HXBc2 gp160 sequence alignment. To facilitate the secreted expression of constructs, the expression vector pFastBac (Invitrogen) was modified to add a honeybee melittin secretion signal (HMSS) sequence at the 5′ terminus of multiple cloning sites and a His6 tag at the 3′ terminus. Briefly, the HMSS DNA sequence was amplified by PCR using primer (5′-GCTTGAGATCTATGAAATTCTTAGTCAACGTTGCC-3′) and (5′-GTTCCAAGCTTTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGAACCGAATTCGAGCTCGGATCCCCATCGATCCGC-3′) with pMelBac (Invitrogen) as a template. The PCR product was digested with BglII and HindIII and cloned into vector pFastBac at corresponding sites. The expression vector so generated, containing an HMSS sequence followed by BamHI, EcoRI, His6 tag, and HindIII site, was named pFBHMH6. All constructs shown in Fig. 1B were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pFBHMH6 for secreted expression. In the first topless construct TN, Asn94 in the C1 region and Lys487 in the C5 region of gp120 were connected by a short linker TPGK. Among all the topless constructs, the primary and secondary cleavage sites between gp120 and gp41 were mutated by PCR as shown in Fig. 1B. The Val489 was also mutated to Ala. In construct STN, the C-terminal tryptophan-rich region was removed from TN and is truncated after Lys665. In construct SH3-STN (SS), the shorter linker TPGK between C1 and C5 in construct STN was replaced by the SH3 domain (residues Glu8–Lue61) of CD2 BP1 protein (16Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To avoid disulfide-linked protein aggregation during expression, the Cys in C1 (Cys54–Cys74) and gp41 (Cys598–Cys604) in TN, STN, and SS were mutated to Ala jointly or separately. For STN, the resulted mutants were named c1-STN (Cys54 and Cys74 to Ala), gp41-STN (Cys598 and Cys604 to Ala), 4cSTN (four Cys to Ala), respectively. The 24-amino acid residues fusion peptide (AVGTIGAMFLGFLGAAGSTMGAAS) in 4cSS was replaced by three linkers in construct 4cSSL24, 4cSSL16, and 4cSSL10, respectively. All mutations were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis method, and the correct sequences were verified by DNA sequencing.The generation and amplification of recombinant baculovirus followed the manufacturers' protocol (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System, Version C). The titer of virus stock was measured using the BacPAK baculovirus rapid titer kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufactures' manual. The virus was usually amplified to a titer around 1 × 108 plaque-forming units before the infection of sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) or Hi5 (Trichoplusia ni) cells for expression. Expression of these constructs was confirmed by Western blotting using the anti-His6 mAb (BD Biosciences) and optimized with respect to virus multiplicity of infection and post-infection harvest times. For large scale expression, Hi5 cells at about 2 × 106 cells/ml in Ex cell 405 medium (JRH Biosciences) were spun down and re-suspended into new medium before the infection with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Supernatants were harvested 48 h post-infection. Secreted proteins were purified from supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using a mAb 8c9 affinity column, where the mAb 8c9 was cross-linked at 5.0 mg/ml to γ-BindPlus Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with dimethylpimelimidate (Pierce). The supernatant were passed through the column with a flow rate of ∼0.5 ml/min. After extensive washing with buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, the protein was then eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), followed by immediate neutralization with 3.0 m Tris, pH 8.8. The fractions containing corresponding proteins were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences). The peaks containing 4cSSL24 were collected and concentrated using an Amicon centrifugal filter device (Millipore).Protein Chemistry—The concentration of 4cSSL24 protein described below was calculated using the theoretical extinction coefficient of A280 = 2.1 at 1.0 mg/ml and confirmed by BCA kit (Pierce). The purified protein was used for protein N-terminal sequencing on a 494 Procise sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The molecular weight of the purified glycosylated protein was measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems).Chemical Cross-linking—4cSSL24 protein at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in PBS was cooled and then incubated with EGS on ice for 30 min or 2 h. The reactions were then quenched by adding Tris (pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linked products were analyzed on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and then Western blotted using the anti-His6 mAb.Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Analysis—About 1.0 mg/ml of 4cSSL24 (in 100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) was subjected to DLS analysis using a DynaPro apparatus (Protein Solutions Inc.) equipped with a temperature stabilizer. The experiments were conducted at 25 °C, and the wavelength of the laser was set at 781.8 nm. About 50 observations were made to calculate the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) using the software DynaPro. The value of the frictional ratio (f/f0) was calculated from D020,w by the relation in Equation 1, f/f0=(KBT6πη20,w)(4πNA3ν¯M)13(1D20,w0)(Eq. 1) where KB = 1.379 × 10–16 erg/°K, η20,w = 0.01 poise, T = 293.15 °K, NA = 6.022137 × 1023/mol, and ν¯=0.73 cm3/g.Negative Staining Electron Microscopy—For staining with uranyl formate, samples at ∼2 μg/ml were absorbed to glow-discharged carbon grids for 30s, followed by washing with 2 drops of deionized water and staining with 2 drops of freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were taken on negative film at a magnification of ×52,000 and a defocus of 1.5 μm using the low dose procedure with a Philips Tecnai12 electron microscope operated at 120 kV. The images on negative film were then digitized with a Zeiss SCAI scanner (pixel size of 0.4 nm at the specimen level).Proteinase Digestion Assay—6-Helix and 4cSSL24 were dissolved into Tris/NaCl buffer (100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml and 0.8 mg/ml, respectively. Trypsin was then added to the solution at a weight ratio of 1:40 and incubated at room temperature. At different times, 20-μl aliquots of the solution were taken out and quenched by adding 5 μl of 5 × SDS sample loading buffer. The samples were then analyzed on a 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—A BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore Inc.) was employed for binding analyses at 25 °C in HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P-20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The biotin-labeled DP178 or scrambled DP178 (scr-DP178) peptide was separately immobilized on the streptavidin-coated SA sensor chip at 1000 RU, following the manufactures' procedure. Both peptides were biotin-labeled at their N terminus. Samples 4cSSL24 (0.5 mg/ml), 5H (0.25 mg/ml), and 6H (0.3 mg/ml) were sequentially run over the DP178-SA and a blank SA for 5 min at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. The sensor chip was regenerated by 10 mm HCl every time after the binding. All the samples were also analyzed on an scr-DP178-bound SA chip at the same condition. Each binding curve obtained from the DP178-bound chip was subtracted with the corresponding curve obtained from the scr-DP178-bound chip.Immunoprecipitation Assay—The expression, refolding, and purification of HXBc2 HIV-1 gp41 5-Helix (5H), 5-Helix(D4) (5HD4), and 6-Helix (6H) followed the published procedure (17Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Proteins were further purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) with a purity >95% on SDS-PAGE. The purified 4cSSL24 (500 μl, 0.5 mg/ml in PBS) was incubated with 40 μl of 8c9-coupled γ-BindPlus beads for 2 h at room temperature, then the beads were spun down and washed with PBS buffer. To investigate the interaction between these proteins and 4cSSL24, 10 μl of these beads was next mixed with 5H (0.1 mg/ml), 6H (0.12 mg/ml), and 5HD4 protein (0.1 mg/ml) in binding buffer (100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then spun down, washed three times with binding buffer, and re-suspended into 50 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. As a control, the γ-BindPlus beads without 8c9 mAb were also incubated with the above 5H, 5HD4, and 6H proteins using similar binding conditions.Polyclonal Antibody Generation—Two New Zealand rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg of protein formulated with complete Freund's adjuvant for the primary injection and followed by several boosters with 100 μg of protein formulated with incomplete Freund's adjuvant every 2 weeks until the titer increased no further. Serum samples were collected 7 days after each immunization and stored at–70 °C until use in ELISA and neutralization assays as described below.MT-2 Assay for Neutralizing Antibodies—Neutralization assays with HIV-1 MN were performed in MT-2 cells by using neutral red to quantify the percentage of cells that survived virus-induced killing. Briefly, a 500 tissue culture 50% infectious dose (TCID50) of virus was incubated with multiple dilutions of serum samples in triplicate for 1 h at 37 °Cin 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. Cells (5 × 104) in 100 μl of growth medium were added, and the incubation continued until most but not all of the cells in virus control wells (cells plus virus but no serum sample) were involved in syncytium formation (usually 3–5 days). Cell viability was quantified by neutral red uptake as described previously (18Montefiori D.C. Robinson Jr., W.E. Schuffman S.S. Mitchell W.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1988; 26: 231-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutralization titers were defined as the reciprocal serum dilution (before the addition of cells) at which 50% of cells are protected from virus-induced killing. A 50% reduction in cell killing corresponds to an approximate 90% reduction in p24 Gag antigen synthesis in this assay (19Bures R. Gaitan A. Zhu T. Graziosi C. McGrath K. Tartaglia J. Caudrelier P. Habib R.E.L. Klein M. Lazzarin A. Stablein D. Deers M. Corey L. Greenberg M.L. Schwartz D.H. Montefiori D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 2019-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Each set of assays includes a positive control serum that had been assayed multiple times and had a known average titer.Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay for Neutralizing Antibodies—Neutralization was measured as reductions in luciferase reporter gene expression after multiple rounds of virus replication in 5.25.EGF-P.Luc.M7 cells (20Montefiori D. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach F.M. Strober W. Coico R. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2004: 12.11.1-12.11.15Google Scholar). This cell line is a genetically engineered clone of CEMx174 that expresses multiple entry receptors (CD4, CXCR4, and GPR15/Bob) and was transduced to express CCR5 (21Brandt S.M. Marian R. Holland A.U. Hope T.J. Landau N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17291-17299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells also possess Tat-responsive reporter genes for luciferase (Luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were maintained in growth medium (RPMI 1640, 12% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg gentamicin/ml) containing puromycin (0.5 μg/ml), G418 (300 μg/ml), and hygromycin (200 μg/ml) to preserve the CCR5 and reporter gene plasmids. For neutralization assay, 5000 TCID50 of virus was incubated with multiple dilutions of test sample in triplicate for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 150 μl in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. A 100-μl suspension of cells (5 × 105 cells/ml of growth medium containing 25 μg of DEAE-dextran/ml but lacking puromycin, G418, and hygromycin) was added to each well. One set of control wells received cells plus virus (virus control), whereas another set received cells only (background control). Plates were incubated until ∼10% of cells in virus control wells were positive for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy (∼3 days). At this time, 100 μl of cell suspension was transferred to a 96-well white solid plate (Costar) for measurements of luminescence using Bright Glo substrate solution as described by the supplier (Promega). Neutralization titers are the dilution at which relative luminescence units were reduced by 50% compared with virus control wells after subtraction of background relative light units. Cell-free stocks of the HIV-1 isolates used in this assay were generated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.ELISA—The titers of the rabbit anti-4cSSL24 serum were measured in a standard ELISA assay. 4cSSL24 protein (100 μl/well) was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml to coat 96-well ImmulonB (ThermoLab System) microtiter plates. Antibody end-point binding titers were determined as the highest dilution -fold of the serum assayed against 4cSSL24 giving A405 reading ratio of experimental/prebleed control of ≥3.0.RESULTSDesign and Stepwise Modification of Topless gp140 Variants—To design gp140 variants in which e-gp41 is maintained in a prefusion state, C1 and C5 segments were retained in various gp140 constructs while the other gp120 components were eliminated. These deletions create a “topless” variant of Env. The crystal structure of gp120 core-CD4–17b Fab complex from the HXBc2 strain of HIV-1 (22Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Majeed S. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1329-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (352) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, left panel) served as the template for the current topless ADA HIV gp140 design. In the core gp120 structure, 50 residues from the N terminus of C1 and 19 residues from the C terminus of C5 are absent, and the remaining termini of C1 and C5 segments are close in space, with residue Asn94 in C1 and Lys487 in C5 being most proximal (∼6 Å). Within the inner domain next to the two termini, a small subdomain, composed of β strands β1, β5, β6, β7, and β25 (Fig. 1A, top left panel), appears relatively separate from the rest of structure and void of glycans. We suspect that this small subdomain may loosely contact the gp41 subunit, dissociating from it when gp120 sheds upon ligand binding. Therefore, for the first topless ADA gp140 variant design (as shown in Fig. 1B, variant TN), we connected Asn94 of C1 and Lys487 of C5 by a short peptide linker TPGK that has a propensity to form a β-turn structure. Additionally, Val489 in C5 was mutated to Ala to reduce potential aggregation caused by its exposed side chain following removal of the gp120 “top.” The primary and secondary cleavage sites were mutated to prevent dissociation of the remaining gp120 fragments from e-gp41 (Fig. 1B). To facilitate detection and purification, a hexa-histidine tag (H6) was attached to the C terminus of all constructs via a short linker (EFGS).The construct, named TN (Fig. 1B), was expressed using the baculovirus system in Hi5 insect cells. The secreted protein expression level was low, ∼50 μg/liter, with most protein appearing as disulfide-linked aggregates on SDS-PAGE. Mutation of the Cys residues in C1 and/or e-gp41 could not eliminate the aggregation (data not shown). Hence, we suspect that the aggregation is caused by the tryptophan-rich segment within the gp41 C-terminal ectodomain membrane-proximal region (CTE), as was previously observed for Escherichia coli-produced e-gp41 segments. 2Z.-S. Qiao, M. Kim, B. Reinhold, D. Montefiori, J.-h. Wang, and E. L. Reinherz, unpublished work. Therefore, the second STN series of topless construct excludes the CTE (Fig. 1, A (middle panel) and B).As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), the STN formed high molecular weight aggregates in the absence of reducing agent, indicating that the disulfide bonds of C1 and/or gp41 were not correctly formed. Consequently, we created three STN disulfide mutants, termed c1-STN, gp41-STN, and 4cSTN (Fig. 1B), in which Cys in C1 and C5 were separately or concurrently mutated to Ala, respectively. c1-STN and gp41-STN, like STN, formed disulfide aggregates, whereas 4cSTN ran at an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. However, the purification efficiency of metal-chelating chromatography using nickel beads was too low to obtain sufficient amounts of protein for biochemical analysis. To overcome this problem, we replaced the short TPGK linker with the SH3 domain from CD2BP1, an adapter protein binding to the cytoplasmic tail of CD2 for which a specific mAb, 8C93d8 (8c9), exists (16Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Given that the N- and C-terminal ends of folded SH3 domains approximate to within ∼6 Å, this replacement will juxtapose the C1 and C5 segments as would the short linker. Therefore, in the constructs STN-SH3 (SS) and the four Cys mutant variant SS (4cSS), the CD2BP1 SH3 domain (residues Glu8–Leu61) replaced the TPGK linkers (Fig. 1, A (right panel) and B). The 4cSS protein (expression level ∼2.0 mg/liter) was efficiently purified using 8c9 affinity chromatography. The oligomer state of 4cSS was tested by gel filtration on a Superdex S-200 column equilibrated with PBS. As shown in Fig. 2C, most of the 4cSS formed heterogeneous soluble aggregates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼440 kDa, larger in size than expected for trimers. The aggregates were not solubilized by acidic buffer conditions (pH 3.0), in contrast to the fusogenic hairpin-like e-gp41, which becomes soluble in acidic rather than neutral pH conditions (6Tan K.

https://openalex.org/W2148059499,"The intracellular localization of a RING-IBR protein, RBCK1, possessing DNA binding and transcriptional activities, has been investigated. The endogenous RBCK1 was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Particularly in the nucleus, it was localized in the granular structures, most likely nuclear bodies. In contrast, the over-expressed RBCK1 was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm. When the cells were treated with leptomycin B, the over-expressed RBCK1 accumulated in the nuclear bodies. These results suggest that RBCK1 possesses the signal sequences responsible for the nuclearcytoplasmic translocation. Mutational analysis of RBCK1 has indicated that an N-terminal region containing Leu-142 and Leu-145 and a C-terminal one containing the RING-IBR domain serve as the nuclear export and localization signals, respectively. Thus, RBCK1 is a transcription factor dynamically shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, RBCK1 was found to interact with nuclear body proteins, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Coexpression of RBCK1 with CBP significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of RBCK1. Although PML per se showed no effect on the transcriptional activity of RBCK1, the CBP-enhanced activity was repressed by coexpression with PML, presumably through the interaction of PML and CBP. Taken together, our data demonstrate that RBCK1 is involved in transcriptional machinery in the nuclear bodies, and its transcriptional activity is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.

RBCK1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in normal rat tissues. The RING-IBR domain of RBCK1 interacts with DNA fragments containing a TGG-rich sequence. The RING finger motif occurring at the N-terminal side (RING1) is essential for the transcriptional activity of RBCK1, which is enhanced by coexpression with protein kinase A and significantly repressed by coexpression with extracellular signal-regulated kinase activator kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK kinase 1 (15Tatematsu K. Tokunaga C. Nakagawa N. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A ubiquitin-like-truncated form of RBCK1, also known as a hepatitis B virus X-associating protein 3 (XAP3), is generated by alternative splicing of human RBCK1 gene and trans-activates Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR) promoter (16Cong Y.S. Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Kuzhandaivelu N. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16482-16489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RBCK1 also has been suggested to act as E3, a UbcM4 (a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, E2)-interacting protein, UIP28 (17Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and a ubiquitin ligase-1 (HOIL-1) for a heme-oxidized iron regulatory protein-2 (IRP2) (18Minato N. Ishimori K. Iwai K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) are the mouse and human splice variants of RBCK1, respectively. Collectively, it is concluded that RBCK1 is a ubiquitin ligase and a transcriptional factor having a RING-IBR domain. However, RBCK1 is usually present in the cytoplasm unlike other conventional transcriptional factors. To further elucidate cellular functions of RBCK1, we investigated its intracellular localization. In this paper, we report the identification of the nuclear export signal (NES) and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in RBCK1, which are responsible for shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, we demonstrate here interactions of RBCK1 with nuclear body proteins, CBP and PML, and their up- and down-regulation of the transcriptional activity of RBCK1. Construction of Plasmids—A mammalian expression plasmid pTB701-hGFPc for a C-terminally GFP-fused protein was constructed by inserting the humanized green fluorescent protein cDNA (hGFPc) 3′-downstream of the SV40 early promoter contained in pTB701. For expression of the C-terminally GFP-fused RBCK1 (RBCK1-GFP), plasmid pTB701-RBCK1-hGFPc was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment encoding RBCK1 into pTB701-hGFPc. Plasmid pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1 was described previously for expression of the N-terminally FLAG-tagged RBCK1 (FLAG-RBCK1) (14Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For expression of truncated forms of the N-terminally FLAG-tagged RBCK1 (FLAG-RBCK1-(1–269) and FLAG-RBCK1-(270–498)), plasmids pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1-(1–269) and pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1-(270–498) were constructed by inserting DNA fragments encoding N-terminal (from Met-1 to Glu-269) and C-terminal (from Cys-270 to His-498) halves of RBCK1 into pTB701-FLAG, respectively. For bacterial expression of an N-terminally GST-fused GFP (GST·GFP), plasmid pGEX-6T1-hGFPc was constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified hGFPc gene into plasmid pGEX-6T1 (Amersham Biosciences). An expression plasmid pGEX-6T1-hGFPc-RBCK1 for the GST·GFP-fused RBCK1 (GST·GFP·RBCK1) was constructed by inserting the RBCK1 gene into pGEX-6T1-hGFPc. An expression plasmid pGEX-6T1-RBCK1 for the GST-fused RBCK1 (RBCK1-GST) was constructed by inserting the RBCK1 gene into pGEX-6T1. Plasmid pGL3-RSV-LTR used for the luciferase reporter gene assay with the RSV promoter was constructed by inserting RSV3′-LTR 5′-upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic (Promega). A mammalian expression plasmid pRc/RSV-mCBP·HA·RK for the C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged CBP was a gift from S. Ishii (19Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression plasmid pCMX-PML for PML was a gift from A. Kakizuka (20Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression plasmid pM-RBCK1 for GAL4 DNA-binding domain-RBCK1 was described previously (14Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Tatematsu K. Nakagawa N. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (L142A/L145A) was carried out for pTB701-RBCK1-hGFPc, pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1, pGEX-6T1-hGFPc-RBCK1, and pM-RBCK1, and the resulting mutant plasmids were denoted with (L142A/L145A) after each plasmid name. Expression of GFP-fused Proteins in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under humidified air with 5% CO2. HEK293 cells (∼5 × 104 cells) were transfected with pTB701-hGFPc, pTB701-RBCK1-hGFPc, or pTB701-RBCK1(L142A/L145A)-hGFPc by using a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were grown on a cover glass (diameter, 1-cm) for 72 h, washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4), and fixed with 100% (v/v) methanol at –20 °C for 20 min. The fluorescence of the cells was observed under an LSM510 confocal laser scan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Preparation of Anti-RBCK1 Polyclonal Antibody—A synthetic 24-residue oligopeptide (LTLQPRGPLEPVLPKPRTHQETGQ) corresponding to rat RBCK1 (from Leu-150 to Glu-173) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with m-maleimidebenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and used as an antigen. The oligopeptide was also conjugated with the activated HiTrap NH resins (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacture's protocol. Antisera were raised in female Japanese rabbits (2.5–3.5 kg) by subcutaneous injections of the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated oligopeptide. Antiserum was applied onto the oligopeptide-conjugated column and washed with PBS. The anti-RBCK1 antibody was eluted from the column with 0.2 m glycine buffer, pH 2.5, dialyzed against PBS, concentrated by using a Centricon YM-10 cartridge (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and stored at –20 °C until use. Immunocytochemical Analysis—Cells were fixed with 100% (v/v) methanol, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. A nuclear body protein PML was visualized with an anti-human PML mouse monoclonal antibody (PG-M3) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a primary antibody (dilution 1:1,000) and an anti-mouse IgG goat antibody conjugated with Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) as a secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000). CBP was detected with an anti-human CBP rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a primary antibody (dilution 1:500) and an anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody conjugated with Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) as a secondary antibody (dilution 1:500). FLAG-RBCK1 was detected with an anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) as a primary antibody (dilution 1:1,000) and an anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody conjugated with Cy2 (Amersham Biosciences) as a secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000). Endogenous RBCK1 was detected by using an anti-RBCK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (described above) as a primary antibody (dilution 1:500) and an anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody conjugated with Cy2 as a secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000). Microinjection of GST·GFP·RBCK1—A cell lysate of Escherichia coli BL21 expressing GST·GFP·RBCK1 or GST·GFP·RBCK1(L142A/L145A) was applied onto a small column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and the GST-fused protein was eluted according to the manufacture's protocol. The eluted protein was concentrated and dialyzed against PBS by using a Centricon YM-10 cartridge and used for microinjection into the nuclei of baby hamster kidney 21 cells (∼1 × 104 cells) cultured on a cover glass in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS at 37 °C under humidified air with 5% CO2. Each protein was mixed with rhodamine B-isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine serum albumin and microinjected by using a glass capillary. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min under humidified air with 5% CO2, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence of the cells was observed under an LSM510 confocal laser scan microscope. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Transcriptional activities of RBCK1 were measured by the luciferase reporter gene assay with the RSV3′-LTR promoter. HEK293 cells (∼1 × 106 cells) were cotransfected using FuGENE 6 with the reporter plasmid pGL3-RSV-LTR (10 ng) and either pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1 (50 ng) or pTB701-FLAG-RBCK1(L142A/L145A) (50 ng). The transcriptional activities of RBCK1 were also measured by the one-hybrid reporter assay using GAL4 DNA-binding domain. HEK293 cells (∼1 × 106 cells) were cotransfected using Fu-GENE 6 with the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene) (1 μg) containing the firefly-derived luciferase gene 3′-downstream of the synthetic promoter consisting of five repeats of the GAL4-recognition site (17-mer), pM-RBCK1 (50 ng), and either pRc/RSV-mCBP·HA·RK (50 ng) or pCMX-PML (50 ng). After 24 h, the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed with 200 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). In both of the luciferase reporter gene assays, the cell lysate was assayed with a luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacture's protocol. Transcriptional activities were shown by the relative luciferase unit divided by protein concentration, which was measured with a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay kit (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Pull-down Assay—COS7 cells (∼5 × 107 cells) transfected with pRc/RSV-mCBP·HA·RK or pCMX-PML were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 tablet/50 ml of the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Cleared lysate was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50% slurry) immobilized with the purified RBCK1-GST (30 μg). After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed twice with the lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses were carried out with an anti-human CBP rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-20) (dilution 1:200) or an anti-human PML mouse antibody (PG-M3) (dilution 1:200) as a primary antibody and an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) (dilution 1:3,000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method with an ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacture's protocol. Effect of LMB on Intracellular Localization of RBCK1—We first investigated the intracellular localization of the over-expressed RBCK1. As shown in Fig. 1B, the GFP-fused RBCK1 was detected almost exclusively in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells (a). When the cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor for the CRM1-dependent nuclear export (21Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar), most RBCK1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at 1 h after the LMB treatment (Fig. 1B, b). Although at 4 h after the treatment the protein still remained evenly in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, c), it accumulated in small granular structures inside the nucleus at 8 h after the treatment (d). Localization of the control GFP was unaffected by the LMB treatment (Fig. 1B, e–h). These results suggest that RBCK1 has an LMB-sensitive NES sequence. However, the predominant existence of RBCK1 in the nucleus after the LMB treatment is unusual for NES-containing proteins, which are generally present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of LMB (22Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 19: 5347-5358Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and suggests that RBCK1 possesses not only NES but also NLS sequences, like Smad1 (23Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39404-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and p53 (24Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 25Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Ben-Ze'ev A. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Colocalization of RBCK1 and PML in Nuclear Bodies—PML is a major protein in the nuclear bodies (known also as NB, nuclear domain 10, or PML oncogenic domain) (20Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), which have granular structures of 250–500 nm in diameter and are present in the nuclei of most cells. The localization of RBCK1 in the nuclear body-like structures (Fig. 1B, d) was further examined by immunocytochemical analysis. HEK293 cells expressing RBCK1-GFP were treated with LMB, and the endogenous PML was visualized with an anti-PML antibody. In the nucleus, more than 70% of fluorescent spots derived from RBCK1-GFP overlapped with those of the nuclear bodies containing PML (Fig. 2A). Neither over-expression of RBCK1 nor LMB treatment affected the localization of PML in the nuclear bodies. Next, the localization of endogenous RBCK1 was studied using an anti-rat RBCK1 rabbit antibody purified by affinity chromatography. Upon Western blotting of HEK293 cell lysate, the antibody could detect a 56-kDa protein (data not shown), whose size corresponds to the molecular mass (56, 380) calculated from the amino acid sequence of human RBCK1 (NCB Accession number NP_112506). When the antibody was pretreated with excess of the 24-residue oligopeptide that was used as an antigen, the 56-kDa-protein band was not observed, indicating that the 56-kDa protein is an endogenous RBCK1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the endogenous RBCK1 was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, unlike the over-expressed one mostly detected in the cytoplasm (cf. Fig. 1B, a). Nevertheless, RBCK1 present in the nucleus colocalized with PML at the nuclear bodies (Fig. 2B, d). Identification of NES and NLS—Truncated forms of RBCK1 were used to delineate the positions of NES and NLS. The N-terminal half (from Met-1 to Glu-269) and C-terminal half (from Cys-270 to His-498) of RBCK1 were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins in HEK293 cells, and the immunocytochemical analyses were carried out with anti-FLAG and anti-PML antibodies. The N-terminal half of RBCK1 was entirely observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3a). In marked contrast, the C-terminal half was detected only in the dot-like structures within the nucleus (Fig. 3d), which mostly colocalized with the nuclear bodies (f) similarly to the full-length RBCK1 in the LMB-treated cells. These results show that the NES and nuclear-localizing function are contained in the N- and C-terminal halves of RBCK1, respectively. It is reasonable that the C-terminal half of RBCK1, also containing the transcriptional activation domain of RBCK1 (15Tatematsu K. Tokunaga C. Nakagawa N. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), is translocated to the nuclear bodies where genes are actively transcribed (26LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R.L. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and activates the transcription by interacting with the transcriptional machineries. Truncated forms of RBCK1 (from Thr-151 to Glu-269 and from Cys-270 to His-498) were also prepared as N-terminally GST·GFP-fused proteins. These proteins were microinjected into the nuclei of baby hamster kidney-21 cells together with the rhodamine B-isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin. Even 1 h after microinjection, these proteins remained in the nuclei (data not shown), whereas the GST·GFP-fused full-length RBCK1 was exported from the nucleus within 30 min (Fig. 4C, a), corroborating that the NES sequence of RBCK1 is contained in the N-terminal region (from Met-1 to Leu-150). The consensus sequence for the LMB-sensitive NES has been reported as LX2–3(L/I/V/F/M)X2–3LX(L/I) (where X is any amino acid residue; Fig. 4B), which is recognized by an NES-receptor exportin-1/CRM1 (27La Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). By comparing the entire RBCK1 sequence with the consensus sequence, a putative NES sequence was found at the region including Leu-142 and Leu-145 (Fig. 4A). It has been reported that the replacement of Leu by Ala in the NES sequence leads to disruption of the NES function (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the GST·GFP-fused RBCK1(L142A/L145A) in which both Leu-142 and Leu-145 were substituted by Ala was injected into the nuclei, the protein did not translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at 30 min after the microinjection (Fig. 4C, c). Also, the GFP-fused RBCK1(L142A/L145A) protein over-expressed in HEK293 cells spontaneously colocalized with PML in the nucleus as dot-like structures without the LMB treatment (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that Leu-142 and Leu-145 are essential for the NES function of RBCK1. Consistent with the previous report that RBCK1 plays as a transcriptional activator for the RSV LTR promoter (16Cong Y.S. Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Kuzhandaivelu N. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16482-16489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), RBCK1 activated the transcription of RSV LTR about 2.5-fold in the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4E). The NES mutant, RBCK1(L142A/L145A), localizing predominantly in the nuclear bodies, showed further enhancement of the transcriptional activity of RSV LTR promoter. A similar result has been obtained in the one-hybrid reporter assay using the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-fused RBCK1(L142A/L145A) (see Fig. 7), suggesting that the transcriptional activity of RBCK1 is down-regulated by NES. Interaction of RBCK1 with PML and CBP—CBP has recently been revealed to scaffold and activate various transcription factors in the nuclear bodies (26LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R.L. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 29Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PML, a main constituent of the nuclear bodies, was also shown to participate in the transcription mechanism involving either CBP or p53 (30Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 31Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In HEp-2 (26LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R.L. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and SK-N-SH cells (32Boisvert F.M. Kruhlak M.J. Box A.K. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), endogenous CBP is mostly detected in the nuclear body. However, the localization of CBP depends on cell lines; in HEK293 cells, it accumulates in nuclear body only when PML is over-expressed (32Boisvert F.M. Kruhlak M.J. Box A.K. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, colocalization of RBCK1 with PML in the nuclear bodies prompted us to examine the colocalization of RBCK1 with CBP. GFP-fused RBCK1 was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cells were treated with LMB. The transfection efficiency was ∼15%. In the cells, in which RBCK1-GFP was not over-expressed, the endogenous CBP was detected diffusely in the nucleus. However, in the cells, in which RBCK1-GFP was overexpressed, both RBCK1-GFP and CBP were detected in dot-like structures (Fig. 5A). Similar localization was observed with the cells over-expressing RBCK1(L142A/L145A)-GFP (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that RBCK1 interacts with not only PML but also CBP. The interactions of RBCK1 with PML and CBP were further examined by a GST pull-down assay. The purified RBCK1-GST protein was adsorbed onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin, mixed with the lysate of COS7 cells over-expressing either PML or CBP, and subjected to the pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, CBP (∼265 kDa) was found to interact with RBCK1. When the lysate of COS7 cells expressing PML was analyzed by Western blotting, two bands (∼58 and 62 kDa) were observed (Fig. 6B). Because the calculated molecular weight of PML is 62,006, the 58-kDa protein might be generated by proteolysis of the 62-kDa PML protein. In the GST pull-down assay, the 62-kDa PML protein was found to interact with RBCK1. Regulation of Transcriptional Activity of RBCK1 by CBP and PML—CBP was shown to act as a coactivator for various transcriptional factors. PML was also shown to act as a coactivator (3Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) or a corepressor (33Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa I.E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S.

Thus the effects of CBP and PML on the RBCK1-dependent transcription were examined by using a luciferase reporter gene"
https://openalex.org/W2134224882,"We have recently developed a novel small animal model for HIV-1 infection (Ayash-Rashkovsky et al., http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/doi/10.1096/fj.04-3184fje; doi:10.1096/fj.04-3184fje). The mice were successfully infected with HIV-1 for 4-6 wk with different clades of either T- or M-tropic isolates. HIV-1 infection was accompanied by rapid loss of human CD4+ T cells, decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio, and increased T cell activation. HIV specific human humoral and cellular immune responses were observed in all HIV-1 infected animals. In the present study, HIV specific human immune responses, both humoral and cellular, were generated in noninfected Trimera mice, after their immunization with gp120-depleted HIV-1 antigen, presented by autologous human dendritic cells. Addition of CpG ODN to the antigen-pulsed DCs significantly enhanced (by 2- to 30-fold) the humoral and cellular HIV-1 specific immune responses. Only mice immunized with the HIV-1 immunogen and CpG were completely protected from infection with HIV-1 after challenge with high infection titers of the virus. This novel small animal model for HIV-1 infection may thus serve as an attractive platform for rapid testing of candidate HIV-1 vaccines and of adjuvants and may shorten the time needed for the development and final assessment of protective HIV-1 vaccines in human trials."

https://openalex.org/W2103332355,"Abstract There is growing interest in understanding how the cellular environment affects protein folding mechanisms, but most spectroscopic methods for monitoring folding in vitro are unsuitable for experiments in vivo or in other complex mixtures. Monoclonal antibody binding represents a sensitive structural probe that can be detected against the background of other cellular components. A panel of antibodies has been raised against Salmonella typhimurium phage P22 tailspike. In this report, nine α-tailspike antibody binding epitopes were characterized by measuring the binding of these monoclonal antibodies to tailspike variants bearing surface point mutations. These results reveal that the antibody epitopes are distributed throughout the tailspike structure, with several clustered in the central parallel β-helix domain. The ability of each antibody to distinguish between tailspike conformational states was assessed by measuring antibody binding to tailspike in vitro refolding intermediates. Interestingly, the binding of all but one of the nine antibodies is sensitive to the tailspike conformational state. Whereas several antibodies bind preferentially to the tailspike native structure, the structural features that comprise the binding epitopes form with different rates. In addition, two antibodies preferentially recognize early refolding intermediates. Combined with the epitope mapping, these results indicate portions of the β-helix form early during refolding, perhaps serving as a scaffold for the formation of additional structure. Finally, three of the antibodies show enhanced binding to non-native, potentially aggregation-prone tailspike conformations. The refolding results indicate these non-native conformations form early during the refolding reaction, long before the appearance of native tailspike."
