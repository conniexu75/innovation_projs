https://openalex.org/W2006268333,"Sex steroid hormones have been thought to alter behaviors in adulthood by changing the activity of neural circuits rather than by inducing major structural changes in these pathways. In a group of androgen-sensitive motoneurons that mediate male copulatory functions, decreases in androgen levels after castration of adult rats produced dramatic structural changes, decreasing both the dendritic length and soma size of these motoneurons. These changes were reversed by androgen replacement. These results imply a surprising degree of synaptic plasticity in adult motoneurons and suggest that normal changes in androgen levels in adulthood are associated with significant alterations in the structure and function of these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1536311055,"The nuclear lamina is a polymeric protein assembly that is proposed to function as an architectural framework for the nuclear envelope. Previous work suggested that phosphorylation of the major polypeptides of the lamina (the lamins) may induce disassembly of this structure during mitosis. To further investigate the possible involvement of phosphorylation in regulation of lamina structure, we characterized lamin phosphorylation occurring in mammalian tissue culture cells during interphase and mitosis. Phosphorylation occurs continuously throughout all interphase periods (coordinately with nuclear envelope growth), and takes place mainly on the assembled lamina. When the lamina is disassembled during cell division, the lamins are modified with approximately 1-2 molecules of associated phosphate. This level of mitotic phosphorylation is 4-7-fold higher than the average interphase level. Lamin phosphate occurs predominantly as phosphoserine, and is distributed over numerous tryptic peptides, many of which are modified during both interphase and mitotic periods. Significantly, phosphorylation is the only detectable charge-altering postsynthetic modification of the lamins that occurs specifically during mitosis. The results of this study support the notion that phosphorylation is important for regulation of interphase and mitotic lamina structure."
https://openalex.org/W1984635932,"Gap junction-mediated communication between contiguous cells has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. This report describes a new technique to measure cell-cell communication, gap fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching, which is based on the diffusion-dependent return of 6-carboxyfluorescein-mediated fluorescence in a photobleached cell that is in contact with other fluorescently labeled cells. Fluorescence recovery rates are interpreted as dye transport across gap junctions. Results of experiments on normal human fibroblasts and human teratocarcinoma cells show that this technique can measure rapid dye transfer and detect inhibition of communication (between teratocarcinoma cells) by the tumor promoters 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate and the pesticide dieldrin."
https://openalex.org/W2041880635,"Hepatitis B viruses synthesize their open circular DNA genomes by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. The details of this process have been examined with the use of mammalian hepatitis B viruses to map the sites for initiation and termination of DNA synthesis and to explore the consequences of mutations introduced at short, separated direct repeats (DR1 and DR2) implicated in the mechanisms of initiation. The first DNA strand to be synthesized is initiated within DR1, apparently by a protein primer, and the completed strand has a short terminal redundancy. In contrast, the second DNA strand begins with the sequence adjacent to DR2, but its 5' end is joined to an oligoribonucleotide that contains DR1; thus the putative RNA primer has been transposed to the position of DR2. It is now possible to propose a detailed strategy for reverse transcription by hepatitis B viruses that can be instructively compared with that used by retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1522605200,"We present and evaluate a model for the secondary structure and membrane orientation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum that controls the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis. This model is derived from proteolysis experiments that separate the 97-kilodalton enzyme into two domains, an NH2-terminal membrane-bound domain of 339 residues and a COOH-terminal water-soluble domain of 548 residues that projects into the cytoplasm and contains the catalytic site. These domains were identified by reaction with antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to specific regions in the molecule. Computer modeling of the reductase structure, based on the amino acid sequence as determined by molecular cloning, predicts that the NH2-terminal domain contains 7 membrane-spanning regions. Analysis of the gene structure reveals that each proposed membrane-spanning region is encoded in a separate exon and is separated from the adjacent membrane-spanning region by an intron. The COOH-terminal domain of the reductase is predicted to contain two beta-structures flanked by a series of amphipathic helices, which together may constitute the active site. The NH2-terminal membrane-bound domain of the reductase bears some resemblance to rhodopsin, the photoreceptor protein of retinal rod disks and the only other intracellular glycoprotein whose amino acid sequence is known."

https://openalex.org/W2039511387,"The pathophysiological events in sickle cell disease are critically dependent on the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin S, which varies inversely with cell cation and water content. Erythrocytes of SS homozygotes exposed to oxygen or carbon monoxide decrease their potassium and water content through a pathway for potassium transport that is activated by both cell swelling and decrease in internal pH. This pathway is not inhibited by ouabain either with or without bumetanide. When SS erythrocytes were separated according to density, the pH- and volume-dependent potassium transport was greatest in the least dense fraction and was reduced in the densest cells. This pathway, which does not depend on polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, may be important in regulating the cation and water content of SS erythrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1983662955,"In situ hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe complementary to vasopressin messenger RNA (mRNA) in sections from normal or Brattleboro rat hypothalami revealed hybridization densities in each of three vasopressin-rich nuclei: the supraoptic, paraventricular, and suprachiasmatic. When entrained to a daily light-dark cycle, each rat strain displayed diurnal variation in hybridizable mRNA in the suprachiasmatic, but not in the supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei. The higher values for suprachiasmatic mRNA in the morning correlate well with previously elucidated morning increases in vasopressin immunoreactivity in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results support the utility of in situ hybridization techniques for elucidating physiological influences on regional peptidergic function, are consistent with a prominent role for vasopressinergic suprachiasmatic neurons in generating the cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin rhythm, and suggest that regulation of this mRNA rhythm is not dependent on release of intact peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1679165404,"Cleavage of tubulin by subtilisin removes a small (Mr less than 2000) fragment from the C-terminal end of both alpha and beta subunits. The resulting protein is much reduced in negative charge. The cleaved, less acidic protein retains its competence to polymerize in a GTP-dependent and cold-, GDP-, and podophyllotoxin-sensitive manner and assembles into sheets or bundles of twisted filaments. The critical concentration for polymerization of the cleaved protein is about 50-fold lower than that for intact tubulin. It is proposed that the C termini of the subunits normally impede polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W2114839966,"The catalase activity of cultured rat hepatocytes was inhibited by 90% pretreatment with 20 mM aminotriazole without effect on the activities of glutathione peroxidase or glutathione reductase, or on the viability of the cells over the subsequent 24 h. Glutathione reductase was inhibited by 85% by pretreatment with 300 microM 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) without effect on glutathione peroxidase, catalase, or on viability. Both pretreatments sensitized the hepatocytes to the cytotoxicity of H2O2 generated either by glucose oxidase (0.05-0.5 units/ml) or by the autoxidation of the one-electron-reduced state of menadione (50-250 microM). Aminotriazole pretreatment had no effect on the GSH content of the hepatocytes. BCNU reduced GSH levels by 50%. Depletion of GSH levels to less than 20% of control by treatment with diethyl maleate, however, did not sensitize the cells to either glucose oxidase or menadione, indicating that the effect of BCNU is related to inhibition of the GSH-GSSG redox cycle rather than to the depletion of GSH. With glucose oxidase, most of the cell killing in hepatocytes pretreated with either aminotriazole or BCNU occurred between 1 and 3 h. The antioxidant diphenylphenylenediamine (DPPD) had no effect on viability at 3 h. Catalase added to the culture medium 1 h after the addition of glucose oxidase prevented the cell killing measured at 3 h. The sulfhydryl reagents dithiothreitol (200 microM), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (4 mM), and alpha-mercaptopropionyl-L-glycine (2.5 mM) prevented the cell killing with exogenous H2O2 in hepatocytes sensitized by the inhibition of catalase or glutathione reductase. With menadione, there was no killing of nonpretreated hepatocytes at 1 h, and DPPD did not prevent the cell death after 3 h. Aminotriazole pretreatment enhanced the cell killing at 3 h but not at 1 h, and DPPD was not protective. Catalase added to the medium at 1 h inhibited the cell death measured at 3 h. In contrast, menadione killed hepatocytes pretreated with BCNU within 1 h. DPPD prevented cell death at 1 h, and there was evidence of lipid peroxidation in the accumulation of malondialdehyde in the culture medium. Catalase added with menadione did not prevent the cell killing at 1 h but did prevent it at 3 h. These data indicate that catalase and the GSH-GSSG cycle are active in the defense of hepatocytes against the toxicity of H2O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2012297432,"The segregation of secretory proteins into the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is normally tightly coupled to their synthesis. This feature distinguishes their biogenesis from that of proteins targeted to many other organelles. In the examples presented, translocation across the ER membrane is dissociated from translation. Transport, which is normally cotranslational, may proceed in the absence of chain elongation. Moreover, translocation across the ER membrane does not proceed spontaneously since, even in the absence of protein synthesis, energy substrates are required for translocation. These conclusions have been extended to the cotranslational integration of newly synthesized transmembrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1594150232,"Heparin was cleaved with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 and the products were reduced with Na+ boro[3H]hydride to generate a mixture of di- and tetrasaccharides having anhydro-D-[3H]mannitol (AManR) residues on their reducing terminals. The products were purified to homogeneity by gel filtration and high-performance liquid chromatography. For each oligosaccharide, the proportions of D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA), L-iduronic acid (IdoUA), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and AManR and the monosaccharide sequence were determined by quantification of the products of acid hydrolysis. The tetrasaccharide sequences were determined by comparison of the disaccharide units formed by hydrazinolysis and deamination with previously characterized disaccharides. The following new oligosaccharides were identified: GlcUA(2-SO4)-AManR, GlcUA(2-SO4)-AManR(6-SO4), GlcUA-AManR(3,6-diSO4), GlcUA-GlcNAc-GlcUA-AManR, IdoUA-GlcNAc-GlcUA-AManR, GlcUA-GlcNAc(6-SO4)-GlcUA-AManR, IdoUA(2-SO4)-GlcNAc-GlcUA-AManR, IdoUA-GlcNAc(6-SO4)-GlcUA-AManR, IdoUA(2-SO4)-GlcNAc-GlcUA-AManR(6-SO4), IdoUA-GlcNAc(6-SO4)-GlcUA-AManR(6-SO4), IdoUA-GlcNAc(6-SO4)-GlcUA-AManR(3-SO4), IdoUA-GlcNAc(6-SO4)-GlcUA-AManR(3,6-diSO4), and IdoUA(2-SO4)-GlcNAc(6-SO4)-GlcUA-AManR(6-SO4). Then the disaccharides and the tetrasaccharides were readily resolved by high-performance anion-exchange liquid chromatography and were quantified on the basis of the amount of 3H counts/min in each. The structures are discussed in terms of their implications regarding heparin biosynthesis and anticoagulant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2075367960,"Immunoreactive oxytocin and neurophysin were identified and measured by radioimmunoassay in human thymus extracts. Serial dilutions of extracts paralleled the appropriate standard curves. Thymus-extracted oxytocin and neurophysin eluted in the same positions as reference preparations on Sephadex G-75. Authenticity of oxytocin was confirmed by biological assay and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. In most instances, thymus contents of oxytocin and neurophysin were far greater than those expected from known circulating concentrations and declined with increasing age. The molar ratio of oxytocin to neurophysin in thymus was similar to that found in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system, which strongly suggested with the other data a local synthesis of oxytocin. These findings indicate the presence of neurohypophyseal peptides in the human thymus and further support the concept of a neuroendocrine function integrated in an immune structure."
https://openalex.org/W1504098071,"The relationship between the intracellular concentration of various nucleotides as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, and the differentiation of 2 human colon cancer cell lines was studied. HT-29 cells were induced to undergo both structural and functional enterocytic differentiation (as determined by electron microscopy and the presence of brush-border specific enzymes, respectively) by changing the carbon source or adding Na butyrate to standard tissue culture media. This differentiation occurred after the cells reached confluency when they were cultured in galactose, uridine, inosine, or without nucleosides (all in the absence of glucose) and in the presence of glucose plus Na butyrate. Cells cultured in 25 mM fructose or glucose +/- nucleosides did not differentiate. In all culture conditions where HT-29 cells did not differentite, the intracellular concentrations of 2 compounds which co-migrated with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine rose approximately equal to 10-fold at confluency and remained elevated throughout the stationary phase, whereas their concentrations remained constant and low after confluency in cells that underwent differentiation. This indicated that the accumulation of these compounds is associated with the inability of these cells to differentiate since other nucleotides and nucleotide sugars did not change in a similar fashion. Purification of the presumed UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, followed by the identification of the products from their chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, confirmed the identity of these two peaks. Nucleotide analysis of Caco-2 cells, which undergo enterocytic differentiation after they reach confluency even when cultured on glucose, revealed the same pattern of UDP-N-acetylhexosamine levels as differentiated HT-29 cells, with its concentration remaining relatively constant and very low, even after the cells were confluent. The significance of the accumulation of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines in cells unable to differentiate is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2041397277,"Most individuals with cat eye syndrome (CES) have a supernumerary bisatellited chromosome which, on the basis of cytogenetic evidence, has been reported to originate from either chromosome 13 or 22. To resolve this question, a single-copy DNA probe, D22S9, was isolated and localized to 22q11 by in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. The number of copies of this sequence was determined in CES patients by means of Southern blots and densitometry analysis of autoradiographs. In patients with the supernumerary chromosome, four copies were found, whereas in one patient with a duplication of part of chromosome 22, there were three copies. Therefore, the syndrome results from the presence of either three or four copies of DNA sequences from 22q11; there is no evidence that sequences from other chromosomes are involved. This work demonstrates how DNA sequence dosage analysis can be used to study genetic disorders that are not readily amenable to standard cytogenetic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2083892518,"Accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in X-linked and neonatal forms of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) appears to be a consequence of deficient oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, a function that has been attributed to peroxisomes. Peroxisomes were readily identified in liver biopsies taken from a patient having the X-linked disorder. However, in liver biopsies from a patient having neonatal-onset ALD, hepatocellular peroxisomes were greatly reduced in size and number, and sedimentable catalase was markedly diminished. The presence of increased concentrations of serum pipecolic acid and the bile acid intermediate, trihydroxycoprostanic acid, in the neonatal ALD patient are associated with a generalized diminution of peroxisomal activities that was not observed in the patient with X-linked ALD."

https://openalex.org/W1545957512,"Glucocorticoid-receptor activation in GH1 cells results from the conversion of a 10 S oligomeric cytosolic form to a 4-5 S nuclear-binding species (Raaka, B. M., and Samuels, H. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 417-425). In this study, we report that triamcinolone acetonide (9 alpha-fluoro-11 beta, 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 16,17-acetonide) elicits a time- and dose-dependent reduction of total-cell (nuclear + cytoplasmic) receptor. The mechanism of receptor regulation was studied by dense amino acid labeling of receptor using media containing 2H, 13C, and 15N-labeled amino acids. Total cell receptor was extracted with 0.4 M KCl and newly synthesized dense receptor was separated from pre-existing receptor of normal density by centrifugation in gradients of 15-30% sucrose (w/v) in D2O. Receptor levels in cells grown without [3H]triamcinolone acetonide was 260 +/- 19 fmol/100 micrograms of DNA (16,000 molecules/cell), and, with 10 nM [3H]triamcinolone acetonide, this decreased to 130 +/- 14 fmol/100 micrograms of DNA after 30 h. Receptor half-life was 19 +/- 1.9 h in the absence and 9.5 +/- 0.3 h in the presence of triamcinolone acetonide and accounted for the decrease in steady-state receptor levels. Receptor synthesis was 9.7 +/- 0.3 fmol/100 micrograms of DNA/h (580 molecules/cell/h) both in the presence and absence of 10 nM [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Triamcinolone acetonide reduced the half-life in proportion to the extent of receptor occupancy and activation. During the approach to steady-state conditions, 10 nM [3H]triamcinolone acetonide shortened receptor half-life almost immediately to the value in cells grown with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide for 24 h or longer. Cycloheximide did not prevent the triamcinolone acetonide-mediated decrease in receptor half-life and the shortening of receptor half-life is rapidly reversed by removal of hormone. These studies support a model of receptor regulation in which triamcinolone acetonide converts the unactivated 10 S receptor to the activated 4-5 S form which is degraded at an increased rate by the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1584663505,"Two distinct forms of antithrombin III were isolated by chromatography of normal human plasma on heparin-Sepharose. The predominant antithrombin species present (AT-III alpha), which eluted from the affinity column in 1 M NaCl, was identified as the antithrombin III form which has been previously characterized. Ionic strength of the buffer was increased to elute a variant form of antithrombin III, designated as AT-III beta. The molecular weight of AT-III beta is less than that of AT-III alpha, but physicochemical studies do not indicate measureable differences in the polypeptide portion of the proteins. Carbohydrate determination revealed the sole detectable structural difference in the two antithrombins: levels of hexosamine, neutral sugars, and sialic acid in AT-III beta were all 25-30% less than in AT-III alpha. Kinetic studies of thrombin inactivation by both antithrombins, in the presence of nonsaturating amounts of heparin, indicated that AT-III beta inhibited thrombin more rapidly. AT-III beta is also distinguishable from AT-III alpha on the basis of heparin-binding affinity estimated from titration of protein fluorescence with heparin. Thus, antithrombin III exists as two molecular entities in human plasma which differ both structurally, in carbohydrate content, and functionally, in their heparin-binding behavior."

Lesions of the cerebellar vermis significantly attenuated long-term habituation without affecting the short-term process or altering initial response levels. In this response system the cerebellar vermis is part of an essential circuit for long-term habituation."
https://openalex.org/W1540076991,"Macrophages express a mannose-specific pinocytosis receptor that binds and internalizes lysosomal hydrolases. Treatment of rat bone marrow-derived macrophages with dexamethasone resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent increase in mannose-receptor activity. The dexamethasone effect was maximal at 24 h. Half-maximal effects were observed at a dexamethasone concentration of 2.5 X 10(-9) M. With 125I-beta-glucuronidase as ligand, a 2.5-fold increase in uptake rate was observed in dexamethasone-treated cells, with no change in Kuptake (2.5 X 10(-7) M beta-glucuronidase). Cell surface binding (4 degrees C) was elevated 2.6-fold following dexamethasone treatment. The increase in ligand binding appeared to be due to an increase in number of sites with no change in affinity. Cycloheximide suppressed the dexamethasone-mediated rise in receptor number, while cycloheximide alone had little effect on receptor activity over 16 h. These results suggest that dexamethasone stimulates synthesis of mannose receptors in macrophages. Extracellular accumulation of hexosaminidase was sharply reduced by dexamethasone treatment, and corresponded with the rise in mannose-receptor activity. Extracellular levels of hexosaminidase from untreated macrophages were modestly increased by the presence of mannan, while the extracellular activity from dexamethasone-treated cells was increased significantly by mannan. Extracellular hexosaminidase, released from zymosan-treated macrophages, was dramatically reduced by dexamethasone pretreatment. Enzyme released from zymosan-stimulated macrophages was efficiently endocytosed by dexamethasone-treated cells in co-culture experiments, and this endocytosis was blocked by the addition of mannan. These results suggest that the mannose receptor of macrophages may play a role in regulating extracellular levels of lysosomal enzymes via a secretion-recapture mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1972151536,"Dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) is a highly toxic contaminant produced in the manufacture of phenoxy herbicides. Despite its high TCDD content, soil from a contaminated area associated with a 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) manufacturing site in Newark, New Jersey, did not induce acute toxicity when administered to guinea pigs (the most sensitive species) by gavage. Analysis of liver samples demonstrated low bioavailability of TCDD from this soil. A comparative analysis of soils showed that Soxhlet extraction was necessary for the determination of TCDD on Newark soil, whereas solvent extraction was sufficient for soil from Times Beach, Missouri. The difference in the bioavailability of TCDD from these soils is correlated with TCDD extractability and may be related to the different compositions of the soils."
https://openalex.org/W2020889497,"Chromosomes of four species of Leishmania represented by ten different geographic isolates were analyzed by pulsed field gradient gel electrophoresis (PFG) to assess chromosome stability in these parasitic protozoans. Among different geographic isolates of the same subspecies, more than two-thirds of chromosomes had similar sizes, ethidium bromide staining intensities, and locations of alpha,beta-tubulin genes. However, among New World Leishmania, members of different species or subspecies have fewer than one-third of their chromosomes in common. Therefore, PFG karyotypes of Leishmania exhibit intraspecific variability similar to that reported for other parasitic protozoans. The greater similarities of the karyotypes of members of the same Leishmania subspecies may indicate that they represent valid taxa. These similarities also allowed the use of PFG in clinical diagnosis for rapid and accurate typing of patient isolates."
https://openalex.org/W1480400003,"Type V collagen was prepared from acetic acid extracts of lathyritic chick bone. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the extracted material demonstrated two collagenous bands of slower mobility than pepsin-extracted alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V) chains. Cyanogen bromide peptide maps of these protein bands identified them as forms of alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V). Segment long spacing (SLS) crystallite banding patterns of the acid-extracted Type V were identical within the triple-helical domain to the SLS banding patterns of pepsin-extracted Type V collagen, supporting the identification of this material. A globular domain at one end of the triple helix of the acid-extracted Type V was visualized by both rotary shadowing and negative staining of SLS crystallites. The molecular weights of the globular terminal peptides were 18,000 and 29,000, respectively, for alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after bacterial collagenase digestion of the isolated alpha chains. The results presented here indicate that fully processed Type V collagen in chick bone exists as a higher molecular weight form than that from pepsin extracts and retains a globular domain at one end of the triple helix. This is in contrast to the interstitial collagens in which only very small non-triple-helical domains (telopeptides) are retained in the fully processed molecules. In vitro aggregation studies demonstrated the intact fully processed form of Type V collagen forms uniform small-diameter fibrous structures. These results suggest that Type V collagen may be present in fibrous structures within tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1532017641,"The rate of uptake and the distribution ratio between intra- and extracellular compartments of L- and D-lactate were studied in hepatocyte preparations from fed rats. L- and D-lactate uptake apparently depended on both passive diffusion and carrier-mediated components. The apparent Km of the high-affinity carrier for L-lactate was in the range of 1.8 mM. The reciprocal competitive inhibitions between isomers of lactate suggest that L- and D-lactate might be transported by distinct carriers. Lactate transport was inhibited by various anions; pyruvate was the most potent anion, whereas only high concentrations of ketone bodies were effective. Acidic extracellular pH enhanced lactate uptake, this effect being more pronounced for L-lactate. At low pH, L-lactate was concentrated into hepatocytes, but its affinity for the carrier appeared unchanged, suggesting the existence of a process gaining energy from the pH gradient across the cell membrane. In the hypothesis of a lactate/H+ symport, the affinity for H+ was not dependent on lactate concentration and the apparent Km for H+ corresponded to a pH of 7.34. No trans-stimulation of lactate uptake after prior loading of the cells with pyruvate or lactate was observed. The present data suggest that, at physiological concentrations, lactate uptake by the liver might be largely carrier-mediated and the rate of transport across the liver cell membrane may be of a magnitude relatively comparable to the rate of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1595761021,"The kinetic mechanism of the binding and release of calcium by troponin and by the complexes troponin: tropomyosin, troponin:tropomyosin:actin, and troponin (TN)-tropomyosin (TM)-actin:myosin subfraction 1 (SF-1) was investigated using troponin labeled on the TN-I subunit with the fluorophore 4-(N-iodoac etoxyethyl-N-methyl)-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. The apparent association constant is five to 10 times smaller for TN:TM:actin compared to TN:TM or TN and saturation of actin sites with SF-1 increased the binding constant approximately to the value for TN:TM. Kinetic measurements on TN or TN:TM fitted a single rate process for association or dissociation which is consistent with a model in which the calcium sites are equivalent and independent and each calcium induces a change in structure of the complex. TN:TM:actin gave biphasic transients for association and dissociation of calcium. The two binding sites are no longer equivalent and independent. The TN:TM:actin:SF-1 complex gave kinetic behavior essentially equivalent to TN:TM. The kinetics of calcium dissociation from the various complexes was also measured by the fluorescent calcium indicator quin 2, which gave the same values for the rate constants as for the labeled protein. The evidence is interpreted in terms of a model in which regulated actin can exist in two states and the binding of each calcium and SF-1 displaces the equilibrium between states. Formation of the complex of TN:TM with actin yielded an enhancement of the fluorescence of the labeled TN-I moiety of approximately 30%. The rate of constant for association of the complex decreased 6-fold in the presence of calcium while the rate constant for dissociation of the protein complex was essentially unchanged. Saturation of actin sites with SF-1 had no effect on the rate constant for association with TN:TM in the presence of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1602195329,"A method has been developed to measure the concentration of chloroquine in lysosomes isolated from the liver of rats. It employs 3H2O and [U-14C]sucrose to determine the intralysosomal water volume of purified lysosomes obtained by free flow electrophoresis. Twelve h after a single dose, the concentration of chloroquine in lysosomes was 6.3 mM and at 24 h it rose to 16.5 mM. With continued treatment, lysosomal chloroquine concentrations were 61 and 74 mM at 48 and 72 h. The lysosomal concentrations of chloroquine attained were sufficient to block intralysosomal phospholipase A1 activity. The lysosomal content of phospholipid rises 1.7-fold and 2.6-fold over that of control at 12 and 24 h, respectively. At 72 h, lysosomal phospholipid was 3.7-fold greater than that of control. Lysosomes show an increased negative surface charge with chloroquine administration which is due in part to an increased ratio of acidic to neutral phospholipids in the lysosomal membrane. The phosphatidylinositol content of lysosomes rose rapidly with chloroquine treatment and accounted for the early increase in the ratio. Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, an acidic phospholipid synthesized only in lysosomes, increased later in the course of chloroquine treatment and accounted for the continued increase in acidic phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1585969322,"Continuous endocytosis of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) mediated by the galactosyl receptor in rat hepatocytes is a cyclic process. 125I-ASOR-receptor complexes are internalized, processed, and the ligand is degraded while the receptor is returned to the cell surface for reutilization. Since a true cycle has a thermodynamic requirement for the input of external energy, we examined the effects of changes in intracellular ATP levels on the function of the receptor cycle. Hepatocytes were depleted of ATP to various extents prior to endocytosis by incubating cells at 15 degrees C in the presence of 2 mM NaF and 0-20 mM NaN3. A luciferase-luciferin bioluminescence assay was used to quantitate the amount of cellular ATP. ATP-depleted cells were allowed to bind 125I-ASOR at 0 degrees C, washed through discontinuous Percoll gradients, and only viable cells were isolated and incubated at 37 degrees C to initiate a synchronous single round of endocytosis. The extent of internalization of this surface-bound 125I-ASOR was unaffected by an ATP depletion to less than 1% of the control level. The rate of internalization of surface-bound ligand was unaffected until the ATP levels decreased to 30% or less; at greater than 98% ATP depletion the initial rate decreased by a maximum of 55% and the kinetics became biphasic. In contrast, continuous endocytosis in the presence of excess ASOR was inhibited by only a 25% decline in cellular ATP content and demonstrated a very sharp threshold response to changing ATP levels. Continuous endocytosis, which requires receptor recycling, was completely inhibited when the total cellular ATP level decreased by only 40%. We conclude that the internalization phase of endocytosis is not dependent on ATP but that the processing and/or externalization phases of the complete receptor cycle are either directly or indirectly dependent on ATP and very sensitive to changes in cellular ATP content."

https://openalex.org/W2079009158,"The crystalline complex of pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) with oligomers of d(pA)4 has been solved by x-ray diffraction methods and refined by standard procedures to a conventional crystallographic R factor of 0.22 at 2.5 angstrom resolution. The asymmetric unit is a complex of one RNase molecule associated with four d(pA)4 oligomers. Although the DNA in this complex is segmented, and therefore shows some discontinuities, it nevertheless traces a continuous path 12 nucleotides in length that passes through the active site cleft of the enzyme and over the surface of the protein. The DNA makes a series of eight to nine electrostatic bonds between its phosphate groups and lysine and arginine residues on the protein, as well as specific chemical interactions at the active site. The path described by the sequence of nucleotides is likely to be that taken by an extended polynucleotide chain when it is bound by the enzyme."

Although some aspects of the structure conform to those seen in dehydrated specimens, novel features are apparent. The technique should permit detailed stop-motion examination of the interaction of platelets with their surrounding medium as well as exploration of the phagocytic and secretory activities of a wide variety of other cells."
https://openalex.org/W1880108033,"It is now appreciated that mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKm) may play an important role in heart high-energy phosphate metabolism and that this isozyme is solubilized in vitro by dilute solutions of Pi. Since an increase in cellular Pi is known to occur with even brief periods of myocardial ischemia, we investigated the relationship between CKm activity and myocardial performance in rabbit hearts subjected to total global ischemia. CKm activity is expressed as a ratio to mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDHm), a stable marker enzyme. A significant decline in this ratio was observed after only 10 min of ischemia, a time prior to changes in total homogenate creatine kinase activity. After 60 min of ischemia, the CKm/MDHm ratio was depressed by more than 70%. Since there was no restoration of activity following 30 min of reperfusion, we correlated changes in enzyme activity to contractile dysfunction following variable periods of total ischemia. The data showed a close correlation between the decline in the CKm/MDHm ratio and the reduction in performance, measured as left ventricular developed pressure. No correlation was observed between State 3 respiratory rates and performance. Using KCl arrest at 27 degrees C or hyperthermic ischemia at 40 degrees C, the CKm/MDHm ratio consistently correlated to the degree of postischemic functional depression, independent of the duration of ischemia. Isoenzyme electrophoresis failed to detect soluble CKm activity in the postischemic supernatant. Therefore, CKm activity appears to be altered rapidly and irreversibly by ischemia. The implications of these observations on the integration of myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1538093889,"The kinetic mechanism of calcium binding was investigated for the high-affinity calcium-magnesium sites of troponin C (TN-C), for the C-terminal fragment containing only the high-affinity sites (TR2) and for the TN-C:TN-I (where TN-I represents the inhibitory subunit of troponin) complex. Rate constants were measured by the change in fluorescence of the proteins labeled with 4-(N-iodoacetoxyethyl-N-methyl-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole at Cys 98. Rate constants for calcium dissociation were also measured using the fluorescent calcium chelating agent quin 2. Calcium binding to TR2 at 4 degrees C is a two-step process at each binding site. (formula; see text) A first order transition (k1 = 700 s-1) follows the formation of a weakly bound collision complex (K0 = 2.5 X 10(3) M-1). The two sits of the labeled protein are distinguishable because of a 2-4-fold difference in rate constants of calcium dissociation. The kinetic evidence is consistent with additive changes in structure induced by calcium binding to two identical or nearly identical high-affinity sites. The mechanism for TN-C:TN-I is similar to TR2. TN-C gave complex kinetic behavior for calcium binding but calcium dissociation occurred with the same rate constants found for TR2. Calcium binding to the high-affinity sites of TnC can be interpreted by the same mechanism as for TR2 but an additional reaction possibly arriving from calcium binding to the low-affinity sites leads to a high-fluorescence intermediate state which is detected by the fluorophore. The interactions between the two classes of sites are interpreted by a model in which calcium binding at the high-affinity sites reverses the fluorescence change induced by calcium binding at the low-affinity sites. Magnesium binding to the calcium-magnesium sites of TR2 and TN-C occurs by the same two-step binding mechanism with a smaller value for K0 and a 5-fold larger rate constant of dissociation."

https://openalex.org/W1519527617,"Cartilage proteoglycans have been well characterized in a number of developing systems, both in vitro and in vivo, but the newly synthesized molecules have been analyzed only from culture material. Because of potential culture artifacts, an attempt was made to characterize the proteoglycans newly synthesized in ovo in chick embryo sternum, tibial epiphysis, and tibial shaft. These in ovo synthesized proteoglycans share many structural features with chick proteoglycans synthesized by chondrocytes in culture including average monomer size, chondroitin sulfate chain size, keratan sulfate chain size, and the ability to aggregate with hyaluronic acid. Moreover, the newly synthesized in ovo proteoglycans, notably those of the tibial epiphysis, display reproducible changes in their structure as a function of embryonic age. These changes correlate with similar changes documented for chick cartilage proteoglycans synthesized in culture. Finally, the proteoglycans synthesized in ovo in the day 17 tibial shaft include, in addition to cartilage proteoglycans, one proteoglycan which seems to be characteristic of bone."
https://openalex.org/W2052641146,Two rare cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in children have been studied; both are associated with a previously undescribed chromosomal translocation [t(2;14) (p13;q32)]. In one patient the translocation was reciprocal and the breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurred just 5' of the C gamma 2 region on the productive immunoglobulin heavy-chain allele. The breakpoint on chromosome 2 does not involve the K locus but lies within an uncharacterized region that coincides with the position of a constitutive fragile site that occurs within normal lymphocytes. Data on the second patient are consistent with these findings and suggest that these cases represent a rare but distinct subgroup of CLL's with a specific cytogenetic change.

The results of experiments with cultured lenses, cell-free RNA translation, and Northern blot hybridization indicated a specific loss of the family of gamma-crystallin messenger RNA's in the Fraser mouse lens. Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA's from normal and Fraser mice showed no differences in gamma-crystallin coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2034898833,"In a normal bisexual laboratory strain of Drosophila mercatorum, females housed with either fertile or sterile males lay more eggs than do females housed in pairs or as isolates. Females of a derived parthenogenetic strain have suffered genetic loss of this behavioral facilitation of egg production, a loss comparable to the loss of sexual receptivity. Despite these losses there has been a large increase in fecundity in the parthenogenetic strain. These findings are compared with those in a parthenogenetic lizard."
https://openalex.org/W1495629638,"Troponin I (TnI) from rabbit white skeletal muscle was labeled at cysteines 48 and 64 with the fluorescent reagent N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. The fluorescence spectra of pyrene-labeled TnI (pyr-TnI) exhibit peaks characteristic of pyrene in its monomeric form and an additional peak resulting from formation of excited dimers (excimers), indicating that the labeled cysteines are close together. Formation of a pyr-TnI-TnC complex in the absence of Ca2+ has little effect on the spectrum, but when Ca2+ is bound to the low-affinity sites of TnC there is a substantial decrease in excimer and a corresponding increase in monomer fluorescence. The involvement of the low-affinity sites in the Ca2+-induced effect is consistent with the fact that Mg2+ has no effect on pyrene fluorescence. On rapid mixing of the pyr-TnI-TnC complex with Ca2+ in a stopped-flow apparatus, most of the excimer decrease is complete within the instrumental dead time, indicating a rate constant k greater than 350 s-1, which is comparable to that of the conformational change in TnC resulting from Ca2+ binding to the low-affinity sites. Rapid mixing of the Mg2-TnC-pyr-TnI complex with Ca2+ yields similar results, suggesting that the type of metal ion present at the high-affinity sites has little, if any, effect on the probe. It has been suggested previously that Cys 48 and 64 are located in a TnT-binding region of TnI (Chong P.C.S. and Hodges, R.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3757). Our results suggest that a Ca2+-induced structural change in the TnI-binding region of TnC could be transmitted to TnT by affecting the TnT-binding region of TnI as part of the chain of events in the regulation of muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W1527101569,"Using immunochemical techniques, we have examined the macromolecular state of association of the major heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) core proteins in mitotic HeLa cells. We find that these proteins are not free but are associated with high-molecular-weight RNA in the form of particles that sediment as a broad band between 80 and 200 S. We have termed these complexes MhnRNP for mitotic hnRNP protein-containing particles. Their quantity, composition, sedimentation coefficients, buoyant density, and sensitivity to dissociating conditions suggest that they are closely related to the hnRNP complexes of interphase cells and may represent hnRNP complexes containing unprocessed or partially processed heterogeneous nuclear RNA that have been released into the cytoplasm during mitosis. Exogenously added RNA does not associate with the MhnRNP nor does it compete for the major MhnRNP proteins. The MhnRNP remain distinct from other ribonucleoprotein complexes and do not associate with ribosomes even though these structures are not separated by a nuclear envelope during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1549227663,"Using the monoclonal antibody LICR-LON-Fib75.1 coupled to Sepharose as an affinity chromatography column, a membrane glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 18,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels has been purified from human red blood cells. The purified protein contained 25% carbohydrate by weight, the predominant sugars being galactose, mannose, and glucosamine. Amino acid analysis indicated that the protein was relatively rich in aspartate, glutamate, valine, and leucine and had a low proline and methionine content. The molecule could be removed from intact red blood cells by trypsin and could be labeled with iodine by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed cell surface iodination of red blood cells. The protein could also be labeled using the lipidsoluble photoactivatable reagent 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl) diazirine) and partitioned into the lower phase of the phase-separable detergent Triton X-114. During size-exclusion chromatography in different detergents alterations were observed in the apparent molecular weight of the protein. These results suggest that this Fib75.1-binding protein is an external red blood cell membrane glycoprotein which is capable of binding detergent. Proteins with a similar molecular weight have also been isolated from two human tumor cell lines by immunoprecipitation with this monoclonal antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1598162709,"An apparently unique isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase has been reported associated with transformation by Kirsten sarcoma virus, which was also expressed in human cancer. This isozyme was designated LDHk (Anderson, G.R., and Kovacik, W.P., Jr., (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 3209-3213; Anderson, G. R., Kovacik, W. P., Jr., and Marotti, K. R. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10583-10591). However, preparations of LDH5 from human placenta and from HeLa cells were later shown to exhibit some of the properties ascribed to LDHk9 and the identify of LDHk as a unique isozyme was questioned (Morin, M. E., and Hance, A. J., (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2864-2869). Saavadra and Anderson (Saavedra, R. A., and Anderson, G. R. (1983) Science (Wash. D.C.) 221, 291-292) refuted the arguments of Morin and Hance (Morin, M. E., and Hance, A. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2864-2869) by claiming that commercial preparations of human placental LDH5 were contaminated with LDHk. Re-evaluation of the unique properties which distinguish LDHk from conventional LDH5 indicates that the two isozymes may not be different. Highly purified preparations of LDHk exhibit a single Mr = 34,000 polypeptide subunit on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels, yet retain activity detectable as both LDHk and LDH5. Attempts to separate LDHk and LDH5 by column chromatography or by continuous electrophoresis on a variety of solid support matrices were unsuccessful. Enzyme activity identified as LDHk in imidazole-borate-buffered gels migrating toward the cathode was detected as LDH5 activity on re-electrophoresis. LDH5 activity identified by electrophoretic migration toward the anode in Tris-glycine-buffered gels also recorded as LDHk when re-electrophoresed toward the cathode in imidazole-borate-buffered gels. Quantitative assays of enzyme activity recovered from the two-gel assay systems, as well as re-electrophoresis of isozyme-enriched preparations, indicated that cross-contamination of isozymes was not responsible for the results obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1538326948,"A significant percentage of excreted ammonium is added to tubular fluid along the medullary collecting duct. However, it is not clear whether this ammonia is produced in the cortex and delivered into the medulla or is produced directly by medullary cells. To address this issue, rat epithelial cells derived from the renal papilla were grown in continuous culture and their ability to generate ammonia was examined. When grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mM glutamine, these cells produced ammonia at a rate of approximately 27 nmol/10(6) cells/h. When these cells were grown in minimum essential medium without glutamine, ammonia production fell to 7 nmol/10(6) cells/ h. Increasing the glutamine concentrations of minimum essential medium to 4 mM increased ammonia production to slightly greater than 30 nmol/10(6) cells/ h. Increasing the media concentration of glutamate, glycine, or asparagine resulted in no significant increase in ammoniagenesis. Analysis of media amino acid concentration revealed that glutamine was the main amino acid consumed while alanine was the predominant amino acid produced. The glutaminase activity of these cells appears to be primarily phosphate-dependent, similar to that observed in vitro in papillary tubules. Alterations of K+ or H+ ion concentration did not alter ammoniagenesis, but addition of 2.5 mM ammonium chloride significantly reduced net ammonia production. It is concluded that rat papillary epithelial cells have the intrinsic ability to utilize glutamine to generate ammonia and alanine. In vivo ammonia produced locally in the medulla may contribute to final urinary ammonium excretion."
