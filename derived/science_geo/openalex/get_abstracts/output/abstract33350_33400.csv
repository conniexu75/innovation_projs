https://openalex.org/W2061050157,The ubiquitin-dependent degradation of a test protein β-galactosidase (βgal) is preceded by ubiquitination of βgal. The many (from 1 to more than 20) ubiquitin moieties attached to a molecule of βgal occur as an ordered chain of branched ubiquitin-ubiquitin conjugates in which the carboxyl-terminal Gly76 of one ubiquitin is joined to the internal Lys48 of an adjacent ubiquitin. This multiubiquitin chain is linked to one of two specific Lys residues in βgal. These same Lys residues have been identified by molecular genetic analysis as components of the amino-terminal degradation signal in βgal. The experiments with ubiquitin mutated at its Lys48 residue indicate that the multiubiquitin chain in a targeted protein is essential for the degradation of the protein.

https://openalex.org/W2065549220,"Two independent cDNA clones encoding the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) were isolated from a pXM expression library made from uninduced murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The clones were identified by screening COS cell transfectants for binding and uptake of radioiodinated recombinant human erythropoietin. As inferred from the cDNA sequence, the murine erythropoietin receptor is a 507 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning domain. It shows no similarities to known proteins or nucleic acid sequences in the data bases. Although the MEL cell EPO-R has a single affinity with a dissociation constant of approximately 240 pM, the EPO-R cDNA, expressed in COS cells, generates both a high-affinity (30 pM) and a low-affinity (210 pM) receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2016410251,"Rosenthal fibers (RFs) are abnormal inclusions within astrocytes, characteristic of Alexander's disease. We have previously isolated a 22 kd protein component of RFs from Alexander's disease brain. By Western blotting, we detected its equivalent in several rat organs, with the highest level in heart, and in a human astrocytoma cell line (U-373MG). A cDNA library established from U-373MG was screened with an anti-RF protein antibody. A partial cDNA clone encoding the lens protein alpha B-crystallin was isolated. The anti-RF protein antibodies react with lens alpha B-crystallin. Furthermore, the distribution of alpha B-crystallin mRNA in rat organs is consistent with the Western blots. Therefore, alpha B-crystallin is not lens-specific and it can accumulate in large amounts in astrocytes in pathological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1668594850,"In a previous report it was shown that mammalian ribosomes were capable of initiating translation at a non-AUG triplet when the initiation codon of mouse dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) was mutated to ACG (Peabody, D.S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11847-11851). In order to assess the capacity of the mammalian translation apparatus to initiate at other non-AUG triplets, the initiator AUG of dihydrofolate reductase was converted to GUG, UUG, CUG, AGG, AAG, AUA, AUC, and AUU. These represent (with ACG) all the possible triplets that differ from AUG by only one nucleotide. The ability of each mutant to produce dihydrofolate reductase was assessed by in vitro transcription/translation of the mutant dhfr sequences under control of the bacteriophage SP6 promoter. Each of the triplets (with the exceptions of AGG and AAG) was able to direct the synthesis of apparently normal dihydrofolate reductase. Incorporation of [35S]tRNAifMet into the products of in vitro translation indicates that in each case the non-AUG triplet is able to direct initiation of the polypeptide chain with methionine. The mutant dhfr sequences were also inserted into the mammalian expression vector SVGT5 for expression in cultured monkey cells. The hierarchy of relative translation efficiencies was similar in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1564565358,"The archaebacterium, Pyrococcus furiosus, grows optimally at 100 degrees C by a fermentative type metabolism in which H2 and CO2 are the only detectable products. The organism also reduces elemental sulfur (S0) to H2S. Cells grown in the absence of S0 contain a single hydrogenase, located in the cytoplasm, which has been purified 350-fold to apparent homogeneity. The yield of H2 activity from reduced methyl viologen at 80 degrees C was 40%. The hydrogenase has a Mr value of 185,000 +/- 15,000 and is composed of three subunits of Mr 46,000 (alpha), 27,000 (beta), and 24,000 (gamma). The enzyme contains 31 +/- 3 g atoms of iron, 24 +/- 4 g atoms of acid-labile sulfide, and 0.98 +/- 0.05 g atoms of nickel/185,000 g of protein. The H2-reduced hydrogenase exhibits an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal at 70 K typical of a single [2Fe-2S] cluster, while below 15 K, EPR absorption is observed from extremely fast relaxing iron-sulfur clusters. The oxidized enzyme is EPR silent. The hydrogenase is reversibly inhibited by O2 and is remarkably thermostable. Most of its H2 activity is retained after a 1-h incubation at 100 degrees C. Reduced ferredoxin from P. furiosus also acts as an electron donor to the enzyme, and a 350-fold increase in the rate of H2 is observed between 45 and 90 degrees C. The hydrogenase also catalyzes H2 oxidation with methyl viologen or methylene blue as the electron acceptor. The temperature optimum for both H2 oxidation and H2 is greater than 95 degrees C. Arrhenius plots show two transition points at approximately 60 and approximately 80 degrees C independent of the mode of assay. That occurring at 80 degrees C is associated with a dramatic increase in H2 production activity. The enzyme preferentially catalyzes H2 production at all temperatures examined and appears to represent a new type of evolution hydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1573051141,"Abstract We have isolated cDNA clones from rat brain and human liver encoding a putative isoform of the Na,K-ATPase beta subunit. The rat brain cDNA contains an open reading frame of 870 nucleotides coding for a protein of 290 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 33,412. The corresponding amino acid sequence shows 98% identity with its human liver counterpart. The proteins encoded by the rat and human cDNAs exhibit a high degree of primary sequence and secondary structure similarity with the rat Na,K-ATPase beta subunit. We have therefore termed the polypeptides these cDNAs encode a beta 2 subunit with the previously characterized rat cDNA encoding a beta 1 subunit. Analysis of rat tissue RNA reveals that the beta 2 subunit gene encodes a 3.4-kilobase mRNA which is expressed in a tissue specific fashion distinct from that of rat beta 1 subunit mRNA. Cell lines derived from the rat central nervous system shown to lack beta 1 subunit mRNA sequences were found to express beta 2 subunit mRNA. These results suggest that different members of the Na,K-ATPase beta subunit family may have specialized functions."

https://openalex.org/W1594161662,"Overexpression of yeast DNA topoisomerase II was achieved by placing the coding sequences of the gene TOP2 downstream of an inducible promoter PGAL1 on a multicopy plasmid. By using a simple purification procedure, milligram amounts of the enzyme of a high specific activity can be obtained from a few liters of culture. In the presence of a drug VM-26 (teniposide), more than 90% of the enzyme molecules become covalently bound to DNA upon addition of the protein denaturant sodium dodecyl sulfate. The formation of the covalent complex was used to map the tyrosine residue that becomes covalently linked to DNA when the enzyme transiently breaks DNA. After exhaustive digestion of the DNA-protein complex with trypsin, a DNA-linked peptide was purified and sequenced directly to identify Tyr-783 as the active site residue."
https://openalex.org/W194459629,"Abstract The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-I and IGF-II, occur in plasma and tissue fluids complexed to specific binding proteins. Although the role of the binding proteins is not completely defined, they are capable of modulating the biological activity of the IGFs. In order to better understand the function of these proteins, we have isolated a clone from the BRL-3A rat liver cell line that encodes a protein corresponding to the IGF binding protein in fetal rat serum. The cDNA clone encodes a precursor protein of 304 amino acids (32,886 daltons), comprised of a 34-residue hydrophobic prepeptide and a 270-residue mature protein (29,564 daltons). The deduced amino acid sequence agrees with the sequence of 173 amino acid residues determined by Edman degradation. The mature protein contains 18 cysteines and no N-glycosylation sites. It contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence near the carboxyl terminus. A similar sequence is present on many extracellular matrix proteins and contributes to their recognition by cellular adhesion receptors. The cloned cDNA has been transcribed in vitro and the resulting RNA expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Injected oocytes secrete a 33-kDa protein that is immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies to the BRL-3A binding protein and binds IGF-I and IGF-II with the same affinity and specificity as does purified BRL-3A binding protein. The binding protein cDNA probe hybridizes to an approximately 2-kilobase mRNA in BRL-3A cells and in multiple fetal rat tissues including liver, kidney, intestine, and lung. Levels of this mRNA are greatly reduced in the corresponding adult tissues. The rat IGF binding protein is closely related to the partial amino acid sequences reported for a bovine IGF binding protein and more distantly related to a human IGF binding protein that recently has been cloned. No significant homologies were identified to other proteins. Thus, the rat IGF binding protein that we have cloned appears to be a distinct member of a family of related IGF binding proteins. We postulate that the structurally distinct IGF binding proteins may have different biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2032057086,"Two erbA homologs, termed ear-1 and ear-7, are present in the human genome on chromosome 17. The two genes reside in the same genetic locus with overlapping exons and are transcribed from opposite DNA strands. In addition, the ear-7 mRNA is alternatively spliced to generate two protein isoforms, namely the ear71 and ear72 proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicts that the ear71 protein is a human counterpart of the chicken c-erbA protein, a molecule closely related or identical to thyroid hormone receptor. Indeed, Scatchard analysis of proteins synthesized in vitro indicated very high affinity binding of T3 to the ear71 protein but not to the ear72 protein. Interestingly, the ear-1 gene product showed low, but appreciable, binding to T3, although its authentic ligand remains to be clarified."

https://openalex.org/W2018487148,"We have examined the developmental regulation and function of two G alpha protein subunits, G alpha 1 and G alpha 2, from Dictyostelium. G alpha 1 is expressed in vegetative cells through aggregate stages while G alpha 2 is inducible by cAMP pulses and preferentially expressed in aggregation. Our results suggest that G alpha 2 encodes the G alpha protein subunit associated with the cAMP receptor and mediates all known receptor-activated intracellular signal transduction processes, including chemotaxis and gene regulation. G alpha 1 appears to function in both the cell cycle and development. Overexpression of G alpha 1 results in large, multinucleated cells that develop abnormally. The central role that these G alpha proteins play in signal transduction processes and in controlling Dictyostelium development is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1498888463,"Abstract Integrin receptors may mediate the adhesion of cells to a number of extracellular matrix components. We found that the attachment of human melanoma cells to collagen types I and IV was blocked by antibodies to the integrin beta 1 subunit but not by peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. Ligand affinity chromatography was used to search for integrin-related receptors which mediate adhesion to native collagens. Detergent extracts of surface 125I-iodinated melanoma cells were chromatographed on type I or IV collagen-Sepharose columns. Bound material was eluted and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EDTA, but not Arg-Gly-Asp peptides, eluted a mixture of two integrin-related heterodimeric complexes. Each complex contained the integrin beta 1 chain with Mr of 110,000 and a distinct alpha chain with Mr of either 200,000 or 150,000. Immunoprecipitation with specific monoclonal antibodies identified the complexes as very late activation antigen (VLA)-1 (alpha 1 beta 1) and VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1), respectively. The binding of these receptors to collagen appeared to be specific because they failed to be retained on fibronectin- or laminin-Sepharose columns. Immunofluorescent staining of cells on collagen substrates with antibodies to VLA-1 and VLA-2 localized these complexes in vinculin-positive adhesion plaques. In contrast, the receptor complexes were not detected in adhesion plaques of cells attached to fibronectin- or laminin-coated substrates. These results indicate that melanoma cells express at least two different integrin-related collagen-binding receptor complexes that appear to mediate cell adhesion to collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1603755042,"Abstract Calcium activates, and the polyphosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) inhibit the mechanical severing of actin filaments by gelsolin. Previous work indicated that the physical state of the two phospholipids is important for their effects in this system. This study correlates tests of gelsolin's severing function with quasielastic light scattering measurements of the size of mixed lipid particles and shows that the previously demonstrated diminution of the maximal effect of PIP2 in micellar form by aggregation of the micelles or mixing with other phospholipids is not the result of an absolute requirement for small lipid particles, but rather the masking of critical sites by aggregation, by sequestration in multilamellar vesicles, or by dilution of the polyphosphoinositides below a critical concentration. Large unilamellar vesicles of PIP and, importantly, PIP2 at low molar ratios (less than 3%) in mixed lipid vesicles of composition similar to plasma membranes are as active as PIP2 micelles. Aggregation or masking of polyphosphoinositide head groups by neomycin or profilin, respectively, blocked inhibition of gelsolin. Experiments with bilayer-forming phospholipids or with Triton X-100 indicate that a critical number of PIP2 molecules may be required for incipient effects on a gelsolin molecule. The actin and polyphosphoinositide binding protein profilin competed with gelsolin for binding PIP2 with a stoichiometry also suggesting binding to multiple PIP2 molecules. The membrane constituents sphingosine and cholesterol blocked the effect of PIP2 on gelsolin when added alone, but did not affect PIP2 when incorporated into mixed lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylinositol. The results suggest that profilin, small changes in membrane lipid composition, and, especially, membrane PIP2 concentration could have large effects on the modulation of gelsolin function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1967449452,"A true Brønsted analysis of proton transfer in an enzyme mechanism is made possible by the chemical rescue of an inactive mutant of aspartate aminotransferase, where the endogenous general base, Lys258, is replaced with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Catalytic activity is restored to this inactive mutant by exogenous amines. The eleven amines studied generate a Brønsted correlation with beta of 0.4 for the transamination of cysteine sulfinate, when steric effects are included in the regression analysis. Localized mutagenesis thus allows the classical Brønsted analysis of transition-state structure to be applied to enzyme-catalyzed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1494863926,"Abstract Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase II-B appears to be adapted for function in the mammalian central nervous system via the properties of its regulatory subunit (RII-B). RII-B is selectively expressed in the central nervous system, tightly associated with cerebral cortex membranes, and avidly complexed by the bovine brain calmodulin-binding protein designated P75 (Sarkar, D., Erlichman, J., and Rubin, C. S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9840-9846). Complexes of RII-B and P75 polypeptides can be purified to near homogeneity from either membrane or cytosolic fractions of brain homogenates, suggesting that the binding protein plays a role in determining the central nervous system-specific properties of protein kinase II-B. To investigate the properties of a prototypic, nonabundant, RII-B-binding protein, we have cloned and characterized cDNAs for rat brain P150, a homolog of bovine brain P75. cDNAs were retrieved from a lambda gt11 expression library using 32P-labeled RII-B as a functional probe. cDNA inserts (800 and 1100 base pairs) subcloned into expression plasmids directed the production of partial P150 polypeptides in Escherichia coli that bind RII-B. Sequence analyses disclosed that P150 is a previously uncharacterized protein that contains multiple octapeptide repeats as well as unique sequences. Antibodies directed against 15-residue peptides corresponding to either repeated or unique sequences bound the polypeptides expressed in E. coli and a 150-kDa protein in rat brain membranes and cytosol. Moreover, the immunoprecipitated 150-kDa protein exhibited high affinity RII-B-binding activity. Finally, 3' deletion analysis demonstrated that a 15-amino acid segment of P150 is essential for binding with RII-B."
https://openalex.org/W1580110901,"Regulatory mechanisms of rat brain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) were probed using a synthetic peptide (CaMK-(281-309] corresponding to residues 281–309 (α-subunit) which contained the calmodulin (CaM)-binding and inhibitory domains and also the initial autophosphorylation site (Thr286). Kinetic analyses indicated that inhibition of a completely Ca2+/CaM-independent form of CaM-kinase II by CaMK-(281–309) was noncompetitive with respect to peptide substrate (syntide-2) but was competitive with respect to ATP. Interaction of CaMK-(281–309) with the ATP-binding site was independently confirmed since inactivation of proteolyzed CaM-kinase II by phenylglyoxal (t½ = 7 min) was blocked by ATP analog plus Mg2+ or by CaMK-(281–309). In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, CaMK-(281–309) no longer protected against phenylglyoxal inactivation, consistent with our previous observations (Colbran, R.J., Fong, Y.-L., Schworer, C.M., and Soderling, T.R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18145–18151) that binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMK-(281–309) 1) blocks its inhibitory property, and 2) enhances its phosphorylation at Thr 286. The present study also showed that phosphorylation of CaMK-(281–309) decreased its inhibitory potency at least 10-fold without affecting its Ca2+/CaM-binding ability. Thus, CaM-kinase II is inactive in the absence of Ca2+/CaM because an inhibitory domain within residues 281–309 interacts with the catalytic domain and blocks ATP binding. Autophosphorylation of Thr286 results in a Ca2+/CaM-independent form of the kinase by disrupting the inhibitory interaction with the catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1499913514,"Abstract Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a bifunctional, density-dependent regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro (at sparse densities SMC are growth-inhibited by the peptide, whereas at confluent densities TGF-beta potentiates their growth). We have used affinity labeling and ligand binding techniques to characterize cell surface receptors for TGF-beta under sparse and confluent culture conditions. Confluent SMC, whose growth are promoted by TGF-beta, exhibited a single class of high affinity TGF-beta binding sites (Kd = 6 pM, 3,000 sites/cell). In contrast, sparse SMC (whose growth are inhibited by TGF-beta) expressed two distinct classes of high affinity binding sites with binding constants of 6 pM (3,000 sites/cell) and 88 pM (11,000 sites/cell). By affinity labeling using 125I-TGF-beta and disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linking, confluent cells were found to express a major Mr = 280,000 TGF-beta receptor as well as trace amounts of low molecular weight (Mr = 85,000 and 65,000) receptor subtypes. All three of these receptors were determined, by ligand competition, to show similar affinity for TGF-beta. The predominant receptor subtypes expressed by sparse SMC exhibited apparent Mr = 75,000 and 65,000. In ligand competition experiments, the Mr = 75,000 receptor subtype (never present in confluent cultures) exhibited lower relative affinity for TGF-beta than did the Mr = 65,000 form. The ability of TGF-beta to inhibit SMC proliferation, therefore, correlates with the expression of a unique TGF-beta-binding protein on the SMC surface. The data suggest that TGF-beta may exert opposite biological effects on the same cell type via an interaction with distinct, selectively expressed receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W824303,"Thrombomodulin, an endothelial thrombin receptor, acts as a cofactor for the thrombin-catalyzed activation of anticoagulant protein C. The extracellular region of human thrombomodulin consists of three tentative domains, a NH2-terminal domain (D1), a domain involving six consecutive epidermal growth factor-like structures (D2), and an O-glycosylation-rich domain (D3). To identify the domain onto which thrombin binds, a series of recombinant proteins corresponding to the entire protein, D1, D2, D1 + D2, D1 + D2 + D3, and D2 + D3 were expressed in simian COS-1 cells. The proteins were partially purified by rabbit anti-thrombomodulin-F(ab')2-agarose chromatography. Western blotting analysis showed the expression of the respective recombinant proteins. All proteins involving D2, as well as D2 alone, had cofactor activity that allowed binding directly to thrombin, but D1 did not. The cofactor activity of the entire protein but not the mutants is increased in the presence of phospholipids and this is the only protein that binds to the phospholipid layer. These results indicate that the domain involving the epidermal growth factor-like structures of thrombomodulin is essential for thrombin binding and expression of the cofactor activity for protein C activation and that none of the extracellular domains interact with phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1974919845,"DNA molecules carrying a Mu end(s) are inefficient targets in the Mu DNA strand-transfer reaction. This target immunity is due to preferential dissociation of Mu B protein from DNA molecules that have Mu A protein bound to the Mu end; free DNA is a much poorer target than DNA with Mu B protein bound. We show that Mu B protein, which binds nonspecifically to DNA, is immobile once bound. An encounter between Mu A and Mu B proteins, bound some distance apart along DNA, is necessary to facilitate the Mu B dissociation. Experiments which show that DNA without a Mu end can acquire immunity, by catenation to DNA with a Mu end(s), are consistent with a model of Mu A-Mu B interaction by DNA looping, but not by linear movement of protein(s) along DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1557110126,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent neutrophil agonist operating through specific receptors located on the cell surface. Binding of PAF to its receptor may also stimulate further PAF synthesis, thus providing a means of amplifying the PAF signal for the cell of origin and/or other responsive cells. In this report we demonstrate that 1-O-alkyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C-PAF), a nonmetabolizable bioactive analog of PAF, stimulates human neutrophils to synthesize PAF, as detected by [3H]acetate incorporation into PAF. This approach allowed us to conclude that [3H]acetate-labeled PAF was formed from endogenous precursor rather than mere turnover of the stimulatory dose of PAF. PAF's ability to initiate further PAF synthesis was confirmed by measuring the PAF-stimulated conversion of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acylglycerophosphocholine to 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine by prelabeled human neutrophils and by determining the molecular species of 1-O-alkyl-2-[3H]acetylglycerophosphocholine produced by cells stimulated with a single molecular species of PAF (C15:0). Degradation of exogenously added [3H]PAF was not inhibited by C-PAF/5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid treatment. Thus, inhibition of PAF degradation was ruled out as the mechanism accounting for the appearance of labeled PAF in the stimulated cells. Synthesis of PAF in response to C-PAF was not dependent on cytochalasin B pretreatment but was dramatically potentiated by 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which alone was without effect. Additionally, we have demonstrated that another major arachidonate metabolite of neutrophils, leukotriene B4, stimulates PAF production. Thus, at least three products of activated neutrophils, including PAF itself, can promote PAF synthesis by these cells. This positive feedback effect may amplify autacoid production and the final cellular response."
https://openalex.org/W1529762732,"The membrane-bound form of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdInsP) kinase was purified 4,300-fold from human red blood cells to a specific activity of 117 nmol min-1 mg-1. Although this enzyme copurified with red blood cell membranes, it was solubilized by high salt extraction in the absence of detergent indicating that it is a peripheral membrane protein. The major protein seen in the most purified preparation migrated at 53,000 daltons on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The major PtdInsP kinase activity in this preparation was also coincident with this 53,000-dalton band upon renaturation of activity from SDS-PAGE. To test further whether the 53,000-dalton protein contained PtdInsP kinase activity, antibodies were prepared against the gel-purified 53,000-dalton protein. This antiserum was able to precipitate both the 53,000-dalton peptide and PtdInsP kinase activity from red blood cell membranes. The apparent size of the native enzyme in the most purified preparation was determined to be 150,000 +/- 25,000 daltons by gel filtration. This PtdInsP kinase activity was at least 100-fold more active in phosphorylating PtdInsP than phosphatidylinositol and was easily separated from the red cell membrane phosphatidylinositol kinase by salt extraction. Analysis of the reaction product, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicates that the enzyme phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate specifically at the 5'-hydroxyl of the inositol ring. The apparent Km for ATP was 2 microM, and the concentrations of Mg2+ and Mn2+ giving half-maximal activity were 2 and 0.2 mM, respectively. Mg2+ supported 3-fold higher activity than Mn2+ at optimal concentrations. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by its product, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and enhanced by phosphatidylserine."
https://openalex.org/W1494460922,"Abstract The plant photoreceptor chromoprotein, phytochrome, is rapidly degraded in vivo after photoconversion from a stable red light-absorbing form (Pr) to a far-red light-absorbing form (Pfr). Previously, we demonstrated that during Pfr degradation in etiolated oat seedlings, ubiquitin-phytochrome conjugates, (Ub-P), appear and disappear suggesting that phytochrome is degraded via a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway (Shanklin, J., Jabben, M., and Vierstra, R. D. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 359-363). Here, we provide additional kinetic and localization data consistent with this hypothesis by exploiting the unique ability to photoregulate phytochrome degradation in vivo. An assay for the quantitation of Ub-P was developed involving immunoprecipitation of total conjugates with anti-ubiquitin antibodies, followed by the detection of Ub-P with anti-phytochrome antibodies. Using this immunoassay, we found that Ub-P will accumulate to approximately 5% of initial phytochrome during Pfr degradation induced by a saturating red light pulse. Reducing the amount of Pfr produced initially by attenuating the red light pulse, lowered the amount of phytochrome degraded in the following dark period and concomitantly reduced the maximal accumulation of Ub-P. Continuous far-red irradiations that maintained only 4% of phytochrome as Pfr induced rapid phytochrome degradation similar to that induced by a red light pulse converting 86% of to Pfr. The appearance and disappearance of Ub-P were similar for each irradiation indicating that Ub-P accumulation is independent of the level of Pfr provided rapid phytochrome degradation is maintained. Pulse-chase studies employing continuous far-red light followed by darkness showed that Ub-P are continuously synthesized during phytochrome degradation and rapidly disappear once degradation ceases. Ub-P also accumulated during Pr degradation induced by the transformation of to Pfr and back to Pr. The commitment to degrade cycled and form Ub-P occurred within seconds after Pfr formation making the cause(s) underlying this phenomenon one of the fastest phytochrome reactions known. Within seconds after Pfr formation, a majority of phytochrome is also known to aggregate in vivo (previously defined as sequestered or pelletable), with aggregated phytochrome preferentially lost during phytochrome degradation. In vitro analysis of aggregated phytochrome indicated that they contain most of the Ub-P. Moreover, the appearance of Ub-P in the aggregated and soluble fractions correlated with the time that phytochrome disappeared from that fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1542044808,"Abstract We examined the effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C, on Ca2+ extrusion from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) incubated in the absence of added extracellular Na+ (Na+o). Previously, strong experimental evidence was presented that the Na+o-independent Ca2+ extrusion from VSMCs is effected by the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (Furukawa, K.-I., Tawada, Y., and Shigekawa, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8058-8065). Brief (2 min) pretreatment of VSMCs with 30-300 nM PMA suppressed the intracellular Ca2+ transient induced with 1 microM ionomycin to about 60% of the control, whereas it accelerated the concomitant Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ extrusion by up to 20%. When the Ca2+ transient was induced with 0.1 microM angiotensin II, the PMA pretreatment markedly suppressed it and reduced also the rate of 45Ca2+ efflux from cells slightly. These effects of PMA were mimicked by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, another protein kinase C activator, but were abolished by prior treatment of cells with staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, or prior long incubation of cells with PMA. Analysis of the effect of PMA on [Ca2+]i dependence of the rate of Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ efflux revealed that PMA increased the maximum Ca2+ efflux rate without a significant change in the affinity for Ca2+. These results strongly suggest that the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump in VSMCs can be stimulated by PMA and that protein kinase C is involved in regulation of [Ca2+]i in intact VSMCs."

We have asked whether IGF-II can regulate the cellular uptake of the lysosomal enzyme 125I-beta-galactosidase by modulating the binding of 125I-beta-galactosidase to the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor. We first isolated high affinity 125I-beta-galactosidase by affinity chromatography on an IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor-Sepharose column. Specific uptake (mannose 6-phosphate-inhibitable) of 125I-beta-galactosidase in BRL 3A2 rat liver cells and in rat C6 glial cells was 3.7-4.8 and 4.0-8.0% of added tracer, respectively. The cell-associated 125I-beta-galactosidase in the uptake experiments largely represented internalized radioligand as measured by acid or mannose 6-phosphate washing. The uptake of 125I-beta-galactosidase was inhibited by an antiserum (No. 3637) specific for the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor. Low concentrations of IGF-II also inhibited the uptake of 125I-beta-galactosidase. Maximal concentrations of IGF-II inhibited uptake by 73 +/- 8% (mean +/- S.D.) in C6 cells and by 77 +/- 6% in BRL 3A2 cells compared to the level of inhibition by mannose 6-phosphate. The relative potency of IGF-II, IGF-I, and insulin (IGF-II much greater than IGF-I; insulin, inactive) were characteristic of the relative affinities of the ligands for the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor. IGF-II also partially inhibited the binding of 125I-beta-galactosidase to C6 and BRL 3A2 cells at 4 degrees C and inhibited the binding to highly purified IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor by 58 +/- 14%. We conclude that IGF-II inhibits the cellular uptake of 125I-beta-galactosidase and that this inhibition is partly explained by the ability of IGF-II to inhibit binding of 125I-beta-galactosidase to the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor."

A genomic fragment that constitutes a portion of the tpa-1 gene was cloned by Tc1 transposon tagging and was used as a probe to screen a nematode complementary DNA library. One of the isolated complementary DNA clones had a nucleotide sequence that predicts a polypeptide of 526 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed that the predicted tpa-1 protein sequence is highly similar to protein kinase C molecules from various animals, including man."
https://openalex.org/W1500311438,"Abstract Immunoprecipitation of native rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of reductase kinase, revealed a major 97-kDa 32P band which disappeared upon competition with pure unlabeled 53-kDa HMG-CoA reductase. A linear correlation between the expressed/total HMG-CoA reductase activity ratio (E/T) and the fraction of 32P released from the 97-kDa enzyme established the validity of the E/T ratio as an index of HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation state in isolated microsomes. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with mevalonolactone resulted in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of microsomal reductase (decrease in E/T) followed by an enhanced rate of decay of total reductase activity which was proportional to the loss of 97-kDa enzyme mass determined by immunoblots. Inhibitors of lysosome function dampened both basal and mevalonate-induced reductase degradation in hepatocytes. In an in vitro system using the calcium-dependent protease calpain-2, up to 5-fold greater yields of soluble 52-56-kDa fragments of reductase (immunoblot and total activity) were obtained when the substrate 97-kDa reductase was phosphorylated before proteolysis. Immunoblots of unlabeled phosphorylated reductase compared with gels of immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled reductase resolved a 52-56-kDa doublet which contained 32P solely in the upper band. These data suggest that a major phosphorylation site of HMG-CoA reductase lies within the linker segment joining the membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of the native 97-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1496021072,"Abstract Peripherin, a recently described member of the intermediate filament multigene family, is present in peripheral and certain central nervous system neurons as well as in cultured neuron-like cell lines, including PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. In PC12 cells, peripherin appears to be the major intermediate filament protein and its relative levels and synthesis are specifically increased during nerve growth factor (NGF)-promoted neuronal differentiation. The present study examines the phosphorylation of peripherin and the regulation thereof by nerve growth factor and other agents in cultured PC12 cells. Immunoblotting experiments using a peripherin-specific antiserum show five distinct isoforms of this protein in whole cell and cytoskeletal extracts resolved by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three of these isoforms incorporate detectable quantities of [32P]phosphate during metabolic radiolabeling. The small proportion (approximately 6%) of total cellular peripherin that is extractable with 1% Triton X-100, does not appear to incorporate phosphate. NGF increases peripherin phosphorylation by 2-3-fold within 1-2 h of treatment. Epidermal growth factor and insulin have no effect. The relative levels of phosphorylated peripherin are markedly elevated (17-fold) by long term NGF exposure, and peripherin becomes a major cytoskeletal phosphoprotein. Activators of protein kinases A and C and treatment with depolarizing levels of K+ also enhance peripherin phosphorylation by 2-3-fold, in cultures both with and without prior long term NGF treatment. Evidence is presented that NGF regulates peripherin phosphorylation by a mechanism independent of protein kinases A and C and of depolarization. The large increase in phosphorylated peripherin brought about by NGF treatment suggests that this neuronal filament protein may play a role in the elaboration and maintenance of neurites. The presence of multiple independent pathways that acutely enhance peripherin phosphorylation indicates that this role is subject to modulation by extrinsic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2150670523,"The functional interactions of the retinal G protein, transducin, with the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) have been examined using the different purified subunit components of transducin and the native and trypsin-treated forms of the effector enzyme. The limited trypsin treatment of the PDE removes the low molecular weight γ subunit (Mr approximately 14,000) of the enzyme, yielding a catalytic moiety comprised of the two larger molecular subunits (α, Mr ≈ 85,000–90,000; β, Mr ≈ 85,000–90,000), which is insensitive to the addition of either the pure αT·GTP γ S species or the pure β γT subunit complex. However, the addition of the pure αT.GDP species to the trypsin-treated PDE (tPDE) results in a significant (90–100%) inhibition of the enzyme activity. This inhibition can be reversed by excess β γT, suggesting that the holotransducin molecule does not (functionally) interact with the tPDE. However, the inhibition by αT·GDP is not reversed by the αT·GTP γ S complex, over a range of [αT·GTP γ S] which elicits a marked stimulation of the native enzyme activity, suggesting that the activated αT species does not effectively bind to the tPDE. The αT·GDP complex also is capable of inhibiting the αT·GTP γ S-stimulated cyclic GMP hydrolysis by the native PDE. This inhibition can be reversed by excess αT·GTP γ S, as well as by βγ T, indicating that the binding site for the activated αT species is in close proximity and/or overlaps the binding site for the αT·GDP complex on the enzyme. Overall, these results are consistent with a scheme where (a) both the small and larger molecular weight subunits of PDE participate in αT-PDE interactions, (b) the activation of PDE by the αT·GTP γ S (or αT·GTP) species does not result in the complete dissociation of the γ subunit from the enzyme, and (c) the deactivation of this signal transduction system results from a direct interaction between the αT·GDP species and the catalytic moiety of the effector enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W79898328,"The plasma membrane fraction from porcine thyroid is known to exhibit an NADPH-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is utilized for the oxidative biosynthesis of thyroid hormones catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. The H2O2 formation is cyanide-insensitive, ATP-activatable, and Ca2+-dependent (Nakamura, Y., Ogihara, S., and Ohtaki, S. (1987) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 102, 1121–1132). It remains unknown, however, whether H2O2 is produced directly from molecular oxygen (O2) or formed via dismutation of superoxide anion (O2−). We therefore attempted to analyze the mechanism of H2O2 formation by utilizing a new method for the simultaneous measurement of O2− and H2O2, in which diacetyldeuteroheme-substituted horseradish peroxidase was employed as the trapping agent for both oxygen metabolites. When NADPH was incubated with the membrane fraction in the presence of the heme-substituted peroxidase, a massive O2 consumption was observed together with the formation of compound III, and O2− adduct of the peroxidase. The amounts of compound III formed and O2 consumed were stoichiometric with each other, while formation of compound II, an indicative of H2O2, was not observed during the reaction. On the other hand, when an excess amount of superoxide dismutase was included in the reaction mixture, compound II was produced with complete suppression of the compound III formation. NADH minimally supported both O2 consumption and formation of compound III or II. These results indicate that the NADPH oxidase in the plasma membrane of thyroid produces O2− as the primary metabolite of O2 and hence that H2O2 required for the thyroid hormone synthesis provided through the dismutation of O2−."
https://openalex.org/W1580329175,"The functional domains of the in situ red cell membrane calcium pump were mapped by a double labeling technique. In inside-out vesicles (IOVs) the calcium pump was phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP, the proteins blotted onto nitrocellulose and tagged by monoclonal antibodies raised against the purified pump protein. After proteolytic treatment of the IOVs by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or calpain-I, the fragmentation pattern of the enzyme was followed on the double-labeled immunoblots. The changes in the kinetics of the pump were examined by parallel measurements of the active calcium uptake in IOVs. By analysis of the results of tryptic digestion, it was possible to show that the antibodies recognized three different domains of the pump: 1) a Mr = 10,000–15,000 fragment (not seen directly) which includes the calmodulin-binding domain, 2) a nonphosphorylated Mr = 35,000 tryptic fragment, and 3) a phosphorylated fragment of Mr = 76,000–81,000. Chymotrypsin or calpain-I digestion of the membranes produced one major, Mr = 125,000 fragment, which had lost antibody-binding region 1. Production of this fragment coincided with the loss of calmodulin dependence and with a calmodulin-like activation of IOV calcium uptake (high Vmax, cooperativity in calcium activation). The Mr = 125,000 fragment was further activated by acidic lipids producing high Vmax and low K1/2 (Ca2+) with no cooperativity. Based on these data a kinetic model and a functional map of the plasma membrane calcium pump is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1498383349,"The effects of CO and O2 on the EPR spectrum of oxidized Clostridium pasteurianum hydrogenase I have been investigated both before and after prolonged exposure to white light at 8 K and 30 K. Low concentrations of O2 were found to induce analogous changes in the EPR spectrum as CO, i.e. conversion of the rhombic signal with g approximately 2.10, 2.04, 2.00, a characteristic of the novel H2-activating center in oxidized Fe-hydrogenases, to an axial signal with g approximately 2.07, 2.01, 2.01. The results suggest a common binding site and mode of coordination for CO and O2 and permit rationalization of conflicting reports from different laboratories concerning the EPR properties of oxidized Fe-hydrogenases. The CO- and O2-induced axial EPR signals were found to be light-sensitive at low temperatures. Moreover, they exhibited indistinguishable and unusual photolysis behavior with the dominant photo-product being dependent on the temperature at which illumination was performed. At 8 K, photodissociation of CO or O2 occurs, resulting in an EPR signal identical with that of the oxidized enzyme in the absence of CO or O2. However, at 30 K, the dominant photoproduct is a rhombic EPR signal with g approximately 2.26, 2.12, 1.89. While the origin of this new EPR signal is uncertain, the g-value anisotropy and relaxation characteristics resemble those of a low spin Fe(III) center. These two photoproducts cannot be thermally or photolytically interconverted, but both are quantitatively reconverted to the original axial EPR signal on warming in the dark to 200 K. A tentative working hypothesis for the nature of the H2-activating center of Fe-hydrogenases is presented that is consistent with the available physiochemical data and permits rationalization of the novel photolysis behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1498215774,"We have examined whether DNA strand exchange activities from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells or Drosophila melanogaster embryos have detectable helicase or melting activities. The partially purified recombinases have been shown to recognize homologous single strand and double strand DNA molecules and form joint molecules in a DNA strand exchange reaction. The joint molecule product consists of a linear duplex joined at one end by a region of DNA heteroduplex to a homologous single strand circular DNA. Using two different partially duplex helicase substrates, we are unable to detect any melting of duplex regions under conditions that promote joint molecule formation. One substrate consists of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 20 or 30 bases long annealed to M13mp18 circular single strand DNA. The second substrate consists of a linear single strand region flanked at each end by short duplex regions. We observe that even in the presence of excess recombinase protein or after prolonged incubation no helicase activity is apparent. Control experiments rule out the possibility that a helicase is masked by reannealing of displaced single strand fragments. Based on these findings and other data, we conclude that the human and D. melanogaster recombinases recognize and pair homologous sequences without significant melting of duplex DNA prior to strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1975841253,Tail shock produces transient presynaptic inhibition and longer lasting presynaptic facilitation of the siphon sensory neurons in Aplysia. The facilitation undergoes activity-dependent enhancement that is thought to contribute to classical conditioning of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex. Inhibition of the sensory neurons has now also been shown to undergo activity-dependent enhancement when action potential activity in the sensory neurons is paired with inhibitory transmitter. This effect appears to involve an amplification of the same cellular mechanisms that are involved in normal presynaptic inhibition. These results suggest that activity-dependent enhancement may be a general type of associative cellular mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W1533047350,"Abstract A calcium and calmodulin-regulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase has been shown to be an integral component of both rat and bovine sperm flagella. The calcium-activated enzyme was inhibited by both trifluoperazine (ID50 = 10 microM) and [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and the basal activity measured in the presence of EGTA was stimulated by limited proteolysis to that observed in the presence of calcium/calmodulin. 125I-Calmodulin binding to purified rat sperm flagella has been characterized and the flagellar-associated calmodulin-binding proteins identified by a combination of gel and nitrocellulose overlay procedures and by chemical cross-linking experiments using dimethyl suberimidate. 125I-Calmodulin bound to demembranated rat sperm flagella in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. At equilibrium, 30-40% of the bound 125I-calmodulin remains associated with the flagella after treatment with EGTA or trifluoperazine. The majority of the bound 125I-calmodulin, both the Ca2+-dependent and -independent, was displaced by excess calmodulin. A 67-kDa calmodulin-binding protein was identified by both the gel and nitrocellulose overlay procedures. In both cases, binding was dependent on Ca2+ and was totally inhibited by trifluoperazine, EGTA, and excess calmodulin. On nitrocellulose overlays, the concentration of calmodulin required to decrease binding of 125I-calmodulin by 50% was between 10(-10) and 10(-11) M. Limited proteolysis resulted in the total loss of all Ca2+-dependent binding to the 67-kDa polypeptide. Chemical cross-linking experiments identified a major calcium-dependent 125I-calmodulin:polypeptide complex in the 84-90-kDa molecular mass range and a minor complex of approximately 200 kDa. Immunoblot analysis showed that the major 67-kDa calmodulin-binding protein did not cross-react with polyclonal antibodies raised against either the calcium/calmodulin-regulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase or phosphoprotein phosphatase (calcineurin) from bovine brain."

https://openalex.org/W1596524104,"Factors affecting the efficiency of protein synthesis were analyzed in Escherichia coli. For this purpose the lacZ gene was fused to produce polypeptides from a dimer (molecular weight 229,957) to a hexamer (molecular weight 684,924) of beta-galactosidase. From pulse-chase experiments it was found that only 45% of the ribosomes which reached to the end of the first monomer were able to complete the second monomer unit. Similarly, for every addition of a monomer unit to synthesize the multimers from the trimer to the hexamer approximately half of the ribosomes failed to complete the synthesis of the added unit. Furthermore, the stability of the polypeptides decreased as their sizes increased. As a result, the overall efficiency of the production of the beta-galactosidase polymers dropped by a factor of approximately 3 on a weight basis for each addition of a monomer unit."

No other major fragments were detected when H2O2 concentration was raised or the incubation time prolonged. A 200-300-fold concentration of H2O2 was needed for a complete degradation of the protein. The degradation was inhibited or completely prevented by deferoxamine, diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid, and thiourea or by Chelex-pretreatment of the Fn solution suggesting a Fenton-type reaction to produce .OH radicals from H2O2. In immunoblotting the Mr 170,000 fragment reacted with monoclonal antibodies against the NH2 terminus and mid-molecule but not with those against the cell-binding site and the COOH terminus of Fn. Reduction of the Mr 350,000 fragment produced alpha- and beta-monomers of Fn as well as Mr 95,000 and 85,000 fragments which reacted with monoclonal antibodies against the cell-binding site and the COOH terminus of Fn. These results suggest that the Mr 170,000 fragment is derived from the NH2-terminal part of both subunits of Fn. The rest of the subunits, the Mr 95,000 (from alpha-chain) and Mr 85,000 (from beta-chain), thus remain disulfide-bonded to an intact Fn subunit to form the nonreduced Mr 350,000 polypeptide. The results show that oxygen radical action may generate defined and reproducible fragments from Fn. The high susceptibility of Fn to the radical induced degradation makes it plausible to occur also in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1552623612,"Washing thylakoid membranes with 1 M LiCl causes the release of the beta subunit from the chloroplast energy transducing complex (CF1.CF0) in spinach chloroplasts. This protein purifies by size exclusion chromatography as a 180-kDa aggregate and, thus, is probably composed of a trimer of beta polypeptides. The purified aggregate binds ADP to a high and a low affinity site with dissociation constants of 15 and 202 microM, respectively. Mg2+ is required for ADP to bind to both sites. Manganese binds to the protein in a cooperative manner to at least two sites with high affinity. The beta subunit preparation catalyzes Mg2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis at rates which are comparable to other subunit-deficient CF1 preparations and is increased by treatments known to activate the Mg2+-ATPase activity of CF1. However, Ca2+ is not an effective cofactor for this reaction and treatments which activate the Ca2+-ATPase of CF1 are either ineffective or inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W1574123559,"DNA topoisomerase I has been purified from homogenates of mature Xenopus laevis ovaries. The initial stages in purification of the native enzyme employed a rapid series of three chromatographic steps, followed by gel filtration performed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Polypeptides that might represent topoisomerase I were identified by specific labeling of the topoisomerase species with radioactive DNA. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of topoisomerase I radiolabeled with DNA identified three polypeptides with mobilities consistent with sizes of 165, 125, and 88 kDa. All three polypeptides were found to possess topoisomerase activity following elution from the gel and renaturation. Partial proteolytic digestion of the radiolabeled 165-, 125-, and 88-kDa polypeptides with Staphylococcus aureus V8 endoproteinase resulted in identical autoradiographic patterns. This suggests that the 125-kDa and 88-kDa polypeptides may be degradation products of the 165-kDa species. The 165-kDa topoisomerase I exhibited the same sensitivity to camptothecin as the total, native topoisomerase I fraction."
