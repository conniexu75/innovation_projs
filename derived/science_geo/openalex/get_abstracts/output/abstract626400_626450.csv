Understanding the factors that limit or drive land carbon storage is therefore important for improving climate predictions. One potential limiting factor for land carbon uptake is soil moisture, which can reduce gross primary production through ecosystem water stress3,4, cause vegetation mortality5 and further exacerbate climate extremes due to land-atmosphere feedbacks6. Previous work has explored the impact of soil-moisture availability on past carbon-flux variability3,7,8. However, the influence of soil-moisture variability and trends on the long-term carbon sink and the mechanisms responsible for associated carbon losses remain uncertain. Here we use the data output from four Earth system models9 from a series of experiments to analyse the responses of terrestrial net biome productivity to soil-moisture changes, and find that soil-moisture variability and trends induce large CO2 fluxes (about two to three gigatons of carbon per year; comparable with the land carbon sink itself1) throughout the twenty-first century. Subseasonal and interannual soil-moisture variability generate CO2 as a result of the nonlinear response of photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange to soil-water availability and of the increased temperature and vapour pressure deficit caused by land-atmosphere interactions. Soil-moisture variability reduces the present land carbon sink, and its increase and drying trends in several regions are expected to reduce it further. Our results emphasize that the capacity of continents to act as a future carbon sink critically depends on the nonlinear response of carbon fluxes to soil moisture and on land-atmosphere interactions. This suggests that the increasing trend in carbon uptake rate may not be sustained past the middle of the century and could result in accelerated atmospheric CO2 growth."

Genetic tumour profiling is used to classify disease and guide therapy1,2, but involves brain surgery for tissue collection; repeated tumour biopsies may be necessary for accurate genotyping over the course of the disease3-10. While the detection of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of patients with primary brain tumours remains challenging11,12, sequencing of ctDNA from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may provide an alternative way to genotype gliomas with lower morbidity and cost13,14. We therefore evaluated the representation of the glioma genome in CSF from 85 patients with gliomas who underwent a lumbar puncture because they showed neurological signs or symptoms. Here we show that tumour-derived DNA was detected in CSF from 42 out of 85 patients (49.4%) and was associated with disease burden and adverse outcome. The genomic landscape of glioma in the CSF included a broad spectrum of genetic alterations and closely resembled the genomes of tumour biopsies. Alterations that occur early during tumorigenesis, such as co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) and mutations in the metabolic genes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH21,2, were shared in all matched ctDNA-positive CSF-tumour pairs, whereas growth factor receptor signalling pathways showed considerable evolution. The ability to monitor the evolution of the glioma genome through a minimally invasive technique could advance the clinical development and use of genotype-directed therapies for glioma, one of the most aggressive human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2914940244,"Replicative crisis is a senescence-independent process that acts as a final barrier against oncogenic transformation by eliminating pre-cancerous cells with disrupted cell cycle checkpoints1. It functions as a potent tumour suppressor and culminates in extensive cell death. Cells rarely evade elimination and evolve towards malignancy, but the mechanisms that underlie cell death in crisis are not well understood. Here we show that macroautophagy has a dominant role in the death of fibroblasts and epithelial cells during crisis. Activation of autophagy is critical for cell death, as its suppression promoted bypass of crisis, continued proliferation and accumulation of genome instability. Telomere dysfunction specifically triggers autophagy, implicating a telomere-driven autophagy pathway that is not induced by intrachromosomal breaks. Telomeric DNA damage generates cytosolic DNA species with fragile nuclear envelopes that undergo spontaneous disruption. The cytosolic chromatin fragments activate the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) pathway and engage the autophagy machinery. Our data suggest that autophagy is an integral component of the tumour suppressive crisis mechanism and that loss of autophagy function is required for the initiation of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2913848851,"Oligodendrocytes wrap nerve fibres in the central nervous system with layers of specialized cell membrane to form myelin sheaths1. Myelin is destroyed by the immune system in multiple sclerosis, but myelin is thought to regenerate and neurological function can be recovered. In animal models of demyelinating disease, myelin is regenerated by newly generated oligodendrocytes, and remaining mature oligodendrocytes do not seem to contribute to this process2-4. Given the major differences in the dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation and adaptive myelination between rodents and humans5-9, it is not clear how well experimental animal models reflect the situation in multiple sclerosis. Here, by measuring the integration of 14C derived from nuclear testing in genomic DNA10, we assess the dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation in patients with multiple sclerosis. The generation of new oligodendrocytes was increased several-fold in normal-appearing white matter in a subset of individuals with very aggressive multiple sclerosis, but not in most subjects with the disease, demonstrating an inherent potential to substantially increase oligodendrocyte generation that fails in most patients. Oligodendrocytes in shadow plaques-thinly myelinated lesions that are thought to represent remyelinated areas-were old in patients with multiple sclerosis. The absence of new oligodendrocytes in shadow plaques suggests that remyelination of lesions occurs transiently or not at all, or that myelin is regenerated by pre-existing, and not new, oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis. We report unexpected oligodendrocyte generation dynamics in multiple sclerosis, and this should guide the use of current, and the development of new, therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2911446286,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors are family C G-protein-coupled receptors. They form obligate dimers and possess extracellular ligand-binding Venus flytrap domains, which are linked by cysteine-rich domains to their 7-transmembrane domains. Spectroscopic studies show that signalling is a dynamic process, in which large-scale conformational changes underlie the transmission of signals from the extracellular Venus flytraps to the G protein-coupling domains-the 7-transmembrane domains-in the membrane. Here, using a combination of X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and signalling studies, we present a structural framework for the activation mechanism of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5. Our results show that agonist binding at the Venus flytraps leads to a compaction of the intersubunit dimer interface, thereby bringing the cysteine-rich domains into close proximity. Interactions between the cysteine-rich domains and the second extracellular loops of the receptor enable the rigid-body repositioning of the 7-transmembrane domains, which come into contact with each other to initiate signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2949331393,"A gene drive biases the transmission of one of the two copies of a gene such that it is inherited more frequently than by random segregation. Highly efficient gene drive systems have recently been developed in insects, which leverage the sequence-targeted DNA cleavage activity of CRISPR–Cas9 and endogenous homology-directed repair mechanisms to convert heterozygous genotypes to homozygosity1–4. If implemented in laboratory rodents, similar systems would enable the rapid assembly of currently impractical genotypes that involve multiple homozygous genes (for example, to model multigenic human diseases). To our knowledge, however, such a system has not yet been demonstrated in mammals. Here we use an active genetic element that encodes a guide RNA, which is embedded in the mouse tyrosinase (Tyr) gene, to evaluate whether targeted gene conversion can occur when CRISPR–Cas9 is active in the early embryo or in the developing germline. Although Cas9 efficiently induces double-stranded DNA breaks in the early embryo and male germline, these breaks are not corrected by homology-directed repair. By contrast, Cas9 expression limited to the female germline induces double-stranded breaks that are corrected by homology-directed repair, which copies the active genetic element from the donor to the receiver chromosome and increases its rate of inheritance in the next generation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR–Cas9-mediated systems that bias inheritance of desired alleles in mice and that have the potential to transform the use of rodent models in basic and biomedical research. In the early embryo, Cas9 expressed in the female germline induces double-stranded breaks that are corrected by homology-directed repair, biasing inheritance of a desired allele in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2905568751,"Cells use compartmentalization of enzymes as a strategy to regulate metabolic pathways and increase their efficiency1. The α- and β-carboxysomes of cyanobacteria contain ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-a complex of eight large (RbcL) and eight small (RbcS) subunits-and carbonic anhydrase2-4. As HCO3- can diffuse through the proteinaceous carboxysome shell but CO2 cannot5, carbonic anhydrase generates high concentrations of CO2 for carbon fixation by Rubisco6. The shell also prevents access to reducing agents, generating an oxidizing environment7-9. The formation of β-carboxysomes involves the aggregation of Rubisco by the protein CcmM10, which exists in two forms: full-length CcmM (M58 in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942), which contains a carbonic anhydrase-like domain8 followed by three Rubisco small subunit-like (SSUL) modules connected by flexible linkers; and M35, which lacks the carbonic anhydrase-like domain11. It has long been speculated that the SSUL modules interact with Rubisco by replacing RbcS2-4. Here we have reconstituted the Rubisco-CcmM complex and solved its structure. Contrary to expectation, the SSUL modules do not replace RbcS, but bind close to the equatorial region of Rubisco between RbcL dimers, linking Rubisco molecules and inducing phase separation into a liquid-like matrix. Disulfide bond formation in SSUL increases the network flexibility and is required for carboxysome function in vivo. Notably, the formation of the liquid-like condensate of Rubisco is mediated by dynamic interactions with the SSUL domains, rather than by low-complexity sequences, which typically mediate liquid-liquid phase separation in eukaryotes12,13. Indeed, within the pyrenoids of eukaryotic algae, the functional homologues of carboxysomes, Rubisco adopts a liquid-like state by interacting with the intrinsically disordered protein EPYC114. Understanding carboxysome biogenesis will be important for efforts to engineer CO2-concentrating mechanisms in plants15-19."

https://openalex.org/W3098846913,"The origin of the supermassive black holes that inhabit the centres of massive galaxies remains unclear1,2. Direct-collapse black holes-remnants of supermassive stars, with masses around 10,000 times that of the Sun-are ideal seed candidates3-6. However, their very existence and their formation environment in the early Universe are still under debate, and their supposed rarity makes modelling their formation difficult7,8. Models have shown that rapid collapse of pre-galactic gas (with a mass infall rate above some critical value) in metal-free haloes is a requirement for the formation of a protostellar core that will then form a supermassive star9,10. Here we report a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of early galaxy formation11,12 that produces metal-free haloes massive enough and with sufficiently high mass infall rates to form supermassive stars. We find that pre-galactic haloes and their associated gas clouds that are exposed to a Lyman-Werner intensity roughly three times the intensity of the background radiation and that undergo at least one period of rapid mass growth early in their evolution are ideal environments for the formation of supermassive stars. The rapid growth induces substantial dynamical heating13,14, amplifying the Lyman-Werner suppression that originates from a group of young galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away. Our results strongly indicate that the dynamics of structure formation, rather than a critical Lyman-Werner flux, is the main driver of the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe. We find that the seeds of massive black holes may be much more common than previously considered in overdense regions of the early Universe, with a co-moving number density up to 10-3 per cubic megaparsec."

https://openalex.org/W2913100513,"Both inhibitory and stimulatory (known as hormesis) effects of the sublethal flupyradifurone, a butenolide insecticide, on Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were investigated for incorporating it into integrated pest management (IPM). A leaf-dip bioassay showed that flupyradifurone was very toxic against adult M. persicae with a 48 h LC50 of 8.491 mg/L. Using the age-stage two-sex life table approach, we assessed the effects of LC25 of flupyradifurone on adult M. persicae and its progeny (F1 and F2). On the one hand, aphids exposed to flupyradifurone had significantly negative effects on the life history traits acrossing the generations, such as reduced the adult longevity and fecundity of F0, shortened the duration of third instar and fourth instar nymphs, preadult period and the pre-reproductive period of F1, and decreased the reproductive days and adult longevity of F2. On the other hand, stimulatory effects on the duration of pre-adult, adult reproductive days, and reproduction of F1 were observed in the flupyradifurone-treated aphids. Consistently with the stimulation on individual traits, a higher net reproductive rate (R0) of F1 and a shorter mean generation time (T) of F2 were observed in the flupyradifurone-treated aphids, although the other population parameters including the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ) and T of F1 and R0, r and λ of F2 were not significantly affected. These results revealed that adult M. persicae exposed to sublethal concentration of flupyradifurone can induce hormetic effects on F1, and also cause negative effects on F2. Our results would be useful for assessing the overall effects of flupyradifurone on M. persicae and the hormetic effects should take into consideration when use flupyradifurone for control M. persicae."
https://openalex.org/W2907087287,"Lysyl oxidases (LOXs) play a central role in extracellular matrix remodeling during development and tumor growth and fibrosis through cross-linking of collagens and elastin. We have limited knowledge of the structure and substrate specificity of these secreted enzymes. LOXs share a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain but differ in their N-terminal region, which is composed of 4 repeats of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains in LOX-like (LOXL) 2. We investigated by X-ray scattering and electron microscopy the low-resolution structure of the full-length enzyme and the structure of a shorter form lacking the catalytic domain. Our data demonstrate that LOXL2 has a rod-like structure with a stalk composed of the SRCR domains and the catalytic domain at its tip. We detected direct interaction between LOXL2 and tropoelastin (TE) and also LOXL2-mediated deamination of TE. Using proteomics, we identified several allysines together with cross-linked TE peptides. The elastin-like material generated was resistant to trypsin proteolysis and displayed mechanical properties similar to mature elastin. Finally, we detected the codistribution of LOXL2 and elastin in the vascular wall. Altogether, these data suggest that LOXL2 could participate in elastogenesis in vivo and could be used as a means of cross-linking TE in vitro for biomimetic and cell-compatible tissue engineering purposes.-Schmelzer, C.

https://openalex.org/W2912725195,"Despite the strong association between diabetes and dementia, it remains to be fully elucidated how insulin deficiency adversely affects brain functions. We show that insulin deficiency in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice decreased mitochondrial ATP production and/or citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase activities in the cerebrum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Concomitant decrease in mitochondrial fusion proteins and increased fission proteins in these brain regions likely contributed to altered mitochondrial function. Although insulin deficiency did not cause any detectable increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission, inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters increased ROS emission and further reduced ATP production, indicating the causative roles of elevated ketones and lactate in counteracting oxidative stress and as a fuel source for ATP production during insulin deficiency. Moreover, in healthy mice, intranasal insulin administration increased mitochondrial ATP production, demonstrating a direct regulatory role of insulin on brain mitochondrial function. Proteomics analysis of the cerebrum showed that although insulin deficiency led to oxidative post-translational modification of several proteins that cause tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary degeneration, insulin administration enhanced neuronal development and neurotransmission pathways. Together these results render support for the critical role of insulin to maintain brain mitochondrial homeostasis and provide mechanistic insight into the potential therapeutic benefits of intranasal insulin.-Ruegsegger, G.

EBV encodes a large number of microRNAs, which actively participate in the development of EBV-related tumors. Here, we report that EBV-miR-BART3-3p (BART3-3p) promotes gastric cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, BART3-3p inhibits the senescence of gastric cancer cells induced by an oncogene (RASG12V) or chemotherapy (irinotecan). LMP1 and EBNA3C encoded by EBV have also been reported to have antisenescence effects; however, in EBVaGC specimens, LMP1 expression is very low, and EBNA3C is not expressed. BART3-3p inhibits senescence of gastric cancer cells in a nude mouse model and inhibits the infiltration of natural killer cells and macrophages in tumor by altering the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Mechanistically, BART3-3p directly targeted the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and caused down-regulation of p53’s downstream target, p21. Analysis from clinical EBVaGC samples also showed a negative correlation between BART3-3p and TP53 expression. It is well known that mutant oncogene RASG12V or chemotherapeutic drugs can induce senescence, and here we show that both RASG12V and a chemotherapy drug also can induce BART3-3p expression in EBV-positive gastric cancer cells, forming a feedback loop that keeps the EBVaGC senescence at a low level.

In vitro, EBV infection of B cells induces a continuous proliferation of B cells, resulting in immortal lymphoblastoid cell lines. It has been reported that EBNA3C acts as a host DNA damage response inhibitor to prevent B cell proliferation from stagnation and promote its immortalization (19Nikitin P.A. Yan C.M. Forte E.

LMP1 is present in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but only a few EBVaGC specimens expressed LMP1. This raises the question of whether EBV affects the senescence process through other molecules in EBVaGC. EBV was the first virus to be found to encode microRNAs. It encodes ∼25 microRNA precursors and 44 mature microRNAs, which are divided into two major clusters, BART and BHRF-1 (20Pfeffer S. Zavolan M. Grässer F.A. Chien M. Russo J.J. Ju J. John B. Enright A.J. Marks D. Sander C. Tuschl T.

The BHRF-1 cluster is expressed only in lytically infected cells or cells with latency type III infections (21Imig J. Motsch N. Zhu J.Y. Barth S. Okoniewski M. Reineke T. Tinguely M. Faggioni A.

EBVaGC specimens express a large number of miR-BARTs, whereas almost all EBV oncoproteins are seldom expressed (8Shinozaki-Ushiku A. Kunita A. Isogai M. Hibiya T. Ushiku T. Takada K. Fukayama M.

The genes targeted by EBV miR-BARTs are associated with oncogenesis, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and signal transductions, but many of them are also involved in tumor progression or have an impact on tumor immune response (22Albanese M.

We speculate that TP53, although not mutated, is also closely regulated in EBVaGC, and EBV-encoded miR-BARTs may contribute to p53 modulation and further affect the senescence of GC cells. In the present study, we show that EBV-miR-BART3-3p (BART3-3p), as a relatively highly expressed microRNA in EBVaGC, can promote the proliferation and inhibit the senescence of GC cells by directly targeting the CDS region of TP53 and inhibiting PTEN. By fine-tuning the two key molecules in the senescence pathway, BART3-3p promotes the development of EBVaGC. To find the EBV BART microRNAs that may regulate p53, we searched all the BART microRNA seed sequences and found that EBV BART3-3p has several binding sites that can interact with TP53. To investigate whether BART3-3p was one of the possible mechanisms for p53 inactivation or down-regulation in EBVaGC, BART3-3p mimics were transfected into two EBV-negative gastric cancer cell lines, SGC7901 and AGS. p53 and its downstream target, p21, were significantly suppressed at the protein level by BART3-3p mimics (Fig. 1A). Considering that the binding sites of BART3-3p and TP53 mRNA predicted by bioinformatics were located in the TP53 CDS region, we cotransfected BART3-3p mimics and TP53 expression vector GFP-p53, which lacked the TP53 3′-UTR and 5′-UTR, into SGC7901 and AGS cells and found that GFP-p53 was also inhibited (Fig. 1B). We also cotransfected GFP-p53 and BART3-3p mimics into the TP53-deficient cell line KATOIII, and the results further confirmed that exogenous GFP-p53 was suppressed by BART3-3p (Fig. 1C). BART3-3p mimics also significantly decreased the mRNA levels of TP53 and its target genes, CDKN1A and BAX (Fig. 1D). Further study showed that BART3-3p reduced the p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1E). To clarify whether TP53 is a direct cellular target gene for BART3-3p, luciferase reporter assays were performed by cotransfection of BART3-3p mimics with the full length of TP53 3′-UTR or CDS-containing luciferase reporter vector into HEK293 cells, respectively. The CDS but not the 3′-UTR luciferase activity was significantly reduced by BART3-3p mimics (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the CDS region of TP53 mRNA may contain the target sites directly targeted by BART3-3p. An online tool for microRNA target prediction, RNAhybrid, showed that two possible binding sites exist in the CDS of TP53 mRNA (from nucleotide positions 511 and 647, respectively) by the seed sequence of BART3-3p (Fig. 1G). The luciferase activity of the WT TP53 CDS but not the mutant CDS was significantly reduced by BART3-3p but not by negative control mimics (Fig. 1H). These results strongly suggest that BART3-3p directly binds to the TP53 CDS region and inhibits its transcription. microRNAs bind to their target genes and carry them to an RNA-induced silencing complex in which Argonaute 2 (Ago2) functions as a platform. SGC7901 cells were transfected with BART3-3p mimics, and then RNA immunoprecipitation was performed by anti-Ago2 antibody. BART3-3p mimics significantly increased the level of TP53 mRNA that binds to Ago2 compared with negative control (nc) mimics (Fig. 1I). Taken together, BART3-3p targets TP53 through binding its CDS region. We collected 20 cases of EBVaGC and 20 cases of non-EBVaGC tissue samples for analyzing the expression levels of TP53 and BART3-3p. The clinic pathological parameters of GC specimens are listed in Table S3. The diagnostic standard of EBVaGC was in situ hybridization positive EBER staining (Fig. 2A). BART3-3p can only be detected in the EBVaGC specimens (although its expression levels varied in the specimens) but not in the non-EBVaGC specimens (Fig. 2B). The average TP53 expression levels are lower in EBVaGC specimens compared with that of non-EBVaGC specimens, but the difference did not reach the significance threshold (p = 0.1785; Fig. 2C). We used the χ2 test to analyze the correlation between the expression levels of BART3-3p and TP53 in EBVaGC specimens. We divided the 20 cases of EBVaGC into two groups, BART3-3p high and BART3-3p low, as well as into TP53 high and TP53 low groups (see “Experimental procedures” for details). The χ2 test showed that BART3-3p in EBVaGC was negatively correlated with TP53 (p < 0.01; Fig. 2D). The above clinical specimen data suggest a possibility that BART3-3p is involved in the regulation of TP53 expression in EBVaGC. We next investigated the function of BART3-3p in the context of tumor biology in GC cells. BART3-3p mimics were transfected into SGC7901 and AGS cell lines. Colony formation (Fig. 3A) and CCK8 assays (Fig. 3B) demonstrated that expression of BART3-3p can increase the proliferation ability of GC cells compared with the negative control. To study whether BART3-3p promotes gastric cancer growth in vivo, we established a xenograft mouse model. SGC7901 cells were transfected with b3-3p agomir or nc agomir for 12 h and then transplanted into the liver capsule of nude mice. b3-3p agomir or nc agomir was injected into corresponding groups of nude mice through their tail veins on days 7 and 14. All mice were sacrificed on day 28 (Fig. 3C). Both groups had one to several transplanted tumors in the livers, and the average tumor volumes of the b3-3p agomir group was larger than that of the nc group (Fig. 3D). To verify the results, we expressed BART3-3p in SGC7901 and AGS cells by lentivirus-mediated transduction and named the cells as SGC7901 LV-b3-3p and AGS LV-b3-3p (Fig. S1A). Compared with their respective controls, p53 of these two cell lines was decreased (Fig. S1B). BART3-3p inhibitor increased the expression of p53 and its downstream target, p21 protein, in both of the cell lines (Fig. S1C). Consistent with the above results, BART3-3p inhibitor can reverse the cell proliferation induced by BART3-3p in SGC7901 LV-b3-3p and AGS LV-b3-3p cell lines (Fig. 3E). The CCK8 assay also showed the same function of BART3-3p inhibitor in cell proliferation in SGC7901 LV-b3-3p and AGS LV-b3-3p cells (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that BART3-3p promotes the proliferation of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. p53 and PTEN are the two master regulators in the senescence pathway. In addition to directly targeting TP53, we also observed that PTEN was inhibited by BART3-3p both at the protein and mRNA levels but not through a direct targeting relationship (Fig. S2). We proposed that BART3-3p may take part in the regulation of cell senescence. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used irinotecan (a chemotherapeutic drug) and RASG12V plasmid to induce either TIS (26Chien Y. Scuoppo C. Wang X. Fang X. Balgley B. Bolden J.E. Premsrirut P. Luo W.

Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88 (9054499): 593-60210.1016/S0092-8674(00)81902-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) in SGC7901 LV-b3-3p/SGC7901 LV-nc cells. Both irinotecan and RASG12V significantly induced senescence in SGC7901 LV-nc cells, but their effects were compromised in the SGC7901 LV-b3-3p cells as assessed by senescence-associated β-gal (SA-β-gal) activity (Fig. 4, A and B). EBV-encoded oncoprotein LMP1 has been reported to inhibit senescence (18Yang X. He Z. Xin B. Cao L. LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus suppresses cellular senescence associated with the inhibition of p16INK4a expression.Oncogene. 2000; 19 (10803461): 2002-201310.1038/sj.onc.1203515Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), so we transfected LMP1 into SGC7901 cell line and found that LMP1’s effect on senescence is similar to that of BART3-3p (Fig. 4, C and D). Irinotecan or RASG12V up-regulated p53 protein levels, whereas BART3-3p reversed this effect (Fig. 4E). We next examined the SASP cytokines by qRT-PCR. Cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) as well as MMP1 and CDK4 were repressed by BART3-3p (Fig. 4F). The IL-6 protein secreted by GC cells is also inhibited by BART3-3p (Fig. 4G). Luciferase reporter assay determined that BART3-3p can inhibit the transcription activity of NF-κB but not that of STAT3, and NF-κB is the master transcriptional factor that promotes the secretory activity of senescent cells (Fig. 4H). BART3-3p can inhibit the RASG12V-induced senescence in the human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 (Fig. S3). In addition to LMP1, EBV-encoded EBNA3C also can inhibit B-cell senescence (19Nikitin P.A. Yan C.M. Forte E. Bocedi A. Tourigny J.P. White R.E. Allday M.J. Patel A. Dave S.S. Kim W. Hu K. Guo J.

However, EBNA3C is not expressed in EBVaGC, and LMP1 expression has been negative in most EBVaGC specimens (7Luo B. Wang Y. Wang X.F. Liang H. Yan L.P. Huang B.H. Zhao P. Expression of Epstein-Barr virus genes in EBV-associated gastric carcinomas.World J.

Epstein-Barr virus promotes epithelial cell growth in the absence of EBNA2 and LMP1 expression.J. Virol. 1999; 73 (9882333): 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cancer Genome Atlas data from 295 GC specimens further confirm this result (6Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of gastric adenocarcinoma.Nature. 2014; 513 (25079317): 202-20910.1038/nature13480Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar). Here, we also determined the expression levels of LMP1 and EBNA3C in 20 cases of EBVaGC and 20 cases of non-EBVaGC tissue samples and found that only three cases of EBVaGC had LMP1 expression, whereas in the remaining samples we were unable to detect LMP1 and EBNA3C expression (Fig. 4I). These results imply the importance of BART3-3p in senescence in EBVaGC because there is very limited expression of LMP1 and EBNA3C in these cancers. The in vitro study showed a consistent effect of BART3-3p on cell senescence. We then examined the in vivo effect of this discovery by xenografting SGC7901 cells into nude mice (under their liver capsule). Mice were randomly divided into two groups; one was treated with b3-3p agomir, and the other was treated with nc agomir. All mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks, and the tumors were stripped from the liver. SA-β-gal staining showed that the number of senescent cells in the b3-3p agomir group was less than that in the nc agomir group (Fig. 5A). The expression levels of TP53, CDKN1A, CDK4, and SASP cytokines (IL-1A, IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8) were decreased in the b3-3p agomir group compared with the nc group (Fig. 5B). The number of NK cells and macrophages that infiltrated the tumor tissues of the b3-3p agomir group was reduced compared with the nc group as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5C), but the number of macrophages that infiltrated the livers was not different between the two groups (Fig. S4). These results suggest that BART3-3p can inhibit senescence in vivo and possibly reduce the recruitment of immune cells by down-regulating important SASP molecules, thus inhibiting the antitumor immune response. It has been reported that activation of NF-κB can increase the expression of a variety of EBV microRNAs (29Verhoeven R.J. Tong S. Zhang G. Zong J. Chen Y. Jin D.Y. Chen M.R. Pan J. Chen H. NF-κB signaling regulates expression of Epstein-Barr virus BART microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.J. Virol. 2016; 90 (27147748): 6475-648810.1128/JVI.00613-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because RASG12V and chemotherapy can activate the NF-κB pathway (26Chien Y. Scuoppo C. Wang X. Fang X. Balgley B. Bolden J.E. Premsrirut P. Luo W. Chicas A. Lee C.S. Kogan S.C. Lowe S.W.

We noticed that both RASG12V and irinotecan can activate NF-κB signaling, and the activation was compromised by the addition of BAY 11-7028 (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that RASG12V and chemotherapy can increase the expression of BART3-3p, most likely by activating NF-κB signaling. In the AGS-EBV cells, when b3-3p inhibitors were introduced, the RASG12V-induced senescence was significantly enhanced (Fig. 6C). This result suggests that although RASG12V can induce cancer cell senescence it also can induce BART3-3p expression, and BART3-3p can inhibit senescence; therefor"

Materials and methods The 10-Item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) questionnaire was sent to 1,000 independent older people and 2,000 dependent older people living at home in a municipal district of Tokyo, Japan. The participants were selected by stratified randomization according to age and care level. We set the cut-off value of EAT-10 at a score of ≥3. The percentage of participants with an EAT-10 score ≥3 was defined as the prevalence of suspected dysphagia. The chi-square test was used for analyzing prevalence in each group. Analysis of the distribution of EAT-10 scores, and comparisons among items, age groups, and care levels to identify symptom features were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results Valid responses were received from 510 independent older people aged 65 years or older (mean age 75.0 ± 7.2) and 886 dependent older people (mean age 82.3 ± 6.7). The prevalences of suspected dysphagia were 25.1% and 53.8%, respectively, and showed significant increases with advancing age and care level. In both groups, many older people assigned high scores to the item about coughing, whereas individuals requiring high-level care assigned higher scores to the items about not only coughing but also swallowing of solids and quality of life. Conclusion In independent people, approximately one in four individuals showed suspected dysphagia and coughing was the most perceivable symptom. In dependent people, approximately one in two individuals showed suspected dysphagia and their specifically perceivable symptoms were coughing, difficulties in swallowing solids and psychological burden."
https://openalex.org/W2914907667,"Introduction The global spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) complicates treatment and isolation measures in hospitals and has shown to increase mortality. Patients with disease- or therapy-related immunodeficiency are especially at risk for fatal infections caused by MDRO. The impact of MDRO colonization on the clinical course of AML patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy—a potentially curative but highly toxic treatment option—has not been systematically studied. Materials & methods 312 AML patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy between 2007 and 2015 were examined for MDRO colonization. Patients with evidence for MDRO before or during the hospital stay of induction chemotherapy were defined as colonized, patients who never had a positive swab for MDRO were defined as noncolonized. Results Of 312 AML patients 90 were colonized and 130 were noncolonized. Colonized patients suffered from significantly more days with fever, spent more days on the intensive care unit and had a higher median C-reactive protein value during the hospital stay. These findings did not result in a prolonged length of hospital stay or an increased mortality rate for colonized patients. However, in a subgroup analysis, patients colonized with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) had a significantly reduced 60- and 90-day, as well as 1- and 2-year survival rates when compared to noncolonized patients. Conclusion Our analysis highlights the importance of intensive MDRO screening especially in patients with febrile neutropenia since persisting fever can be a sign of MDRO-colonization. CRE-colonized patients require special surveillance, since they seem to be at risk for death."
https://openalex.org/W2913725229,"Circulating biomarkers available in clinical practice do not allow to stratify patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) prior the onset of a clinically relevant event. We evaluated the methylation status of specific genomic segments and gene expression in peripheral blood of patients undergoing Cardiac Computed Tomography (CCT) for CHD (n = 95). We choose to investigate cholesterol metabolism. Methylation and gene expression of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), sterol regulatory element-binding factor 2 (SREBF2) and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Calcium score (CACS), stenosis degree, total plaque volume (TPV), calcified plaque volume (CPV), non-calcified plaque volume (NCPV) and plaque burden (PB) were assessed in all CHD patients (n = 65). The percentage of methylation at the specific analyzed segment of LDLR promoter was higher in CHD patients vs healthy subjects (HS) (n = 30) (p = 0.001). LDLR, SREBF2 and ABCA1 mRNAs were up-regulated in CHD patients vs HS (p = 0.02; p = 0.019; p = 0.008). SREBF2 was overexpressed in patients with coronary stenosis ≥50% vs subjects with stenosis <50% (p = 0.036). After adjustment for risk factors and clinical features, ABCA1 (p = 0.005) and SREBF2 (p = 0.010) gene expression were identified as independent predictors of CHD and severity. ROC curve analysis revealed a good performance of ABCA1 on predicting CHD (AUC = 0.768; p<0.001) and of SREBF2 for the prediction of disease severity (AUC = 0.815; p<0.001). Moreover, adjusted multivariate analysis demonstrated SREBF2 as independent predictor of CPV, NCPV and TPV (p = 0.022; p = 0.002 and p = 0.006) and ABCA1 as independent predictor of NCPV and TPV (p = 0.002 and p = 0.013). CHD presence and characteristics are related to selected circulating transcriptional and epigenetic-sensitive biomarkers linked to cholesterol pathway. More extensive analysis of CHD phenotypes and circulating biomarkers might improve and personalize cardiovascular risk stratification in the clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2914027553,"Abstract Melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm with increasing incidence that is classified by the NCI as a recalcitrant cancer, i.e., a cancer with poor prognosis, lacking progress in diagnosis and treatment. In addition to conventional therapy, melanoma treatment is currently based on targeting the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and immune checkpoints. As drug resistance remains a major obstacle to treatment success, advanced therapeutic approaches based on novel targets are still urgently needed. We reasoned that the base excision repair enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) could be such a target for its dual role in safeguarding the genome and the epigenome, by performing the last of the multiple steps in DNA demethylation. Here we show that TDG knockdown in melanoma cell lines causes cell cycle arrest, senescence, and death by mitotic alterations; alters the transcriptome and methylome; and impairs xenograft tumor formation. Importantly, untransformed melanocytes are minimally affected by TDG knockdown, and adult mice with conditional knockout of Tdg are viable. Candidate TDG inhibitors, identified through a high-throughput fluorescence-based screen, reduced viability and clonogenic capacity of melanoma cell lines and increased cellular levels of 5-carboxylcytosine, the last intermediate in DNA demethylation, indicating successful on-target activity. These findings suggest that TDG may provide critical functions specific to cancer cells that make it a highly suitable anti-melanoma drug target. By potentially disrupting both DNA repair and the epigenetic state, targeting TDG may represent a completely new approach to melanoma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2914434089,"Understanding of genetic diversity is important to explore existing gene in any crop breeding program. Most of the diversity preserved in the landraces which are well-known reservoirs of important traits for biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, the genetic diversity at twenty-four most significant blast resistance gene loci using twenty-eight gene specific markers were investigated in landraces originated from nine diverse rice ecologies of India. Based on phenotypic evaluation, landraces were classified into three distinct groups: highly resistant (21), moderately resistant (70) and susceptible (70). The landraces harbour a range of five to nineteen genes representing blast resistance allele with the frequency varied from 4.96% to 100%. The cluster analysis grouped entire 161 landraces into two major groups. Population structure along with other parameters was also analyzed to understand the evolution of blast resistance gene in rice. The population structure analysis and principal coordinate analysis classified the landraces into two sub-populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed maximum (93%) diversity within the population and least (7%) between populations. Five markers viz; K3957, Pikh, Pi2-i, RM212and RM302 were strongly associated with blast disease with the phenotypic variance of 1.4% to 7.6%. These resistant landraces will serve as a valuable genetic resource for future genomic studies, host-pathogen interaction, identification of novel R genes and rice improvement strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2912818628,"All organisms begin protein synthesis with methionine (Met). The resulting initiator Met of nascent proteins is irreversibly processed by Met aminopeptidases (MetAPs). N-terminal (Nt) Met excision (NME) is an evolutionarily conserved and essential process operating on up to two-thirds of proteins. However, the universal function of NME remains largely unknown. MetAPs have a well-known processing preference for Nt-Met with Ala, Ser, Gly, Thr, Cys, Pro, or Val at position 2, but using CHX-chase assays to assess protein degradation in yeast cells, as well as protein-binding and RT-qPCR assays, we demonstrate here that NME also occurs on nascent proteins bearing Met–Asn or Met–Gln at their N termini. We found that the NME at these termini exposes the tertiary destabilizing Nt residues (Asn or Gln) of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, which degrades proteins according to the composition of their Nt residues. We also identified a yeast DNA repair protein, MQ-Rad16, bearing a Met–Gln N terminus, as well as a human tropomyosin–receptor kinase–fused gene (TFG) protein, MN-TFG, bearing a Met–Asn N terminus as physiological, MetAP-processed Arg/N-end rule substrates. Furthermore, we show that the loss of the components of the Arg/N-end rule pathway substantially suppresses the growth defects of naa20Δ yeast cells lacking the catalytic subunit of NatB Nt acetylase at 37 °C. Collectively, the results of our study reveal that NME is a key upstream step for the creation of the Arg/N-end rule substrates bearing tertiary destabilizing residues in vivo. All organisms begin protein synthesis with methionine (Met). The resulting initiator Met of nascent proteins is irreversibly processed by Met aminopeptidases (MetAPs). N-terminal (Nt) Met excision (NME) is an evolutionarily conserved and essential process operating on up to two-thirds of proteins. However, the universal function of NME remains largely unknown. MetAPs have a well-known processing preference for Nt-Met with Ala, Ser, Gly, Thr, Cys, Pro, or Val at position 2, but using CHX-chase assays to assess protein degradation in yeast cells, as well as protein-binding and RT-qPCR assays, we demonstrate here that NME also occurs on nascent proteins bearing Met–Asn or Met–Gln at their N termini. We found that the NME at these termini exposes the tertiary destabilizing Nt residues (Asn or Gln) of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, which degrades proteins according to the composition of their Nt residues. We also identified a yeast DNA repair protein, MQ-Rad16, bearing a Met–Gln N terminus, as well as a human tropomyosin–receptor kinase–fused gene (TFG) protein, MN-TFG, bearing a Met–Asn N terminus as physiological, MetAP-processed Arg/N-end rule substrates.

As the pharmacist is often the first and only point of reference for people complaining of headache, we carried out a survey in a nationwide sample of Italian pharmacies, in order to describe the distribution of migraine or non-migraine type headaches and medicines overuse among people entering pharmacies seeking for self-medication; and to evaluate the association, in particular of migraine, with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and with the pathway of care followed by the patients. A 14-item questionnaire, including socio-demographic and clinical factors, was administered by trained pharmacists to subjects who entered a pharmacy requesting self-medication for a headache attack. The ID Migraine™ Screener was used to classify headache sufferers in four classes. From June 2016 to January 2017, 4424 people have been interviewed. The prevalence of definite migraines was 40%, significantly higher among women and less educated people. About half of all headache sufferers and a third of migraineurs do not consider their condition as a disease and are not cared by any doctor. Among people seeking self-medication in pharmacies for acute headache attacks, the rate of definite or probable migraine is high, and a large percentage of them is not correctly diagnosed and treated. The pharmacy can be a valuable observatory for the study of headaches, and the first important step to improve the quality of care delivered to these patients."

Here, we show that roseltide rT1 is also a cell-penetrating, mitochondria-targeting peptide that increases ATP production. Results from flow cytometry, live-cell imaging, pulldown assays, and genetically-modified cell lines supported that roseltide rT1 enters cells via glycosaminoglycan-dependent endocytosis, and enters the mitochondria through TOM20, a mitochondrial protein import receptor. We further showed that roseltide rT1 increases cellular ATP production via mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. Using biotinylated roseltide rT1 for target identification and proteomic analysis, we showed that human mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase subunit O is an intramitochondrial target.

The longitudinal burden of these injuries through readmissions is currently underestimated. We aimed to determine the 6-month readmission risk and hospital costs for patients injured by firearms.We used the Nationwide Readmission Database 2010-2015 to assess the frequency of readmissions at 6 months, and hospital costs associated with readmissions for patients with firearm-related injuries. We produced nationally representative estimates of readmission risks and costs.Of patients discharged following a firearm injury, 15.6% were readmitted within 6 months. The average annual cost of inpatient hospitalizations for firearm injury was over $911 million, 9.5% of which was due to readmissions. Medicare and Medicaid covered 45.2% of total costs for the 5 years, and uninsured patients were responsible for 20.1%.From 2010-2015, the average total cost of hospitalization for firearm injuries per patient was $32,700, almost 10% of which was due to readmissions within 6 months.

https://openalex.org/W2911890512,"Hydropeaking is the rapid change in the water flow downstream of a hydropower plant, driven by changes in daily electricity demand. These fluctuations may produce negative effects in freshwater fish. To minimize these impacts, previous studies have proposed habitat enhancement structures as potential mitigation measures for salmonids. However, the recommendation of these mitigation measures for cyprinids remains scarce and their effects unknown. In this study, the effects of potential habitat mitigation structures under simulated hydropeaking and base-flow conditions are examined for Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) in an indoor flume. Solid triangular pyramids and v-shaped structures were evaluated as potential flow-refuging areas and compared with a configuration without structures. A novel, interdisciplinary approach is applied to investigate individual and group responses to rapidly changing flows, by assessing physiological (glucose and lactate), movement behaviour (structure use, sprints and drifts) and the pressure distribution using a fish-inspired artificial lateral line flow sensor. The major findings of this study are four-fold: 1) Under hydropeaking conditions, the v-shaped structures triggered a lactate response and stimulated individual structure use, whereas solid structures did not elicit physiological adjustments and favoured individual and group structure use. Overall, both solid structures and their absence stimulated sprints and drifts. 2) The hydrodynamic conditions created in hydropeaking did not always reflect increased physiological responses or swimming activity. 3) Each event-structure combination resulted in unique hydrodynamic conditions which were reflected in the different fish responses. 4) The most relevant flow variable measured was the pressure asymmetry, which is caused by the vortex size and shedding frequency of the structures. Considering the non-uniform nature of hydropeaking events, and the observation that the fish responded differently to specific flow event-structure combinations, a diverse set of instream structures should be considered for habitat-based hydropeaking mitigation measures for Iberian barbel."
https://openalex.org/W2911404092,"Many diseases and conditions decrease the ability to control balance. In clinical settings, there is therefore a major interest in the assessment of postural control. Trunk accelerometry is an easy, low-cost method used for balance testing and constitutes an alternative method to the posturography using force platforms. The objective was to assess the responsiveness of accelerometry in a battery of 12 quiet standing tasks. We evaluated the balance of 100 healthy adults with an accelerometer fixed onto the sternum. We used the average amplitude of acceleration as an indirect measure of postural sways. The tasks of increased difficulty were realized with or without vision. The battery of tasks was repeated four times on two different days to assess reliability. We analyzed the extent to which the task difficulty and the absence of vision affected the trunk sway. The influence of individual characteristics (age, height, mass, sex, and physical activity level) was also assessed. The reliability analysis revealed that four repetitions of the battery of tasks are needed to reach a high accuracy level (mean ICC = 0.85). The results showed that task difficulty had a very large effect on trunk sways and that the removal of vision further increased sways. Concerning the effects of individual characteristics, we observed that women tended to oscillate more than men did in tasks of low difficulty. Age and physical activity level also had significant effects, whereas height and mass did not. In conclusion, age, sex, and physical fitness are confounders that should be considered when assessing patients’ balance. A battery of simple postural tasks measured by upper-trunk accelerometry can be a useful method for simple balance evaluation in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2913912451,"In alpine habitats, the seasonally marked climatic conditions generate seasonal and spatial differences in forage availability for herbivores. Vegetation availability and quality during the growing season are known to drive life history traits of mountain ungulates. However, little effort has been made to understand the association between plant phenology and changes in the foraging strategies of these mountain dwellers. Furthermore, this link can be affected by the seasonal presence of livestock in the same meadows. The objective of this work was to study the seasonal changes in diet composition of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra p. pyrenaica) and its relationship to primary production trends in a Mediterranean alpine environment. Moreover, diet composition in two populations with contrasting livestock pressure was compared in order to study the effect of sheep flocks on the feeding behaviour of chamois. From 2009 to 2012, monthly diet composition was estimated by cuticle microhistological analysis of chamois faeces collected in the eastern Pyrenees. The primary production cycle was assessed by remote sensing, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Additionally, the diet of sheep sharing seasonally the subalpine and alpine meadows with chamois was analysed. Diet selection of chamois and sheep and their overlap was also assessed. Our results show an intra-annual variation in the diet composition of Pyrenean chamois and demonstrate a strong relationship between plant consumption dynamics and phenology in alpine areas. In addition, Calluna vulgaris, Cytisus spp. and Festuca spp., as well as forbs in the summer, are found to be key forage species for Pyrenean chamois. Furthermore, this study couldn’t detect differences between both chamois populations despite the presence of sheep flocks in only one area. However, the detection of a shift in the diet of chamois in both areas after the arrival of high densities of multi-specific livestock suggest a general livestock effect. In conclusion, Pyrenean chamois are well adapted to the variations in the seasonal availability of plants in alpine habitats but could be disturbed by the seasonal presence of livestock. Due to the key plants in their diet, we suggest that population management programmes should focus on the preservation of mixed grasslands composed of patches of shrubs and herbs. The effects of climate change and shrub expansion should be studied as they may potentially affect chamois population dynamics through changes in habitat composition and temporal shifts in forage availability."
https://openalex.org/W2912271176,"Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside-binding lectin which is important in cell proliferation and apoptotic regulation. Recently, serum galectin-3 has been shown to have prognostic value as a biomarker in heart failure. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can cause severe myocarditis, congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy as well as encephalitis in various animals including mice. The pathophysiological role of galectin-3 in acute myocarditis following viral infection is not fully understood. The goal of this study is to determine the cardiac localization and the time-course of galectin-3 expression in heart failure after viral inoculation with EMCV. At 12, 24, 48, 96 hours, 7 and 10 days after intraperitoneal EMCV inoculation, animals were examined histologically and analyzed for the expression of galectin-3 and Iba1. Galectin-3 was up-regulated in degenerated fibrotic lesions of cardiac tissues 96 hours after viral inoculation and were followed by myocardial fibrosis. At the same time, Iba1 positive macrophages were observed within the inflammatory sites. A time-course correlation between the number of galectin-3 positive cells and the cardiac area of degenerated fibrotic lesions was detected—serum galectin-3 increased at 96 hours and correlated well with the number of cardiac galectin-3 positive cells. Our results indicate that galectin-3 expression may be a useful biomarker of cardiac fibrotic degeneration in acute myocarditis following viral infection. In addition, measuring serum galectin-3 levels might be an early diagnostic method for detecting cardiac degeneration in acute myocarditis."

These fungi are found in high density in human-affected areas such as sewage-contaminated water, and five species, namely Scedosporium apiospermum, S. boydii, S. aurantiacum, S. dehoogii, and S. minutisporum, cause human infections. Thailand is a popular travel destination in the world, with many attractions present in densely populated areas; thus, large numbers of people may be exposed to pathogens present in these areas. We conducted a comprehensive survey of Scedosporium species in 350 soil samples obtained from 35 sites of high human population density and tourist popularity distributed over 23 provinces and six geographic regions of Thailand. Soil suspensions of each sample were inoculated on three plates of Scedo-Select III medium to isolate Scedosporium species. In total, 191 Scedosporium colonies were isolated from four provinces. The species were then identified using PCR and sequencing of the beta-tubulin (BT2) gene. Of the 191 isolates, 188 were S. apiospermum, one was S. dehoogii, and species of two could not be exactly identified. Genetic diversity analysis revealed high haplotype diversity of S. apiospermum. Soil is a major ecological niche for Scedosporium and may contain S. apiospermum populations with high genetic diversity. This study of Scedosporium distribution might encourage health care providers to consider Scedosporium infection in their patients."
https://openalex.org/W2912531000,"The mycobacterial type VII secretion system ESX-1 is responsible for the secretion of a number of proteins that play important roles during host infection. The regulation of the expression of secreted proteins is often essential to establish successful infection. Using transcriptome sequencing, we found that the abrogation of ESX-1 function in Mycobacterium marinum leads to a pronounced increase in gene expression levels of the espA operon during the infection of macrophages. In addition, the disruption of ESX-1-mediated protein secretion also leads to a specific down-regulation of the ESX-1 substrates, but not of the structural components of this system, during growth in culture medium. This effect is observed in both M. marinum and M. tuberculosis. We established that down-regulation of ESX-1 substrates is the result of a regulatory process that is influenced by the putative transcriptional regulator whib6, which is located adjacent to the esx-1 locus. In addition, the overexpression of the ESX-1-associated PE35/PPE68 protein pair resulted in a significantly increased secretion of the ESX-1 substrate EsxA, demonstrating a functional link between these proteins. Taken together, these data show that WhiB6 is required for the secretion-dependent regulation of ESX-1 substrates and that ESX-1 substrates are regulated independently from the structural components, both during infection and as a result of active secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2912676157,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is located in fungal vacuolar membranes. It is involved in multiple cellular processes, including the maintenance of intracellular ion homeostasis by maintaining acidic pH within the cell. The importance of V-ATPase in virulence has been demonstrated in several pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans. However, it remains to be determined in the clinically important fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. Increasing multidrug resistance of C. glabrata is becoming a critical issue in the clinical setting. In the current study, we demonstrated that the plecomacrolide V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin B1 exerts a synergistic effect with azole antifungal agents, including fluconazole and voriconazole, against a C. glabrata wild-type strain. Furthermore, the deletion of the VPH2 gene encoding an assembly factor of V-ATPase was sufficient to interfere with V-ATPase function in C. glabrata, resulting in impaired pH homeostasis in the vacuole and increased sensitivity to a variety of environmental stresses, such as alkaline conditions (pH 7.4), ion stress (Na+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ stress), exposure to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 and antifungal agents (azoles and amphotericin B), and iron limitation. In addition, virulence of C. glabrata Δvph2 mutant in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis was reduced in comparison with that of the wild-type and VPH2-reconstituted strains. These findings support the notion that V-ATPase is a potential attractive target for the development of effective antifungal strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2912169597,"Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are able to transport hydrophilic molecules inside cells. To reach the cytosol, the peptide associated with a cargo must cross the plasma or the endosomal membrane. Different molecular mechanisms for peptide internalisation into cells have been proposed and it is becoming clear that the cellular internalisation mechanisms are different depending on the peptide sequence and structure and the target membrane. Herein, the penetration of three peptides into large unilamellar vesicles were studied: the homeodomain derived 16-residues penetratin, nona-arginine (R9), and a small peptide containing 6 arginine and 3 tryptophan residues (RW9). The membrane models were composed of phospholipids from natural sources containing different molecular species. We observed that among the three peptides, only the amphipathic peptide RW9 was able to cross the membrane vesicles in the liquid disordered state. The changes in the distribution of the previously characterized cholesterol-pyrene probe show that cholesterol-pyrene molecules dissociate from clusters upon membrane interaction with the three peptides and that the cholesterol environment becomes more disordered in the presence of RW9. Finally, we studied the effect of the peptides on lipid ordering on giant plasma membrane vesicles. The amphipathic peptides RW9 and its longer homologue RW16 induced lipid de-packing in plasma membrane vesicles. Overall, the data suggest that a disordered membrane favours the translocation of RW9, that the membrane cholesterol is redistributed during peptide interaction, and that the peptide amphipathic character is important to increase membrane fluidity and peptide membrane translocation."

RVA is also one of the most common enteric viruses detected on pig farms and contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality in piglets. Long-term multi-site surveillance of RVA on Thai swine farms to determine the diversity of RVA strains in circulation is currently lacking. In this study, we characterized the 11 segments of the RVA genome from 24 Thai porcine RVA strains circulating between 2011 and 2016. We identified G9 (15/24) and P[13] (12/24) as the dominant genotypes. The dominant G and P combinations were G9P[13] (n = 6), G9P[23] (n = 6), G3P[13] (n = 5), G9P[19] (n = 3), G4P[6] (n = 2), G4P[19] (n = 1), and G5P[13] (n = 1). Genome constellation of the Thai strains showed the predominance of Wa-like genotype (Gx-P[x]-I1/I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1/T7-E1/E9-H1) with evidence of reassortment between the porcine and human RVA strains (e.g., G4-P[6]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G9-P[19]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E9-H1). To assess the potential effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination, the Thai RVA strains were compared to the RVA strains represented in the swine rotavirus vaccine, which showed residue variations in the antigenic epitope on VP7 and shared amino acid identity below 90% for G4 and G5 strain. Several previous studies suggested these variations might effect on virus neutralization specificity and vaccine efficacy. Our study illustrates the importance of RVA surveillance beyond the G/P genotyping on commercial swine farms, which is crucial for controlling viral transmission."

RecQ-mediated genome instability protein 1 (RMI1), together with Bloom syndrome protein and topoisomerase IIIα, form an evolutionarily conserved complex that is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. Herein, we report that RMI1 depletion increases cell sensitivity to camptothecin treatment, as shown by an elevation of genotoxic stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks, a stronger activation of the DNA damage response, and a greater G2/M cell cycle delay. Our findings support that, upon DNA damage, RMI1 forms nuclear foci at the damaged regions, interacts with RAD51, and facilitates the recruitment of RAD51 to initiate homologous recombination.

Cell surface bacterial recognition receptor expression (flow cytometry) and cytokine release (bead array) were analyzed.NTHI and SP reduced bacterial recognition receptor expression on MDMs from COPD and Sm, but not NoS (except TLR4). SR-AI and MARCO were reduced by both NTHI and SP, whereas other receptors by either NTHI or SP. Among COPD subjects, COPD-ES demonstrated a greater number of reductions as compared to COPD-S. NTHI reduced SR-AI, MARCO, CD11b, CD35 and CD206 in COPD-ES while only SR-AI and CD11b in COPD-S. SP reduced SRA-1, CD1d, TLR2 and TLR4 in both COPD-ES and COPD-S, and reduced MARCO and CD93 only in COPD-ES. All receptors reduced in COPD by NTHI and most by SP, were also reduced in Sm. Budesonide counteracted the receptor reductions induced by both NTHI (CD206 p = 0.03, MARCO p = 0.08) and SP (SR-AI p = 0.02) in COPD-ES. Fluticasone counteracted only SP-induced reductions in TLR2 (p = 0.008 COPD-ES and p = 0.04 COPD-S) and TLR4 (p = 0.02 COPD-ES). Cytokine release was equivalently reduced by both corticosteroids.Reduction in macrophage bacterial recognition receptors during bacterial exposure could provide a mechanism for the increased pneumonia risk in COPD.

Standard protocols using the mutant T4 DNA polymerase are provided for the sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) method and a modified QuikChange method, where the mutant enzyme enhances the yield of correctly mutated plasmid and further suppresses parental plasmid during digestion with DpnI.

Previous studies provided evidence that radio electric fields asymmetrically conveyed through the Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer (REAC) technology are able to commit R1 embryonic stem cells and human adipose derived stem cells toward a cardiac phenotype. The present study aimed at investigating whether the effect of physical stimulation by REAC in combination with specific chemical inductors enhance the cardiogenic potential in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The appearance of a cardiac-like phenotype in iPSCs cultured in the presence of a cardiogenic medium, based upon BMP4 and a WNT-inhibitor, was consistently increased by REAC treatment used only during the early fate differentiation for the first 72 hours. REAC-exposed iPSCs exhibited an upregulation in the expression of specific cardiogenic transcripts and morphologically in the number of beating clusters, as compared to cells cultured in the cardiogenic medium alone. Our results indicate that physical modulation of cellular dynamics provided by the REAC offers an affordable strategy to mimic iPSC cardiac-like fates in the presence of a cardiogenic milieu."
https://openalex.org/W2894593835,"The amplitude of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) generated in the brainstem of rats exponentially decreases over the sequential averaging of EEG epochs. This behavior is partially due to the adaptation of the ASSR induced by the continuous and monotonous stimulation. In this study, we analyzed the potential clinical relevance of the ASSR adaptation. ASSR were elicited in eight anesthetized adult rats by 8-kHz tones, modulated in amplitude at 115 Hz. We called independent epochs to those EEG epochs acquired with sufficiently long inter-stimulus interval, so the ASSR contained in any given epoch is not affected by the previous stimulation. We tested whether the detection of ASSRs is improved when the response is computed by averaging independent EEG epochs, containing only unadapted auditory responses. The improvements in the ASSR detection obtained with standard, weighted and sorted averaging were compared. In the absence of artifacts, when the ASSR was elicited by continuous acoustic stimulation, the computation of the ASSR amplitude relied upon the averaging method. While the adaptive behavior of the ASSR was still evident after the weighting of epochs, the sorted averaging resulted in under-estimations of the ASSR amplitude. In the absence of artifacts, the ASSR amplitudes computed by averaging independent epochs did not depend on the averaging procedure. Averaging independent epochs resulted in higher ASSR amplitudes and halved the number of EEG epochs needed to be acquired to achieve the maximum detection rate of the ASSR. Acquisition protocols based on averaging independent EEG epochs, in combination with appropriate averaging methods for artifact reduction might contribute to develop more accurate hearing assessments based on ASSRs."

Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the menopause status was associated with the changes in magnesium (p = 0.003) and creatinine (p = 0.002) secretion, whereas not with the changes in citrate (p = 0.402) secretion.Postmenopausal women have a significant lower secretion of magnesium in their 24-hour urine than non-menopausal ones. We suppose that might be associated with increased risk of urinary stone formation among postmenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2912765990,"Studies of past forest use traditions are crucial in both understanding the present state of the oldest European forests, and in guiding decisions on future forest conservation and management. Current management of Poland’s Białowieża Forest (BF), one of the best-preserved forests of the European lowlands, is heavily influenced by anecdotal knowledge on forest history. Therefore, it is important to gain knowledge of the forest’s past in order to answer questions about its historical administration, utilisation, and associated anthropogenic changes. Such understanding can then inform future management. This study, based on surveys in Belarussian and Russian archives and a preliminary field survey in ten forest compartments of Białowieża National Park, focuses on culturally-modified trees (CMTs), which in this case are by-products of different forms of traditional forest use. Information about the formation of the CMTs can then be used to provide insight into former forest usage. Two types of CMTs were discovered to be still present in the contemporary BF. One type found in two forms was of 1) pine trees scorched and chopped in the bottom part of the trunk and 2) pine trees with carved beehives. A second type based on written accounts, and therefore known to be present in the past (what we call a ‘ghost CMT’), was of 3) lime-trees with strips of bark peeled from the trunk. Written accounts cover the period of transition between the traditional forest management (BF as a Polish royal hunting ground, until the end of the eighteenth century) and modern, “scientific” forestry (in most European countries introduced in the second half of the nineteenth century). These accounts document that both types of CMTs and the traditional forest uses responsible for their creation were considered harmful to “rational forestry” by the nineteenth-century forest administration. Thus the practices which created CMTs were banned and the trees gradually removed from the forest. Indeed, these activities drew the attention of forest administrators for several decades, and in our view delayed the introduction of new, timber-oriented, forest management in the BF."
https://openalex.org/W2913493121,"Detection of antibodies to Anaplasma spp. using commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ccELISA) is based on the recombinant major surface protein 5 fused to maltose binding protein (MBP-MSP5) or glutathione S-transferase (GST-MSP5). To avoid false positive reactions due to the presence of antibodies against E. coli MBP in cattle, previous sera absorption is required. This study evaluated the replacement of MBP-MSP5 or GST-MSP5 antigens by the truncate MSP5 (residues 28–210) of A. marginale (tMSP5m), A. centrale (tMSP5c) and fusion protein MSP5 (tMSP5cm), expressed without N-terminus transmembrane helix in the ccELISA test. Immunoreactivity was evaluated by western blot using monoclonal antibodies against the tMSP5 and by in-house cELISA (hcELISA) with purified tMSP5m, tMSP5c or tMSP5cm using sera from cattle infected with A. marginale (n = 226) or vaccinated with A. centrale (n = 173) and uninfected cattle (n = 216). Results of hcELISA were compared with those of ccELISA. Recombinant protein was expressed highly soluble (> 95%) in E. coli without a molecular chaperone. Specificity of the hcELISA-tMSP5m, -MSP5c or -tMSP5cm was identical to (99.5%) and greater than that in ccELISA (96.3%). Sensitivity of hcELISA-tMSP5m and ccELISA was identical (95.5%), but lower than that of hcELISA-tMSP5cm (96.2%) and -tMSP5c (97.2%). The analysis of vaccinated cattle by hcELISA-tMSP5c showed sensitivity of 99.4%. In summary, the generation of fusion MSP5 A. marginale-A. centrale protein without transmembrane helix was a very effective method to express the recombinant protein highly soluble in the bacterial cytoplasm and contributed to an increased test performance for detecting antibodies in cattle naturally infected with A. marginale or vaccinated with A. centrale."

PirB is a functional ortholog of human LILRB2. As such, it is used as a mouse model to study LILRB2 function. PirB is expressed on various types of hematopoietic cells, where it down-regulates activation and differentiation. For example, through interaction with MHC-I molecules, PirB inhibits B-cell (3Maeda A. Scharenberg A.M. Tsukada S. Bolen J.B. Kinet J.P. Kurosaki T.

Unlike the other LILRB family members, PirB and LILRB2 are also expressed in neurons, where they are involved in restricting synaptic plasticity and neuronal regeneration.

PirB is a type I transmembrane protein with a domain organization that is typical for the LILR protein family (17Kubagawa H. Burrows P.D.

The extracellular segment is predicted to consist of six tandem Ig-like domains, referred to as D1–D6. The Ig-like domains are connected to a transmembrane helix by a short linker that is predicted to be disordered and O-linked glycosylated. The intracellular tail contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motives. Upon activation of the receptor through ligand binding, tyrosines in these motives are phosphorylated by Src family kinases (18Ho L.H. Uehara T. Chen C.-C. Kubagawa H.

PirB shares a high sequence homology with LILR proteins and, in particular, with its human ortholog LILRB2, with which it has an overall sequence identity of 52% for the extracellular Ig-like domains. Instead of the six Ig-like domains for mouse PirB, the human LILRB2 ectodomain consists of only four Ig-like domains. The first and third domain of PirB are most similar to the first domain of LILRB2 (35 and 43% sequence identity, respectively), whereas the second and fourth domains of PirB are most similar to the second domain of LILRB2 (56 and 43% sequence identity, respectively). The fifth and sixth domain of PirB are most similar to the third and fourth domain of LILRB2 (64 and 57% sequence identity, respectively). Although mouse PirB and human LILRB2 differ in domain number, they interact with a similar set of ligands and have similar functions (1Hudson L.E. Allen R.L.

To date, the only known structures for LILR family members consist of two consecutive Ig-like domains.

Insight in the structural features of PirB will aid understanding of how the protein is able to interact with such diverse ligands and trigger signaling to carry out its diverse range of functions. Here we present the crystal structure of the PirB ectodomain and investigate its interactions with the extracellular segment of the MAI MAG. The six Ig-like domains of PirB are arranged in an extended repeating zigzag arrangement. The PirB N-terminal domain, D1, has positional flexibility and adopts three alternative orientations in which the angle between domains D1 and D2 varies from 75° to 315°. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments we show that the dissociation constant for the PirB–MAG ectodomain interaction is 9 μm. The extended conformation of PirB may enable trans-cellular interaction with ligands, such as MAG and MHC-I, to induce intercellular signaling. The crystal structure of the PirB ectodomain containing all 6 Ig-like domains (PirB1–6) reveals an extended zigzag conformation with multiple orientations for the N-terminal Ig-like domain (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). The PirB1–6 structure was determined in three crystal forms, denoted PirBcryst1, PirBcryst2, PirBcryst3, with maximum resolutions of 3.3, 3.4, and 4.5 Å, respectively (Table 1). In two of the crystal forms, PirBcryst2 and PirBcryst3, the asymmetric unit contains two monomers, resulting in a total of five unique structures. The six tandem Ig-like domains are arranged in a zigzag shape, with only minor deviations between the five structures (Fig. 2, A–C, and Fig. S2). From tip to tip (Tyr-104–Cα to Ser-536–Cα), the structure measures 146 Å in the extended conformation found in PirBcryst1. Glycans are observed in four of the six predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-338, -479, -500, and- 531), in at least one of the five structures. In PirBcryst1 domain D6 is partially disordered; residues 528–549 and 567–593 are not visible in the electron density and were omitted from the model. The best-defined structure for domain 6 is observed in the second monomer (chain B) of PirBcryst2 (PirBcryst2-B), therefore this structure is used for the analysis of D6 outlined below, additionally this structure is used to supplement the PirB1–6 structure shown in Fig. 1A.Table 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsPirBcryst1PirBcryst2PirBcryst3Data collectionBeamlineDLS I04SLS PXSLS PX-I (1.0000 Å)aDiffraction data for this crystal were collected at two different beamlines and combined to form one dataset, see “Experimental procedures” for details.Wavelength (Å)0.97951.0000ESRF ID23-1 (0.9686 Å)aDiffraction data for this crystal were collected at two different beamlines and combined to form one dataset, see “Experimental procedures” for details.Space groupP4122P21P21Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)106.4 106.4 217.954.7 185.3 99.167.3 127.1 144.1α, β, γ (°)90 90 9090 105.6 9090 103.4 90Resolution (Å)53.19 − 3.30 (3.56 − 3.30)52.69 − 3.40 (3.63 − 3.40)70.07 − 4.50 (4.67 − 4.50)No. reflections19,634 (3,949)25,778 (4,683)13,858 (1,273)Rmerge0.277 (2.767)0.108 (0.824)0.226 (0.907)I/σI8.2 (1.5)6.9 (1.8)4.0 (1.6)Completeness (%)100 (100)98.8 (99.2)98.9 (98.0)Redundancy22.3 (22.5)3.2 (3.2)3.5 (3.5)CC1/20.998 (0.542)0.949 (0.586)0.960 (0.594)RefinementChains in asymmetric unit122Rwork/Rfree0.248 / 0.2950.256 / 0.3070.313 / 0.339No. non-H atomsProtein4,2229,1679,264Ligand/ion424242B-factors (Å2)Protein128139244Ligand/ion182212254R.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0030.0030.008Bond angles (°)0.790.681.22Ramachandran most favored (%)94.1095.7594.45Ramachandran outliers (%)0.200.521.62Molprobity score2.141.762.09Protein Data Bank code6GRQ6GRS6GRTa Diffraction data for this crystal were collected at two different beamlines and combined to form one dataset, see “Experimental procedures” for details.

As is often seen in LILR and KIR family members, the A–A′ strand is shared between the two β-sheets. Additionally, there is a polyproline helix before β-strands A and G and a 310-helix in the E–F loop. These secondary structure elements are not present in all domains, for instance, D1, D3, and D6 lack β-strand D, in D5 and D6 the G and A′ strands are unraveled, and in D2 and D6 the 310-helix is missing. Moreover, β-strand G is very short in D2 and it does not interact with β-strand F, leaving a separate parallel β-sheet composed of strands A′ and G. Despite the differences in secondary structure elements, the three-dimensional structures of all six Ig-like domains are very similar; in PirBcryst1 they have an average r.m.s. deviation on Cα’s of just 1.6 ± 0.3 Å (Fig. 1, D–F). Consecutive Ig-like domains interact with each other through topologically equivalent interfaces (Fig. 1, D–F) that are also observed in the two or three domain containing structures for LILR and KIR proteins (23Shiroishi M.

https://openalex.org/W2914087647,"Objective The primary objective was to determine if initial empirical intravenous dosing of gentamicin improved patient's outcomes in pyelonephritis/urosepsis compared with alternative IV antibiotic management. Design Retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting Public TertiaryTeaching Hospital serving adults in an urban centre. Participants All adult patient records with a recorded diagnosis of any of pyelonephritis/urosepsis, urinary tract infection, UTI, complicated urinary tract infection, bacteriuria, symptomatic bacteriuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria from 2nd February 2012 to 10th May 2014 were reviewed. Only patients treated with an empirical regimen of one or more IV antibiotics were included in the study. Main outcomes The primary outcomes were: duration of IV antibiotic treatment, time to resolution of symptoms and length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary end points were: compliance with Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotic (electronic version) (eTG) for severe pyelonephritis/urosepsis and appropriateness of gentamicin use. Data analysis Univariate and multivariable associations between baseline and demographic variables and the main outcomes were performed using Chi-square tests and a General Linear Model using the SAS version 9.2 software. Results Of 295 patients reviewed 152 were prescribed one or more IV antibiotics and included in the study. Approximately half of the patients (n = 73, 48%) were prescribed IV piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin), while gentamicin was prescribed for 66 patients (43.4%). Of the 152 patients evaluated, 49 (32%) were given gentamicin first. Multivariable regression analysis showed that duration of IV treatment was shorter for those aged over 70 (40.2 hours vs 85.5 hours for those aged up to 70; p = 0.0074), and those who received gentamicin as first line treatment (41.3 hours vs 89.8 hours for those not receiving any gentamicin; p = 0.0312). After adjustment for age and gentamicin administration, there appeared to be no significant difference in duration of IV treatment for any other independent variables. No significant associations between the independent variables (gentamicin, age, gender, comorbidities, and eTG compliance) and either time to resolution of symptoms (median: 68 hours) or hospital LOS (median: 5 days) were observed. Conclusions Neither time to resolution of abnormal symptoms nor length of stay were significantly influenced by an initial dose of gentamicin when the data were subjected to multivariable analysis. The age of the patient and pattern of gentamicin treatment were the dominant factors associated with duration of IV antibiotics. Piperacillin/tazobactam is not recommended in treatment guidelines for pyelonephritis/urosepsis but was the most commonly prescribed IV antibiotic. This requires review by the appropriate hospital clinicians."
https://openalex.org/W2952824708,"Background High-throughput sequencing technology has revolutionized both medical and biological research by generating exceedingly large numbers of genetic variants. The resulting datasets share a number of common characteristics that might lead to poor generalization capacity. Concerns include noise accumulated due to the large number of predictors, sparse information regarding the p≫n problem, and overfitting and model mis-identification resulting from spurious collinearity. Additionally, complex correlation patterns are present among variables. As a consequence, reliable variable selection techniques play a pivotal role in predictive analysis, generalization capability, and robustness in clustering, as well as interpretability of the derived models. Methods and findings K-dominating set, a parameterized graph-theoretic generalization model, was used to model SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data as a similarity network and searched for representative SNP variables. In particular, each SNP was represented as a vertex in the graph, (dis)similarity measures such as correlation coefficients or pairwise linkage disequilibrium were estimated to describe the relationship between each pair of SNPs; a pair of vertices are adjacent, i.e. joined by an edge, if the pairwise similarity measure exceeds a user-specified threshold. A minimum k-dominating set in the SNP graph was then made as the smallest subset such that every SNP that is excluded from the subset has at least k neighbors in the selected ones. The strength of k-dominating set selection in identifying independent variables, and in culling representative variables that are highly correlated with others, was demonstrated by a simulated dataset. The advantages of k-dominating set variable selection were also illustrated in two applications: pedigree reconstruction using SNP profiles of 1,372 Douglas-fir trees, and species delineation for 226 grasshopper mouse samples. A C++ source code that implements SNP-SELECT and uses Gurobi optimization solver for the k-dominating set variable selection is available (https://github.com/transgenomicsosu/SNP-SELECT)."
https://openalex.org/W2912673791,"Disordered eating (DE) is extensively studied among adolescents and young women. However, there is growing evidence that DE as well as the clinical eating disorders may occur at any age from childhood to advanced years. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of DE in a representative sample of middle-aged women from Norway. The study included 90 592 women (median age: 55 years) from the Norwegian Women and Cancer study who responded to a questionnaire between the years 2002-2005. Correlates of self-reported DE were assessed by logistic regression analyses. The overall period prevalence of DE between 2002-2005 was 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.25-0.31) %, and was highest among women ≥ 66 years: 0.65 (0.60-0.70) %. DE was strongly associated with depression (Odds ratio [OR] 3.34 [95% confidence interval 2.53-4.41]), being unemployed (OR 1.78 [1.32-2.40]) and single (OR 1.66 [1.25-2.20]). Women with DE were more likely to report low energy intake (OR 1.41 [1.08-1.86]) and were less likely to be moderately physically active (OR 0.67 [0.47-0.95]). Using the largest study sample in the literature, the present findings confirm smaller studies showing that DE do occur in women in mid-life and older age as well. Our results contribute to address a somewhat under-communicated community health problem that needs attention in terms of age-specific treatment and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2914946368,"Pharmacists in a number of countries are being trained in the administration of injections with the aim of improving access and adherence to vaccinations. However, little is known about population-level adherence to multiple-dose travel vaccines, and whether the availability of pharmacist immunizers is associated with adherence. Health administrative data from Alberta, Canada, from April 2008 to May 2017 identified adults dispensed at least one vaccine for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, or rabies. Individuals were coded as completers or non-completers of the vaccine series based on the number of doses dispensed over a time period comprising the duration of the standard series plus 6 months to account for late doses. The association between the proportion of Alberta pharmacists with injection authorization (according to pharmacist registration data) and completion of vaccine series was assessed using linear regression. Over the study period, 24,164 patients initiated a vaccine series for hepatitis A monovalent, 195,480 for hepatitis B monovalent, 169,802 for combined hepatitis A&B, 1,726 for Japanese encephalitis, and 1,908 for rabies. There were fewer than 5 individuals receiving Japanese encephalitis vaccine per year from 2008–2010 or rabies vaccine from 2008–2009. While statistically significant positive associations were seen across all vaccines except for Japanese encephalitis, the magnitude of these associations was small. Each 1% increase in the proportion of injections-authorized pharmacists saw a corresponding increase in the proportion of individuals with completed vaccine series by 0.31% for hepatitis A monovalent, 0.19% for hepatitis B monovalent, 0.22% for combined hepatitis A&B, and 0.21% for rabies. This may suggest that challenges remain with implementing reminder systems to ensure adherence among travellers. Strategies to develop or improve patient and clinician reminder systems in pharmacies for travel vaccines should therefore be explored."
