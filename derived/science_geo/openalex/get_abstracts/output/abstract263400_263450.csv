https://openalex.org/W1994145712,"The analysis of the first plant genomes provided unexpected evidence for genome duplication events in species that had previously been considered as true diploids on the basis of their genetics1,2,3. These polyploidization events may have had important consequences in plant evolution, in particular for species radiation and adaptation and for the modulation of functional capacities4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we report a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype. The draft sequence of the grapevine genome is the fourth one produced so far for flowering plants, the second for a woody species and the first for a fruit crop (cultivated for both fruit and beverage). Grapevine was selected because of its important place in the cultural heritage of humanity beginning during the Neolithic period11. Several large expansions of gene families with roles in aromatic features are observed. The grapevine genome has not undergone recent genome duplication, thus enabling the discovery of ancestral traits and features of the genetic organization of flowering plants. This analysis reveals the contribution of three ancestral genomes to the grapevine haploid content. This ancestral arrangement is common to many dicotyledonous plants but is absent from the genome of rice, which is a monocotyledon. Furthermore, we explain the chronology of previously described whole-genome duplication events in the evolution of flowering plants."

https://openalex.org/W2144486959,"Recent studies have indicated an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and central nervous system (CNS) insulin resistance. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the link between these two pathologies have not been elucidated. Here we show that signal transduction by neuronal insulin receptors (IR) is strikingly sensitive to disruption by soluble Abeta oligomers (also known as ADDLs). ADDLs are known to accumulate in AD brain and have recently been implicated as primary candidates for initiating deterioration of synapse function, composition, and structure. Using mature cultures of hippocampal neurons, a preferred model for studies of synaptic cell biology, we found that ADDLs caused a rapid and substantial loss of neuronal surface IRs specifically on dendrites bound by ADDLs. Removal of dendritic IRs was associated with increased receptor immunoreactivity in the cell body, indicating redistribution of the receptors. The neuronal response to insulin, measured by evoked IR tyrosine autophosphorylation, was greatly inhibited by ADDLs. Inhibition also was seen with added glutamate or potassium-induced depolarization. The effects on IR function were completely blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, tetrodotoxin, and calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. Downstream from the IR, ADDLs induced a phosphorylation of Akt at serine473, a modification associated with neurodegenerative and insulin resistance diseases. These results identify novel factors that affect neuronal IR signaling and suggest that insulin resistance in AD brain is a response to ADDLs, which disrupt insulin signaling and may cause a brain-specific form of diabetes as part of an overall pathogenic impact on CNS synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2029684068,"Dyslipidemia is associated with a prothrombotic phenotype; however, the mechanisms responsible for enhanced platelet reactivity remain unclear. Proatherosclerotic lipid abnormalities are associated with both enhanced oxidant stress and the generation of biologically active oxidized lipids, including potential ligands for the scavenger receptor CD36, a major platelet glycoprotein. Using multiple mouse in vivo thrombosis models, we now demonstrate that genetic deletion of Cd36 protects mice from hyperlipidemia-associated enhanced platelet reactivity and the accompanying prothrombotic phenotype. Structurally defined oxidized choline glycerophospholipids that serve as high-affinity ligands for CD36 were at markedly increased levels in the plasma of hyperlipidemic mice and in the plasma of humans with low HDL levels, were able to bind platelets via CD36 and, at pathophysiological levels, promoted platelet activation via CD36. Thus, interactions of platelet CD36 with specific endogenous oxidized lipids play a crucial role in the well-known clinical associations between dyslipidemia, oxidant stress and a prothrombotic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2066312160,"Mammalian centrioles play a dynamic role in centrosome function, but they also have the capacity to nucleate the assembly of cilia. Although controls must exist to specify these different fates, the key regulators remain largely undefined. We have purified complexes associated with CP110, a protein that plays an essential role in centrosome duplication and cytokinesis, and have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, Cep97, that recruits CP110 to centrosomes. Depletion of Cep97 or expression of dominant-negative mutants results in CP110 disappearance from centrosomes, spindle defects, and polyploidy. Remarkably, loss of Cep97 or CP110 promotes primary cilia formation in growing cells, and enforced expression of CP110 in quiescent cells suppresses their ability to assemble cilia, suggesting that Cep97 and CP110 collaborate to inhibit a ciliogenesis program. Identification of Cep97 and other genes involved in regulation of cilia assembly may accelerate our understanding of human ciliary diseases, including renal disease and retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2036458630,"Circadian clocks are widely distributed in mammalian tissues, but little is known about the physiological functions of clocks outside the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain. The retina has an intrinsic circadian clock, but its importance for vision is unknown. Here we show that mice lacking Bmal1, a gene required for clock function, had abnormal retinal transcriptional responses to light and defective inner retinal electrical responses to light, but normal photoreceptor responses to light and retinas that appeared structurally normal by light and electron microscopy. We generated mice with a retina-specific genetic deletion of Bmal1, and they had defects of retinal visual physiology essentially identical to those of mice lacking Bmal1 in all tissues and lacked a circadian rhythm of inner retinal electrical responses to light. Our findings indicate that the intrinsic circadian clock of the retina regulates retinal visual processing in vivo."

Using antibody adsorption and elution from selected gp120 variants, the neutralizing specificities of the two most broadly reactive sera were mapped to the primary receptor CD4-binding region of HIV-1 gp120. Novel antibodies to the CD4-binding site are elicited in some HIV-1-infected individuals, and new approaches to present this conserved region of gp120 to the immune system may result in improved vaccine immunogens."
https://openalex.org/W1975955075,"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a main catechin of green tea, has been suggested to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, the exact role and related mechanism have not been established. In this study, we examined the role of EGCG in hepatic gluconeogenesis at concentrations that are reachable by ingestion of pure EGCG or green tea, and are not toxic to hepatocytes. Our results show in isolated hepatocytes that EGCG at relatively low concentrations (<or=1 microm) inhibited glucose production via gluconeogenesis and expression of key gluconeogenic genes. EGCG was not toxic at these concentrations while demonstrating significant cytotoxicity at 10 mum and higher concentrations. EGCG at 1 mum or lower concentrations effective in suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis did not activate the insulin signaling pathway, but activated 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The EGCG suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis was prevented by blockade of AMPK activity. In defining the mechanism by which EGCG activates AMPK, we found that the EGCG activation of AMPK was mediated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK). Furthermore, our results show that the EGCG activation of AMPK and EGCG suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis were both dependent on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was a known activator of CaMKK. Together, our results demonstrate an inhibitory role for EGCG in hepatic gluconeogenesis and shed new light on the mechanism by which EGCG suppresses gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042128990,"Ubiquitination of proteins is an abundant modification that controls numerous cellular processes. Many Ubiquitin (Ub) protein ligases (E3s) target both their substrates and themselves for degradation. However, the mechanisms regulating their catalytic activity are largely unknown. The C2-WW-HECT-domain E3 Smurf2 downregulates transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling by targeting itself, the adaptor protein Smad7, and TGF-beta receptor kinases for degradation. Here, we demonstrate that an intramolecular interaction between the C2 and HECT domains inhibits Smurf2 activity, stabilizes Smurf2 levels in cells, and similarly inhibits certain other C2-WW-HECT-domain E3s. Using NMR analysis the C2 domain was shown to bind in the vicinity of the catalytic cysteine, where it interferes with Ub thioester formation. The HECT-binding domain of Smad7, which activates Smurf2, antagonizes this inhibitory interaction. Thus, interactions between C2 and HECT domains autoinhibit a subset of HECT-type E3s to protect them and their substrates from futile degradation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2148053098,"Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are essential lipids whose functional diversity is enabled by variation in their chain length. The full VLCFA biosynthetic machinery and how this machinery generates structural diversity remain elusive. Proteoliposomes reconstituted here from purified membrane components—an elongase protein (Elop), a novel dehydratase, and two reductases—catalyzed repeated rounds of two-carbon addition that elongated shorter FAs into VLCFAs whose length was dictated by the specific Elop homolog present. Mutational analysis revealed that the Elop active site faces the cytosol, whereas VLCFA length is determined by a lysine near the luminal end of an Elop transmembrane helix. By stepping the lysine residue along one face of the helix toward the cytosol, we engineered novel synthases with correspondingly shorter VLCFA outputs. Thus the distance between the active site and the lysine residue determines chain length. Our results uncover a mutationally adjustable, caliper-like mechanism that generates the repertoire of cellular VLCFAs. Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are essential lipids whose functional diversity is enabled by variation in their chain length.

Thus the distance between the active site and the lysine residue determines chain length. Our results uncover a mutationally adjustable, caliper-like mechanism that generates the repertoire of cellular VLCFAs. Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are structurally diverse biological molecules with unusually long hydrocarbon chains, ranging from 20 to 36 carbons (C20–36) or more (Leonard et al., 2004Leonard A.E. Pereira S.L. Sprecher H. Huang Y.S. Elongation of long-chain fatty acids.Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These lipids perform essential roles in a wide range of biological processes that cannot be supported by the more common shorter fatty acids (i.e., C16 and C18). For example, the chain length of certain VLCFAs allows them to simultaneously reside in both leaflets of the lipid bilayer, thereby stabilizing highly curved cellular membranes, such as those surrounding nuclear pore complexes (Schneiter et al., 2004Schneiter R. Brugger B. Amann C.M. Prestwich G.D. Epand R.F. Zellnig G. Wieland F.T. Epand R.M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Notably, the variation in VLCFA chain length across different species and different tissues has enabled the numerous functional specializations of these lipids. In S. cerevisiae, for example, while C22 is able to support the essential functions of VLCFAs, C26 is specifically required for a variety of membrane-based processes, including the formation of GPI lipid anchors and the trafficking of proteins in the secretory pathway (Dickson et al., 2006Dickson R.C.

Similarly, in mammals, VLCFAs with lengths greater than C30 allow the formation of a permeability barrier that is critical for the normal structure and function of the skin (McMahon et al., 2007McMahon A. Butovich I.A. Mata N.L. Klein M. Ritter 3rd, R. Richardson J. Birch D.G. Edwards A.O. Kedzierski W.

Genet. 2007; 16: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Finally, VLCFAs and their derivatives act as signaling molecules (e.g., arachidonic acid; Leonard et al., 2002Leonard A.E. Kelder B. Bobik E.G. Chuang L.T. Lewis C.J. Kopchick J.J. Mukerji P. Huang Y.S. Identification and expression of mammalian long-chain PUFA elongation enzymes.Lipids. 2002; 37: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and are dominant lipid constituents of certain tissues in animals (e.g., photoreceptor cells and myelin; Poulos et al., 1992Poulos A. Beckman K. Johnson D.W. Paton B.C. Robinson B.S. Sharp P. Usher S. Singh H. Very long-chain fatty acids in peroxisomal disease.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 318: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and plants (e.g., oils and waxes; Kunst and Samuels, 2003Kunst L. Samuels A.L. Biosynthesis and secretion of plant cuticular wax.Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 51-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Efforts to understand the mechanistic principles enabling their structural diversity have been hampered by the inability to reconstitute VLCFA synthesis from purified components (Cinti et al., 1992Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. The fatty acid chain elongation system of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Jakobsson et al., 2006Jakobsson A. Westerberg R. Jacobsson A.

Sprecher H. Huang Y.S. Elongation of long-chain fatty acids.Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This has been largely due to the insoluble nature of the VLCFA biosynthetic machinery which has been known since the 1960s to consist of detergent-labile complexes embedded within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (for a historical overview see Cinti et al., 1992Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. The fatty acid chain elongation system of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These pioneering studies demonstrated that VLCFAs are synthesized by the elongation of shorter fatty acids (C16 and C18) that are produced in the cytosol by the well-characterized, multienzyme complex termed the fatty acid synthase (FAS; Jenni et al., 2007Jenni S. Leibundgut M. Boehringer D. Frick C. Mikolasek B. Ban N.

The Crystal Structure of Yeast Fatty Acid Synthase, a Cellular Machine with Eight Active Sites Working Together.Cell. 2007; 129: 319-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). VLCFA synthesis was shown to proceed by a four-step biochemical cycle (Figure 1B; Nugteren, 1965Nugteren D.H. The enzymic chain elongation of fatty acids by rat-liver microsomes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar): (1) condensation of malonyl-CoenzymeA (CoA) with an acyl-CoA precursor; (2) reduction of the resulting 3-keto intermediate; (3) dehydration of the 3-hydroxy species; and (4) reduction of the enoyl product to yield a saturated FA chain that is two carbons longer than its precursor. The above conceptual framework facilitated more recent genetic approaches in budding yeast that identified several ER membrane proteins required for VLCFA production. Specifically, Ybr159wp and Tsc13p are strong candidates for the enzymes catalyzing the second and fourth steps of the elongation cycle, respectively, as they are homologous to known reductases and their inactivation leads to the accumulation of the expected keto and enoyl intermediates in the ER membrane (Beaudoin et al., 2002Beaudoin F. Gable K. Sayanova O. Dunn T. Napier J.A. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene required for heterologous fatty acid elongase activity encodes a microsomal beta-keto-reductase.J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additionally, Fen1p and Sur4p are two yeast members (Oh et al., 1997Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. ELO2 and ELO3, homologues of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ELO1 gene, function in fatty acid elongation and are required for sphingolipid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) of a large family of proteins termed the Elops (Jakobsson et al., 2006Jakobsson A. Westerberg R. Jacobsson A. Fatty acid elongases in mammals: their regulation and roles in metabolism.Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) which are required for the first (condensation) step in the elongation cycle (Moon et al., 2001Moon Y.A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. Identification of a mammalian long chain fatty acyl elongase regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins.J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4958-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, heterologous expression of Elop homologs in yeast demonstrated that these proteins determine the length of cellular VLCFA products. Hence, the proliferation and specialization of Elops has been responsible for the observed VLCFA chain length diversity across different organisms and cell types (Jakobsson et al., 2006Jakobsson A. Westerberg R. Jacobsson A. Fatty acid elongases in mammals: their regulation and roles in metabolism.Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, Leonard et al., 2004Leonard A.E. Pereira S.L. Sprecher H. Huang Y.S. Elongation of long-chain fatty acids.Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The exact function of Elops in the elongation cycle is uncertain, however, as these proteins lack homology to known condensing enzymes. Therefore, it remains to be established whether Elops are members of a novel family of condensing enzymes or noncatalytic adapters for recruiting specific substrates to the actual condensing enzyme. Finally, no protein has been identified that is specifically required for the dehydratase reaction. Based on these findings, we can now restate the question of VLCFA chain length determination in more specific mechanistic terms. Namely, how do Elops instruct the components of the elongation cycle to extend shorter FAs in two-carbon addition steps so as to yield VLCFA products of defined lengths? The observation that ER membranes containing a single Elop can convert substrates of different lengths to the same-length end product (Paul et al., 2006Paul S. Gable K. Beaudoin F. Cahoon E. Jaworski J. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. Members of the Arabidopsis FAE1-like 3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase gene family substitute for the Elop proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9018-9029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) argues against a length-determining mechanism that “counts” a fixed number of two-carbon additions. Conversely, ER membranes with different Elops allow for the elongation of the same substrate to different-length VLCFA products (Paul et al., 2006Paul S. Gable K. Beaudoin F. Cahoon E. Jaworski J. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. Members of the Arabidopsis FAE1-like 3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase gene family substitute for the Elop proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9018-9029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, Elops are able to specify VLCFA length in absolute terms. Efforts to understand the mechanism by which Elops achieve this and how evolutionary diversification of the Elop family has enabled the synthesis of VLCFAs of novel chain lengths have been hampered by the incomplete inventory of the components required for VLCFA synthesis (Paul et al., 2006Paul S. Gable K. Beaudoin F. Cahoon E. Jaworski J. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. Members of the Arabidopsis FAE1-like 3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase gene family substitute for the Elop proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9018-9029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, the integral membrane nature of the enzymes involved has thus far obstructed the in vitro reconstitution of any step of the elongation cycle (Cinti et al., 1992Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. The fatty acid chain elongation system of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Jakobsson et al., 2006Jakobsson A.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Here we identify Phs1p as the VLCFA dehydratase and show that it is the final missing component of the elongation cycle by reconstituting robust VLCFA synthesis using purified Elops, Phs1p, Ybr159wp, and Tsc13p inserted into proteoliposomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that Elops are a novel family of condensing enzymes that specify VLCFA length by terminating processive rounds of the elongation cycle following the synthesis of defined length products. Finally, we exploit this reconstituted system to elucidate the logic by which Elops measure VLCFA length and use this understanding to rationally design VLCFA synthase variants with dramatically altered product length outputs. In our previous large-scale genetic interactions study of the yeast early secretory pathway, we identified Phs1p as a highly conserved ER protein with six predicted transmembrane segments that plays an essential role in sphingolipid metabolism (Schuldiner et al., 2005Schuldiner M. Collins S.R. Thompson N.J. Denic V. Bhamidipati A. Punna T. Ihmels J. Andrews B. Boone C.

Several observations suggested to us that Phs1p might be a core component of the elongation cycle, the biosynthetic source of VLCFA substrates critical for the production of sphingolipids (Figure 1A). First, as expected following a block in VLCFA synthesis (Figure 1A; Beaudoin et al., 2002Beaudoin F. Gable K. Sayanova O. Dunn T. Napier J.A.

Second, cells with reduced Phs1p levels fail to grow in the presence of exogenously added myristic acid (C14) when FAS is chemically inhibited (Figure 2B), a hallmark of VLCFA mutants (Rossler et al., 2003Rossler H.

CoA-containing molecules were fluorescently labeled and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. ∗ is a nonspecific derivatization breakdown product of 3-hydroxy C18-CoA (data not shown). To further define the role of Phs1p in fatty acid elongation, we incubated membranes that had been genetically depleted of Phs1p with radiolabeled malonyl-CoA and unlabeled C18-CoA in the presence of reducing cofactors (essential for the second and fourth steps of the elongation cycle). The products of this reaction were then separated on the basis of chain length by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography. As previously seen (Paul et al., 2006Paul S. Gable K. Beaudoin F. Cahoon E. Jaworski J. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. Members of the Arabidopsis FAE1-like 3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase gene family substitute for the Elop proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9018-9029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), wild-type membranes elongated C18-CoA up to C26 (Figure 2D), the most abundant VLCFA in S. cerevisiae (Welch and Burlingame, 1973Welch J.W. Burlingame A.L. Very long-chain fatty acids in yeast.J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 464-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Phs1p-depleted membranes were strongly compromised for elongation and instead accumulated a fast-migrating (i.e., more hydrophilic) species (Figure 2D). Normal-phase TLC, a method better suited for resolving elongation cycle intermediates, identified this species as the 3-hydroxy intermediate (Figure 2E), which is the substrate for the third step in the cycle (Figure 1B). Notably, the first two steps (i.e., formation of the 3-keto intermediate in the absence of NAD(P)H and its reduction in the presence of NAD(P)H, respectively) were not compromised by Phs1p depletion (Figure 2E). Thus, Phs1p is specifically required for the dehydratase step of the elongation cycle. As Phs1p lacks homology to known dehydratases, we sought to determine if it catalyzes the third step of the elongation cycle by purifying epitope-tagged Phs1p. Strikingly, coincubation of either yeast- (Figure S1A) or bacterially produced Phs1p (Figure S1B) and a 3-hydroxy C18-CoA dehydratase substrate (Figure S2A) resulted in accumulation of the dehydrated enoyl-CoA (Figures 2F, S2B, and S2C). Taken together, these data establish that Phs1p is the founding member of a novel and conserved family of membrane dehydratases that catalyze the third step of the elongation cycle. Previous genetic studies have shown that mutations in close PHS1 homologs cause tumorigenesis in plants (Bellec et al., 2002Bellec Y. Harrar Y. Butaeye C. Darnet S. Bellini C. Faure J.D.

Tiret L. Kessler J.L. Blot S. Panthier J.J. SINE exonic insertion in the PTPLA gene leads to multiple splicing defects and segregates with the autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy in dogs.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the molecular role of Phs1p now points to the involvement of VLCFAs in these processes. To explore the role of Elops in the condensation reaction, we overexpressed and purified functional epitope-tagged versions of Fen1p and Sur4p, two yeast Elops (Figure S3A), but failed to detect significant condensation activity in our detergent-solubilized preparations (data not shown). We therefore removed the detergent in the presence of synthetic phospholipids of a defined composition approximating that of the ER membrane (Matsuoka and Schekman, 2000Matsuoka K. Schekman R. The use of liposomes to study COPII- and COPI-coated vesicle formation and membrane protein sorting.Methods. 2000; 20: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the resulting proteoliposomes, containing either Fen1p or Sur4p (Figure S3B), catalyzed formation of the 3-keto product (Figure 3A). We next explored the mechanism by which Elops catalyze the condensation reaction. These membrane-embedded proteins lack an absolutely conserved cysteine-containing catalytic triad found in the condensing enzymes of FAS and FAS-like systems (Paul et al., 2006Paul S. Gable K. Beaudoin F. Cahoon E. Jaworski J. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. Members of the Arabidopsis FAE1-like 3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase gene family substitute for the Elop proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9018-9029Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cysteine-targeted FAS inhibitor cerulenin does not interfere with VLCFA synthesis (Figure 2B). We therefore examined absolutely conserved signature sequence motifs within the Elop family (Jakobsson et al., 2006Jakobsson A. Westerberg R. Jacobsson A. Fatty acid elongases in mammals: their regulation and roles in metabolism.Prog.

Glutathione (GSH) depletion is an early hallmark observed in apoptosis, and we have demonstrated that GSH efflux during death receptor-mediated apoptosis occurs via a GSH transporter. We now evaluate the relationship between GSH depletion, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the progression of apoptosis. Simultaneous single cell analysis of changes in GSH content and ROS formation by multiparametric FACS revealed that loss of intracellular GSH was paralleled by the generation of different ROS including hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and lipid peroxides. However, inhibition of ROS formation by a variety of antioxidants showed that GSH loss was independent from the generation of ROS. Furthermore, GSH depletion was observed to be necessary for ROS generation. Interestingly, high extracellular thiol concentration (GSH and N-acetyl-cysteine) inhibited apoptosis, whereas, inhibition of ROS generation by other non-thiol antioxidants was ineffective in preventing cell death. Finally, GSH depletion was shown to be a necessary for the progression of apoptosis activated by both extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. These results document a necessary and critical role for GSH loss in apoptosis and clearly uncouple for the first time GSH depletion from ROS formation.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a ubiquitous, evolutionary conserved process. Under physiological conditions it is important not only in the turnover of cells in all tissues, but also during the normal development and senescence of the organism. Moreover, its deregulation has been observed to occur as either a cause or consequence of distinct pathologies (1Green D.R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Fadeel B. Orrenius S. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 479-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar).

Wasem C. Torgler R. Cima I. Jakob S. Corazza N. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a highly organized process characterized by the progressive activation of precise pathways leading to specific biochemical and morphological alterations. Initial stages of apoptosis are characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, changes in intracellular ionic homeostasis, cell shrinkage, loss of membrane lipid asymmetry, and chromatin condensation. Later stages associated with the execution phase of apoptosis are characterized by activation of execution caspases and endonucleases, apoptotic body formation, and cell fragmentation (1Green D.R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 193: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Franco R. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 209: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Apoptosis has been widely reported to be modulated by changes in the redox status of the cell; however, the precise mechanisms involved are still unclear (6Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Redox.

Reduced glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant low molecular weight thiol in animal cells and is involved in many cellular processes including antioxidant defense, drug detoxification, cell signaling, and cell proliferation (8Hammond C.L.

Nutr. 2004; 134: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). In addition, alterations in its concentration have been demonstrated as a common feature of many pathological situations including AIDS, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer (9Wu G. Fang Y.Z.

Intracellular GSH loss is an early hallmark in the progression of cell death in response to different apoptotic stimuli (11Hammond C.L. Madejczyk M.S. Ballatori N. Toxicol. Appl.

Additionally, high GSH levels have also been associated with an apoptotic resistant phenotype in different cells (18Friesen C. Kiess Y. Debatin K.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S73-S85Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Watson R.W. Rotstein O.D. Jimenez M. Parodo J. Marshall J.C.

We have recently shown that Fas ligand (FasL)-induced GSH efflux is mediated by its extrusion across the plasma membrane in lymphoid cells with characteristics of GSH/organic anion transporter (13Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis by changes in intracellular GSH are not completely understood. Because of its action as a primary intracellular antioxidant in the cells, a reduction in the intracellular glutathione content has primarily been thought to reflect the generation of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) (6Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Redox. Rep. 2001; 6: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Although, the role of ROS in apoptosis has been extensively studied (6Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Redox.

Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), contradictory results including both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of ROS on apoptosis have been reported. For example, induction of apoptosis by activation of the Fas receptor has been suggested to be dependent on the generation of H2O2 formation (20Kohno T. Yamada Y. Hata T. Mori H. Yamamura M.

In the present work, we evaluate the relationship between GSH depletion, ROS generation, and their respective roles in apoptosis at the single cell level. We present evidence that clearly uncouples for the first time the role of GSH depletion in apoptosis from the generation of ROS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that changes in GSH content are necessary for apoptosis to occur. In contrast, increases in ROS did not modulate apoptotic cell death. Our data suggest an important role for changes in intracellular GSH content in the activation of programmed cell death independent from increases in ROS formation.

All other reagents were from Sigma/Aldrich. Cell Culture and Media—Jurkat cells, E6.1 clone (human leukemia) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 31 mg/liter penicillin, and 50 mg/liter streptomycin at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Apoptosis was induced by incubating cells (5–7 × 105 cells/ml) at 37 °C, 7% CO2 for the time indicated with either human recombinant FasL (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA), cycloheximide, etoposide or treatment with ultraviolet C light (UVC) light in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene La Jolla, CA). In media containing high GSH (+GSH) or NAC (+NAC), NaCl was substituted with 25 mm l-glutathione or 10 mm NAC, maintaining the same osmolarity of the media. Media osmolarity was measured on a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Logan, UT). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—Apoptotic parameters were analyzed by FACS, using a BD LSR II flow cytometer and BD FACSDiva Software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) for data analysis. Samples were analyzed and in all cases 1 × 104 cells were recorded. Fluorophores were diluted in Me2SO or dimethylformamide (DMF) and preloaded just prior to FACS analysis and incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 in cell culture medium, unless otherwise indicated. Control cells were incubated with vehicles, which never exceed 0.1% in the final concentration. Propidium iodide (PI) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml just prior to FACS analysis and analyzed for FL-2 (488 excitation, 575/26 emission). Sequential analysis of the distinct fluorophores was used and cells with increased PI fluorescence (loss of membrane integrity) were excluded during the analysis unless otherwise stated. Cell debris or fragments were gated out from the analysis on a forward scatter/side scatter plot. The appearance of discrete cell populations was identified as described previously (13Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, gates were set on dot plots of the respective dye-fluorescence versus forward scatter, and then represented accordingly. Changes in the biochemical parameters during apoptosis are observed as changes in the normal distribution of the population of cells with differences in the mean fluorescence intensity for the distinct fluorescent reporters used, compared with control cells in the absence of stimuli and were determined as follows. Changes in Intracellular Glutathione Content, GSHi—For intracellular GSH determinations, cells were preloaded for 15 min with 10 μm mBCl, which forms blue fluorescent adducts with intracellular glutathione (30Sebastia J. Cristofol R. Martin M. Rodriguez-Farre E. Sanfeliu C. Cytometry. 2003; 51: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to flow cytometry examination, PI was added. For mBCl, cells were excited with a Violet (UV) 405 nm laser, and emission was acquired with a 440/40 filter. Changes in the GSHi are reflected by the appearance of populations of cells with differences in mBCl fluorescence, reflecting changes in GSHi. Populations were gated as previously described (13Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, contour plots of mBCl fluorescence versus forward scatter were used to identify populations of cells with different GSHi levels induced after FasL treatment. Three different cell populations were identified and represented independently. Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—Hydrogen peroxide formation was detected using nonfluorescent DHR, which after its oxidation by H2O2 in the presence of peroxidases, or Fe2+ results in cationic rhodamine (31Gomes A.

Hydroxyl radical (·OH–) formation was analyzed using HPF, which is essentially nonfluorescent until it reacts with ·OH yielding a bright green fluorescent compound (32Setsukinai K. Urano Y. Kakinuma K. Majima H.J. Nagano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3170-3175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO) detection was performed using DAF-FM. After its cleavage by intracellular esterases, DAF is nonfluorescent until it reacts with the spontaneous oxidation product of nitric oxide, nitrosonium cation, to form a fluorescent heterocycle benzotrizole that is trapped in the cytosol. Cells were pre-loaded for 30 min with 5 μm of either DHR, HPF, or DAF-FM and analyzed for FL1 (488 excitation, 530/30 emission). Generation of lipid peroxides (LPO) was assessed using BODIPY® FL EDA, which upon interaction with peroxyl radicals looses its fluorescence; and also by fluorescence quenching of the fatty acid analog CsPA (33Makrigiorgos G.M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1997; 35: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were equilibrated with either 5 μm BODIPY® FL EDA or 1.5 μm CsPA for 30 min. Then, cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium before apoptosis induction. BODIPY® FL EDA was analyzed in FL-1 and CsPA was analyzed at 325/355 nm excitation and 440/40 emission. Superoxide anion (·O2−) formation was detected using DHE, which after its oxidization to ethidium by ·O2−, it intercalates within the DNA and exhibits bright red fluorescence (34Ghelli A. Benelli B. Esposti M.D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were preloaded for 30 min with 5 μm DHE, and changes in its fluorescence were detected in FL-2. For DHE analysis, TOTO-3 dye was added to the samples instead of PI and analyzed at 633 excitation and 660/20 emission to assessed loss of membrane integrity. Caspase 3 and PARP Cleavage Analysis by FACS—Simultaneous analysis of the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP was performed as previously described (13Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit for 30 min at room temperature in the dark according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were then pelleted and washed with the Perm/Wash buffer and stained for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with FITC-conjugated anti-cleaved caspase 3 or PE-conjugated anti-PARP cleavage site-specific. Following incubation, cells were washed with the PermWash buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. PE and FITC fluorescence were examined for FL-1 and FL-2, respectively. Analysis of Plasma Membrane Lipid Symmetry—Changes in the phosphatidylserine symmetry were determined using annexin V conjugated to FITC (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, 5 × 105 control or treated cells, initially washed in PBS, were incubated with 1 μl of annexin-FITC and PI for 15 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. Annexin-FITC/PI-stained samples were diluted in 400 μl of 1× annexin binding buffer and examined immediately by FACS. FITC fluorescence was analyzed on FL1. Early apoptotic cells are defined as having annexin positive, propidium iodide negative staining. Late apoptotic and non-viable cells are both annexin and propidium iodide-positive. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy—A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY) was used to obtain DIC images. Cells were prestained for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with 5 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 and then washed with fresh culture media. Hoechst-stained cells were examined with a Plan-Apo 63 × oil N.A. = 1.4 objective lens to obtain simultaneous DIC and UV images. Hoechst was excited at 390 nm with a Titanium Sapphire 750 nm laser, and emission was collected with a BP 465 filter. Images were analyzed with LSM 5 image browser software. Extracellular GSH and GSSG Determinations—Extracellular GSH determinations were performed as described in Ref. 13Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar with minor modifications to improve GSH recovery. Experiments were performed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (SIGMA/Aldrich). Cells were incubated with 250 μml-(αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (acivicin) for 1 h, to inhibit the catabolism of released GSH by the γ-glutamyl-transferase (GGT). Then, cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were induced to undergo apoptosis with FasL. This allowed an improved recovery of accumulated extracellular GSH. Acivicin was present throughout the experiment. Samples were centrifuged, and aliquots were taken for extracellular determinations. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized, and kept frozen until use for protein determinations. The extracellular GSH and GSSG concentrations were measured enzymatically using the GSH/GSSG-412 kit (Oxis Research, Portland, OR). Samples were prepared in 5% meta-phosphoric acid to remove proteins, with or without 1-methyl-2-vinyl-pyridium trifluoromethane sulfonate, a GSH-specific scavenger. Ellman's reagent (5′,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) reacts with GSH to form a product with an absorption maximum at 412 nm. GSSG was determined using glutathione reductase and β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to reduce GSSG to GSH followed by reaction with Ellman's reagent. Results are normalized to protein concentration for each sample. [3H]GSH Uptake Assays—Apoptosis was induced in the presence of 1 μCi of [3H]GSH ([glycine-2-3H]glutathione, 1.53 TBq/mmol, Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). The experiments were done in the presence of 250 μm acivicin and 1 mm BSO (dl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine) to inhibit both GSH catabolism and de novo synthesis, respectively. At the indicated time, cells were separated from the medium by filtering through a glass micro-fiber filter (Whatman). Filters were washed with ice-cold PBS. Then, the filter was dried and placed in a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of Ecolite (ICN Radiochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The radioactivity was counted in a LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Results are expressed as the radioactivity incorporated (dpm) normalized to protein concentration. Protein Extraction and Western Immunoblotting—Cells were pelleted, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini protease mixture, Roche). Samples were sonicated, centrifuged, and the pellets discarded. Then, samples were assayed in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer for protein concentration using Bio-Rad protein assay, and cell extracts were normalized to equal protein concentration. Loading buffer containing glycerol, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and bromphenol blue was added, and samples were denatured at 99 °C for 5 min. Protein extracts, 50 μg/sample, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide Tris/glycine gels (Novex, Invitrogen, CA) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween and 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were incubated with the corresponding primary antibody (1:1000) overnight. Then, blots were incubated for 1 h with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in TBS containing 0.05% Tween, and 0.5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were then visualized on film with the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were subsequently stripped using 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS buffer, and reprobed with distinct antibodies. To verify equal protein loading, blots were also reprobed with anti-α-tubulin antibody. Statistical Analysis—When indicated, significance of differences in mean values were calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test. The number of experiments is indicated in each case in the legends of the figures. FasL-induced GSH Loss Is Independent of, but Necessary for, the Generation of ROS—Glutathione depletion is a common phenomenon during apoptosis (11Hammond C.L. Madejczyk M.S. Ballatori N. Toxicol.

Most studies suggest that GSH depletion during apoptosis is an indicator for ROS formation and oxidative stress. Such findings have led to the wide-spread assumption that GSH depletion is a byproduct of the apoptotic process; and that ROS formation and GSH depletion in apoptosis are coupled together as cause and consequence phenomena (6Carmody R.J.

Triggering apoptosis induces the formation of ROS and RNS (6Carmody R.J. Cotter T.G. Redox. Rep. 2001; 6: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S.

Because of the stochastic nature of apoptosis, multiparametric flow cytometry (FACS) was used because it allows us to identify the appearance of discrete populations of cells at different stages in apoptosis and to analyze them at the single cell level. Such analysis is not possible with conventional bulk biochemical assays. Fig. 1 (histograms) shows that FasL induced a dose-dependent gen"

https://openalex.org/W2071887987,"Nervous system function is mediated by a precisely patterned network of synaptic connections. While several cell-adhesion and secreted molecules promote the assembly of synapses, the contribution of signals that negatively regulate synaptogenesis is not well understood. We examined synapse formation in the Caenorhabditis elegans motor neuron DA9, whose presynapses are restricted to a specific segment of its axon. We report that the Wnt lin-44 localizes the Wnt receptor lin-17/Frizzled (Fz) to a subdomain of the DA9 axon that is devoid of presynaptic specializations. When this signaling pathway, composed of the Wnts lin-44 and egl-20, lin-17/Frizzled and dsh-1/Dishevelled, is compromised, synapses develop ectopically in this subdomain. Conversely, overexpression of LIN-44 in cells adjacent to DA9 is sufficient to expand LIN-17 localization within the DA9 axon, thereby inhibiting presynaptic assembly. These results suggest that morphogenetic signals can spatially regulate the patterning of synaptic connections by subdividing an axon into discrete domains."
https://openalex.org/W1995229645,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be differentiated into osteoblasts and provide an excellent cell source for bone regeneration and repair. Recently, the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been found to play a critical role in skeletal development and osteogenesis, implying that Wnts can be utilized to improve de novo bone formation mediated by MSCs. However, it is unknown whether noncanonical Wnt signaling regulates osteogenic differentiation. Here, we find that Wnt-4 enhanced in vitro osteogenic differentiation of MSCs isolated from human adult craniofacial tissues and promoted bone formation in vivo. Whereas Wnt-4 did not stabilize β-catenin, it activated p38 MAPK in a novel noncanonical signaling pathway. The activation of p38 was dependent on Axin and was required for the enhancement of MSC differentiation by Wnt-4. Moreover, using two different models of craniofacial bone injury, we found that MSCs genetically engineered to express Wnt-4 enhanced osteogenesis and improved the repair of craniofacial defects in vivo. Taken together, our results reveal that noncanonical Wnt signaling could also play a role in osteogenic differentiation.

Because of their osteogenic potential, MSCs could be potentially used for repairing critical size bone defects that normally cannot undergo spontaneous healing (2Krebsbach P.H. Kuznetsov S.A.

(2005) Science STKE 2005, pe 37Google Scholar). Recently, growing evidence has suggested that MSCs also exist in a number of nonmarrow tissues. For example, MSCs isolated from adipose tissue and muscle express some common cell surface markers that are identified in marrow MSCs from bone marrow and can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, muscle cells, and neural cells (6Sottile V. Halleux C. Bassilana F. Keller H. Seuwen K. Bone. 2002; 30: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Peng H. Wright V. Usas A. Gearhart B. Shen H. Cummins J. Huard J. J. Clin.

Recently, based on the primary characteristics of MSCs from bone marrow, we have isolated MSCs from craniofacial tissues, such as the dental pulp and periodontal ligament (9Seo B.M. Miura M.

Like MSCs isolated from bone marrow, these cells are self-renewing, multipotent, and clonogenic. They can be induced to differentiate into osteoblast-like cells and adipocytes in vitro. When implanted into immunodeficient mice, these cells formed mineralized tissues or related craniofacial structures, suggesting that they can be used in the replacement of tooth and craniofacial (9Seo B.M.

Although bone regeneration mediated by MSCs shows potential utility, the regenerative capacity of these cells is relatively low when taking into account the number of cells utilized for transplantation in vivo. Moreover, critical size defects in patients often require a large number of MSCs. To obtain enough MSCs for cell transplantation, MSCs must be expanded ex vivo (2Krebsbach P.H. Kuznetsov S.A. Bianco P. Robey P.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the potential problem for ex vivo expansion is that MSCs have a limited life span and may gradually lose their osteogenic potential. To overcome these potential problems, several strategies have been explored. We and others have found that overexpression of telomerase significantly extended the life span of MSCs and enhanced bone formation potential of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo (11Shi S. Gronthos S. Chen S. Reddi A. Counter C.M. Robey P.G. Wang C.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A variety of growth factors that promote osteogenic differentiation have also been utilized to enhance bone regeneration mediated by MSCs. For example, studies by Peng et al. (7Peng H. Wright V. Usas A. Gearhart B. Shen H. Cummins J. Huard J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 could significantly improve bone formation and healing by MSCs isolated from muscle. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has recently been found to play an essential role in bone development and postnatal maintenance of bone mass (12Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. Macdougald O.A.

Since Wnts are secreted growth factors, they may potentially be utilized as recombinant factors to improve bone regeneration. There are 19 Wnt family proteins in total that are primarily divided into two main categories based on their role in cytosolic β-catenin stabilization: canonical and noncanonical (21Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 22Cadigen K.M. Nusse R.

Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Canonical Wnts transduce their signals through intracellular β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt proteins, β-catenin is associated with a cytoplasmic complex containing adenomatous polyposis coli, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, Axin, and casein kinase 1. In this complex, glycogen synthase kinase-3β constitutively phosphorylates β-catenin, resulting in its ubiquitination and the degradation by the 26 S proteasome. In the presence of Wnt stimulation, a frizzled receptor and the Wnt co-receptor LRP5 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5) or LRP6 transduce signals to inhibit Axin/adenomatous polyposis coli/glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of free cytosolic β-catenin. The elevated cytosolic β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus, form a complex with members of the Tcf family of transcription factors, and activate the expression of Wnt target genes (21Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 22Cadigen K.M. Nusse R.

Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). In contrast, noncanonical Wnts transduce their signal independent of β-catenin. The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway has been found to be associated with gastrulation movements, heart induction, dorsoventral patterning, tissue separation, and neuronal migration (21Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Unlike the canonic Wnt signaling pathway, the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway is quite diverse. It has been reported that noncanonical Wnts can activate calcium flux, G proteins, Rho GTPases, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (21Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev.

Tissue Eng. 2004; 10: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and Boland et al. (32Boland G.M. Perkins G. Hall D.J. Tuan R.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1210-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the canonical Wnt-3a and Wnt-1 inhibited osteogenic differentiation and promoted proliferation of MSCs in vitro. Cho et al. (33Cho H.H. Kim Y.J. Kim S.J. Kim J.H. Bae Y.C. Ba B. Jung J.S. Tissue Eng. 2006; 12: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling promoted proliferation and suppressed osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived MSCs. However, the underlying mechanism that is responsible for the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is not clear. Nevertheless, these findings suggest at least that, although canonical Wnt signaling plays a critical role in bone development, targeting Wnt/β-catenin may be not useful for improving osteogenic potential of MSCs for bone tissue engineering. During the course of studying the role of Wnts in craniofacial bone regeneration, consistent with the studies of Boer et al. (31Boer J.D. Wang H.J. Blitterswijk C.V. Tissue Eng. 2004; 10: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we also observed that several canonical Wnts strongly inhibited osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. 3J. Chang, W. Sonoyama, Z. Wang, Q. Jin, C. Zhang, P. H. Krebsbach, W. Giannobile, S. Shi, and C.-Y. Wang, unpublished observation. Unexpectedly, we identified that Wnt-4, a noncanonical Wnt member, played a novel role in promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs isolated from craniofacial tissues. Using two different models of craniofacial bone injury, we found that MSCs that were genetically engineered to express Wnt-4 exhibited robust bone formation capacities and improved the repair of craniofacial bone defects. We found that p38 MAPK was activated by Wnt-4 in a novel noncanonical signaling pathway in MSCs and played a critical role in enhancing osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Our results suggest that Wnt-4 may be potentially utilized for enhancing the properties of MSCs in craniofacial bone regeneration and repair. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infection—C2C12 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. MSCs from human periodontal ligaments were grown as described previously. BMP4 was purchased from R & D Systems. To engineer C2C12 cells or MSCs stably expressing Wnt-4, the retrovirus-mediated infection was performed as described previously (38Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). Briefly, retroviruses were produced by transfecting the retroviral vector encoding Wnt-4 or control vector into 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method. Forty-eight h after transfection, retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected, filtered with 0.45-μm filters, and stored in -70 °C. C2C12 cells or MSCs were infected with retroviruses in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Forty-eight h after infection, cells were selected with neomycin (2 μg/ml) for 10 days. The surviving cells were pooled, and cells expressing Wnt-4 were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were either untreated or treated with BMP4 (50 ng/ml) and then harvested and washed once with PBS. Cells were pelleted and lysed with cell lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). The protein concentration was measured according to the manufacturer's instruction (Bio-Rad). 30-50 aliquots of protein extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semidry gel transfer cell. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C and then probed with the primary antibodies. The immunocomplexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Promega) using the SuperSignal reagents (Pierce), as described previously (38Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were from the following sources: anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies from Sigma; anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were from Convance; anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibodies were from Clontech; anti-phospho-p38 polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling; and anti-p38 and anti-Axin polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNAs were extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5-10-μg aliquots of RNA samples were separated on a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane for 16-24 h (Bio-Rad). RNAs were cross-linked with a UV cross-linker (Promega). Blots were prehybridized with PerfectHyb (Sigma) buffer containing salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) for 20 min and then hybridized with PerfectHyb buffer containing 32P-labeled osterix (Osx), type I collagen, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes. The probes were labeled with a random primed labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (ICN). The probes were purified with a micro-G50 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization, the blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 42 °C, as described previously (38Nakashima K.

Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), von Kossa, Alizarin Red Staining, and Transplantation in Nude Mice—Cells were grown in differentiation-inducing media containing 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 μm dexamethasone. 1-7 days after induction, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with an ALP staining kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). For detecting mineralization, cells were induced for 2-3 weeks, fixed with 70% ETOH, and stained with 2% alizarin red or 1% silver nitrate (11Shi S. Gronthos S. Chen S. Reddi A. Counter C.M. Robey P.G. Wang C.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) (Sigma). Approximately 4.0 × 106 of the cells were mixed with 40 mg of hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate ceramic particles (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN) and then transplanted subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of 10-week-old immunocompromised beige mice (bg-nu/nu-xid; Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (11Shi S. Gronthos S. Chen S. Reddi A. Counter C.M. Robey P.G. Wang C.Y. Nat.

Sections were then deparaffinized, hydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Periodontal Bone Defect Model—A nude rat periodontal defect model was utilized as previously described (44Jin Q.-M. Anusaksathien O. Webb S.A. Printz M.A. Giannobile W.V. Mol.

In brief, athymic nude rats (approximate weight 240-260 g) (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. A 2-cm skin incision was made at the lower border of the mandible, and the tissues were exposed by separating the superficial fascia, masseter muscle, and periosteum. A 3 × 2-mm defect was made using a high speed dental handpiece on the buccal plate of the alveolar bone between the mandibular first and second molar teeth. The periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone were removed from the mesial and distobuccal roots of the mandibular first molar and the mesiobuccal root of the mandibular second molar teeth within the defect area. Polylactic co-glycolide polymer scaffolds (3 × 2 × 1 mm) were seeded overnight with 2.5 × 105 MSC/V or MSC/Wnt-4 cells and placed within the respective defects, as previously described for other tissue engineering applications. This study was performed under protocols approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the University of Michigan and was in compliance with state and federal laws. Five weeks postsurgery, rats were sacrificed by CO2 euthanization, and the mandibulae were harvested, immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, and then scanned by microcomputed tomography (μCT) (model Pxs5-928EA; GE Healthcare, London, Canada) to evaluate osseous structures. The mandibulae were subsequently decalcified with a 10% EDTA solution for ∼2-3 weeks, dehydrated with gradient alcohols, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections ∼5 μmin thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. μCT scanning produced three-dimensional images, allowing for detailed visualization and analysis of hard tissue architecture and anisotropy. The samples were scanned at 18 μm resolution for mineralized tissue with accelerated potential of 80 kV and a beam current of 80 μA. The eXplore Microview version 2.0 software provides image analyzing tools with coronal, saggital, and transversal views two- and three-dimensionally. Linear distances of roots were measured (mm) from the root furcation to root apex on the first molar (M1) distal root of the buccal side of mandibulae by a single calibrated examiner. The μCT can create sections with 18-μm thickness from a three-dimensionally reconstructed image. Tooth furcations and root apices were determined through a coronal view, and the number of frames was counted. The exposed root length was measured between furcation and the root apex. The fractions of bone-covered root surface were calculated with the fraction exposed root length/total root length, as previously described (44Jin Q.-M. Anusaksathien O. Webb S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2018432392,"Signal transduction in the NF-κB transcription factor pathway is inhibited by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) activity, although the molecular mechanism(s) are incompletely understood. We have previously shown that nitric oxide (NO), derived from NOS2 consequent upon cytokine stimulation, attenuates NF-κB p50-p65 heterodimer DNA binding and have identified the p50 monomer as a locus for inhibitory S-nitrosylation. We now show that the binding partner of p50, NF-κB p65, is also targeted by NO following cytokine stimulation of respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages and identify a conserved cysteine within the Rel homology domain that is the site for S-nitrosylation. S-Nitrosylation of p65 inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, and nuclear levels of S-nitrosylated p65 correlate with decreased DNA binding of the p50-p65 heterodimer. NOS2 regulates cytokine-induced S-nitrosylation of p65, resulting in decreased NF-κB binding to the NOS2 promoter, thereby inhibiting further NOS2 expression. Collectively, these findings delineate a mechanism by which NOS2 modulates NF-κB activity and regulates gene expression in inflammation.

Collectively, these findings delineate a mechanism by which NOS2 modulates NF-κB activity and regulates gene expression in inflammation. The transcription factor NF-κB controls the expression of many genes involved in the inflammatory response (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). One of these genes is the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) 2The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; SNO, S-nitrosothiol; SNOC, S-nitrosocysteine; RHD, Rel homology domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; KO, knockout; WT, wild type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IP, immunoprecipitate; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2. whose activity impacts the cellular response to acute injury (2Kolios G. Valatas V. Ward S.G. Immunology. 2004; 113: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The product of NOS2, nitric oxide (NO), is known to modulate NF-κB activity at multiple steps in the signal transduction pathway (3Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The primary molecular mechanism by which NO alters NF-κB signaling is via S-nitrosylation, with several different NF-κB proteins including IκB kinase β and p50 regulated by this post-translational modification (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 5Reynaert N.L. Ckless K. Korn S.H. Vos N. Guala A.S. Wouters E.F.M. van der Vliet A. Janssen-Heininger Y.M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8945-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Particularly, we have shown that p50 is S-nitrosylated under conditions of nitrosative stress and is associated with a decrease in NF-κB (p50-p65) DNA binding (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of S-nitrosylation of the NF-κB p50-p65 heterodimer in the context of cytokine signaling and cellular NOS2 expression has not been established. NOS2 expression is dependent upon NF-κB activation, with the cytokine-responsive κB-binding site(s) identified in both the human and the murine NOS2 promoters (6Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E. Ganster R.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokine-stimulated NOS2 activity, in turn, inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcription, but the specific molecular target(s) of NOS2 in the NF-κB pathway have not been elucidated (8Connelly L. Palacios-Callender M. Ameixa C. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that cytokine-induced NOS activity inhibits NF-κB DNA binding in a reversible manner, a mechanism consistent with S-nitrosylation of the p50-p65 heterodimer (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence accumulated recently suggests a central role of S-nitrosylation by NOS2 in the regulation of inflammatory mediators (9Kim S.F. Huri D.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 2005; 310: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Park H.-S. Huh S.-H. Kim M.-S. Lee S.H. Choi E.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14382-14387Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the past, the p50 monomer was felt to be the probable target for NOS2-mediated S-nitrosylation of the p50-p65 heterodimer. This rationale was based on the initial identification of a single redox-sensitive cysteine (Cys-62) located in the DNA-binding region of p50 (11Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cysteine is not only conserved throughout all Rel family members but is also found within a canonical SNO motif (12Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.-O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of a common NO-responsive site that could function to universally regulate NF-κB Rel protein-DNA binding (Fig. 1). We now show that the binding partner of p50, p65 (or RelA), is S-nitrosylated in cytokine-stimulated respiratory epithelium and macrophages and identify this conserved cysteine (Cys-38) within the DNA-binding site of the Rel homology domain (RHD) as the site of S-nitrosylation. S-Nitrosylation of p65 is dependent upon NOS2 activity, and nuclear SNO-p65 levels are inversely correlated with NF-κB p50-p65 DNA binding and NF-κB-dependent transcription. These results suggest a pathway by which NOS2 might coordinate the inflammatory response by regulating the NF-κB-dependent transcription of critical response mediators. Cell Lines and Plasmids—HEK 293 (CRL-1573), RAW 264.7 (TIB-71), and A549 (CCL-185) cells were grown in their ATCC-designated media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cultures were maintained in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from 8–12-week-old male C57BL/6 (wild type (WT)) or NOS2 knock-out (KO) (B6.129P2-Nos2tm1Lau; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) mice 72 h after intraperitoneal instillation of thioglycollate broth. The peritoneum was lavaged with ice-cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Approximately 1 × 107 cells were plated for use in the biotin switch assay. The p65 wild-type (p65wt) expression plasmid was constructed by inserting full-length human p65 cDNA (a gift from Dr. Albert Baldwin, University of North Carolina) into pDNR-CMV (Clontech) using a BamH1 restriction site. The plasmid expressing p65 with a cysteine → serine mutation at amino acid 38 (p65C38ΔS) was created utilizing a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pNFκB-Luc and pRL-CMV (Renilla luciferase) plasmids were purchased from Stratagene and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. Cell Lysates—Preparation of A549 and RAW 264.7 cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was done as outlined previously (13Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. J. Biol.

Whole cell lysates of HEK 293 cells were prepared by resuspending the harvested cells in 1 volume of cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), placing on ice for 20 min, and pelleting debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the BCA method (Pierce Biotechnology), and extracts were used immediately or stored at -80 °C. NF-κB Reporter Assay—HEK 293 cells were grown to ∼75% confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pNFκB-Luc and 0.5 μg of pRL-CMV ± 5 μg of p65wt or p65C38ΔS expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown for 24 h after transfection prior to the indicated treatments. Luciferase activity was quantitated on a TD 20/20 luminometer using a Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). NF-κB DNA Binding Assays—Nuclear protein binding to a consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit (TransAm p65, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Absorbance was read at 450 nm with samples appropriately blanked. A commercially available kit was utilized for the NF-κB chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). A rabbit antibody directed against NF-κB p65 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for immunoprecipitation. DNA input was quantified using a 10-fold dilution of the cell lysate. DNA was purified from the NF-κB ChIP eluates as well as input lysate using phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was resuspended in Tris-EDTA and subjected to PCR using primers flanking the cytokine-responsive κB site in the human NOS2 promoter (forward primer, 5′-GGGCTTATGTGGCCTAACCAA-3, and reverse primer, 5′-CCACCAGGGAACTTGAAAAA-3′) and mouse NOS2 promoter (forward primer, 5′-ACACGAGGCTGAGCTGACTT-3, and reverse primer, 5′-CATTCACACATGGCATGGA-3′). PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Residual genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed using NOS2 (forward, 5′-ACCTTGTTCAGCTACGCCTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CATTCCCAAATGTGCTTGTC-3′) or β-actin (forward, 5′-TCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTG-3′) primers and SYBR green PCR mix (iQ SYBR Green supermix, Bio-Rad Laboratories). Samples were amplified using a PCR thermocycler (iCycler, Bio-Rad), and the single color real-time PCR detection system (MyIQ, Bio-Rad). Using β-actin as a reference gene, changes in NOS2 mRNA levels between samples were determined. S-Nitrosothiol Detection Assay—A biotin switch assay for S-nitrosothiol detection was performed as described previously (14Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All steps were done with minimal light exposure. 100–250 μg of protein lysate was diluted in HEN buffer (250 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine, 1% SDS) with free thiols blocked by the addition of 3 mm methyl methane thiosulfonate followed by heating to 50 °C for 30 min. S-Nitrosothiols were labeled by the addition of 5 mm ascorbic acid and N-(6-(Biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (EZ-Link Biotin-HPDP, Pierce Biotechnology). Negative controls were prepared by the omission of ascorbic acid. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubating overnight (4 °C) with NeutrAvidin agarose beads (Pierce Biotechnology). After extensive washing, proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 95 °C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins recovered by the biotin switch assay and the input protein lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to NF-κB p65 (C-20). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Detection of S-nitrosothiols in p65 immunoprecipitates (IP) by mercury-coupled, photolysis chemiluminescence was performed using a previously described method with minor variations (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). 500 μg of protein lysate was incubated with an antibody to NF-κB p65 (C-20) for 4 h at 4 °C followed by extraction of the immunocomplexes using a commercial kit (Seize IP, Pierce Biotechnology). The IP eluates were kept on ice with limited light exposure prior to analysis of S-nitrosothiols by photolysis chemiluminescence. S-Nitrosylation of NF-κB p65—To ascertain whether the NF-κB p65 protein can be modified by S-nitrosylation in situ, we treated untransfected and p65wt-overexpressing HEK 293 cells with S-nitrosocysteine (SNOC, 500 μm) for 1 h followed by quantification of S-nitrosylated p65 (SNO-p65) levels in whole cell lysates using the biotin switch assay. SNO-p65 was detected by immunoblot in untransfected 293 cells only after SNOC treatment (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, HEK 293 cells overexpressing p65wt display some biotin labeling at baseline, indicating the possibility of constitutive S-nitrosylation, but a marked increase in SNO-p65 formation was seen after SNOC treatment. In the absence of concurrent ascorbate treatment, minimal biotin labeling of p65 was noted in the SNOC-treated, p65wt-overexpressing cells, demonstrating the specificity of the biotin switch method for quantifying SNO-p65. Further corroboration that NF-κB p65 undergoes cellular S-nitrosylation was obtained by mercury-coupled, photolysis chemiluminescence quantification of SNO in p65 IP prepared from SNOC-treated untransfected and p65wt-overexpressing HEK 293 cells. SNO was detected in the p65 IP prepared from untransfected HEK 293 cells only after SNOC treatment (Fig. 2B). In the p65wt-overexpressing cells, SNO levels in the p65 IP increased ∼3-fold (33.3 versus 12.2 nm) after SNOC treatment, further substantiating that NF-κB p65 is a target for S-nitrosylation. S-Nitrosylation of NF-κB p65 Is Dependent on Cysteine 38—Previous work has established that the NF-κB p50 monomer undergoes S-nitrosylation at cysteine 62 in the DNA-binding region of the RHD (15Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). As this cysteine is conserved in the p65 monomer (Fig. 1), we investigated whether this thiol is the target for S-nitrosylation in p65. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created a p65 expression plasmid encoding for a cysteine → serine mutant at amino acid position 38 (p65C38ΔS). We then quantified SNO-p65 levels by biotin switch in untransfected, p65wt-overexpressing, and p65C38ΔS-overexpressing HEK 293 cells with or without SNOC treatment (500 μm). Although a detectable increase in SNO-p65 levels was seen in the untransfected and p65wt-overexpressing cells after SNOC treatment, no change in biotin labeling was observed in the p65C38ΔS-overexpressing cells after SNOC. These results indicate that cysteine 38 is the site of S-nitrosylation in the NF-κB p65 protein (Fig. 3A). In addition to the RHD DNA-binding site, NF-κB p65 also contains a transactivation domain that functions to initiate NF-κB-dependent transcription when p65-containing dimers are bound to target DNA sites (16Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Altmann H. Czisch M. Holak T.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25613-25620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether S-nitrosylation of p65 results in a decrease in NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, we performed an NF-κB reporter assay in HEK 293 cells overexpressing either the p65wt or the p65C38ΔS protein. Although both p65wt and p65C38ΔS expression result in an increase in NF-κB-dependent reporter activity above control, SNOC treatment (500 μm) led to a decrease in NF-κB reporter activity only in the p65wt-expressing cells (relative luciferase activity - 38.4 (-SNOC) versus 48.9 (+SNOC), p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the prior observation that a serine substitution at the conserved cysteine in the RHD allows for Rel protein DNA binding but a loss of NO-induced binding inhibition (16Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Altmann H. Czisch M. Holak T.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25613-25620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, S-nitrosylation at Cys-38 in the p65 protein appears to be a molecular transducer for NO inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. S-Nitrosylation of NF-κB p65 in Cytokine-stimulated Cells—We have previously demonstrated dithiothreitol-reversible, NO-induced inhibition of NF-κB (p50-p65) DNA binding in cytokine-stimulated A549 and RAW 264.7 cells, consistent with S-nitrosylation of the p50-p65 heterodimer (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 13Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34223-34228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using the biotin switch assay, we now confirm the presence of S-nitrosylated NF-κB p65 in both the cytoplasm and, more importantly, the nucleus of cytokine-stimulated A549 and RAW 264.7 cells. In unstimulated cells, p65 is primarily sequestered in the cytoplasm (presumably bound to IκBα) with a modest degree of basal S-nitrosylation observed in the A549 cells (Fig. 4A). Upon cytokine stimulation, NF-κB p65 undergoes nuclear translocation associated with an increase in NF-κB p65 DNA binding (Fig. 4B). However, at 8 h after stimulation, both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear p65 pools show increased S-nitrosylation in conjunction with the induction of cellular NOS2 expression (Fig. 4A). The increase in nuclear SNO-p65 at 8 h after stimulation coincides with a decrease in NF-κB DNA binding (when compared with 1 h after stimulation) despite there being no change in the total amount of nuclear p65, indicating that cytoplasmic activation of NF-κB is not being affected (Fig. 4B). Thus, S-nitrosylation of NF-κB p65 within the nucleus appears to be a mechanism by which NF-κB DNA binding is regulated in cytokine-stimulated cells. NOS2 Activity Regulates S-Nitrosylation of p65 and NF-κB DNA Binding—Our prior investigations have shown that NOS2 activity inhibits NF-κB signaling in cytokine-stimulated cells by a mechanism consistent with S-nitrosylation of p50-p65 (4Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These observations, along with the fact that cytokine-induced NOS2 expression in A549 and RAW 264.7 cells coincides with a rise in nuclear SNO-p65 levels (Fig. 4A), led us to investigate whether SNO-p65 formation in these cells is NOS2-dependent. Cells were stimulated with cytokines with or without the addition of the NOS2-specific inhibitor 1400W (100 μm). A marked decrease in nuclear SNO-p65 was seen in both cell lines co-treated with 1400W at 8 h after stimulation, indicating that NOS2 activity mediates SNO-p65 formation in cytokine-stimulated cells (Fig. 5A). To determine whether NOS2 inhibition in cytokine-stimulated cells leads to a decrease in NF-κB binding to target promoter sites, we utilized an NF-κB (p65) ChIP assay. We demonstrate that cytokine stimulation of A549 and RAW 264.7 cells results in an increase in NF-κB binding to the cytokine-responsive NF-κB sites in the NOS2 promoter (Fig. 5B). If the cytokine-stimulated cells are treated concurrently with 1400W (100 μm), NF-κB DNA binding to these κB promoter sites is further augmented. Moreover, the increase in NF-κB binding to the NOS2 promoter elicited by NOS2 inhibition translates into higher cellular NOS2 mRNA transcription and protein expression (Fig. 5, C and D). To further establish that NOS2 regulates SNO-p65 formation, we quantified SNO-p65 levels in cell lysates prepared from peritoneal macrophages that were harvested from WT (C57BL/6) or NOS2 KO mice. SNO-p65 levels were markedly lower in the NOS2 KO peritoneal macrophages when compared with WT macrophages, both at baseline and after cytokine stimulation, despite an increase in total p65 expression in the NOS2 KO macrophages (Fig. 5E). The decrease in SNO-p65 formation seen in the NOS2 KO macrophages also correlated with an increase in NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 5F). Collectively, these data indicate that NOS2 functions to control S-nitrosylation of NF-κB p50-p65 in the cell. The present study identifies the NF-κB p65 monomer as a target of S-nitrosylation by NOS2 and links the nuclear accumulation of SNO-p65 with inhibition of NF-κB. NF-κB, thus, joins a growing list of immunomodulators that are regulated by NOS2 through S-nitrosylation. In particular, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) undergoes S-nitrosylation via direct interaction with NOS2 in cytokine-stimulated macrophages (9Kim S.F. Huri D.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 2005; 310: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). NOS2 thereby increases COX-2 activity and augments prostaglandin production. In contrast, cytokine-induced, NOS2-mediated S-nitrosylation inhibits the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and the serine kinase Akt, altering the cellular stress response (10Park H.-S. Huh S.-H. Kim M.-S. Lee S.H. Choi E.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14382-14387Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Carvalho-Filho M.A. Ueno M. Carvalheira J.B.C. Velloso L.A. Saad M.J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E476-E482Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, COX-2, JNK1, and Akt have also been shown to influence NF-κB signaling (18Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 19Poligone B. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is increasingly apparent that regulation of inflammation is a primary function for NOS2. Given that NF-κB controls the expression of numerous cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, cell surface receptors, and apoptotic mediators (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of NOS2-mediated S-nitrosylation of NF-κB p65 would be expected to attenuate inflammation. Indeed, selective inhibition of NOS2 has been shown to enhance tissue inflammation in response to acute injury in the lung and other organ systems (21McCartney-Francis N.L. Song X.-y. Mizel D.E. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2734-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Dikopoulos N. Nussler A.K. Liptay S. Bachem M. Reinshagen M. Stiegler M. Schmid R.M. Adler G. Weidenbach H.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2940-2946PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mice with genetic deletion of NOS2 have also demonstrated a more pronounced inflammatory response (24Fenyk-Melody J.E. Garrison A.E. Brunnert S.R. Weidner J.R. Shen F. Shelton B.A. Mudgett J.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2940-2946PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zeidler P.C. Millecchia L.M. Castranova V. Toxicol. Appl.

Transplant. 2007; 7: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to ameliorating inflammation, inhibitory S-nitrosylation of NF-κB p65 would also serve to prevent nitrosative injury by curtailing continued κB-dependent NOS2 expression and cellular NO production. In fact, NOS2 expression has been shown to be augmented in cytokine-stimulated macrophages treated with NOS inhibitors (28Peng H.-B. Spiecker M. Liao J.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1970-1976PubMed Google Scholar), a finding we confirm in our present studies (Fig. 5D), thus linking S-nitrosylation of p65 to the regulation of NOS2 expression. The fact that two of the five Rel proteins (p65 and p50) have now been shown to be S-nitrosylated at a cysteine conserved in all NF-κB Rel family members implies a general mechanism by which NO might regulate Rel protein-DNA interactions. Prior studies have shown that this cysteine within the RHD must be reduced in order for the NF-κB heterodimer (p50-p65) to bind to specific κB promoter sequences (11Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). NOS2-mediated S-nitrosylation of this cysteine could function to inhibit Rel protein DNA binding, thereby affecting the transcription of a broad range of inflammatory mediators. Importantly, all of the Rel proteins are also known to modulate NOS2 transcription (7Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cieslik K.A. Deng W.-G. Wu K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Cruz M.T. Duarte C.B. Goncalo M. Figueiredo A. Carvalho A.P. Lopes M.C. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NF-κB serves as a prototype of transcription factors whose DNA binding is dependent upon the redox status of protein thiols with several of these transcriptional regulators, including AP-1, Sp1, and cAMP-response element-binding protein, also demonstrating NO-sensitive DNA binding (3Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In addition, a growing number of transcription factors have been shown to be modified by S-nitrosylation (31Gao C. Guo H. Wei J. Mi Z. Wai P. Kuo P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Hongo F. Garban H. Huerta-Yepez S. Vega M. Jazirehi A.R. Mizutani Y. Miki T. Bonavida B. Biochem.

These observations implicate targeted S-nitrosylation as a common mechanism by which gene transcription is controlled. Interestingly, thioredoxin, a protein that governs the redox status of the NF-κB p50-p65 heterodimer, both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, is itself regulated by S-nitrosylation (35Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In cytokine-stimulated endothelium, S-nitrosylation of thioredoxin has been shown to accelerate thioredoxin activity, which would be expected to promote DNA binding of NF-κB. In this context, SNO-thioredoxin (or perhaps the SNO-metabolizing enzyme, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (36Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar)) may play a role in the denitrosylation of cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 and IκB kinase β that is seen upon cytokine stimulation of A549 (Fig. 4A) and Jurkat T cells (5Reynaert N.L. Ckless K. Korn S.H. Vos N. Guala A.S. Wouters E.F.M. van der Vliet A. Janssen-Heininger Y.M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8945-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), respectively. However, NOS2 is unlikely to mediate the constitutive S-nitrosylation of NF-κB proteins as it is only expressed in the cell after cytokine activation. Recent observations implicate dynamic NOS protein-protein interaction in targeting proteins for S-nitrosylation. For example, NOS2 must bind directly to COX-2 in cytokine-stimulated macrophages to induce S-nitrosylation (9Kim S.F. Huri D.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 2005; 310: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, which is physiologically inhibited by S-nitrosylation, may also bind to NOS2, in this case, in a NO-dependent manner (37Matsumoto A. Comatas K.E. Liu L. Stamler J.S. Science. 2003; 301: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Dexras1 and dynamin are regulated by S-nitrosylation in the context of protein interactions with NOS1 and NOS3, respectively (38Wang G. Moniri N.H. Ozawa K. Stamler J.S. Daaka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Cheah J.H. Kim S.F. Hester L.D. Clancy K.W. Patterson III, S.E. Papadopoulos V. Snyder S.H.

Although we have noted cellular co-localization of NF-κB p65 with NOS2 in both A549 and RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown), direct protein-protein interaction has not been confirmed nor linked with S-nitrosylation of p65. Future investigations will examine this question as well as NOS2 interaction with other NF-κB proteins and transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2020915761,"During gestation there is a high demand for the essential nutrient choline. Adult rats supplemented with choline during embryonic days (E) 11-17 have improved memory performance and do not exhibit age-related memory decline, whereas prenatally choline-deficient animals have memory deficits. Choline, via betaine, provides methyl groups for the production of S-adenosylmethionine, a substrate of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). We describe an apparently adaptive epigenomic response to varied gestational choline supply in rat fetal liver and brain. S-Adenosylmethionine levels increased in both organs of E17 fetuses whose mothers consumed a choline-supplemented diet. Surprisingly, global DNA methylation increased in choline-deficient animals, and this was accompanied by overexpression of Dnmt1 mRNA. Previous studies showed that the prenatal choline supply affects the expression of multiple genes, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), whose expression is regulated in a DNA methylation-dependent manner. The differentially methylated region 2 of Igf2 was hypermethylated in the liver of E17 choline-deficient fetuses, and this as well as Igf2 mRNA levels correlated with the expression of Dnmt1 and with hypomethylation of a regulatory CpG within the Dnmt1 locus. Moreover, mRNA expression of brain and liver Dnmt3a and methyl CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) protein as well as cerebral Dnmt3l was inversely correlated to the intake of choline. Thus, choline deficiency modulates fetal DNA methylation machinery in a complex fashion that includes hypomethylation of the regulatory CpGs within the Dnmt1 gene, leading to its overexpression and the resultant increased global and gene-specific (e.g. Igf2) DNA methylation. These epigenomic responses to gestational choline supply may initiate the long term developmental changes observed in rats exposed to varied choline intake in utero."
https://openalex.org/W2016532893,"Fatty acid nitration by nitric oxide-derived species yields electrophilic products that adduct protein thiols, inducing changes in protein function and distribution. Nitro-fatty acid adducts of protein and reduced glutathione (GSH) are detected in healthy human blood. Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses reveal that nitroalkene derivatives of oleic acid (OA-NO2) and linoleic acid (LNO2) rapidly react with GSH and Cys via Michael addition reaction. Rates of OA-NO2 and LNO2 reaction with GSH, determined via stopped flow spectrophotometry, displayed second-order rate constants of 183 M(-1)S(-1) and 355 M(-1)S(-1), respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. These reaction rates are significantly greater than those for GSH reaction with hydrogen peroxide and non-nitrated electrophilic fatty acids including 8-iso-prostaglandin A2 and 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2. Increasing reaction pH from 7.4 to 8.9 enhanced apparent second-order rate constants for the thiol reaction with OA-NO2 and LNO2, showing dependence on the thiolate anion of GSH for reactivity. Rates of nitroalkene reaction with thiols decreased as the pKa of target thiols increased. Increasing concentrations of the detergent octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside decreased rates of nitroalkene reaction with GSH, indicating that the organization of nitro-fatty acids into micellar or membrane structures can limit Michael reactivity with more polar nucleophilic targets. In aggregate, these results reveal that the reversible adduction of thiols by nitro-fatty acids is a mechanism for reversible post-translational regulation of protein function by nitro-fatty acids."

Although several analgesic conotoxins have already reached human clinical trials, a continuing need exists for the discovery and development of novel non-opioid analgesics, such as subtype-selective sodium channel blockers. μ-Conotoxin KIIIA is representative of μ-conopeptides previously characterized as inhibitors of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium channels in amphibian dorsal root ganglion neurons. Here, we show that KIIIA has potent analgesic activity in the mouse pain model. Surprisingly, KIIIA was found to block most (>80%) of the TTX-sensitive, but only ∼20% of the TTX-resistant, sodium current in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. KIIIA was tested on cloned mammalian channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 were strongly blocked; within experimental wash times of 40–60 min, block was reversed very little for NaV1.2 and only partially for NaV1.6. Other isoforms were blocked reversibly: NaV1.3 (IC50 8 μm), NaV1.5 (IC50 284 μm), and NaV1.4 (IC50 80 nm). “Alanine-walk” and related analogs were synthesized and tested against both NaV1.2 and NaV1.4; replacement of Trp-8 resulted in reversible block of NaV1.2, whereas replacement of Lys-7, Trp-8, or Asp-11 yielded a more profound effect on the block of NaV1.4 than of NaV1.2. Taken together, these data suggest that KIIIA is an effective tool to study structure and function of NaV1.2 and that further engineering of μ-conopeptides belonging to the KIIIA group may provide subtype-selective pharmacological compounds for mammalian neuronal sodium channels and potential therapeutics for the treatment of pain. Peptide neurotoxins from cone snails continue to supply compounds with therapeutic potential. Although several analgesic conotoxins have already reached human clinical trials, a continuing need exists for the discovery and development of novel non-opioid analgesics, such as subtype-selective sodium channel blockers. μ-Conotoxin KIIIA is representative of μ-conopeptides previously characterized as inhibitors of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium channels in amphibian dorsal root ganglion neurons. Here, we show that KIIIA has potent analgesic activity in the mouse pain model.

This group of conotoxins includes μ-conotoxin SmIIIA from Conus stercusmuscarum and μ-conotoxin KIIIA from Conus kinoshitai (Fig. 1). Structural and functional studies on peptides in this group to date suggest that amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of these peptides, including Trp and His (see Table 1), are important for function (19West P.J. Bulaj G. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Keizer D.W. West P.J. Lee E.F. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G.

It is widely believed that TTX-r sodium channels are potential molecular targets for analgesic therapy (23Wood J.N. Boorman J.P. Okuse K. Baker M.D. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 24Dib-Hajj S. Black J.A. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 253-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nerves of mammals, there are two TTX-r subtypes, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9; a variety of data suggest that these may participate in pain signaling. Thus, inhibition of TTX-r channels is a postulated analgesic mechanism that needs to be experimentally evaluated. Given the ability of the KIIIA group of μ-conotoxins to inhibit amphibian TTX-r sodium channels, we tested whether μ-conotoxin KIIIA is analgesic and demonstrate that, as predicted, it has analgesic activity. However, when we evaluated the specificity of μ-conotoxin KIIIA against various mammalian sodium channel subtypes, we found that this peptide blocked only a minor fraction of the total TTX-r sodium channel currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) but it blocked, almost irreversibly, rat Nav1.2 neuronal sodium channels. Our results validate the KIIIA group of μ-conotoxins as a rich pharmacopoeia of selective blockers of mammalian neuronal sodium channels and as potential therapeutics for treatment of pain and other neurological disorders. Molecular Modeling—An initial model of KIIIA was created with the MODELLER (6v2) program using the structure of SmIIIA (Protein Data Bank accession code 1Q2J, representative structure 13) as a template, following the procedure described earlier (20Bulaj G. West P.J. Garrett J.E. Watkins M. Zhang M.M. Norton R.S. Smith B.J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7259-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Zhang M.M. Fiedler B.

Analogs were built into the initial model of KIIIA using InsightII (Accelrys, 2000). All structures were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation using the GROMACS (v3.3.1) package of programs applying a similar approach as had been used to model KIIIA previously. All simulations consisted of an initial minimization of water molecules followed by 100 ps of molecular dynamics with the peptide fixed. The restraints on the peptide were then removed and molecular dynamics continued for a further 10 ns. Chemical Synthesis of Conotoxins—Conotoxin analogs were synthesized on solid support using standard Fmoc protocols as described previously (20Bulaj G. West P.J. Garrett J.E. Watkins M. Zhang M.M. Norton R.S. Smith B.J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7259-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The identities of peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Oxidative folding was carried out for 2 h in buffered solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm reduced and 1 mm oxidized glutathione. The refolded peptides were purified by semipreparative HPLC. Inflammatory Pain Assay—Swiss Webster mice (ranging from 25 to 30 g) were placed in individual open glass cylinders for observation. Fifteen minutes prior to intraplantar injection of 10 μl of 4.4% formalin into one hind paw, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 or 20 nmol of test peptide or saline solution (vehicle control). Mice (two at a time) were observed for 50 min, and paw-licking time was determined every 5 min in 2-min intervals. The acute (first) phase of the nociceptive response was quantified within the first 5 min. The inflammatory (second) phase was quantified from 20–30 min. For each dose of peptide, at least four animals were tested. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah. Whole Cell Voltage Clamping of Mouse DRG Neurons—Adult mouse (Swiss Webster) DRG neurons were dissociated and voltage-clamped as described previously (21Zhang M.M. Fiedler B. Green B.R. Catlin P. Watkins M. Garrett J.E. Smith B.J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracellular solution was (in mm): NaCl, 140; KCl, 3; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; HEPES, 20; pH 7.3. Recording pipettes (1–2 mΩ) contained (in mm): CsF, 140; NaCl, 10; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10; pH 7.3. TTX-sensitive currents were recorded from large neurons whose sodium currents could be totally blocked by 1 μm TTX, and TTX-resistant currents were recorded from small neurons in the presence of 1 μm TTX. Conotoxins were dissolved in extracellular solution, and toxin exposures were conducted in static baths. The membrane potential was held at -80 mV, and sodium channels were activated by a 50-ms test pulse to 0 mV, applied every 20 s. Each test pulse was preceded by a -120 mV prepulse lasting 50 ms. Current signals were low pass-filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz, and leak-subtracted by a P/6 protocol using in-house software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Single-channel Recordings from Planar Lipid Bilayers—Membrane fractions containing voltage-gated sodium channels from rat brain were isolated using standard procedures (25Hui K. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Krueger B.K. Worley III, J.F. French R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 479: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C. Prior to experiments, membrane fractions were incubated with batrachotoxin (1 μm) for a minimum of 1 h. A horizontal chamber was used with two compartments (each ∼200 μl) for the “extracellular” and “intracellular” solutions, separated by a plastic partition penetrated by a hole of diameter ∼60–100 μm. The current offset was set to zero in symmetric solutions before forming the bilayer. The bilayer was formed by painting a solution of lipid across the hole (50 mg of total lipid/ml in decane, POPE:POPC, 4:1). Lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Records were made at room temperature using symmetrical solutions of (concentrations in mm) NaCl, 200; MOPS, 10; and EDTA, 0.1; pH 7.0. Aliquots of membrane fractions (∼1 μl) were pipetted directly over the bilayer, and incorporation of a single channel was detected as an increase in current amplitude of ∼1 pA at ± 60 mV. Channel orientation was deduced from the increased frequency of closures at -70 mV (extracellular side defined as 0 mV). Toxin was added to the extracellular side at 500 nm by perfusing the appropriate chamber with toxin-containing solution (2 × 400 μl), and toxin-blocking events were observed as step decreases in single-channel amplitude. Data were collected and analyzed using pClamp 9.2 software, an Axopatch 200 amplifier, a Digidata 1322A acquisition system (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA), and SigmaPlot 8.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Generation of NaV Clones and RNA Preparation—The cDNA clones were kindly provided by Drs. Alan Goldin and Gail Mandel. Approximately 20 ng of cDNA for each Nav channel isoform was transfected into electrocompetent cells and plated on an agar plate with the antibiotic. Ten clones were picked and grown overnight in 5 ml of Luria Bertani medium. Of the 10 inoculated media, the cDNA was isolated from five and screened by BamHI digestion. One clone from each that yielded the correct fragments was grown in 50 ml of Luria Bertani medium with the antibiotic to obtain enough cDNA for sequencing. The correct cDNA for each isoform was linearized with NotI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) for generation of capped cRNA. The cRNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentration of the cRNA was determined by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm using a Milton Roy Spectronic 1001. Harvesting, cRNA Injection, and Voltage Clamping of Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were harvested, prepared, and injected with cRNA as previously described (27Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A given oocyte was injected with 30 nl of cRNA for one of the following sodium channel isoforms: rNaV1.2, rNaV1.3, rNaV1.4, rNaV1.5, mNaV1.6, or rNaV1.7 (1.5, 15, 0.6, 3, 30, or 15 ng, respectively). Oocytes were two-electrode voltage-clamped using microelectrodes containing 3 m KCl (<0.5 mΩ). Sodium currents were acquired using a holding potential of -80 mV and stepping to a value between -20 and 0 mV (depending on NaV subtype) for 50 ms every 20 s and processed as described above for clamping of neurons. Toxin exposures were in static baths to conserve material. Off-rate constants were determined from single-exponential fits of the time course of recovery from block following peptide washout, and the on-rate constants were obtained from the slopes of kobs versus [peptide] as done previously (19West P.J. Bulaj G. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Yoshikami D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression and electrophysiological measurements of rNav1.8 channels were performed as described in Ref. 15Bulaj G. Zhang M.M. Green B.R. Fiedler B. Layer R.T. Wei S. Nielsen J.S. Low S.J. Klein B.D. Wagstaff J.D. Chicoine L. Harty T.P. Terlau H. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7404-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar. All electrophysiological recordings were conducted at room temperature (∼20 °C). KIIIA Is a Potent Analgesic Compound—Because many sodium channel blockers possess analgesic activity, and KIIIA was found to block TTX-r sodium channels in amphibian preparations (20Bulaj G. West P.J. Garrett J.E. Watkins M. Zhang M.M. Norton R.S. Smith B.J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7259-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we first tested this peptide for analgesic activity following systemic delivery in the formalin-induced pain assay in mice. As shown in Fig. 2, intraperitoneal injection of KIIIA significantly reduced paw licking during both phase I and phase II. Compared with lidocaine (20 mg/kg-1 intraperitoneal, ∼3 times the normal maximum systemic dose for adult humans), KIIIA appeared to be a more effective analgesic, in particular during phase II, which reflects inflammatory pain. This analgesic effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 2B), with an ED50 of 1.6 nmol/mouse (equivalent of 0.1 mg/kg). Using a rotarod test, no motor impairment was observed at a dose of 3 nmol, indicating a separation of the toxic and analgesic activity of the peptide; some motor impairment, but no apparent paralytic activity, was found at the highest dose of KIIIA tested, 10 nmol. Unexpected Specificity of KIIIA for Cloned Rat and Mouse Sodium Channels—We examined the ability of KIIIA to block sodium channels in mouse DRG neurons. As shown in Fig. 3, KIIIA (5 μm) largely blocked (>80%) TTX-sensitive (TTX-s) but only partially blocked (∼20%) TTX-r sodium channels. Increasing the concentration of KIIIA to 50 μm did not yield any additional block of the TTX-r sodium current in DRG neurons. Consistent with the above observations, only TTX-s A-compound action potentials were abolished by 5 μm KIIIA, whereas C-compound action potentials were slowed and only slightly attenuated by the toxin. C-compound action potentials that persist in the presence of TTX were unaffected by KIIIA (data not shown). KIIIA also caused discrete block of unitary currents from NaV channels incorporated into lipid bilayers from rat brain membranes (Fig. 4). These records showed no dissociation (unblocking) transitions in 63 min of recorded blocked time from four experiments, placing a lower limit on the mean blocked time of 15.8 ± 5.8 min (mean ± S.E.). Thus, block is effectively irreversible on the experimental time scale. The small residual unblocked current, seen in Fig. 4 for the KIIIA-bound channel, parallels single-channel and whole cell data for some derivatives of μ-GIIIA (28French R.J. Prusak-Sochaczewski E. Zamponi G.W. Becker S. Kularatna A.S. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the residual TTX-s current at high KIIIA concentrations in Figs. 3A and 5A.FIGURE 5Block by KIIIA and its analogs of rNaV1.2 and 1.4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A, representative traces from voltage-clamp recordings were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” KIIIA and the analogs were each tested at a concentration of 1 μm on oocytes expressing rNaV1.2 or rNaV1.4. In each panel, the top row shows superimposed recordings before (control, gray trace) and during (black trace) exposure to indicated peptide. The bottom row shows the time course of block and recovery, where the black bar above each plot indicates when the peptide was present. Block by KIIIA of rNaV1.2 was irreversible but that of rNaV1.4 was reversible. B, comparison of the activity of KIIIA and its analogs against rNaV1.2 and 1.4. Modification of residues in the N-terminal portion of the peptide had minimal effects in contrast to those in the C-terminal portion. Remarkably, the K7A substitution attenuated the activity against rNaV1.4 but not rNaV1.2. Mean and S.D. values were calculated from at least three independent experiments using Excel software. C, comparison of the block of six NaVs by KIIIA and K7A. All NaVs were from rat, except NaV1.6, which was from mouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the activity of KIIIA on mammalian sodium channels in further detail, various cloned α-subunits of rat or mouse sodium channels were expressed in oocytes. Fig. 5A illustrates representative traces of the block of rNaV1.2 and 1.4 by KIIIA, and Table 2 summarizes the results with seven subtypes of sodium channels. All five neuronal subtypes tested, rNav1.1, rNav1.2, rNav1.3, mNav1.6, and rNav1.7, were blocked by KIIIA: rNav1.2 was essentially irreversibly blocked with a kon of 0.3 μm-1·min-1. In contrast to rNav1.2, rNav1.3 was reversibly inhibited with an IC50 of 8 μm. Inhibition of rNav1.1 and rNav1.7 was characterized by very slow on- and off-rates. The skeletal muscle subtype rNav1.4 was reversibly blocked with a relatively fast on-rate and a calculated KD of 0.05 μm, close to the IC50 of 0.08 μm. Interestingly, KIIIA was significantly less potent against heart muscle subtype rNav1.5 (estimated IC50 284 μm).

Two analogs of KIIIA contained additional two-amino acid extensions at the N terminus, ZN- or ZR- (where Z is pyroglutamate), as found in the related μ-conotoxins SIIIA and SmIIIA, respectively (Table 1). All analogs were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry and subjected to the oxidative folding procedure used previously to produce KIIIA (20Bulaj G. West P.J. Garrett J.E. Watkins M. Zhang M.M. Norton R.S. Smith B.J. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7259-7265Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When the folding was performed in the presence of oxidized and reduced glutathione, a number of the analogs yielded one major oxidation product, but several analogs produced two folded species in approximately equal quantities (supplemental Fig. S1). To assess which of the two products was more likely to be the correctly folded form with the native connectivity of disulfide bridges, we compared functional and structural properties of both products. The individual folding species were tested for their ability to block rNav1.2 sodium channels expressed in oocytes and also analyzed by 1H NMR (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). For each analog, a single product was significantly more active than others present, suggesting that it was likely to be the correctly folded form. The correct folding of these analogs was confirmed by one-dimensional 1H NMR. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the introduced replacements (such as W8A) should not affect the conformation of the peptide and that selected misfolded forms (containing non-native disulfide bridges) should differ in overall conformation from the native one (data not shown). For the analyses of structure-activity relationships, the most active folding product of each mutant was used in subsequent experiments.TABLE 3Inhibition of rNaV1.2 and rNaV1.4 by KIIIA and its analogs Standard deviation was calculated from at least three independent experiments using Excel software.

E., Deriy, L. V., Li, C., Szeto, F. L., Chen, Y., Huang, P., Tong, J., Naren, A. P., Bindokas, V., Palfrey, H. C., and Nelson, D. J. (2006) Nat. Cell Biol. 8, 933–944). Here we determined whether the CFTR chloride channel is a generalized pathway for chloride entry into phagosomes in macrophages and whether mutations in CFTR could contribute to alveolar macrophage dysfunction. The pH of mature phagolysosomes in macrophages was measured by fluorescence ratio imaging using a zymosan conjugate containing Oregon Green® 488 and tetramethylrhodamine. Acidification of phagolysosomes in J774A.1 macrophages (pH ∼5.1 at 45 min), murine alveolar macrophages (pH ∼5.3), and human alveolar macrophages (pH ∼5.3) was insensitive to CFTR inhibition by the thiazolidinone CFTRinh-172. Acidification of phagolysosomes in alveolar macrophages isolated from mice homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR, the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis, was not different compared with that in alveolar macrophages isolated from wild-type mice. We also measured the kinetics of phagosomal acidification in J774A.1 and murine alveolar macrophages using a zymosan conjugate containing fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine. Phagosomal acidification began within 3 min of zymosan binding and was complete within ∼15 min of internalization. The rate of phagosomal acidification in J774A.1 cells was not slowed by CFTRinh-172 and was not different in alveolar macrophages from wild-type versus ΔF508-CFTR mice. Our data indicate that phagolysosomal acidification in macrophages is not dependent on CFTR channel activity and do not support a proposed mechanism for cystic fibrosis lung disease involving defective phagosomal acidification and bacterial killing in alveolar macrophages. It was reported recently that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is required for acidification of phagosomes in alveolar macrophages (Di, A., Brown, M. E., Deriy, L. V., Li, C., Szeto, F. L., Chen, Y., Huang, P., Tong, J., Naren, A. P., Bindokas, V., Palfrey, H. C., and Nelson, D. J. (2006) Nat. Cell Biol. 8, 933–944).

Chronic lung infection and deterioration of lung function are the major causes of morbidity and death in cystic fibrosis (CF) 2The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

Med. 2005; 352: 1992-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Although the genetic defect in CF was identified in 1989 (mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)), the mechanisms by which CFTR mutations cause lung disease remain uncertain. Various mechanisms have been proposed to link defective CFTR function to CF lung disease, such as defective airway submucosal gland secretion, abnormal airway surface liquid composition or oxygenation, Na+ hyperabsorption producing airway surface liquid dehydration (reduced airway surface liquid volume), loss of CFTR regulation of other transport proteins, and intrinsic hyperinflammation (reviewed in Refs. 3Verkman A.S.

Determination of the mechanisms linking defective CFTR function to CF lung disease is of great importance in developing rational therapies to treat CF. A recent report of defective phagolysosomal acidification in alveolar macrophages in CFTR null mice suggested a new mechanism to link defective CFTR function to CF lung disease (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Macrophages are key protagonists of the innate immune system and patrol the body, including the alveolar surface, to engulf and destroy pathogens in their phagolysosomes (8Delves P.J. Kim I.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 9Zhang P. Kim W.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Immunol.

It is interesting that no defect in bactericidal activity was observed in peritoneal macrophages from CFTR null mice, suggesting that CFTR-dependent acidification of phagolysosomes is specific to alveolar macrophages. Although the authors made no direct connection between CFTR mutations, acidification of phagosomes in alveolar macrophages, and CF disease progression, the prevailing view has emerged that defective alveolar macrophage function is important in the pathophysiology of CF lung disease (11de Jonge H.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 7-8Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 12Steinberg B.E. Kim N. Vargas-Caballero M. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we use ratiometric, fluorescent zymosan and dextran conjugates to determine the role of CFTR in the acidification of phagolysosomes in macrophages. In J774A.1 macrophages, phagolysosomal and lysosomal acidification was not dependent upon CFTR chloride conductance. We also found that phagolysosomal acidification was not dependent on CFTR channel activity in murine and human alveolar macrophages and was not different in ΔF508-CFTR murine alveolar macrophages. As such, CFTR channel activity is not required for phagosomal acidification in macrophages. Cells—J774A.1 murine macrophages (ATCC TIB-67), which are of peritoneal origin, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H-21 using standard procedures. Alveolar macrophages were freshly isolated from wild-type and CF (ΔF508-CFTR homozygous) mice in a CD1 genetic background. Briefly, mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine, and alveolar macrophages were obtained immediately by bronchoalveolar lavage (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y.

Mice were provided by the CF Animal Core Facility of the University of California, San Francisco. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained by lavage of lungs that were rejected for lung transplantation as part of the California Transplant Program. Alveolar macrophages were identified by standard morphological criteria and confirmed by the uptake of non-opsonized zymosan. Fluorescent Probe Synthesis—Ratioable, pH-sensitive, fluorescent probes for measurement of phagolysosomal and lysosomal pH were synthesized using standard succinimidyl ester chemistry. Oregon Green® 488-X or 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was covalently coupled to zymosan (Sigma) together with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). For lysosomal pH determination, Oregon Green® 488-X and TMR were conjugated to 40-kDa amino dextran (Invitrogen). For each probe, TMR is a pH-insensitive marker of conjugate uptake to allow ratio imaging. Cell Labeling, in Situ Calibration, and Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging—For measurement of the pH of mature phagolysosomes, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Oregon Green® 488/TMR-zymosan for 30–45 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 6 mm glucose and 1 mm pyruvate (PBS/Glc/Pyr), washed three to five times with PBS, and imaged. To label lysosomes, cells were incubated with 4–10 mg/ml Oregon Green® 488/TMR-dextran for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS/Glc/Pyr, washed, and incubated in PBS/Glc/Pyr for 2 h at 37 °C to chase dextran to lysosomes. The kinetics of phagosomal acidification was measured using a method based on published protocols to synchronize the uptake of phagocytic substrates (12Steinberg B.E. Kim N. Vargas-Caballero M.

Cells were washed with 4 °C PBS/Glc/Pyr and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein/TMR-zymosan at 4 °C for 20–30 min. 5 volumes of 37 °C PBS/Glc/Pyr were then added to the cells, and internalization of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein/TMR-zymosan was allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C before washing the cells four times with 4 °C PBS/Glc/Pyr to remove zymosan that had not internalized. Cells were kept at 4 °C for up to 2 h prior to experiments. The temperature was raised to 37 °C just prior to microscopy, and initial images were acquired 3 min after internalization began. All imaging experiments were performed in PBS/Glc/Pyr. In some experiments, the thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 was used at 10 μm, or the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 was used at 100 nm. Inhibitors were present during cell loading, chase, and experiments. In situ calibration experiments were done to relate fluorescence ratios to pH. After loading (as described above), cells with labeled phagolysosomes or lysosomes were incubated for 30–40 min at 37 °C in calibration buffer (5 mm Hepes, 5 mm potassium citrate, 120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 nm bafilomycin A1, 10 μm nigericin, 10 μm valinomycin, and 10 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) at pH 2.5–8.6. Background-corrected fluorescence ratios at different pH values were fitted to the following equation: Fgreen/Fred = A + B((1 + 10(pKa-pH)nH)-1). Microscopy—Fluorescence images were acquired on a Nikon TE2000U microscope equipped with a 100×/numerical aperture 1.45 Plan Apo TIRF objective, an EXFO X-Cite light source, a Hamamatsu EM-CCD camera, a UNIBLITZ shutter, and a microincubator to maintain cells at 37 °C during data acquisition. Sequential, wide-field images of cells were captured using Chroma 31001 and 31002 filter sets. Neutral density filters were placed in the excitation light path to attenuate illumination intensity, and the absence of photobleaching was confirmed in control experiments by stable fluorescence of labeled cells during continuous illumination. For kinetic experiments, illumination light was shuttered in between data acquisition. Images of representative cells containing phagocytosed Oregon Green® 488/TMR-zymosan were obtained using a Nikon TE2000S microscope equipped for phase-contrast and fluorescence imaging and a Hamamatsu EM-CCD camera. Cells were incubated with fluorescent zymosan for 45 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS prior to imaging. As we reported in prior studies of endosomal pH and chloride (17Sonawane N. Kim J.R. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5506-5513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Sonawane N.D. Kim A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Zen K. Kim J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), standard image analysis was performed by computing area-integrated, background-subtracted fluorescence intensities for specified regions of interest using NIH ImageJ software. To measure the pH of mature phagolysosomes, we synthesized a fluorescent pH indicator consisting of Oregon Green® 488 (pKa ∼4.7) and TMR covalently bound to zymosan (Fig. 1A, inset). The pKa of Oregon Green® 488 renders it pH-sensitive at or near the acidic pH of mature macrophage phagolysosomes and allows accurate measurement of phagolysosomal pH by two-color ratio imaging. Unlike Di et al. (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), we chose a ratiometric approach to measure phagosomal pH such that our measurements were insensitive to probe concentration. To calibrate the pH probe, we incubated J774A.1 macrophages with the zymosan conjugate for 45 min to allow internalization of the probe and subsequent maturation of phagolysosomes. Labeled cells were then washed and exposed to solutions at the specified pH containing ionophores to equilibrate the extracellular and intraphagosomal pH. The pKa determined for Oregon Green® 488 by ratio imaging of cells at different pH values agreed with that determined in vitro (Fig. 1A), indicating that the zymosan conjugate faithfully reports phagolysosomal pH. We initially measured the pH of phagolysosomes in J774A.1 murine macrophages, which were reported previously to express CFTR by biochemical, electrophysiological, and immunocytochemical criteria (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Following incubation of J774A.1 macrophages with fluorescent zymosan, fluorescently labeled phagolysosomes were seen through the green and red channels as shown in Fig. 1B, which are shown along with a pH pseudocolored ratio image. The intensity of individual phagolysosomes varied greatly, indicating that zymosan uptake and/or size varies in phagosomes. Averaged data for many cells indicated that phagolysosomes attained an acidic pH of 5.08 ± 0.08 (Fig. 1C, left), in agreement with previous studies (12Steinberg B.E. Kim N. Vargas-Caballero M.

Immunity. 2005; 23: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To assess the CFTR dependence of phagolysosomal acidification in J774A.1 macrophages, we labeled cells with Oregon Green® 488/TMR-zymosan in the presence of 10 μm CFTRinh-172, a selective inhibitor active against CFTR from different species, including human and mouse (22Ma T. Kim J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Phagolysosomal acidification was insensitive to the CFTR inhibitor in J774A.1 macrophages with a final pH of 5.10 ± 0.03 (Fig. 1C, middle). To confirm that our fluorescent indicator was sensitive to pH changes, phagolysosomal pH was measured following incubation with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase required for phagosomal acidification (15Lukacs G.L. Kim O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, phagolysosomes failed to acidify completely, reaching a pH of ∼6.5 (Fig. 1C, right), in agreement with previous data (15Lukacs G.L. Kim O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hackam D.J. Kim O.D. Zhang W.-J. Demaurex N. Woodside M. Tsai O. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29810-29820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine the role of CFTR channel activity in the acidification of phagolysosomes in alveolar macrophages, similar measurements were done in alveolar macrophages lavaged from mouse lungs. In alveolar macrophages from wild-type mice, phagolysosomal acidification was not impaired by the CFTR inhibitor (pH 5.34 ± 0.05 versus 5.37 ± 0.07) (Fig. 2, left). Furthermore, phagolysosomal pH in alveolar macrophages from CF mice containing the most common CF mutation, ΔF508-CFTR, was not significantly different from that in alveolar macrophages from wild-type mice (pH 5.34 ± 0.05 versus 5.40 ± 0.06) (Fig. 2, middle). As expected, phagolysosomal acidification was sensitive to bafilomycin (Fig. 2, left and middle), confirming dependence on the vacuolar H+-ATPase. We also found that the CFTR-selective inhibitor CFTRinh-172 did not impair acidification of phagolysosomes in (non-CF) human alveolar macrophages (pH 5.30 ± 0.08 versus 5.35 ± 0.07) (Fig. 2, right). To account for their finding of defective phagolysosomal acidification in CF alveolar macrophages, Di et al. (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) reported that (i) lysosomal acidification is defective in CFTR knock-out macrophages and that (ii) lysosomal fusion to phagosomes is responsible for phagolysosomal acidification. To assess whether lysosomal acidification is dependent on CFTR channel activity, we measured lysosomal acidification in J774A.1 macrophages using a dextran conjugate containing Oregon Green® 488 and TMR. This ratiometric, fluid-phase marker was sensitive at the acidic pH values found in lysosomes (Fig. 3A). Lysosomes were labeled by a standard pulse-chase protocol (Fig. 3B, inset). We found that lysosomal acidification in J774A.1 murine macrophages was not altered by the CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 at 10 μm (pH 4.48 ± 0.03 versus 4.42 ± 0.03). In a control study, lysosomes failed to acidify completely in the presence of bafilomycin (Fig. 3B). Using live cell imaging, Di et al. (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) reported that phagosomal acidification occurs after fusion with lysosomes but that this fusion event occurs 20–30 min after an initial zymosan acidification event (∼0.5 pH units lower than cytoplasmic or external pH; see “Discussion”). In the case of CFTR null macrophages, although fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes was observed, acidification did not occur, as lysosomes are not acidic. To reassess these unexpected findings, we measured the kinetics of phagosomal acidification using a zymosan conjugate containing 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (pKa ∼6.4) and TMR (Fig. 4A, inset). This zymosan conjugate was chosen to more accurately report the initial stages of phagosomal acidification as compared with the Oregon Green® 488 conjugate, the signal of which becomes saturated above pH ∼7, as shown in Fig. 1A. Following pulse label-chase, phagosomal acidification in J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 4B, left) and murine alveolar macrophages (right) began within 3 min of phagocytosis and reached steady state by ∼15 min, in agreement with previous data obtained with murine peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (15Lukacs G.L. Kim O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yates R.M. Kim D.G. Immunity. 2005; 23: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although contrary to the kinetic data of Di et al. (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of acidification in J774A.1 macrophages was not altered by CFTR inhibition by CFTRinh-172, nor was rate of acidification different in wild-type versus ΔF508-CFTR alveolar macrophages (Fig. 4B). The final pH values obtained using 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein/TMR-zymosan were in good agreement with those determined using Oregon Green® 488/TMR-zymosan. Taken together, these data indicate that phagolysosomal acidification in macrophages is not dependent on CFTR chloride channel activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CFTR channel activity in phagosomal acidification in macrophages. Our study was motivated by the critical role for CFTR in phagosomal acidification as reported recently (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and the important implications of this finding to bacterial killing by alveolar macrophages and mechanisms of CF lung disease. A CFTR-dependent defect in the acidification of lysosomes and phagolysosomes (by 1–2 pH units) in alveolar, but not peritoneal, macrophages from CFTR null mice was reported to be responsible for reduced bacterial killing (7Di A. Kim M.E. Deriy L.V. Li C. Szeto F.L. Chen Y. Huang P. Tong J. Naren A.P. Bindokas V. Palfrey H.C. Nelson D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Using the CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172, we found pharmacological evidence against CFTR involvement in phagosomal acidification in J774A.1 macrophages and in murine and human alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, using alveolar macrophages isolated from ΔF508-CFTR mice, we found no evidence for defective phagolysosomal acidification with mutant CFTR. As such, our experimental approach does not formally rule out the possibility that residual channel activity from ΔF508-CFTR or after CFTR inhibition is responsible for the observed acidification in phagosomes and lysosomes. However, for several reasons, we believe that significant residual channel activity is unlikely. The targeting of ΔF508-CFTR to phagosomal membranes is very unlikely given that this mutant resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Rowe S.M. Kim S. Sorscher E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1992-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 23Gadsby D.C. Kim P. Csanády L. Nature. 2006; 440: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 24Guggino W.B. Kim B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and a complete absence of endoplasmic reticulum-derived components in phagosomes has been proven (25Touret N. Kim P. Terebiznik M. Harrison R.E. Trombetta S. Pypaert M. Chow A. Jiang A. Shaw J. Yip C. Moore H.-P. van der Wel N. Houben D. Peters P.J. de Chastellier C. Mellman I. Grinstein S. Cell. 2005; 123: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ΔF508-CFTR is strongly inhibited at acidic pH (26Sherry A.M. Kim J. Malinowska D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 35: C870-C875Crossref Google Scholar), is subject to degradation in lysosomes (27Benharouga M. Kim M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and requires a chemical potentiator (such as genistein) to produce significant chloride channel activity (28Yang H. Kim A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For experiments with the inhibitor CFTRinh-172 (used at 10 μm), which has an IC50 of ∼300 nm, complete CFTR inhibition has been found at ∼5–10 μm in a variety of cellular and tissue preparations (22Ma T.

Verkman A.S. Gastroenterology. 2003; 126: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, we cannot formally rule out the unlikely possibility that CFTR performs an alternative function, other than ion conductance, that has not been directly assessed by our studies. For example, CFTR has been reported to participate in the regulation of endocytosis, exocytosis, and endosomal fusion (30Biwersi J. Kim N. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12484-12489Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Bradbury N.A. Kim T. Berta G. Sorscher E. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, taken together, our data indicate that CFTR does not constitute a universal pathway for chloride ion conductance in the phagosomal or lysosomal membranes of macrophages, and so defective acidification of alveolar macrophage phagosomes does not contribute to CF disease progression in CF subjects with the common ΔF508-CFTR mutation. The mechanism of phagosomal maturation in macrophages is incompletely understood; however, a variety of biophysical, proteomic, and genetic approaches have begun to elucidate this process (10Vieira O.V. Kim R.J. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 689-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Desjardins M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33Jutras I. Kim M.

To the best of our knowledge, in all studies that rigorously investigated the kinetics of phagosomal acidification, irrespective of macrophage origin or the precise assay protocol, acidification of phagosomes to ∼pH 5 was observed to begin within 2–3 min of probe binding and was complete within 5–15 min of particle ingestion (12Steinberg B.E.

Traffic. 2007; 8: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Phagosomal acidification in macrophages is mediated by the bafilomycin-sensitive vacuolar ATPase (15Lukacs G.L. Kim O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lukacs G.L. Kim O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24540-24548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, there is no consensus on the cellular source for delivery of this proton pump to phagosomes. Indeed, vacuolar ATPases are found in many cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane, early endosomes, and the Golgi (35Nishi T. Kim M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated, however, that lysosomes are probably not the source of vacuolar ATPase for phagosomal acidification. In murine peritoneal macrophages, phagosomal acidification is complete prior to fusion with lysosomes, as assessed by fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy (15Lukacs G.L. Kim O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21099-21107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

XIAP, a ubiquitous IAP, can inhibit both caspase-9, the initiator caspase of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and the downstream effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. Smac neutralizes XIAP inhibition of caspase-9 by competing for binding of the BIR3 domain of XIAP with caspase-9, whereas how Smac liberates effector caspases from XIAP inhibition is not clear. It is generally believed that binding of Smac with IAP generates a steric hindrance that prevents XIAP from inhibiting effector caspases, and therefore small molecule mimics of Smac are not able to reverse inhibition of the effector caspases. Surprisingly, we show here that binding of a dimeric Smac N-terminal peptide with the BIR2 domain of XIAP effectively antagonizes inhibition of caspase-3 by XIAP. Further, we defined the dynamic and cooperative interaction of Smac with XIAP: binding of Smac with the BIR3 domain anchors the subsequent binding of Smac with the BIR2 domain, which in turn attenuates the caspase-3 inhibitory function of XIAP. We also show that XIAP homotrimerizes via its C-terminal Ring domain, making its inhibitory activity toward caspase-3 more susceptible to Smac.

Apoptosis, a cellular process that plays crucial roles in multiple physiological and pathological events, is executed by the activity of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases (1Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar, 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). In mammals, a major caspase activation pathway is the mitochondrial cytochrome c-mediated pathway (3Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). This pathway mediates apoptosis triggered by a plethora of death stimuli including DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, and various other stressful conditions. Mechanistically, these stimuli converge on mitochondria and cause release of cytochrome c (4Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4461) Google Scholar), which subsequently induces the mediator protein Apaf-1 to form an oligomeric protein complex, the apoptosome (5Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar, 6Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). The apoptosome recruits and activates the initiator caspase, caspase-9, and the apoptosome-caspase-9 holoenzyme activates the downstream effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. This caspase cascade leads to apoptotic cell death associated with a series of hallmark morphological features. In cells, the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is regulated at multiple stages. The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates release of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c (7Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 8Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

The pathway can also be regulated downstream of cytochrome c release. For example, it has been found that oncoprotein prothymosin-α and tumor suppressor putative HLA-associated protein proteins modulate the assembly and activity of the apoptosome-caspase-9 holoenzyme, likely via regulating the nucleotide binding/exchanging function of Apaf-1 (11Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12Kim H.E. Du F. Fang M. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17545-17550Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Further, the enzymatic activity of caspases can be directly regulated by IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) proteins (13Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). IAP proteins all contain one or more BIR (baculoviral IAP repeat) domains, which are thought to be responsible for caspase inhibition. For example, XIAP, a ubiquitous member of IAP family, contains three BIR domains (from the N terminus, BIR1, BIR2, and BIR3). During the process of apoptosis, the inhibitory function of IAP can be antagonized by Smac/Diablo (14Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

The molecular basis underlying neutralization of IAP by Smac is intriguing and elegant. Smac is a dimeric protein and is post-translationally processed in mitochondria (14Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L.

Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The N terminus of processed Smac, starting with the residues AVPI, has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for removal of inhibition of caspase-9 by XIAP (21Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Structural studies demonstrated that the AVPI residues of Smac interact specifically and tightly with a conserved groove within the XIAP BIR3 domain (22Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P.

Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was revealed that the XIAP BIR3 domain interacts with caspase-9 in a strikingly similar manner. The cleaved, activated caspase-9 exposes a new N terminus similar to that of Smac, which is required for interaction of caspase-9 with the groove region of XIAP BIR3 domain (24Shiozaki E.N. Chai J.

Therefore, Smac neutralizes XIAP inhibition of caspase-9 by competing for the same specific binding site of XIAP with caspase-9. In addition to the initiator caspase-9, XIAP can inhibit the effector caspases of the mitochondrial pathway as well (26Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Such inhibition can also be counteracted by Smac (21Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Smac does so is not clear, because Smac can only interact with the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP (21Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), whereas XIAP utilizes a linker region between its BIR1 and BIR2 domains, instead of one of the BIR domains, to inhibit the effector caspases. This linker region can strongly interact with the active sites of both caspase-3 and caspase-7, as defined biochemically and structurally (26Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N.

Currently, it is generally accepted that binding of Smac with the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP creates a steric hindrance that is essential for preventing binding of XIAP linker region with effector caspases, thus achieving neutralization of XIAP inhibition (27Chai J.

IAP proteins are frequently overexpressed in human cancers, indicating their oncogenic function and the potential to be therapeutic targets (32Huang Y. Lu M. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Li L. Thomas R.M. Suzuki H. De Brabander J.K. Wang X. Harran P.G.

Indeed, small molecule compounds and antisense oligonucleotides targeting IAP have been developed as anticancer proto-drugs (36Schimmer, A. D., and Dalili, S. (2005) Hematology 2005, American Society of Hematology Education Program Book, pp. 215-291, American Society of Hematology, Washington, D. CGoogle Scholar, 37Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Wang Z.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48168-48176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mechanism by which the short N terminus of Smac antagonizes IAP was also explored for anticancer agent development. A successful example for such mechanism-based design is a synthesized chemical compound mimicking the structure of the dimeric Smac N-terminal sequence, AVPI (33Li L. Thomas R.M. Suzuki H. De Brabander J.K. Wang X. Harran P.G. Science. 2004; 305: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The nonpeptide nature of this molecule provides desirable cell permeability and stability, and this molecule possesses a strong ability to potentiate apoptosis in cancer cells, thus a promising anticancer drug lead. However, it is predicted by the current model that the effect of such a Smac N-terminal mimic might be limited, because it is supposed to be able to only antagonize inhibition of caspase-9 by IAP but not to antagonize inhibition of effector caspases by IAP, which should require the bulky Smac protein to create steric hindrance (32Huang Y. Lu M. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the biochemical mechanisms by which Smac antagonizes inhibition of the effector caspase, caspase-3, by XIAP. We show that the dimeric Smac N-terminal peptide alone can effectively restore caspase-3 activity inhibited by XIAP. Our study also indicates that Smac interacts with the BIR3 and then BIR2 domains of XIAP sequentially, and such dynamic interaction cooperatively neutralizes inhibition of caspase-3 by the linker region of XIAP. Reagents—Caspase-3 substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC (catalog number 235425), and caspase-9 substrate, Ac-LEHD-AFC (catalog number 218765), were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-Smac antibody (catalog number 05-681) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; anti-FLAG antibody M2 was from Sigma. Plasmids—For His-tagged recombinant proteins, full-length human XIAP (residues 10–497) or XIAP-ΔRing (residues 10–356) was generated by PCR and subcloned into pET21a (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate BIR2 (D214S) and BIR3 mutant (E314A) of full-length XIAP.

For purification of heterodimer Smac, PCR product from pET15b-Smac (AVPI)-His was inserted into pOKD4 to generate pOKD4-Smac (MVPI)-FLAG. Peptide Synthesis—All of the peptides were prepared using standard Fmoc solid phase chemistry on a peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc.). The dimeric peptide (dAVPI) was synthesized using Universal PEG NovaTag resin (catalog number 04-12-3911; EMD Biosciences). The Fmoc protecting group of the Universal PEG NovaTag resin was first removed using 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide. Then individual Fmoc-AA-OH was coupled to the resin. The amino group of N-terminal amino acids was protected by the t-butyloxycarbonyl group, rather than Fmoc. After the first peptide was synthesized, the (4-methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethyl protecting group was removed with 1.0 m N-hydroxybenzotriazole in trifluoroethanol/dichloromethane. The produced resin was used for the synthesis of second peptides using the same procedure. The final cleavage and deprotection were performed with a mixture (trifluoroacetic acid:water:triisopropylsilane, 95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v). The cleaved peptides were extracted repeatedly with ethyl ether and purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (ZORBAX 300 SB-C18, Agilent Technologies), using a 0–30% water/acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide identity was verified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies). Preparation of Cytosolic Fractions from HeLa Cells—HeLa cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. After washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cell pellets were suspended in 5× volume of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with mixture proteases inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were broken by passing through 22-gauge needles 25 times. The cell lysates were then subject to centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by final centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C to obtain HeLa S-100 fraction (HS100). Recombinant Proteins—Generally, for His-tagged proteins, plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) and cultured at 37 °C. When optical density reached 0.6, 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression at 18 °C for 16 h. The cells were pelleted and subjected to standard Ni2+ affinity chromatography. For expression of recombinant SMAC proteins, pET15b-Smac-His and pOKD4-SMAC-FLAG were cotransformed into BL21 (DE3), followed by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The eluted protein was then subjected to anion exchange Q column purification (1 ml of HiTrapQ; GE Healthcare) eluted with 20 ml of gradient from 100 to 400 mm NaCl in Buffer A, which resulted in two protein peaks. The first one was wild type homodimer Smac (Smac-WT), and the second was mutant heterodimer Smac (Smac-Mut). For GST-tagged protein, a similar procedure was performed to get the expression of proteins in BL21, followed by GST affinity chromatography. All of the recombinant proteins obtained by affinity purification were dialyzed in Buffer A for 2 h at 4 °C. Aliquots were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Caspase Activity Assay—For caspase-3 or caspase-9 activity assay in a total reconstituted system, each reaction with a final volume of 30 μl was assembled on ice, including: 3 μl of 10× caspase assay buffer (300 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 50% sucrose, 1% CHAPS, 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (40Scott F.L. Denault J.B. Riedl S.J. Shin H. Renatus M. Salvesen G.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), 3 μl caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC, 1 mm), or 3 μl caspase-9 substrate (Ac-LEHD-AFC, 1 mm), respectively. Wild type or mutant XIAP and Smac or peptides were added as indicated. The mixture was first incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and then supplemented with 3 μl of 10 nm caspase-3 or 3 μl of 200 nm leucine zipper-linked dimeric caspase-9 (41Yin Q. Park H.H. Chung J.Y. Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. da Graca L.S. Jiang X. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively, to initiate the enzyme reaction. Generation of fluorescent signal (relative fluorescent units) because of the cleavage of substrates, indicative of caspase-3 or caspase-9 activity, was measured by an automated spectrophotometer (TECAN, Inc.) at wavelengths of 360/465 nm (excitation/emission) or 400/505 nm, respectively. For caspase-3 activity assay with HeLa cytosolic extract, caspase-3/7 in HS100 was first activated with 1 mm dATP and 5 μm cytochrome c at 30 °C for 3.5 h. Then 9 μl of preactivated HS100 was mixed with 21 μl of reaction solution prewarmed at 30 °C for 10 min, consisting of the indicated amounts of XIAP, dAVPI, and caspase-3 substrates. Substrate cleavage was measured as above. GST Pull-down Experiment—For each sample, 5 μg of purified full-length XIAP (GST-XIAP) or BIR3 domain (GST-BIR3) was coupled to 20 μl of glutathione beads. Subsequently, in a 200-μl Buffer A system, the beads were incubated with 1 μm Smac in the presence of indicated concentration of dAVPI for 1 h followed by three washes. Then beads were boiled in 4× SDS loading buffer, and eluted proteins were subject to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with an anti-Smac antibody. Molecular Mass Measurement—Molar mass of purified XIAP-WT or XIAP-ΔRing was determined by static multi-angel light scattering. Protein was injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 gel filtration column equilibrated in Buffer A. The chromatography system was coupled to a three-angle light scattering detector (mini-DAWN EOS) and refractive index detector (Optilab DSP, Wyatt Technology). The data were collected every 0.5 s at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Data analysis was carried out using the ASTRA program (Wyatt Technology), yielding the molar mass and mass distribution (polydispersity) of the sample. The Dimeric N-terminal Peptide of Smac Is Sufficient to Antagonize Inhibition of Caspase-3 by XIAP—Small molecules mimicking the Smac N-terminal peptide, AVPI, are potential anticancer agents, because they are able to restore caspase-9 activity inhibited by IAP proteins. On the other hand, according to the current understanding, the effect of such agents is limited to antagonizing IAP inhibition of caspase-9 but not of the downstream effector caspases (32Huang Y. Lu M. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). However, a recently reported dimeric AVPI mimic showed potent activity to potentiate apoptosis in cancer cells, and in cell extracts, this mimic was able to stimulate caspase-3/7 activity as effectively as Smac protein itself (33Li L. Thomas R.M. Suzuki H. De Brabander J.K. Wang X. Harran P.G. Science. 2004; 305: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This report immediately suggested that AVPI peptide might be able to antagonize inhibition of caspase-3/7 by IAP as well, a possibility clearly conflicting with the current view. On the other hand, several questions should be addressed before such a new mechanism needs to be invoked. First, one might argue that the nonpeptide nature of this Smac mimic might provide the molecule certain functions irrelevant to Smac; second, it is possible that in the cell extracts, the concentrations of effector caspases are much higher that that of endogenous IAP; therefore, once inhibition of caspase-9 is released by the Smac mimic, IAP cannot prevent the downstream activity of the effector caspases any more. To address these questions and explore whether the Smac N-terminal peptide is sufficient to antagonize XIAP inhibition of caspase-3 activity, we performed chemical synthesis to generate authentic Smac N-terminal peptide rather than its nonpeptide mimic. We synthesized the monomer Smac N-terminal peptide AVPIAQK (mAVPI), as well as its reverse sequence KQAIPVA (mIPVA) as a negative control. Because Smac is a dimeric protein, and the chemical mimic of AVPI dimer possesses greater activity than the monomer mimic (33Li L. Thomas R.M. Suzuki H. De Brabander J.K. Wang X. Harran P.G. Science. 2004; 305: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), we also synthesized the AVPIAQK dimer (dAVPI) by covalently linking the C-terminal Lys residues of the two AVPIAQK peptides (Fig. 1, A and B). The synthesized dimer was purified by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 1C), and its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1D). We further confirmed that the synthesized dAVPI behaved as Smac in terms of its binding activity to XIAP; thus, as shown in Fig. 2A, dAVPI competes for GST-tagged full-length XIAP (GST-XIAP) and its BIR3 domain (GST-BIR3) against Smac in a dose-dependent manner.FIGURE 2dAVPI antagonizes XIAP inhibition of caspase-3 in HeLa cell extracts. A, dAVPI competes with Smac for binding with BIR3 domain (GST-BIR3) or full-length XIAP (GST-XIAP). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” GST-BIR3 or GST-XIAP was first conjugated to glutathione beads and then incubated with Smac in the presence of various concentrations of dAVPI as indicated. Bound Smac was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using an antibody against Smac (upper panel), and the total GST-BIR3 and GST-XIAP were stained by Ponceau S (lower panel). B, HeLa cell cytosolic extracts (HS100) was activated with dATP and cytochrome c as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An aliquot of activated HS100 was then added into the prewarmed reaction mixture without XIAP (-XIAP), or with 100 nm XIAP in the absence (+XIAP) or presence of dAVPI (+XIAP/dAVPI), mAVPI (+XIAP/mAVPI), or the control mIPVA (+XIAP/mIPVA), as indicated. C, dAVPI is more potent than mAVPI in liberating caspase-3 activity from XIAP inhibition. Assays were performed as in B, with individual synthetic peptides added with indicated concentration. Control indicates reactions in the absence of peptides. All of the data are presented as velocity of Ac-DEVD-AMC cleavage normalized against the maximal velocity (that is, in the absence of XIAP. Same for other figures). The error bars represent standard error calculated from three independent experiments (same for other figures).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subsequently, we examined the effect of the synthesized peptides on XIAP inhibition of caspase-3/7 activity in HeLa cell extracts. To ensure that we were observing caspase-3/7 activity directly, we first activated caspase-3/7 by preincubating the cell extracts with 5 μm cytochrome c and 1 mm dATP at 30 °C for 3.5 h. This incubation maximally activated caspase-3/7 in the cell extracts (data not shown). Subsequently, we added recombinant XIAP in the presence of different peptides to test whether the inhibitory function of XIAP can be reversed. Indeed, the added recombinant, full-length XIAP completely inhibited caspase-3/7 activity, and both dAVPI and mAVPI could restore caspase-3/7 activity but not the control peptide mIPVA (Fig. 2B). As expected, dAVPI does so much more efficiently than mAVPI (Fig. 2C). Our particular experimental setup clarified that the Smac N-terminal peptide alone is able to antagonize inhibition of caspase-3/7 by XIAP. Thus, the steric hindrance generated by the bulky Smac protein is dispensable for antagonization of XIAP function in cell extracts. Interaction of Smac N Terminus with the BIR2 Domain Antagonizes XIAP Inhibition of Caspase-3—How does dAVPI antagonize XIAP inhibition of caspase-3, a function of the linker region between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains of XIAP? This linker region cannot interact with AVPI, and dAVPI apparently is not bulky enough to generate any steric hindrance. Because AVPI can specifically interact with both the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP, and the BIR2 domain is directly adjacent to the linker region, we propose that interaction of AVPI with the BIR2 domain is required for removing XIAP inhibition of caspase-3. To examine this possibility, we generated a XIAP mutant (BIR2-Mut) in which a conserved residue, aspartate 214, is mutated to serine. Based on the structure of Smac-BIR3 complex, this mutant should lose its ability to interact with AVPI (22Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W.

We have identified a novel activity in HeLa cell extracts that can unwind the let-7 microRNA duplex. Using partially purified material, we have shown that microRNA helicase activity requires ATP and has a native molecular mass of ∼68 kDa. Affinity purification of the unwinding activity revealed co-purification of P68 RNA helicase. Importantly, recombinant P68 RNA helicase was sufficient to unwind the let-7 duplex. Moreover, like its native homolog, P68 RNA helicase did not unwind an analogous small interfering RNA duplex. We further showed that knockdown of P68 inhibited let-7 microRNA function.

It is now recognized that microRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and that their deregulation may underlie many human diseases (1Calin G.A. Croce C.M.

Science. 2007; 316: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand how they are incorporated into the protein cofactor complexes that are essential for their suppressive activity. MicroRNAs are initially transcribed as precursor RNAs, which fold into hairpin structures (6Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (3240) Google Scholar). The acknowledged first step of microRNA maturation is the specific endonucleolytic cleavage of the pri-microRNA near the base of the stem loop, by Drosha (7Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3970) Google Scholar). The Drosha cleavage product is typically a 70-nucleotide stem loop RNA, containing a two-nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and a recessed 5′-phosphate (8Gregory R.I. Yan K.P. Amuthan G.

Frendewey D. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Dicer cleaves both strands of the hairpin precursor ∼21 nucleotides from the end of the stem loop creating a 19-nucleotide paired duplex with two-nucleotide overhangs at the 3′ ends: the transient microRNA duplex (12Hutvagner G.

It is now clear that the silencing activities of microRNAs are effected by a novel class of RNA-binding proteins called the Argonaute family (15Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G.

Biol. 2005; 12: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of these proteins for duplex RNA is much less than that observed for single-stranded RNA (15Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 19Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of Argonaute/RNA complexes in the cell typically reveals the association of only one strand (the guide strand) of this transient duplex (20Maniataki E. Mourelatos Z. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2979-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, there are likely to be additional factors, which unwind the transient duplex and confer specificity in uptake into Argonaute. Studies on structurally different, but conceptually analogous, siRNA 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; GAPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; GAPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. duplexes have revealed that this specificity in uptake may be conferred by a heterodimer of Dicer and R2D2 in which the stable end of the duplex is bound by R2D2 and Dicer facilitates the loading of the loosely paired 5′ end of the guide strand into Argonaute (21Tomari Y.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Although the unwinding is likely facilitated by the cleavage of the passenger strand by Argonaute (25Leuschner P.J. Ameres S.L. Kueng S. Martinez J. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Matranga C. Tomari Y. Shin C. Bartel D.P. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2005; 123: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), RNA helicase A has also recently been implicated in loading of the guide strand of siRNA (27Robb G.B. Rana T.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 523-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the factors that are likely required to load the guide strand of the analogous microRNA duplex into Argonaute complexes. In contrast to siRNA duplexes, microRNA duplexes typically contain unpaired bulges, which likely preclude the cleavage of the passenger strand by Argonaute (26Matranga C. Tomari Y. Shin C. Bartel D.P. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2005; 123: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). An affinity-purified complex that contains Argonaute2 and Dicer has been shown to direct the cleavage of a target mRNA directed by a let-7 hairpin precursor (19Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2005; 123: 631-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 28Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2005; 436: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Although this argues that Dicer might be necessary for the unwinding of the microRNA transient duplex, microRNA duplexes can still silence expression in cells that lack Dicer (29Giraldez A.J. Cinalli R.M. Glasner M.E. Enright A.J. Thomson J.M. Baskerville S. Hammond S.M. Bartel D.P. Schier A.F. Science. 2005; 308: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). In any event, neither the siRNA-directed nor the microRNA duplex-directed cleavage of a mRNA has been successfully reconstituted with recombinant proteins, and thus, it is likely that additional factors are required for this step. In the present study, we have identified an activity from human cells that promotes the ATP-dependent unwinding of the human let-7 microRNA precursor duplex. Further characterization suggested that this activity corresponded to the previously described P68 RNA helicase (30Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that recombinant P68 RNA helicase was sufficient to unwind the let-7 microRNA precursor duplex. Importantly, a transient knockdown of P68 abrogated let-7-directed suppression of gene expression and indicates that P68 RNA helicase is indeed required to facilitate the uptake of duplex let-7 microRNA into the silencing complex. HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Synthetic RNAs and siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Luciferase reporter plasmids were provided by the David Bartel laboratory. The His-P68 plasmid was provided by the Zhi-Ren Liu laboratory. Anti-P68 monoclonal antibody (PAB204) was obtained from Upstate Biochemicals, and monoclonal antibodies against GAPD and Vimentin were obtained from Abcam. Preparation of HeLa Cell Extract—HeLa S3 cells (National Cell Culture Center) were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The swollen cells were homogenized, and KCl, MgCl2, and glycerol were added to final concentrations of 100 mm, 2 mm, and 10%, respectively. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). KCl was added dropwise to a final concentration of 400 mm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant nuclear extract was stored at -80 °C in aliquots. RNA Affinity Chromatography—0.5 ml of avidin A beads (Vector Laboratories) were incubated with 36 μmol of biotinylated let-7 precursor hairpin RNA in 0.6 ml volume with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C for 8 h. Beads were washed with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and then equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Nuclear extract was applied to the column and washed with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. The column was then eluted with buffer A containing a 50 mm stepwise 0.05 m-0.8 M NaCl gradient. Preparation of Recombinant His-P68 RNA Helicase—Recombinant His-P68 was prepared as described previously (31Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12810-12815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In short, His-P68 was induced in BL21 (DE3) cells with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 6 h. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and were lysed by the addition of lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and Triton X-100 (1%). The resulting supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column. The column was first washed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole followed by lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and 0.15 mm NaCl. Recombinant His-P68 was then eluted with buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Preparation of Labeled MicroRNA Precursor Duplex—The let-7 guide strand was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After phenol-chloroform extraction, it was annealed (65 °C for 5 min and then 37 °C for 25 min) to a 5-fold excess of let-7 passenger strand. The duplex was then gel-purified and stored in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m potassium acetate. Precursor Duplex-unwinding Assay—Reaction mixtures (0.02 ml) contained labeled let-7 precursor duplex (1 nm), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and nuclear extract or recombinant P68 RNA helicase as indicated. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-EDTA buffer (50% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% each bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol) and analyzed by 15% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Luciferase Assay of MicroRNA Function—HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 in a 12-well plate using the indicated amounts of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and either β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase plasmid. Firefly and either β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase activities were assayed 36-48 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase assay (Promega). Firefly activity was normalized by cotransfection of either β-galactosidase or Renilla plasmids to control for transfection efficiency. The Identification of an ATP-dependent Activity That Can Unwind the let-7 MicroRNA Duplex—We elected to use the human let-7 duplex (Fig. 1A) as a model since let-7 is absolutely conserved between worms and humans and has been biochemically studied in many systems (12Hutvagner G.

This choice therefore permits the ready comparison of any identified human protein co-factors with those identified in other organisms. However, one disadvantage of the human let-7 duplex is that a discernible level of single strand is produced merely on incubation at 37 °C. Thus, in all experiments, we included a negative comparison control (a heat-inactivated corresponding cellular fraction) so that we could clearly distinguish any cellular helicase activity from the enzyme-independent background. Fig. 1B shows that the let-7 duplex was unwound on incubation with nuclear extract made from HeLa cells. The extent of unwinding titrated with the amount of extract added to the reaction. To extend this observation and to establish the native molecular weight of the activity, we fractionated the extract using a Sephadex S-200 column. Fractions were collected and assayed for helicase activity. There was a minor high molecular weight species; however, the majority of the unwinding activity eluted in an inclusion volume consistent with a native molecular mass of 68 kDa (Fig. 1C). Next, using this partially purified material, we investigated whether the unwinding activity required ATP. Little unwinding was seen in the absence of ATP, whereas the addition of ATP markedly stimulated the reaction and appeared to saturate at 5 mm. In addition, no unwinding activity was seen in reaction mixtures containing AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (Fig. 1D). From these observations, we concluded that we have identified a novel ATP-dependent activity in HeLa cell extract that is capable of unwinding the let-7 microRNA duplex and that this activity has a native molecular mass of ∼68 kDa. P68 RNA Helicase Co-purifies with the MicroRNA Duplex-unwinding Activity—Our initial observations suggested that the activity that unwinds the let-7 duplex precursor might correspond to P68 RNA helicase. P68 RNA helicase is an ATP-dependent RNA-unwinding enzyme of 68 kDa that has been found to be a subunit of the Drosha-processing complex (8Gregory R.I. Yan K.P. Amuthan G. Chendrimada T. Doratotaj B. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2004; 432: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar, 30Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Huang Y.

Accordingly, we elected to affinity-purify our unwinding activity and investigate whether it co-purified with P68 RNA helicase. We prepared an affinity column by immobilizing a biotinylated hairpin sequence containing the let-7 passenger and guide sequences (Fig. 2A) to avidin beads. HeLa cell extract was applied, the column was washed with low salt, and bound protein was eluted using a step gradient from 0.05 to 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 2B). A significant portion of the microRNA helicase activity was retained and eluted at 200-250 mm NaCl (Fig. 2C). Next, we assayed for the presence of P68 RNA helicase by Western blot and found that it was precisely coincident with the unwinding activity (Fig. 2D). Thus, we concluded that P68 was indeed a strong candidate for the microRNA-unwinding activity. Recombinant P68 RNA Helicase Is Sufficient to Unwind the let-7 MicroRNA Duplex—Next, we investigated whether recombinant P68 was sufficient to unwind the let-7 microRNA duplex, and if so, whether its properties resembled those displayed by the native activity. First, we investigated the structural features of the microRNA duplex that are necessary for unwinding by the native activity. We synthesized two mutant derivatives of the let-7 duplex. In the first mutant (mutant 1), nucleotide substitutions were made so that every nucleotide of the microRNA guide strand was annealed to the passenger. This mutant is a “bad” siRNA in which the 5′ end of the guide strand is annealed to the passenger strand. Previous studies have shown that the guide strand of such an siRNA will not be readily incorporated into a silencing complex (21Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 22Liu X. Jiang F. Kalidas S. Smith D. Liu Q. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1514-1520Google Scholar, 26Matranga C.

Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). This mutant was a very poor substrate; virtually no unwinding activity was noted even on incubation with saturating amounts of affinity-purified unwinding activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, we synthesized a mutant that lacked the internal bulges of the microRNA duplex yet retains the unpaired structure of the 5′ end of the guide strand. This mutant (mutant 2) is analogous to a “good” siRNA in which the guide strand is readily incorporated into the silencing complex (41Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Importantly, this mutant was also a very poor substrate and indicates that the unwinding activity recognized the internal bulges and therefore can distinguish between an siRNA duplex and a microRNA duplex. Indeed, the importance of the internal bulges was illustrated by the observation that a third mutant, in which the bulges were retained and the 5′ end of the guide was annealed to the passenger strand, exhibited significant unwinding Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, recombinant P68 RNA helicase also displayed a marked preference for a microRNA duplex, and the critical role of the internal bulges was similarly evident. Thus, we concluded that P68 RNA helicase is sufficient to unwind the let-7 duplex, and like the affinity-purified activity, it prefers a microRNA duplex to an siRNA duplex (Fig. 3, A and C). P68 RNA Helicase Is Required for let-7 MicroRNA Function in HeLa Cells—If P68 RNA helicase was required for the unwinding of the let-7 microRNA duplex, one would predict that its down-regulation would prevent loading of let-7 microRNA into the silencing complex and that significant inhibition of microRNA activity would result. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a reporter plasmid (pIS-Lin41(s) (42Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar)) that contains a previously characterized let-7-response element found in lin-41 mRNA. Indeed, transfection of this plasmid into HeLa cells resulted in a 22-fold repression when compared with normalized luciferase activity in comparison with that expressed by the parental plasmid that lacks the response element (Fig. 4A). Evidence that this suppression was exerted by let-7 was provided by the observation that this suppression was alleviated by AntagomiRs against let-7 but not by AntagomiRs against an irrelevant microRNA (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the suppressive activity of the element was attenuated by mutations that compromise the annealing of let-7 (Fig. 4B). In the following experiment, we have used the comparison of the luciferase activity between the wild type (WT) and mutant (MUT) let-7-response elements as a measure of let-7 activity. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of P68 RNA helicase, but not GAPDH, attenuated the activity of let-7 microRNA (Fig. 4B). Importantly, GAPDH was successfully down-regulated as shown by Western blot analysis using Vimentin as a loading control (Fig. 4C). Thus, we conclude that P68 RNA helicase is indeed required for microRNA activity and is likely required for the incorporation of the microRNA into the Argonaute2 complex. The single-stranded small RNA-directed silencing of mRNA has been reconstituted with recombinant Argonaute2 (18Rivas F.V. Tolia N.H. Song J.J. Aragon J.P. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, the precursor microRNA duplex-directed silencing of mRNA has not yet been reconstituted with the candidate recombinant proteins. Thus, it is likely that other factors remain to be discovered. In these studies, we have identified an ATP-dependent unwinding activity that specifically unwinds the let-7 microRNA duplex yet exhibits little activity on a derived siRNA duplex. This observation reinforces the current perception that the guide strands of siRNA and microRNA duplexes arrive in Argonaute2 complexes through different pathways (20Maniataki E. Mourelatos Z. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2979-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 22Liu X. Jiang F. Kalidas S. Smith D. Liu Q. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1514-1520Google Scholar, 26Matranga C. Tomari Y. Shin C. Bartel D.P. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2005; 123: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Indeed, it will be interesting to see whether RNA helicase A, which has been implicated in the unwinding of the siRNA duplex (27Robb G.B. Rana T.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 523-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), is also capable of unwinding some microRNA duplexes. Our size fractionation analysis and affinity purification studies suggested that a principal component of the unwinding activity corresponds to the P68 RNA helicase. P68 was originally identified in human cells due to its coincidental reactivity with a monoclonal antibody directed against SV40 large T antigen (40Lane D.P. Hoeffler W.K. Nature. 1980; 288: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). P68 was originally believed to be an RNA helicase due to its homology to the DEAD box of eIF-4A, a well characterized RNA helicase (43Lane D. Nature. 1988; 334: 478Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Ray B.K. Lawson T.G. Kramer J.C. Cladaras M.H. Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7651-7658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When P68 was assayed for unwinding activity, it was found to be an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, which can unwind RNA duplexes in both 3′ to 5′ and 5′ to 3′ directions (30Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The substrates unwound by P68 RNA helicase range in size from 22 to 175 nucleotides in length and contain overhangs of varied lengths ranging from 6 to 185 nucleotides long (30Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, our observations are consistent with the known properties of P68 RNA helicase. P68 RNA helicase has been implicated in many cellular functions. In some cases, for example, in its perceived role as a transcriptional regulator, this function does not require helicase activity (45Bates G.J. Nicol S.M. Wilson B.J. Jacobs A.M. Bourdon J.C. Wardrop J. Gregory D.J. Lane D.P. Perkins N.D. Fuller-Pace F.V. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, its touted role in mRNA splicing, rRNA processing, and mRNA decay requires the integrity of the helicase domain (46Lin C. Yang L. Yang J.J. Huang Y. Liu Z.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7484-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47Ishizuka A. Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2497-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 48Fukuda T.

Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Our studies here lead us to speculate that P68 RNA helicase might regulate the expression of many microRNAs with a consequent pleiotropic effect upon cellular function. It is possible that this function might accommodate many of the previously ascribed functions in RNA metabolism. In any event, the regulation of microRNA activity would be consistent with its well described role in cellular proliferation. However, it remains possible that P68 RNA helicase may only unwind particular subclasses of microRNA duplexes, and its role in a particular cell function may be peculiar to the miRNAs that are expressed in a given cell type. Our contention that P68 RNA helicase plays a role in the unwinding of the let-7 microRNA duplex is strengthened by the previous observation that it is a subunit of the affinity-purified Drosha-processing complex (48Fukuda T. Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Matsumoto T. Koshida I. Yoshimura K. Mihara M. Naitou M. Endoh H. Nakamura T. Akimoto C. Yamamoto Y. Katagiri T. Foulds C. Takezawa S. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. O'Malley B.W. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack P68 RNA helicase are compromised in their expression of many microRNAs (48Fukuda T. Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Matsumoto T. Koshida I. Yoshimura K. Mihara M. Naitou M. Endoh H. Nakamura T. Akimoto C. Yamamoto Y. Katagiri T. Foulds C. Takezawa S. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. O'Malley B.W. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Importantly, we show here, for the first time, that a recombinant RNA helicase is sufficient to unwind a microRNA precursor duplex. From this key observation, we would propose that P68 RNA helicase might drive the selective uptake of the let-7 guide strand into the silencing complex. So far, however, our preliminary attempts to directly demonstrate this using purified, recombinant proteins have not been successful. However, the present studies have identified an essential co-factor that may ultimately facilitate the reconstitution of this critical step."

In osteoarthritic joint disease, expression of bFGF and MMP-13 in chondrocytes and their release into the synovial fluid are significantly increased. We have previously found that the capacity for cartilage repair in human adult articular chondrocytes is severely compromised by minimal exposure to bFGF because bFGF reduces responsiveness to bone morphogenetic protein-7 and insulin-like growth factor-1 and induces MMP-13 through protein kinase Cδ-dependent activation of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Here we show using biochemical and molecular approaches that transcription factor Elk-1, a direct downstream target of MAPK, is a critical transcriptional activator of of MMP-13 by bFGF in human articular chondrocytes. We also provide evidence that Elk-1 is a direct target of NFκB and induces MMP-13 expression upon activation of the NFκB signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that elevated expression of MMP-13 occurs through Elk-1 activation of both MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways, thus revealing a two-pronged biological mechanism by which bFGF controls the production of catabolic enzymes that are associated with excessive degradation of the cartilage matrix in degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.

Given the physiological significance and potential clinical impact on cartilage homeostasis, comparatively little is known about the role of growth factors, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of the disease. Articular cartilage is a relatively uncomplicated tissue composed of chondrocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM). Despite its limited cell diversity and absence of vasculature and innervation, it is a dynamic tissue in which maintenance of the ECM depends on the delicate and physiologically regulated balance between anabolic and catabolic responses of sparsely distributed chondrocytes in normal cartilage. However, in OA, chondrocyte metabolism is unbalanced due to excessive production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), aggrecanases (ADAMTS), and other proteinases by chondrocytes (1Pelletier J.P.

Among the MMPs, MMP-1 (collagenase-1) and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) play a significant role in the development of OA, because they are rate-limiting enzymes involved in collagen degradation (1Pelletier J.P.

MMP-1 is produced primarily by synovial cells, whereas MMP-13 is almost exclusively produced by chondrocytes that reside in the cartilage. In addition to collagen, MMP-13 also degrades the proteoglycan molecule aggrecan, suggesting a potential dual role in matrix destruction (5Burrage P.S. Kim K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 6Miwa H.E. Kim T.A. Hyunh T.D. Flory D.M. Hering T.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Given the important role of MMP-13, it is vital to elucidate the key regulators and signaling pathways that control MMP-13 gene expression. Defining this mechanism is necessary to understand the molecular etiology of OA and to design new strategies for the development of therapautics to prevent the joint destruction seen in OA. Basic FGF (or FGF-2) is a member of a large FGF family of structurally related proteins that bind heparin or heparin sulfate and modulate the growth, differentiation, migration, and survival of a wide variety of cell types (8Bikfalvi A. Kim S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Basic FGF (bFGF) is expressed by chondrocytes and is stored in the ECM of adult articular cartilage (9Vincent T. Kim M. Bolton M. Wait R. Saklatvala J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1989; 7: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) is well known. Nevertheless, previous studies on bFGF from a variety of species have yielded inconsistent results with regards to production of ECM and articular cartilage homeostasis. We recently showed that bFGF has a striking antagonistic effect on the well known cartilage anabolic activities of insulin-like growth factor-1 and osteogenic protein-1, as reflected by inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis and its deposition (14Loeser R.F. Kim S. Pacione C. Im H.J., Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 3910-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Signals generated by bFGF stimulate MMP-13 expression in several cell types, including cultured human chondrosarcoma cells (15Uria J.A. Kim M. Lopez J.M. Alvarez J. Vizoso F. Takigawa M.

Hence, bFGF stimulation of articular chondrocytes may disturb cartilage homeostasis by increasing MMP-13 expression and ECM degradation. Despite these findings, though, the transcriptional mechanisms by which bFGF stimulates MMP-13 expression are poorly understood. Immediate release of bFGF upon mechanical injury to cartilage leads to the rapid and sustained activation of Erk, and it occurs concomitantly with striking changes in chondrocyte gene expression (9Vincent T. Kim M. Bolton M. Wait R. Saklatvala J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8259-8264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Vincent T.L. Kim M.A. Hansen U.N. Amis A.A. Saklatvala J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that the activation of multiple MAPK subgroups (Erk, p38, and JNK) is required for the bFGF-mediated stimulation of MMP-13 in human adult articular chondrocytes (18Im H.J.

Elk-1 is a direct downstream target gene of MAPK and is a member of the Ets domain-containing ternary complex factor subfamily of transcription factors (19Gille H. Kim M. Thomae O. Moomaw C.

Kim C.B. Jaworski J.A. Dicamillo S.J. Panchenko M.P. Goldstein R. Foster J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L766-L775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise physiological role of this transcription factor in chondrocytes has not yet been characterized after stimulation with bFGF. Similarly the critical role of the NFκB pathway in the stimulation of MMP-13 production by various stimuli such as IL-1β, fibronectin fragment, and hyaluranon oligonucleotide has been suggested in previous studies (25Mengshol J.A. Kim M.P. Coon C.I. Barchowsky A. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 26Forsyth C.B. Kim J. Loeser R.F.

Nevertheless, the precise cellular and molecular mechanism by which the NFκB pathway stimulates MMP-13 is not clearly understood. In this study, we investigated the concept that the transcriptional activities of Elk-1 and NFκB may together control ECM homeostasis in cartilage. We identified Elk-1 as a key transcriptional regulator of MMP-13 expression by a two-pronged mechanism, because it acts both directly and indirectly. Our data show that activation of MMP-13 transcription occurs via Elk-1 directly, as well as via the NFκB pathway, in which Elk-1 plays a role as an intermediate regulatory molecule to lead to the NFκB-dependent induction of MMP-13 expression. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how the release of growth factors and inflammatory cytokines upon cartilage damage can result in the sustained activation of MMPs that may cause further destruction of articular cartilage. Chondrocyte Isolation and Culture Conditions—Normal human ankle cartilage was obtained from tissue donors through the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donor Network. Each donor specimen was graded for gross degenerative changes based on a modified version of the 5-point scale of Collins (28Muehleman C. Kim D. Huch K. Cole A.A. Kuettner K.E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 23-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion of ankle articular cartilage (grade 0 or 1, which has no sign of cartilage degeneration) using Pronase followed by overnight digestion with collagenase-P as described previously (18Im H.J. Kim P. Natarajan V. Schmid T.M. Block J.A. Davis F. van Wijnen A.J. Loeser R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11110-11121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were resuspended in media at 2 × 106 per milliliter and plated onto 12-well plates at 1 ml/well. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (complete media) for 5 days before the experiments. Chondrocyte Stimulation and Immunoblotting—Cells were serum-starved by changing media to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with antibiotics for 1 day. For inhibitor studies, cells were preincubated with individual pathway-specific chemical inhibitors for 30 min before stimulation with bFGF or IL-1β. Experiments were terminated with removal of media and/or cell lysate preparation. The conditioned media was stored at 4 °C with 0.1% NaN3 and used for the experiments within 5 days. Cell lysates were prepared using modified cell lysis radioimmune precipitation assay buffer: 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Total protein concentrations of both media and cell lysates were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis as described previously (18Im H.J. Kim P. Natarajan V. Schmid T.M.

Immunoreactivity was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) and the Signal Visual Enhancer system (Pierce), which magnifies the signal. Plasmids Constructs—Dominant negative forms of individual MAPK expression vectors (Erk-DN, p38-DN, and JNK-DN) were kindly provided by Dr. Ralf Janknecht (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Elk-1 wild type and its positive luciferase promoter plasmid construct, c-Fos-Luc, Elk-1-associated mutant constructs (CMV-Elk-1 383A) and Gal4-Elk-1 system, including the Luciferase reporter plasmid construct (Gal4 RE-Luc), Gal4-Elk-1 wt, and Gal4-Elk1 Ser383A, were provided by Dr. A.

The p3xNFκBLuc plasmid construct, containing three copies of tandemly repeated NFκB response element sequences (5′-TTGGGCACTCCCTG-3′) of MMP-13 promoter region was achieved by placing the NFκB response elements of MMP-13 promoter region upstream of an SV40 promoter at the SacI site of the pGL3-promoter vector, which contains a luciferase reporter gene system (Promega) as described previously (31Im H.J.

Transient Transfection by Nucleofection (Electroporation)—Nucleofection methods were optimized for use with human articular chondrocytes by minor modifications of the instructions for the Nucleofector™ kit (Amaxa Biosystems) that have been described previously (18Im H.J.

The Renilla vector (pRL-TK) was co-transfected as an internal control, and the luciferase activity representing promoter activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (Berthold). In samples containing combinations of plasmids (i.e. co-transfections with Elk-1 or pCMV-IκBαM cDNA construct with MMP-13 promoter/luciferase reporter construct) we adjusted the total amount of DNA concentration to <5 μg per 100 μl of cell-Nucleofector solution complex for the entire set of experiments to minimize toxic effects observed at higher DNA concentrations. To introduce siRNA-targeting Elk-1, the validated TranSilent TF siRNAs targeting Elk-1 and GAPDH were purchased from Panomics (Fremont, CA) or SuperArray Bioscience Co. (Frederick, MD) and were introduced into human articular chondrocytes using nucleofection (as described above) by following the manufacturer's protocol. The effect of Elk-1 siRNA on bFGF-mediated MMP-13 expression was assessed by immunoblotting using anti-MMP-13 (R&D System) or anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam, UK). Chemical Inhibitors, Growth Factors, and Cytokines—The PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (10 μm), PKCδ inhibitor (Rottlerin, 4 μm), PKCϵ inhibitor, and PKCα/β inhibitor (GÖ6976, 5 nm); NFκB inhibitor SN50 (peptide inhibitor, 10 μm), IKK inhibitor II (wedelolactone, 10 μm), FGFR1 inhibitor (SU5402, 5 μm), LY294002 (50 nm), rapamycin (20 nm), and wortmanin (10 μm); Ras inhibitor (manumycin A, 3 μm), Raf inhibitor (Raf1 kinase inhibitor 1, 20 μm), MEK inhibitor (PD098059, 20 μm), p38 inhibitor (SB203580, 10 μm), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 20 μm) were purchased from Calbiochem. Human recombinant bFGF and IL-1β were provided by NCI (National Institutes of Health) and Amgen, respectively. Optimal doses were evaluated by dose-dependent experiments for the use of chemical and peptide inhibitors to ensure specific effects on signaling pathways operative in human adult articular chondrocytes. Reverse Transcription and PCR—Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out with 500 ng of total cellular RNA using either real-time or the One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For all experiments, optimal conditions were determined by initially generating cycle number-dependent expression curves and the linear range for the PCR amplification. The same amounts of total RNA or genomic DNA were subjected to One-Step RT-PCR simultaneously to minimize experimental variation due to differences in amplification efficiency. The assessment for GAPDH was performed in parallel (18Im H.J. Kim P. Natarajan V. Schmid T.M. Block J.A. Davis F. van Wijnen A.J. Loeser R.F. J. Biol.

The One-Step RT-PCR was performed using 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 40 s in the presence of 50 pmol of sense and antisense primers. The primer sequences and the conditions for their use are summarized in Table 1. The resulting PCR products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and UV transillumination. Integrated density values for testing genes were normalized relative to GAPDH values to yield a semi-quantitative assessment. For real-time PCR, the primer sets specific to human genes and optimized conditions were used to generate <200-bp coding regions, spanning at least one exon and an intron as we performed previously (18Im H.J.

Following stimulation, culture media was removed, and the cells were then lysed with 1 ml buffer A, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 3 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer B. The samples were incubated on ice for 2 h and centrifuged, and the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Gel Shift Assays (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays)—Gel shift assays of Elk-1 and NFκB were performed by using the commercially available kits (Panomics). Following stimulation, the nuclear extracts (prepared as mentioned above) were incubated with the biotin-labeled double-stranded transcription factor (Elk-1 and NFκB) either consensus sequence or the sequence present in MMP-13 gene. The samples were then resolved on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Pall Biodyne B membrane, blocked, and incubated with Streptavidin-horseradish conjugate. The bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence-imaging system. Unlabeled, double-stranded wild-type oligonucleotides were used to determine the binding specificity of the assay. Nuclear Translocalization of Elk-1—Chondrocytes plated at a density of 100,000 in 4-well chamber slides were cultured for 24 h in complete media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was then changed to serum-free medium for 18 h. Chemical inhibitors were incubated for 1 h prior to treatment with bFGF (100 ng/ml). The treatment was then aborted by washing the cells with 1× PBS three times followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with 1× PBS and incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 prepared in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilizing the cells with Triton X-100, the cells were washed and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. After washing the cells with PBS, the primary antibody prepared in 1% bovine serum albumin made in PBS (1:200 dilution) was then added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with green fluorescent-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (prepared in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. The cells were then washed, the slides were prepared using the mounting media containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes), which can counterstain the nucleus, and visualized using the fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope) connected to a PC running MetaView Imaging Series 6.1. The nuclear image was visualized using a UV filter, whereas the cytoplasmic fluorescence staining was visualized by using a blue filter. Both images were overlaid using MetaView imaging software. Histology—Safranin Orange staining was performed using full thickness cartilage slices prepared from OA knee joint tissues and a 4-mm diameter puncher. These explants were cultured in 1.0 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Following a 2-day recovery period, the cartilage explants were treated with or without bFGF (100 ng/ml) under serum-free conditions (mini-ITS). Following 14 days of incubation, the slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for overnight and embedded in paraffin, and 8 μm sections were prepared. The paraffin sections were deparaffinized and stained with Safranin Orange staining to assess matrix proteoglycan loss. Type II Collagen Digestion Assay—75 ml of culture media from each sample to be tested was activated with 1 μm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma, catalog no. A9563) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. After activation, 75 ml of 0.5 mg/ml chick sternal type II collagen (Sigma, catalog no. C9301) was added to the activated culture media, and the mixture was vortexed thoroughly followed by placing the mixture of culture media and type II collagen (150 μl) in a heating block for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of 2× reducing Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 161-0737), and the samples were then resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 2 h. The gel was destained with water containing 10% methanol and 10% acetate acid. Statistical Analyses—The statistical significance of results was determined by analysis of variance, using StatView 5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Identification of an Elk-1 Response Element in the Distal Promoter Region of the MMP-13 Gene That Regulates MMP-13 Expression in Human Adult Articular Chondrocytes—Our previous studies suggest that bFGF-mediated up-regulation of MMP-13 occurs via a transcriptional stimulation (18Im H.J.

To define elements controlling MMP-13 transcription, MMP-13 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were transiently transfected into primary human articular chondrocytes. Deletion from -1600 (-1600MMP-13) to -736 (-736MMP-13) upstream of the ATG of the MMP-13 promoter region shows no significant change in the basal promoter activity (Fig. 1A), consistent with our previous report with an immortalized chondrocyte cell line (30Im H.J.

Further deletion from -736 to -370 of the MMP-13 promoter (-370MMP-13) significantly reduces basal promoter activity (up to ∼40% reduction). This decreased level of promoter activity is similar to the activity observed for the -186MMP-13 promoter that contains minimal core transcription factor response elements, including motifs for Runx2, ETS, and AP-1. These results suggest that the distal -736 to -370 promoter region of the MMP-13 gene encompasses key elements that regulate MMP-13 promoter activity in human adult articular chondrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1979014492,"We investigated the role and mechanism of action of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) produced by the spinal cord (SC) in pain modulation in sciatic-neuropathic and control rats. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after reverse transcription revealed cytochrome P450c17 (DHEA-synthesizing enzyme) gene repression in neuropathic rat SC. A combination of pulse-chase experiments, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and flow-scintillation detection showed decreased DHEA biosynthesis from pregnenolone in neuropathic SC slices. Radioimmunoassays demonstrated endogenous DHEA level drop in neuropathic SC. Behavioral analysis showed a rapid pronociceptive and a delayed antinociceptive action of acute DHEA treatment. Inhibition of DHEA biosynthesis in the SC by intrathecally administered ketoconazole (P450c17 inhibitor) induced analgesia in neuropathic rats. BD1047 (sigma-1 receptor antagonist) blocked the transient pronociceptive effect evoked by acute DHEA administration. Chronic DHEA treatment increased and maintained elevated the basal nociceptive thresholds in neuropathic and control rats, suggesting that androgenic metabolites generated from daily administered DHEA exerted analgesic effects while DHEA itself (before being metabolized) induced a rapid pronociceptive action. Indeed, intrathecal administration of testosterone, an androgen deriving from DHEA, caused analgesia in neuropathic rats. Together, these molecular, biochemical, and functional results demonstrate that DHEA synthesized in the SC controls pain mechanisms. Possibilities are opened for pain modulation by drugs regulating P450c17 in nerve cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967866736,"In this study we investigated the molecular mechanism by which the Orp1 (Gpx3) protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae senses and reacts with hydrogen peroxide. Upon exposure to H(2)O(2) Orp1(Cys36) forms a disulfide-bonded complex with the C-terminal domain of the Yap1 protein (Yap1-cCRD). We used 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole to identify a cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) modification that forms on Cys(36) of Orp1(Cys36) upon exposure to H(2)O(2). Under similar conditions, neither Cys(82) of Orp1(Cys82) nor Cys(598) of Yap1 forms Cys-SOH. A homology-based molecular model of Orp1 suggests that the structure of the active site of Orp1 is similar to that found in mammalian selenocysteine glutathione peroxidases. Proposed active site residues Gln(70) and Trp(125) form a catalytic triad with Cys(36) in the Orp1 molecular model. The remainder of the active site pocket is formed by Phe(38), Asn(126), and Phe(127), which are evolutionarily conserved residues. We made Q70A and W125A mutants and tested the ability of these mutants to form Cys-SOH in response to H(2)O(2). Both mutants were unable to form Cys-SOH and did not form a H(2)O(2)-inducible disulfide-bonded complex with Yap1-cCRD. The pK(a) of Cys(36) was determined to be 5.1, which is 3.2 pH units lower than that of a free cysteine (8.3). In contrast, Orp1 Cys(82) (the resolving cysteine) has a pK(a) value of 8.3. The pK(a) of Cys(36) in the Q70A and W125A mutants is also 8.3, demonstrating the importance of these residues in modulating the nucleophilic character of Cys(36). Finally, we show that S. cerevisiae strains with ORP1 Q70A and W125A mutations are less tolerant to H(2)O(2) than those containing wild-type ORP1. The results of our study suggest that attempts to identify novel redox-regulated proteins and signal transduction pathways should focus on characterization of low pK(a) cysteines."

We studied the hypothesis that short chain acyl-CoA (SC-CoAs) might be some of these products by discerning the pathways of SC-CoA formation in beta cells. Insulin secretagogues acutely stimulated 1.5–5-fold increases in acetoacetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), and acetyl-CoA in INS-1 832/13 cells as judged from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements. Studies of 12 relevant enzymes in rat and human pancreatic islets and INS-1 832/13 cells showed the feasibility of at least two redundant pathways, one involving acetoacetate and the other citrate, for the synthesis SC-CoAs from secretagogue carbon in mitochondria and the transfer of their acyl groups to the cytosol where the acyl groups are converted to SC-CoAs. Knockdown of two key cytosolic enzymes in INS-1 832/13 cells with short hairpin RNA supported the proposed scheme. Lowering ATP citrate lyase 88% did not inhibit glucose-induced insulin release indicating citrate is not the only carrier of acyl groups to the cytosol.

Physiol. 2005; 288: E1-E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). About one-half of the pyruvate derived from glucose, the most potent insulin secretagogue, is carboxylated by pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate (2MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Brown L.J. Hasan N.M.

Although most of this oxaloacetate is used for anaplerosis and many studies have suggested that anaplerosis is important for insulin secretion (8Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M.

Physiol. 2004; 287: E828-E833Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the purpose of anaplerosis in the beta cell is unclear. It seems clear, however, that if the carboxylation of pyruvate increases the levels of citric acid cycle intermediates inside the mitochondria, this would alter mitochondrial function because many citric acid cycle intermediates inhibit or activate citric acid cycle enzymes (as described in biochemistry texts and briefly reviewed in Refs. 2MacDonald M.J.

Therefore, this indicates that these metabolites must be transferred to the extramitochondrial space where they might have signaling or supporting roles in insulin secretion. To explain part of the role of anaplerosis in insulin secretion, we recently proposed the “succinate mechanism” (14Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2669-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based on our own data and data from the literature and speculated that succinate metabolism supplies both NADPH and short chain acyl-CoA precursors of mevalonic acid that have signaling or supporting roles in insulin secretion (2MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Brown L.J. Hasan N.M. Buss J.D. Kendrick M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1-E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2669-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although succinate metabolism was instrumental in suggesting the original hypothesis, succinate has become less central to the hypothesis as it has evolved, in part, into a scheme involving the mitochondrial synthesis of multiple short chain acyl-CoAs from the carbon derived from all metabolized insulin secretagogues. Another hypothesis of insulin secretion that has been discussed for 2 decades involves the mitochondrial export of citrate as a carrier of acetyl groups to the cytosol where they are converted to malonyl-CoA, which has a special role in insulin secretion via its inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This is believed to increase cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA molecules, which might perform signaling roles in insulin secretion (for a review see Ref. 15Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S299-S304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have described the possible involvement of NADPH in insulin secretion (6MacDonald M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30593-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the possibility that multiple short chain acyl-CoAs, not just mevalonic acid or malonyl-CoA, might be some of the many products of anaplerosis in the beta cell. We first showed that acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, HMG-CoA, 2The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; KIC, α-ketoisocaproate; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcription. succinyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA are increased to various extents in INS-1 cells stimulated by many different insulin secretagogues as judged from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements. We then considered the pathways by which multiple short chain acyl-CoAs might be synthesized from insulin secretagogues in mitochondria and their acyl groups transferred to the cytosol where they could be re-activated with coenzyme A and have roles in insulin secretion. Acyl-CoA molecules themselves cannot be transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane and, therefore, after they are synthesized in mitochondria, the coenzyme A moiety is removed, and their acyl groups are transported as carboxylate ions out of the mitochondria to the extramitochondrial space. Outside the mitochondria they are reconverted to their CoA derivatives. The pathways of the original “succinate mechanism” scheme (14Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2669-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were proposed on the assumption of pathways known to be present in non-beta cells without verification of the presence of the enzymes in the beta cell that might synthesize and metabolize short chain acyl-CoAs or, if present, their intracellular location (mitochondrial versus extramitochondrial). Thus, the scheme did not fully address the pathways by which short chain acyl-CoAs could be synthesized in mitochondria and re-formed in the cytosol. The malonyl-CoA hypothesis seemed to consider citrate as the only carrier of short chain acyl groups from mitochondria to the cytosol (15Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S299-S304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To discern the feasibility of the various possible relevant pathways, we determined the presence or absence, as well as the intracellular locations, of short chain acyl-CoA-synthesizing enzymes in rat and human pancreatic islets and in INS-1 832/13 cells with measurements of their enzyme activities, immunoblot analysis of their protein levels, and/or RT-PCR analysis of their cognate mRNAs. The results showed that beta cells possess enzymes that can form all of the short chain acyl-CoAs studied except malonyl-CoA in their mitochondria and all of the CoAs except succinyl-CoA in their extramitochondrial space. Proof that citrate is not the only carrier of acyl groups from mitochondria to the cytosol was obtained by lowering ATP citrate lyase activity with shRNA and showing that this did not inhibit glucose-induced insulin release. Evidence that acetoacetate is a carrier of acyl groups from mitochondria to the cytosol in the beta cell was obtained by lowering acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase activity with shRNA and observing that this partially inhibited insulin release. Thus, we believe the data suggest that multiple short chain acyl-CoAs formed by anaplerosis could play roles in signaling or supporting insulin secretion and that there are at least two pathways, one involving acetoacetate and the other citrate, for translocation of acyl groups from mitochondria to the cytosol in beta cells.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody to human HMG-CoA reductase was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to human cytosolic acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT2) was from Abcam. Human pancreatic islets were from the Islet Isolation Core at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. INS-1 832/13 cells were from Chris Newgard (22Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 494: 24-30Google Scholar). Short Chain Acyl-CoAs—INS-1 832/13 cells were maintained as monolayers on 150-mm diameter plates in INS-1 medium (RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium (the glucose concentration in this medium is 11.1 mm) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm Hepes buffer (23Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar)) and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Twenty four hours before an experiment was to be performed, this medium was replaced with fresh medium modified to contain 5 mm glucose. On the day of the experiment plates were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and once with 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution modified to contain 15 mm sodium bicarbonate and 15 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.3. Secretagogues were added to the plates in 10 ml of the modified Krebs-Ringer solution, and after 30 min at 37 °C, this solution was quickly withdrawn and replaced with 2 ml of 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% methanol. The extracts were then prepared for analysis and analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry exactly as described previously (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6043-6052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation of pancreatic islets was as described previously (6MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, islets were homogenized in 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm potassium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 (MSH). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to precipitate the nuclei and cell debris fraction, and the resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 10 min to precipitate the mitochondrial fraction. The resulting supernatant fraction or a 20,000 × g for 20 min supernatant fraction was the cytosol. In some instances, the 5,500 × g supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 or 50,000 × g for 20 min to obtain a pellet enriched in microsomes and peroxisomes. Liver, kidney, and heart subcellular fractions were prepared as described previously (25MacDonald M.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 258: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were fractionated with reagents from the mitochondrial isolation kit (catalog number 8974, Pierce). About 100 μl of loosely packed INS-1 832/13 cells were homogenized in 800 μl of mitochondria isolation reagent A containing a protease inhibitor EDTA-free mixture (Pierce). After vortexing and a 2-min incubation on ice, 10 μl of reagent B was added. The mixture sat on ice for 5 min and was then homogenized with 30 strokes up and down in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Reagent C (800 μl) containing Halt protease inhibitor was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to give the mitochondrial pellet that was resuspended in MSH solution and freeze-thawed three times before use. The resulting supernatant fraction (cytosol) and mitochondrial fraction were used for enzyme assays and immunoblot analysis. In some instances, the resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at higher speeds to obtain a pellet enriched in microsomes and peroxisomes as described for islets. Enzyme Assays—Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase was measured in the presence of 50 mm sodium acetoacetate, 0.2 mm succinyl-CoA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 8.0 (26Williamson D.H. Bates M.W. Page M.A. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), at 30 °C. The rate of acetoacetyl-CoA formation was followed by measuring the increase in absorbance at 310 nm. Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase was measured in the presence of 25 μm acetoacetyl-CoA, 60 μm coenzyme A, 5 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.6, at 30 °C. The disappearance of acetoacetyl-CoA was followed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 303 nm (27Middleton B. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase was measured with slight modifications of a radiochemical assay (28Bergstrom J.D. Edmond J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete assay mixture contained final concentrations of 0.5 mm β-[3-14C]hydroxybutyrate (specific radioactivity, 3 mCi/mmol), 1 mm coenzyme A, 1.5 mm ATP, 3 mm NAD, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.05 units/ml of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides in Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.5. The mixture was maintained at 37 °C for 10 min to generate [3-14C]acetoacetate before pancreatic islet cytosol or INS-1 cytosol was added to bring the final volume to 50 μl. After 20 more min the enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 12 μl of acetic acid to the reaction mixture, and part of or the entire volume was spotted on Whatman SG81 chromatography paper. Chromatography was run in a mixture of ethyl ether:formic acid (7:1) for 60–90 min. Acetoacetyl-CoA remains at the origin and acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate migrate with the solvent front. Liquid scintillation spectrometry was used to measure radioactivity in squares of paper cut from the origin to estimate synthetase activity. Radioactivity in blanks containing cytosol and reaction mixtures minus ATP was subtracted from the radioactivity in samples containing the complete reaction mixture plus cytosol to calculate activity attributable to the synthetase. The activity with ATP present in the enzyme assay mixture was 17–26-fold higher than with no ATP present or when a blank with no cellular extract was present in the reaction mixture when INS-1 cytosol was used and 5-fold higher when rat islet cytosol was used. ATP citrate lyase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 5 mm citrate, 0.3 mm coenzyme A, 3 mm ATP, 0.15 mm NADH, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 units/ml of malate dehydrogenase from pig heart mitochondria in Tris chloride buffer, pH 8.5, at 37 °C (29Ki S.W. Ishigami K. Kitahara T. Kasahar K. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39231-39236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The disappearance of NADH, which corresponded to oxaloacetate formation, was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was measured in the presence of 10 mm α-ketoglutarate, 50 mm NH4Cl, 100 μm NADH, 2 mm ADP, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm KCN, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.0 at 30 °C (30MacDonald M.J. McKenzie D.I. Kaysen J.H. Walker T.M. Moran S.M. Fahein L.A. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADH disappearance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. In each spectrophotometric assay, the background rate measured in the absence of one substrate was subtracted from the rate in the presence of the complete reaction mixture to give the rate attributable to the enzyme. Usually for positive controls, enzyme activities were measured in non-islet tissues known to contain the enzyme of interest (data not shown). RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured INS-1 (832/13) cells and from freshly isolated rat islets and liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified on an RNeasy Mini column (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was performed with the primers shown in supplemental Table 1. cDNAs from tissues known to contain specific transcripts were run as positive controls (data not shown). Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting of HMG-CoA synthase, rat islets and INS-1 cells, or human islets, were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing protease inhibitors. Rat liver and heart tissue were homogenized, and protein was extracted using T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing protease inhibitors. Whole rat islets were either homogenized in MSH and boiled in sample buffer or boiled directly in sample buffer (1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 65 mm Tris chloride, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and either 100 mm dithiothreitol or 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with a mixture of 5% nonfat milk and 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antiserum diluted 1:500 to 1:2000 in blocking buffer. Primary antisera were raised in rabbits immunized with internal peptides of the rat cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase (HIPSPAKKVPRLPAT) and the rat mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (CSTIPPAPLAKTDT) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (the amino-terminal cysteine was added to the native sequence to facilitate conjugation). The membranes were washed and treated with the secondary antibody labeled with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:15,000 in blocking buffer, and proteins were visualized with the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Luminescence was captured on a Chemi Doc XRS Gel documentation system (Bio-Rad) or on KSR-B Luc Ultra Autorad x-ray film (ISC Bioexpress). To demonstrate equal loading of proteins per lane, the membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated in Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) for 30 min at 42 °C and re-probed with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Immunoblotting to detect other proteins was done similarly using dilutions of antibody recommended by the supplier. For each enzyme as appropriate, proteins were also measured in subcellular fractions from kidney, liver, or heart as positive or negative controls (data not always shown). Silencing of ATP Citrate Lyase and Acetoacetyl-CoA Synthetase Genes—Five different 65-bp inserts containing 19-bp sequences targeted against the ATP citrate lyase gene were cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pRNA-U6.1/Hygro plasmid downstream of the U6 promoter (Genescript) and transfected into INS-1 832/13 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected and maintained in INS-1 tissue culture medium containing 150 μg/ml of hygromycin. The target sequence that provided the largest decrease in enzyme activity and enzyme protein was CAACAGACCTATGACTACG (nucleotides 1012–1030 of GenBank™ accession number NM_016987). Three 64–69-bp inserts containing 19–22-bp sequences targeted against the acetoacetyl synthetase gene were cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid pSilencer 2.1-U6 Hygro (Ambion) downstream of the U6 promoter and transfected into the INS-1 cells and selected with hygromycin. The target sequence that provided the largest decrease in enzyme activity and insulin release was ACAGCATGTTTCTGGATGA (nucleotides 872–891 of GenBank™ accession number NM_023104). Sequences that gave less knockdown of enzyme activity and insulin release were GGAATTACGATGACTTATA and GGAAGGCTTACTTCTCCAAATA. As an additional control, cells were also transfected with a vector containing a nontargeting shRNA sequence. Data Analysis—Statistical significance was confirmed with Student's t test. Short Chain Acyl-CoA Measurements—The first phase of insulin release normally begins within 3 min of an increase in glucose or other insulin secretagogues that come in contact with the beta cell. The second phase of insulin release, in which the largest amount of insulin is released, is caused by metabolism of insulin secretagogues (31Henquin J.C. Ravier M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and lasts for several hours or until the stimulus stops. We stimulated INS-1 832/13 cells with various insulin secretagogues, as well as nonsecretagogues as negative controls, and selected 30 min as a time point to measure short chain acyl-CoAs in beta cells when the cells would likely be showing changes in metabolite levels related to a stimulated state. Relative insulin release caused by the various secretagogues and nonsecretagogue controls is listed in the legend of Fig. 2. In INS-1 832/13 cells used for these studies numerous concomitant measurements of insulin release showed that glucose, pyruvate, and leucine plus glutamine were the most potent stimulants of insulin release from these cells, closely followed by 2 mm α-ketoisocaproate plus 10 mm monomethyl succinate (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6043-6052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 4M. J. MacDonald, unpublished data. Leucine provides a moderate stimulus of insulin release in these cells. 4M. J. MacDonald, unpublished data. Incubation of INS-1 832/13 cells for 30 min under conditions that stimulate insulin release caused large relative increases in several short chain acyl-CoAs. The unstimulated concentration of acetoacetyl-CoA was the lowest of any of the CoAs measured, and the relative increases in acetoacetyl-CoA were the largest (2–5-fold). Succinyl-CoA, HMG-CoA, and malonyl-CoA were present at intermediate levels. Succinyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA were increased 2–3-fold. HMG-CoA was increased 30–60% and acetyl-CoA, which was present at the highest level of the CoAs studied, was increased 55–80%. Pyruvate, which is as potent an insulin secretagogue as glucose in INS-1 832/13 cells (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6043-6052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin.

In fresh rat pancreatic islets α-ketoisocaproate at a 10 mm concentration is as potent an insulin stimulant as glucose, but α-ketoisocaproate alone does not stimulate insulin in INS-1 832/13 cells (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6043-6052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). α-Ketoisocaproate alone at either 2 or 10 mm also caused large increases in the short chain CoAs. Methyl succinate alone and leucine alone each stimulate about one-third the amount of insulin release of glucose in fresh rat pancreatic islets (24MacDonald M.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2030633377,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a multifunctional phosphatase that plays important roles in many cellular processes including regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Because PP2A is involved in so many diverse processes, it is highly regulated by both non-covalent and covalent mechanisms that are still being defined. In this study we have investigated the importance of leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT-1) for PP2A methylation and cell function. We show that reduction of LCMT-1 protein levels by small hairpin RNAs causes up to a 70% reduction in PP2A methylation in HeLa cells, indicating that LCMT-1 is the major mammalian PP2A methyltransferase. In addition, LCMT-1 knockdown reduced the formation of PP2A heterotrimers containing the Balpha regulatory subunit and, in a subset of the cells, induced apoptosis, characterized by caspase activation, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and membrane blebbing. Knockdown of the PP2A Balpha regulatory subunit induced a similar amount of apoptosis, suggesting that LCMT-1 induces apoptosis in part by disrupting the formation of PP2A(BalphaAC) heterotrimers. Treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor partially rescued cells from apoptosis induced by LCMT-1 or Balpha knockdown. LCMT-1 knockdown cells and Balpha knockdown cells were more sensitive to the spindle-targeting drug nocodazole, suggesting that LCMT-1 and Balpha are important for spindle checkpoint. Treatment of LCMT-1 and Balpha knockdown cells with thymidine dramatically reduced cell death, presumably by blocking progression through mitosis. Consistent with these results, homozygous gene trap knock-out of LCMT-1 in mice resulted in embryonic lethality. Collectively, our results indicate that LCMT-1 is important for normal progression through mitosis and cell survival and is essential for embryonic development in mice."

The NMR structure of Ca2+-bound Frq1 complexed to an N-terminal Pik1 fragment (residues 121-174) was determined. The Frq1 main chain is similar to that in free Frq1 and related proteins in the same branch of the calmodulin superfamily. The myristoyl group and first eight residues of Frq1 are solvent-exposed, and Ca2+ binds the second, third, and fourth EF-hands, which associate to create a groove with two pockets. The Pik1 peptide forms two helices (125-135 and 156-169) connected by a 20-residue loop. Side chains in the Pik1 N-terminal helix (Val-127, Ala-128, Val-131, Leu-132, and Leu-135) interact with solvent-exposed residues in the Frq1 C-terminal pocket (Leu-101, Trp-103, Val-125, Leu-138, Ile-152, and Leu-155); side chains in the Pik1 C-terminal helix (Ala-157, Ala-159, Leu-160, Val-161, Met-165, and Met-167) contact solvent-exposed residues in the Frq1 N-terminal pocket (Trp-30, Phe-34, Phe-48, Ile-51, Tyr-52, Phe-55, Phe-85, and Leu-89). This defined complex confirms that residues in Pik1 pinpointed as necessary for Frq1 binding by site-directed mutagenesis are indeed sufficient for binding. Removal of the Pik1 N-terminal region (residues 8-760) from its catalytic domain (residues 792-1066) abolishes lipid kinase activity, inconsistent with Frq1 binding simply relieving an autoinhibitory constraint. Deletion of the lipid kinase unique motif (residues 35-110) also eliminates Pik1 activity. In the complex, binding of Ca2+-bound Frq1 forces the Pik1 chain into a U-turn. Frq1 may activate Pik1 by facilitating membrane targeting via the exposed N-myristoyl group and by imposing a structural transition that promotes association of the lipid kinase unique motif with the kinase domain.

Frq1 and other frequenins belong to the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) branch of the calmodulin superfamily, which includes recoverin and neurocalcin (28Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D.

These proteins are small (≤25 kDa) and characterized by a consensus signal for N-terminal myristoylation and four EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites (Fig. 1). We have shown previously that, at saturation, Frq1 binds only three Ca2+ (32Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Frq1, which is itself essential for the viability of yeast cells (20Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), associates with membranes in a manner that depends on both the N-myristoyl group and conformational changes induced upon Ca2+ binding, suggesting that Frq1, like other NCS proteins, may possess a Ca2+-myristoyl switch (32Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, prior work indicated that N-myristoylation of Frq1 is important (but not essential) for stimulating both the catalytic activity (20Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the membrane recruitment of Pik1 (17Strahl T. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Thorner J. J.

The structure of Frq1 in solution revealed that calcium is bound at EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4, and the overall main chain fold is similar to that seen previously for Ca2+-bound forms of recoverin, neurocalcin, GCAP2, and KChIP1. The four EF-hands form two domains packed in a globular arrangement that contrasts with the dumbbell-shaped arrangement of EF-hand domains seen in calmodulin and troponin C (41Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 42Herzberg O. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A striking feature of the NCS structures is a solvent-exposed hydrophobic groove formed by residues Phe-22, Trp-30, Phe-34, Phe-48, Ile-51, Tyr-52, Phe-55, Phe-85, and Leu-89 in the N-terminal domain of Frq1 that are invariant in all other NCS proteins (Fig. 1). The corresponding hydrophobic residues in GCAP2, recoverin, and KChIP1 have been implicated previously in target recognition (35Zhou W. Qian Y. Kunjilwar K. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S.

We report here the NMR-derived structure of Frq1 in solution bound to a fragment (residues 121-174) corresponding to the Frq1-docking site in Pik1 (21Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S.

This is the first atomic resolution structure of a Ca2+-myristoyl switch protein bound to a lipid kinase target protein. The structure reveals that Pik1-(121-174) forms two antiparallel α-helical segments that interact with bipartite binding sites on the surface of Frq1. In essence, binding of Frq1 generates a U-turn in the Pik1 polypeptide, shedding considerable light on how Frq1 may potentiate the activity of this enzyme. Moreover, the structure of Frq1 bound to Pik1-(121-174) is somewhat different from the target complexes of other EF-hand proteins, like recoverin (40Ames J.B. Levay K. Wingard J.N. Lusin J.D.

Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and grown in M9 minimal medium containing [15N]NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose, according to well established procedures (48Muchmore D.C.

Labeled Frq1 was purified from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysates using Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography on a nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peak fractions were then applied to an anion-exchange column (50-ml bed, DEAE-Sepharose, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A (2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0-0.4 m KCl) at a flow rate of 2 ml min-1 over the course of 180 min. Peak fractions were concentrated to 5 ml and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-100, GE Healthcare) in buffer B (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Final purity was greater than 98%, as judged by SDS-PAGE. A functional polypeptide fragment of Pik1 (residues 121-174, named Pik1-(121-174)) uniformly labeled with nitrogen-15 and/or carbon-13 and tagged with a C-terminal His6 tract was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) carrying the pET23d vector (Novagen) harboring the Pik1-(121-174) coding sequence (21Huttner I.G.

Labeled Pik1-(121-174) was isolated from the insoluble fraction of bacterial cell lysates dissolved in 8 m urea buffer and purified using Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography on a nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peak fractions were then dialyzed extensively against 4 liters of 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) to remove urea. After dialysis, the Pik1-(121-174) polypeptide remained soluble at pH 5.0 and was concentrated about 10-fold to a final concentration of 1 mm used in NMR experiments. The Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex used in NMR experiments was prepared by slowly mixing a relatively dilute stock solution of Ca2+-bound Frq1 (0.05 mm Frq1 in 2 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.0) to 1 eq of Pik1-(121-174) (0.05 mm Pik1 in 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at pH 5.0). The dilute preparation was then concentrated 20-fold to generate a final sample used in NMR studies (0.3 ml of 1 mm Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex). NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR analysis consisted of 15N-labeled or 13C/15N-labeled Frq1 bound to 1 eq of unlabeled Pik1-(121-174) (1.0 mm) in 0.3 ml of a 95% H2O, 5% [2H]H2O solution containing 5 mm sodium acetate and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 5.0). Reverse-labeled samples (i.e. 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled Pik1-(121-174) bound to 1 eq of unlabeled Frq1) were also prepared for some of the NMR experiments. All NMR experiments were performed at 40 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 or DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a four-channel interface and triple resonance probe with triple axis pulsed field gradients and DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with an Ultrashield Bruker magnet, a three-channel interface, and cryo-probe with z axis pulsed field gradients. The 15N-1H HSQC spectra (see Fig. 2) were recorded on a sample of 15N-labeled Frq1 bound to unlabeled Pik1-(121-174) (Fig. 2A) and 15N-labeled Pik1-(121-174) bound to unlabeled Frq1 (Fig. 2B) (in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O). The number of complex points and acquisition times were as follows: 256, 180 ms (15N (F1)); and 512, 64 ms (1H (F2)). The 13C (F1)-edited, 13C (F3)-filtered NOESY-HMQC spectra (see Fig. 2C) were recorded on a sample of unlabeled Frq1 protein bound to 13C-labeled Pik1-(121-174) (51Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as 13C-labeled Frq1 bound to unlabeled Pik1-(121-174) (data not shown). Intermolecular NOESY experiments were performed as described previously (52Lee W. Revington M.J. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments of chiral methyl groups of valine and leucine were obtained by analyzing 1H-13C HSQC experiments performed on a sample that contained 10% 13C labeling in either Frq1 or Pik1-(121-174) (53Neri D.

All triple resonance experiments were performed, processed, and analyzed as described (54Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 849-853PubMed Google Scholar, 55Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Kainosho M. Stryer L. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on a sample of 13C/15N-labeled Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex (in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O) with the following number of complex points and acquisition times: HNCO (15N (F1) 32, 23.7 ms; 13CO (F2) 64, 42.7 ms; 1H (F3) 512, 64 ms); HNCACB (15N (F1) 32, 23.7 ms; 13C (F2) 48, 6.3 ms; 1H (F3) 512, 64 ms); CBCACONNH (15N (F1) 32, 23.7 ms; 13C (F2) 48, 6.3 ms; 1H (F3) 512, 64 ms); CBCACOCAHA (13C (F1) 52, 6.8 ms, 13CO (F2) 64, 42 ms, 1H (F3) 384, 64 ms); and, HBHACONNH (15N (F1) 32, 23.7 ms, 1Hab (F2) 64 21 ms; 1H (F3) 512, 64 ms). The triple resonance and NOESY spectra measured above were analyzed to determine secondary and tertiary structure in Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex. The chemical shift index (see Ref. 56Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar for detailed description), 3JNHα coupling constants, and NOE connectivity patterns for each residue were analyzed and provided a measure of the overall secondary structure. Small 3JNHα coupling constants (<5 Hz), strong NOE connectivities (NN(i,i + 1) and αN(i,i + 3)), and positive chemical shift index are characteristic of residues in an α-helix. Conversely, large 3JNHα coupling constants (>8 Hz), strong αN(i,i + 1) and weak NN(i,i + 1) NOE connectivities, and negative chemical shift index are characteristic of residues in a β-strand. The results of the secondary structure analysis of Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex are summarized schematically in Fig. 1. 15N{1H} NOE data were measured using two-dimensional 15N,1H HSQC-based experiments as described previously (57Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Saturation was carried out with a series of 120° 1H pulses separated by 5-ms delays applied during the interscan delay (3 s). Structure Calculation—Backbone and side chain NMR resonances of Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex were assigned as described previously (55Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Kainosho M. Stryer L. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Structure calculations were performed using the YASAP protocol within X-PLOR (58Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), as described previously (59Bagby S. Harvey T.S. Eagle S.G. Inouye S. Ikura M. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 107-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A total of 2300 interproton distance constraints were obtained as described (55Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Kainosho M. Stryer L. Ikura M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by analysis of 13C-edited and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (100 ms mixing time) of 13C,15N-labeled Frq1 bound to unlabeled Pik1-(121-174) and 13C,15N-labeled Pik1-(121-174) bound to unlabeled Frq1. In addition to the NOE-derived distance constraints, the following additional constraints were included in the structure calculation: 18 distance constraints involving Ca2+ bound to loop residues 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 in each EF-hand motif (EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4); 170 distance constraints for 85 hydrogen bonds; and 222 dihedral angle constraints. Fifty independent structures were calculated, and the 20 structures of lowest energy were selected. The average total and experimental distance energies are 4730 and 61 kcal mol-1. The average root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) from an idealized geometry for bonds and angles are 0.0068 Å and 2.05°. None of the distance and angle constraints were violated by more than 0.40 Å or 4°, respectively. Deletion Analysis of Pik1—To construct Pik1-(Δ34-110), Pik1-(Δ8-760), and Pik1-(Δ16-833), DNA fragments of PIK1 carrying these respective internal deletions were generated by PCR with appropriate primers and pRS316-GAL1prom-GFP-Pik1 as the template. The resulting PCR products were incorporated in place of the normal PIK1 open reading frame in pRS316-GAL1prom-GFP-Pik1, which had been linearized by cleavage with MfeI, via homologous recombination-mediated gap-repair (60Ma H. Kunes S. Schatz P.J. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) in yeast strain BY4743. Plasmid DNA was recovered from the resulting Ura+ transformants, amplified in Escherichia coli, and sequenced to verify production of the proper in-frame deletions. The control plasmid, pRS314-GAL1prom-GFP-Pik1, has been described before (17Strahl T. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Standard methods for DNA-mediated transformation, sporulation, tetrad dissection, and other genetic manipulations of yeast cells were used (61Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R. (eds) (1991) Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology, Vol. 194, Academic Press, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). In vitro lipid-kinase assays and immunoblot analysis of proteins were done essentially as described before (17Strahl T. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Preparation and Characterization of the Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) Complex—We showed previously that Frq1 interacts with Pik1 in a localized region (residues 121-174) that is necessary and sufficient for Pik1 activation by Frq1 (21Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S. Ames J.B. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4862-4874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A stoichiometric complex of Frq1 bound to Pik1-(121-174) at saturating Ca2+ is soluble and stable under NMR conditions. The Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex is monomeric in solution with a total molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, as judged by dynamic light scattering analysis and size-exclusion chromatography. The binding energetics for the Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) complex were quantified using isothermal titration calorimetry, as described previously (21Huttner I.G. Strahl T. Osawa M. King D.S. Ames J.B. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4862-4874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of the isothermal titration calorimetry data revealed that complex formation occurs with a stoichiometry of 1:1, a dissociation constant of ∼100 nm, and enthalpy of +7 kcal/mol, suggesting that binding is largely entropy-driven. Entropically driven binding is consistent with hydrophobic intermolecular interactions and/or a protein conformational change. NMR Structural Analysis of the Frq1-Pik1-(121-174) Complex—The 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of 15N-labeled Frq1 exhibited spectral changes that saturated upon the addition of 1 eq of unlabeled Pik1-(121-174) (Fig. 2A), confirming that Frq1 binds to Pik1-(121-174) in a 1:1 complex under NMR conditions. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled Frq1 in the complex exhibited the expected number of amide resonances (190) with uniform intensity, indicating that the complex is structurally homogeneous and stably folded. Pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion studies (62Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar) confirmed that the complex is monomeric under NMR conditions. Sequence-specific assignments for the amide peaks are indicated in Fig. 2A. More than 96% of the amide resonances were assigned exc"
https://openalex.org/W1995798426,"Cripto-1 (CR-1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane glycoprotein that has been shown to play an important role in embryogenesis and cellular transformation. CR-1 is reported to function as a membrane-bound co-receptor and as a soluble ligand. Although a number of studies implicate the role of CR-1 as a soluble ligand in tumor progression, it is unclear how transition from the membrane-bound to the soluble form is physiologically regulated and whether differences in biological activity exist between these forms. Here, we demonstrate that CR-1 protein is secreted from tumor cells into the conditioned medium after treatment with serum, epidermal growth factor, or lysophosphatidic acid, and this soluble form of CR-1 exhibits the ability to promote endothelial cell migration as a paracrine chemoattractant. On the other hand, membrane-bound CR-1 can stimulate endothelial cell sprouting through direct cell-cell interaction. Shedding of CR-1 occurs at the GPI-anchorage site by the activity of GPI-phospholipase D (GPI-PLD), because CR-1 shedding was suppressed by siRNA knockdown of GPI-PLD and enhanced by overexpression of GPI-PLD. These findings describe a novel molecular mechanism of CR-1 shedding, which may contribute to endothelial cell migration and possibly tumor angiogenesis.

EGF-CFC proteins are indispensable for early embryonic development, being involved in the formation of the primitive streak, patterning of the anterior/posterior axis, mesoendoderm formation, and establishment of left-right asymmetry (2Shen M.M. Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). CR-1 is an oncofetal gene, which is expressed during early developmental stages and is re-expressed in several types of human carcinomas (3Bianco C. Kim L. Normanno N. Khan N. Salomon D.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 67: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fact, CR-1 protein is highly expressed in a number of human carcinomas, including breast (75-82%), colon (67-84%), and gastric cancer (33-47%), where it is being assessed as a tumor-specific target for immunotherapy (3Bianco C.

CR-1 functions through at least three different signaling pathways: 1) as a co-receptor for the transforming growth factor β-related proteins Nodal and growth and differentiation factors 1 and 3 (10Yeo C.

Nodal requires EGF-CFC proteins as co-receptors to bind the activin type I receptors (activin-like kinases 4 and 7) and activin type II receptor (ActRII). Embryological defects in CR-1-null mice are lethal mainly due to a disruption of Nodal-dependent signaling (15Ding J. Kim L. Yan Y.T. Chen A. Desai N. Wynshaw-Boris A. Shen M.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CR-1 can also function independently of Nodal as a ligand for glypican-1, which can activate a c-Src/MAPK/PI3K-Akt intracellular signaling pathway (3Bianco C. Kim L. Normanno N. Khan N. Salomon D.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 67: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and then promote cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion (5Strizzi L. Kim C. Normanno N. Seno M.

Some of the oncogenic actions of CR-1, such as tumor angiogenesis, utilize this latter pathway (16Bianco C. Kim L. Ebert A. Chang C. Rehman A. Normanno N. Guedez L. Salloum R. Ginsburg E. Sun Y. Khan N. Hirota M. Wallace-Jones B. Wechselberger C. Vonderhaar B.K. Tosato G. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Sanicola M. Salomon D.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). EGF-CFC proteins contain several domains that include an N-terminal signal peptide, a variant EGF-like domain, a cysteine-rich CFC domain, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linkage signal at the C-terminus. CR-1 is tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor (17Minchiotti G. Kim S. Liguori G. Signore M. Lania G. Adamson E.D. Lago C.T. Persico M.G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the GPI anchoring enables CR-1 to act as a membrane-bound co-receptor, CR-1 can also be released as a soluble protein (18Minchiotti G. Kim G. Parisi S. Lago C.T. Rosa F. Persico M.G. Development. 2001; 128: 4501-4510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yan Y.T. Kim J.J. Luo Y.E.C. Haltiwanger R.S. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4439-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the endogenous regulatory mechanism controlling CR-1 shedding is largely unknown. We have previously found that CR-1 is a potent endothelial chemoattractant in vitro and promotes tumor angiogenesis in vivo (16Bianco C. Kim L. Ebert A. Chang C. Rehman A. Normanno N. Guedez L. Salloum R. Ginsburg E. Sun Y. Khan N. Hirota M. Wallace-Jones B. Wechselberger C. Vonderhaar B.K. Tosato G. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Sanicola M. Salomon D.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To facilitate endothelial cell migration in vivo, CR-1 should be released from tumor cells to interact with surrounding endothelial cells. In this respect, a recent study has demonstrated that the plasma levels of CR-1 in breast and colon cancer patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (20Bianco C. Kim L. Mancino M. Rehman A. Hamada S. Watanabe K. De Luca A. Jones B. Balogh G. Russo J. Mailo D. Palaia R. D'Aiuto G. Botti G. Perrone F. Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 5158-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that CR-1 is released into plasma from tumor cells and that plasma CR-1 levels might serve as a surrogate tumor marker. Therefore, shedding of CR-1 is a key biological process in understanding the characteristics of CR-1 as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancer and in delineating the mechanism by which CR-1 can initiate angiogenesis. In the current study, we have evaluated the differential roles of membrane-bound and soluble forms of CR-1 in stimulating endothelial cells and delineated the mechanism of CR-1 shedding in vitro. Cells—HEK293T (293T), MDCK, COS7, and SW480 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NTERA2/D1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Macoy's 5A medium with 15% FBS. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured as described previously (16Bianco C. Kim L. Ebert A. Chang C.

Human embryonic cells Per-C6 (Crucell, Leiden, The Netherlands) transfected with wild-type CR-1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml G418, and 10% FBS. Reagents—Human CR-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (MAB2771 and FAB2772P) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) or developed as previously reported (B3F6) (8Adkins H.B. Kim C. Schiffer S.G.

Antibodies against total p42/44 MAPK, phospho-p42/44 MAPK, total Akt, phospho-Akt, and phospho-Smad2 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), total Smad2 from Upstate (Chicago, IL), β-actin from Sigma-Aldrich, and transferrin receptor (TfR) and V5 from Invitrogen. Phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Cholera toxin B (CTxB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All fluorescent dyes were purchased from Invitrogen, and all chemical compounds were from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) or, for recombinant proteins, from R&D Systems. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Plasmids and Transfection—The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of human CR-1 was cloned from NTERA2/D1 cells (13Bianco C. Kim H.B. Wechselberger C. Seno M. Normanno N. De Luca A. Sun Y. Khan N.

All CR-1-related constructs were generated by PCR-based methods and cloned into the pCI neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The stop codon (TGA) was inserted just after Ser-161 or Ser-169 of the full-length CR-1 (amino acids 1-188, CR1WT) to obtain CR1ΔC (Ser-161) or (Ser-169), respectively. The transmembrane portion of ErbB4 (amino acids 651-683) with a FLAG tag was inserted after Ser-169 of CR1WT to obtain CR1TM. The cDNA encoding mouse GPI-phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) was purchased from ATCC (IMAGE clone, 5052822). The open reading frame with Kozak sequence was amplified by PCR using primers: F, ACCATGTCTGCAGGCAGGCTGTGG; R, GTCTGAGCTGAAGCTGTAGAC. The PCR product was cloned into pEF6/V5-His TOPO TA expression vector (Invitrogen) in-frame to generate a C-terminal-tagged mGPIPLD-V5 expression vector. DNA sequences were validated by direct sequencing. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To establish stable transfectants, transfected cells were selected by G418, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 293T and MDCK cells and 2 mg/ml for SW480 cells, respectively. Isolation of Detergent-resistant Microdomains—DRM isolation by nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was performed as previously reported (22McCabe J.B. Kim L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3601-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NTERA2/D1 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of MBS (MES-buffered saline; 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C. After homogenization by 10 strokes with a tightfitting Dounce homogenizer, samples were adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose. Then, a 5-40% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 20 h, in an SW40Ti rotor (Beckmann-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Twelve 1-ml fractions were removed from the top of the tubes and analyzed by Western blotting for CR-1 and for the non-raft-associated membrane protein, TfR using an anti-human TfR antibody (1:2,000) and by dot blotting for the lipid raft marker GM-1 using HRP-conjugated CTxB (1:1,000). Phase Separation—Phase separation by Triton X-114 was performed as previously described (23Lee J.Y. Kim M.R. Sok D.E. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid) with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and PI-PLC treatment was performed by incubating with 1 unit/ml PI-PLC (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates and conditioned media were then adjusted to 2% Triton X-114 using 2× Triton X-114 solution (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 4% Triton X-114). After incubation for 1 h on ice, phase separation was carried out by warming up to 37 °C and subsequent centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 25 °C. Before applying for Western blotting, proteins were precipitated with chloroform-methanol precipitation to remove the detergent. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and CR-1 protein was detected with B3F6 mAb at a 1:5,000 dilution and anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000, Amersham Biosciences) (supplemental Fig. S1, A-C). For quantification, 50 μg of total cell lysates and 40 μl of conditioned media were analyzed for NTERA2/D1 cells, and 20 μg of total cell lysates and 20 μl of conditioned media were analyzed for 293T transfectants, respectively. All images of Western blot analysis in this work were visualized, processed, and quantified with an Image Analyzer equipped with LabWorks software (Ultra Violet and Laboratory Products, Upland, CA). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—A sandwich-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as previously described (20Bianco C. Kim L. Mancino M. Rehman A. Hamada S. Watanabe K. De Luca A. Jones B. Balogh G. Russo J. Mailo D. Palaia R. D'Aiuto G. Botti G. Perrone F. Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 5158-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Anti-CR-1 mAb B3F6 (1 μg/well) was absorbed to a 96-well Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp Plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). The plates were blocked with blocking solution (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), washed with wash buffer (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of conditioned media from growth factor-treated cells. Human CR-1 recombinant protein (R&D Systems) was used as a standard (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). After washing, a rabbit polyclonal anti-CR-1 antibody (1:3,000) was added to the plates for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed five times with washing buffer and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (1:3,000, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidasesubstrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), and reactions were quenched with stop solution (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Absorbance was read at 450 nm. Fluorescence Imaging—Cells were grown for overnight in chambered slides. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Depending on the experiment, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking, CR-1 was labeled with 5 μg/ml MAB2771 and detected with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Plasma membrane and lipid rafts were detected with 5 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate and with 1 μg/ml CTxB-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Invitrogen), respectively. Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) was used as a mounting medium. For confocal images, a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Meta confocal system (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) with an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective lens was used. Z stacks were collected with Zeiss AIM software using a multitrack configuration. FACS Analysis—293T transfectants were collected with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mm EDTA. After washing with ice-cold FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 1.0 × 105 cells were incubated for 20 min with anti-human CR-1 phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (FAB2772P) at a dilution of 1:50. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer, and analyzed using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). Migration Assay—Transwell migration assay of HUVECs was performed as previously described (21Watanabe K. Kim Y. Yamashita H. Shimizu K. Ding Y. Abe M. Ohta H. Imagawa K. Hojo K. Maki H. Sonoda H. Sato Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 24 h prior to the assay, the culture medium of 293T or SW480 transfectants, which were seeded in the bottom chamber, were replaced with serum-free medium with or without growth factors or chemicals. 5 × 104 serum-starved HUVECs were seeded in the upper chamber of 8-μm pore filter 24-well Transwell plates (Corning, Acton, MA). After 12-16 h, cells were fixed and stained, and cells on the upper side of the filters were wiped away with cotton swabs. Migrated cells on the bottom side of the filter were quantified using IMAGE (National Institutes of Health) software. Each experiment was performed in triplicates and repeated at least twice in independent culture conditions. Direct Co-culture Assay—HUVECs were labeled with Cell-Tracker green 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (Invitrogen) prior to the assay. 5 × 104 labeled HUVECs were seeded on confluent cultures of 293T transfectants that had been grown in 6-well plates in serum-free medium. After 12-16 h, cells were fixed and counter staining was performed with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) and DAPI. Images were taken by fluorescence microscopy, on an IX51 inverted microscope equipped with a 20× 0.4-nemerical aperture objective lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For quantification, HUVECs with sprouting morphology (spindle shapes and/or processes) were counted in total 70-135 CellTracker-positive HUVECs/field under low power magnification. Counting was performed for three different fields in a blinded manner, and three independent experiments were performed. siRNA and RT-PCR Analysis—siRNAs against GPI-PLD were purchased from Ambion (Foster City, CA). Sequences are as below follows: siGPIPLD1 sense, GGAUUCCUUAGGACCAUGGtt; antisense, CCAUGGUCCUAAGGAAUCCtt; si-GPIPLD2 sense, GCUAUUGAUUUUCACGGCUtt; antisense, AGCCGUGAAAAUCAAUAGCTC; siGPIPLD3 sense, GCUCUGGAGUUUCUUCAGCtt; and antisense, GCUGAAGAAACUCCAGAGCtc. These sequences contain 1- to 4-nucleotide mismatches with mouse GPI-PLD, which was used for the rescue experiment. Mixture of nonspecific Control siRNAs #1, #2, and #3 (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) were used for a negative control. Subconfluent 293T or SW480 cells were transfected with a total of 30 μm siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000. Because the knockdown efficiencies of each siRNA were not sufficient (<50% inhibition), we used a mixture of three siRNAs and achieved a maximum inhibition of >70%. RT-PCR was performed using Supermix (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions at the indicated cycles. A PCR primer set for human GPI-PLD was purchased from Superarray (Frederick, MD). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Released CR-1—The cultured media from CR-1-transfected Per-C6 cells was harvested and clarified, and the released CR-1 protein was affinity-purified by binding to the B3F6 mAb coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Deglycosylation, Reduction, and Alkylation of Shed CR-1—N-Linked glycans were removed from the protein with peptide N-glycosidase F. About 1.5 μl of peptide N-glycosidase F (2.5 milliunits/μl, Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) was added to 40 μl of a solution containing ∼10 μg of protein. The solution was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The deglycosylated protein was then reduced with 40 mm dithiothreitol in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 2 h at 37 °C, and alkylation was done by adding 0.5 μl of 4-vinylpyridine into 50 μl of the solution. The solution was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 60 min. The alkylated proteins were recovered by precipitation with 40 volumes of -20 °C ethanol. The solution was stored at -20 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was washed once with -20 °C ethanol. Trypsin Digestion—About 10 μg deglycosylated and alkylated protein was digested with 7% (w/w) of trypsin (Promega) in 1 m urea, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, for 5 h at room temperature; the final volume was 50 μl. Separation and Analysis of the Digested Shed CR-1 Protein—The tryptic digest was analyzed on an liquid chromatography-MS/MS system composed of a nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatograph (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The high-performance liquid chromatograph was equipped with a 0.3-mm × 1-mm Pepmap C18-trap column for desalting and a 0.075-mm × 150-mm, 100-Å, Pepmap C18 column for separation. Peptides were eluted with a 70-min linear gradient (0-50% acetonitrile) in 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired using information-dependent acquisition and switched automatically between MS and MS/MS. The nanoelectrospray was generated with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Protana, Toronto, Canada) using a PicoTip needle (15-μm inner diameter, New Objectives, Woburn, MA) maintained at a voltage of 1700 V. MS/MS spectra were collected in the m/z range of 50-2,200, and the collision energy setting was automatically determined by the information-dependent acquisition based on the m/z values of each precursor ion. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the quantitative results. Results with a p value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. CR-1 Localization in Lipid Rafts—The GPI-anchorage of CR-1 to the cell membrane has been previously reported by the ability of bacterial PI-PLC to release CR-1 from cultured cells (17Minchiotti G. Kim S. Liguori G. Signore M. Lania G. Adamson E.D. Lago C.T. Persico M.G. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that CR-1 exhibits pericellular characteristics of a GPI-anchored protein in that CR-1 can be localized to lipid raft domains on the plasma membrane by immunocytochemical analysis in human embryonal carcinoma NTERA2/D1 cells, from which CR-1 was isolated and cloned and is expressed at a relatively high level (1Salomon D.S. Kim C. Ebert A.D. Khan N.I. De Santis M. Normanno N. Wechselberger C. Seno M. Williams K. Sanicola M. Foley S. Gullick W.J. Persico G. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CR-1 exhibited a punctate staining pattern, a proportion of which was co-localized with the lipid raft marker GM-1, which has been labeled with CTxB (Fig. 1A). To confirm the results from imaging analysis, biochemical isolation of DRMs was performed in NTERA2/D1 cells. Detergent resistance has been considered as a biochemical characteristic of lipid rafts (24Jacobson K. Kim O.G. Anderson R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). CR-1 protein was found to be enriched in DRMs, which contain GM-1 but do not contain a non-raft membrane protein TfR (25Muller H.K. Kim O. Haase J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28901-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), although a more substantial amount of immunoreactive CR-1 was found to be associated in the soluble fractions (fractions 9-12, Fig. 1B). Because apical sorting is one of the well known characteristics of GPI-anchored proteins, we examined the CR-1 localization in a well established model of cell polarity, MDCK cells (26Paladino S. Kim T. Catino M.A. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In fully polarized MDCK cells stably transfected with CR-1, CR-1 was stained mainly on the apical surface (supplemental Fig. S2A). A substantial amount of CR-1 protein was detected in the conditioned medium obtained from the apical side but not from the basal side in CR-1-expressing MDCK cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). These results suggest that CR-1 is sorted to the apical side of the plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells. Regulation of CR-1 Shedding by Serum and Growth Factors—To evaluate the extent of CR-1 secretion into the medium, we compared the amount of released and cell-associated CR-1 by semi-quantitative Western blot analysis using recombinant human CR-1 protein as a standard (Table 1, Fig. 1C, and supplemental Fig. S1, A-C). As summarized in Table 1, when cells were cultured in serum-free medium, little CR-1 protein was detected in the conditioned medium of 293T cells stably transfected with wild-type CR-1 (293T CR1WT cells) and in the conditioned medium from NTERA2/D1 cells that express endogenous CR-1 (∼36 ng/ml and"
https://openalex.org/W2119371129,"Cernunnos-XLF is the most recently identified core component in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in mammals. It associates with the XRCC4/ligase IV ligation complex and stimulates its activity in a still unknown manner. NHEJ also requires the DNA-dependent protein kinase that contains a Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. To understand the interplay between Cernunnos-XLF and the other proteins implicated in the NHEJ process, we have analyzed the interactions of Cernunnos-XLF and NHEJ proteins in cells after treatment with DNA double strand-breaking agents by means of a detergent-based cellular fractionation protocol. We report that Cernunnos-XLF is corecruited with the core NHEJ components on chromatin damaged with DSBs in human cells and is phosphorylated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. Our data show a pivotal role for DNA ligase IV in the NHEJ ligation complex assembly and recruitment to DSBs because the association of Cernunnos-XLF with the XRCC4/ligase IV complex relies primarily on the DNA ligase IV component, and an intact XRCC4/ligase IV complex is necessary for Cernunnos-XLF mobilization to damaged chromatin. Conversely, a Cernunnos-XLF defect has no apparent impact on the XRCC4/ligase IV association and recruitment to the DSBs or on the stimulation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase on DNA ends.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; IR, ionizing radiation; WCE, whole cell extract; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Cali, calicheamicin γ1; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; shPKcs, short hairpin protein kinase catalytic subunit.3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; IR, ionizing radiation; WCE, whole cell extract; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Cali, calicheamicin γ1; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; shPKcs, short hairpin protein kinase catalytic subunit. occur physiologically in lymphocytes during V(D) J recombination or class-switch recombination (1Dudley D.D. Kim J. Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 86: 43-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, DSBs in most cells are pathologic like those arising from genomic replication in the presence of nicks or from cell treatment with ionizing radiation (IR) or radiomimetic molecules. Improper repair of DSBs may lead to cell death or cancer-prone genomic rearrangements (2Lieber M.R. Kim K. Raghavan S.C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 1234-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3O'Driscoll M. Kim P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, apart from homologous recombination between sister chromatids, DSBs are mainly processed by in situ religation relying on the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (4Burma S. Kim B.P. Chen D.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although alternative subpathways may operate (5Audebert M. Kim B. Calsou P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6170-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), the major NHEJ pathway relies on a set of core proteins, the individual deficiency of which elicits a radiosensitive severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome in human or animals (7de Villartay J.P. Kim C. de Chasseval R. Buck D. Le Guyader G. Villey I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The two DNA ends of the DSB are recognized and bound by the ring-shaped heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 that recruits the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) (8Downs J.A. Kim S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The assembled DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) holoenzyme then exhibits serine-threonine protein kinase and DNA end-bridging activities (9Collis S.J. Kim T.L. Jeggo P.A. Parker A.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10Meek K. Kim S. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Among other functions, the kinase activity regulates DNA end access to processing enzymes like the DNA-PKcs-associated Artemis nuclease (11Drouet J. Kim P. Delteil C. de Villartay J.P. Salles B.

This explains why DNA-PK is a favored target in radiosensitization strategies of tumors (14Salles B. Kim P. Frit P. Muller C. Pathol. Biol. 2006; 54: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, the XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex is responsible for the ligation step (15Grawunder U. Kim D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 16Li Z. Kim T. Gao Y. Cheng H.L. Seed B. Stamato T.D. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W.

Kim P. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) that is deficient in a human radiosensitive severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (17Buck D.

Cernunnos-XLF is therefore likely involved in most NHEJ reactions and not just those that require end processing in contrast to DNA-PKcs and Artemis. In addition, like XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV, Cernunnos-XLF may be implicated in the development of the central nervous system (24Cantagrel V. Kim A.M. Lisgo S. Missirian C. Borges A. Philip N.

In particular, we have used a detergent-based cellular fractionation protocol that allows assessment in situ of the DSB-induced recruitment of NHEJ repair proteins after cell treatment with IR or radiomimetic molecules (26Drouet J.

Hamann (Wyeth Research, Pearl River, NY), was dissolved at 4 mm in ethanol and stored at–70 °C. Wortmannin (Sigma) and NU7026 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO (10 mm stock solution) and stored at–20 °C. Small aliquots of stock solutions chemicals were used once.Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-XLF raised against the region between amino acids 250 and 299 was from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-Ku70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (clone 111), anti-p460 (DNA-PKcs, clone 18.2), and anti-β-actin (clone ACTN05) monoclonal antibodies were from Neomarkers. Monoclonal antibody antiphosphorylated H2AX (JBW301) was from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. Rabbit serum anti-XRCC4 was raised against full-length recombinant protein produced in baculovirus, and IgG was affinity-purified. Polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-ligase IV, anti-pS2056, and monoclonal antibody anti-γ-tubulin were from Serotec or gifts from Dr. D. J. Chen (University of Texas, Dallas) and Dr. M. Defais (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories.Cell Culture and Cloning—All culture media were from Invitrogen and were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum unless indicated, 2 mm glutamine, 125 units/ml penicillin, and 125 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. MRC5-SV2 was from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) and was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. BuS cells are SV40T-transformed, telomerase-immortalized radiosensitive fibroblasts from the Cernunnos-deficient P2 patient as published (17Buck D. Kim L. de Chasseval R. Barraud A. Fondaneche M.C.

BuC cells were obtained after transduction of BuS with the pMND-Cernunnos-Myc-ires-GFP retroviral vector expressing a C-terminal Myc-His-tagged Cernunnos protein. 4L. Malivert and P. Revy, unpublished results. Both cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. DNA-PKcs-deficient and -complemented cell lines (Fus9-alias M059J and Fus1, respectively (27Hoppe B.S. Kim R.B. Kirchgessner C.U. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. C. Kirchgessner, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-F12 1/1. The LIG4-defective N114P2 cells and the parental cell line Nalm-6 (gifts from Dr. M. R. Lieber, University of Southern California, Los Angeles) were isolated as described previously (15Grawunder U. Kim D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. Small interfering RNA design and cloning in pEBV-based small interfering RNA vectors carrying a hygromycin B resistance cassette and establishment of knockdown and control HeLa clones were as described elsewhere (28Despras E. Kim P. Salles B. Calsou P. Kuhfittig-Kulle S. Angulo J.F. Biard D.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2526-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Biard D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3535-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HeLa clones were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium in the presence of 125 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The same procedure as for HeLa was followed to establish an MRC5-shL4 clone expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing LIG4 and a BuC-shX4 clone expressing a shRNA silencing XRCC4. The RNA-interfering sequences for LIG4 (NM_002312) and for XRCC4 (NM_022550) were nucleotides 1939 to 1957 and nucleotides 674 to 692, respectively.DNA-damaging Treatments—For drug exposure, exponentially growing cells were either mock-treated or treated with freshly diluted calicheamicin at the specified concentrations in medium at 37 °C in culture dishes and then harvested at the indicated time points. For cell treatment with IR, irradiation was carried out in a Faxitron RX-650 irradiator (Faxitron X-ray Corp., Buffalo Grove, IL) at a dose rate of 5.72 grays/min. For UV irradiation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then exposed to UVC irradiation (254 nm) from a germicidal lamp (Bioblock Scientific). Immediately after irradiation, unsupplemented medium was added, and cells were postincubated as above.Biochemical Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Treated or mock-treated cells in culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected by scraping, and centrifuged. Cell fractionation was carried out by two consecutive extractions. Pellets of about 1 × 106 cells were first resuspended for 10 min on ice in 200 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini™, Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm cantharidin, all from Sigma). Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was collected (fraction S1), and the pellet was washed with extraction buffer without Triton. The pellet was further incubated in 100 μlof extraction buffer without Triton but supplemented with 200 μg/ml Rnase A (Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C under agitation. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min, the pellet was washed with extraction buffer without Triton (fraction P2). Insoluble P2 fraction was resuspended in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% SDS, heated 10 min at 100 °C, and sonicated for 10 s (Vibracel, Bioblock Scientific). Whole cell extracts (WCEs) of treated or mock-treated cells were obtained by direct lysis in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% SDS and treatment as above. When necessary, the treated or mock-treated cell pellets were resuspended in 1× lambda phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs) with 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 2 mm magnesium chloride and protease inhibitors as above, sonicated on ice, and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 400 units of lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Concentrated loading sample buffer was added for 1× final concentration in all fractions, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Equal aliquots of each fraction derived from equivalent cell numbers were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% for standard separation or 15% for γ-H2AX isolation) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma). After three washes with PBS-T, membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk. Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Immunofax A, Yelen). When necessary, successive immunoblotting was performed on the same membranes after stripping (Restore Western blot stripping buffer, Pierce). For data presentation, films were scanned and processed with Adobe PhotoShop 3.0 software.Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—Cell extracts were obtained as follows. Cells were washed with cold PBS, spun at 4 °C, 300 × g for 5 min, resuspended in hypotonic buffer HB (10 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini™, Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm cantharidin, all from Sigma), and then lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C three times. Lysates were then supplemented with NaCl to final 350 mm and cleared by spinning at 4 °C, 15,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble proteins were diluted with hypotonic buffer to final 120 mm NaCl, and protein concentration was measured. 100 μg of proteins were mixed in the reaction volume completed to 100 μl with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) with proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as above. When necessary, ethidium bromide was added at 100 μg/ml final concentration. For anti-Cernunnos-XLF immunoprecipitation, the mixture was mixed with 10 μl of magnetic anti-rabbit IgG Immunobeads suspension coated with the anti-XLF primary antibody according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Dynal), and the beads were mixed gently on a wheel for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were pulled down over a magnet, the supernatant extract was removed, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS-T, and proteins in the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Samples were thereafter incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of iodoacetamide (100 mm) and then separated in a 10% acrylamide Tris-glycine-SDS gel. For immunodetection after transfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, rabbit TrueBlot horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (eBioscience) were used as secondary antibodies to reduce the interfering signal of the immunoglobulins used for the immunoprecipitation.RESULTSCernunnos-XLF Is Phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs during the Cellular Response to DSBs—Cernunnos-XLF has been identified recently as a new member of the NHEJ apparatus. Because other members such as XRCC4 (26Drouet J. Kim C. Lefrancois J. Concannon P. Salles B. Calsou P. J. Biol.

For production of DSBs, MRC5-SV2 cells were treated with IR or with Cali, which yields a 1:3 ratio of DNA double strand breaks to single strand breaks in vivo compared with a 1:20 ratio for IR (32Elmroth K. Kim J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As opposed to non- or UV-treated cells, WCE from IR- and Cali-treated cells contained γ-H2AX, the phosphorylated form on Ser139 of the histone H2AX variant, which is admitted to be a quantitative nuclear marker of DSBs (33Rothkamm K. Kim I. Thompson L.H. Lobrich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5706-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Under both of these latter conditions, XRCC4 exhibited a slower migrating form that was sensitive to lambda phosphatase (Fig. 1C), indicating that it corresponded to phosphorylation as reported previously (26Drouet J. Kim C. Lefrancois J. Concannon P. Salles B. Calsou P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7060-7069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, a slower migrating form of Cernunnos-XLF sensitive to lambda phosphatase was detected which was faint after IR but predominant after Cali (Fig. 1, B and C). This indicates that, like XRCC4, Cernunnos-XLF is phosphorylated in the cell in the presence of DSBs.We sought to determine whether DNA-PKcs activity was necessary for Cernunnos-XLF phosphorylation after DSBs. We first used the selective DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7026 that has been shown to exhibit a strong DNA-PKcs-dependent radiosensitization effect on cells (34Veuger S.J. Kim N.J. Richardson C.J. Smith G.C. Durkacz B.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6008-6015PubMed Google Scholar). MRC5-SV2 cells were pretreated or not with NU7026 before treatment with Cali. As shown in Fig. 2A, the DNA-PKcs inhibitor strongly reduced both XRCC4 and Cernunnos-XLF phosphorylation. This suggests that the phosphorylation observed under these conditions mostly relies on the NU7026-sensitive DNA-PKcs activity. Then we treated with Cali the M059J glioblastoma cells that do not express DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-deficient cells, Fus9) and M059J-complemented cells that contain an extra copy of the human gene coding for DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs-complemented cells, Fus1) (27Hoppe B.S. Kim R.B. Kirchgessner C.U. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, although both XRCC4 and Cernunnos-XLF were phosphorylated upon Cali treatment of the DNA-PKcs proficient Fus1 cells, no shift was observed for either protein after treatment of the DNA-PKcs-deficient Fus9 cells. These data clearly implicate DNA-PKcs in the phosphorylation of Cernunnos-XLF upon generation of DSBs in DNA of human cells.FIGURE 2Effect of a defect in DNA-PK activity on the DSBs-induced phosphorylation of Cernunnos-XLF. A, MRC5-SV2 cells were treated or not with Cali (10 nm) for 1 h in the presence or not of NU7026 (30 μm) before lysis. Whole cell extracts were denatured and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels followed by electrotransfer onto membranes. The membranes were blotted with the antibodies as indicated. B, DNA-PKcs deficient (Fus9) and DNA-PKcs complemented (Fus1) glioblastoma cell lines were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 10 nm Cali, and then cells were collected and lysed in denaturating buffer. Whole cell extracts were denatured and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by electrotransfer onto membranes and blotting with the antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cernunnos-XLF Is Corecruited with the Major NHEJ Components but Is Not Necessary for Their Mobilization to Chromatin Damaged with DSBs—Cernunnos-XLF has been shown to be part of a larger complex with XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV (18Ahnesorg P.

We have recently examined nuclear compartmentalization of NHEJ factors and demonstrated that in response to drugs that induce DSBs, NHEJ components mobilize to a detergent-insoluble nuclear fraction corresponding to the damaged chromatin (26Drouet J.

Therefore we have addressed the question of Cernunnos-XLF mobilization to damaged chromatin together with the other NHEJ factors as a result of production of DSBs in the cell.After 1 h of treatment with calicheamicin, MRC5-SV2 cells were extracted with a buffer containing Triton; thereafter, the cell pellet was treated with RNaseA in the same buffer but without detergent, and insoluble P2 fraction was collected. A parallel extraction procedure was performed on untreated cells and cells treated with Cali. Fig. 3A shows the immunoblot analysis following SDS-PAGE of cell-equivalent aliquots of P2 fraction compared with WCEs under both untreated and Cali-treated conditions. In contrast to extracts from mock-treated cells, extracts from Cali-treated cells contain γ-H2AX consistent with the high DNA double strand-breaking potency of C"

Previous in vitro investigations on isolated colicin nuclease domains have shown that they have a strong propensity to associate with anionic phospholipid vesicles, implying that electrostatic interactions with biological membranes play a role in their import. In the present work we set out to test this hypothesis in vivo. We show that cell killing by the DNase toxin colicin E9 of E. coli HDL11, a strain in which the level of anionic phospholipid and hence inner membrane charge is regulated by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, is critically dependent on the level of inducer, whereas this is not the case for pore-forming colicins that take the same basic route into the periplasm. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the level and rate of HDL11 cell killing and the net positive charge on a colicin DNase, with similar effects seen for wild type E. coli cells, data that are consistent with a direct, electrostatically mediated interaction between colicin nucleases and the bacterial inner membrane. We next sought to identify how membrane-associated colicin nucleases might be translocated into the cell. We show that neither the Sec or Tat systems are involved in nuclease colicin uptake but that nuclease colicin toxicity is instead dependent on functional FtsH, an inner membrane AAA+ ATPase and protease that dislocates misfolded membrane proteins to the cytoplasm for destruction.

Colicins are SOS-induced protein antibiotics that penetrate and kill cells in competing Escherichia coli populations (1Kirkup B.C. Kim M.A. Nature. 2004; 428: 412-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 2Czaran T.L. Kim R.F. Pagie L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Colicin entry is known to begin with binding to an extracellular receptor followed by translocation across the outer membrane (OM) 3The abbreviations used are: OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.3The abbreviations used are: OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. by a mechanism that has similarities to that used by filamentous bacteriophages in the early stages of phage infection (3Cascales E. Kim S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Once in the periplasm the cytotoxic domains of colicins target the IM or, in the case of the nuclease colicins, are translocated entirely across the IM to reach their cytoplasmic nucleic acid substrates (3Cascales E. Kim S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 4James R. Kim C.N. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There is currently no information available as to how this latter step is accomplished, although it is likely to require unfolding of the nuclease (5Mosbahi K. Kim C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E.J. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Passage across the OM for both pore-forming and nuclease type colicins is mediated by an OM receptor(s) and proteins of either the Tol (for Group A colicins such as A, N, and E1–E9) or Ton (for Group B colicins such as B, D, Ia, and Ib) complexes. Colicins are able to utilize a wide variety of OM proteins as their primary receptor, such as FepA, FhuA, Cir, BtuB, and OmpF, all involved in passive or active nutrient transport across the OM (3Cascales E. Kim S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In contrast, the translocation step is restricted to either the Ton or Tol proteins, with movement across the OM likely by a common mechanism because colicins can be engineered to take either route by the simple exchange of colicin domains or indeed the requisite phage domains (6Jakes K.S. Kim N.G. Zinder N.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4231-4238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Braun V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 4: 295-307Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the Ton (TonB·ExbB·ExbD) complex is in the energy-dependent transport of nutrients across the OM. The complex is coupled to the proton motive force across the IM and is transduced to OM receptors via TonB through so-called “TonB box” sequences, which stimulate the passage of nutrients across the OM (8Wiener M.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Tol·Pal system (TolA·TolQ·TolR·TolB·Pal) is also a transmembrane assembly responsive to the proton-motive force. In contrast to the Ton system, however, the Tol·Pal complex is required for stability of the OM, with recent data suggesting that its physiological role is that of an energized tether that maintains the appropriate juxtaposition between the inner and outer membranes and newly formed peptidoglycan during cell division (9Lloubes R.

Niki H. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1008-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Association with these energized periplasm-spanning systems bring the cytotoxic domains of pore-forming colicins to the periplasmic side of the IM into which they spontaneously insert forming voltage-dependent ion channels that depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane (11Zakharov S.D. Kim W.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclease type colicins, or at least their cytotoxic domains, must pass into the cytoplasm where they act enzymatically on DNA (colicins E2, E7, E8, and E9), tRNA (E5 and D), or rRNA (E3, E4, and E6) (4James R. Kim C.N. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Masaki H. Kim T. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). From work on colicins D and E7 has come the suggestion that the nuclease domains are cleaved from the remainder of the toxin while in the periplasm and/or passage across the IM. In the case of colicin D, the protease has been identified as the signal peptidase LepB or a factor processed by LepB (13de Zamaroczy M. Kim L. Lecuyer A. Geli V. Buckingham R.H. Mol.

A key consideration for this group of cytotoxins is the absence of any sequence or structural similarity between the different nuclease domains or indeed between nucleases that import via the Tol or Ton pathways, emphasizing that whatever route(s) exist for entry to the cytosol they are insensitive to the structure of the nuclease. Here, we provide the first in vivo evidence demonstrating the importance of nuclease domain charge on colicin translocation, which implies that prior to import to the cytoplasm there is an electrostatically driven association with the E. coli IM. We also identify a putative translocation route for membrane-associated colicin nucleases.

Mutations in the DNase domain of colicin E9 (K21E, K45E, K21E/K45E, S77K/S78R, and S77K/S78R/S80K; DNase numbering) were made by the Stratagene QuikChange method using the plasmid pRJ345 as the template. The NcoI-XhoI fragment of the mutagenized plasmid was ligated into the same sites of the plasmid pCS4. Protein Purification—Nuclease colicins were used either as complexes with their immunity proteins (25Kleanthous C. Kim D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 26: 624-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or as isolated toxins; cell killing kinetics are unaltered by the presence of the immunity protein (26Wallis R.

James R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4900-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The colicin E3·Im3 and colicin E9·Im9 (E2·Im2, E7·Im7, and E8·Im8) complexes and uncomplexed colicin E9 were purified as described previously (28Walker D. Kim G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4161-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Colicin Ia and Ib were purified from strains BZB2114 and BZB2115, respectively (described below). The cells were grown in LB medium (1.6 liters) to an A600 = 0.5, mitomycin C was added to a final concentration of 0.6 μg ml-1, and the cells were grown for a further 4 h all at 37 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.0, and broken by passage through a French press. After removal of the cell debris by centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 114 g liter-1 at 4 °C and stirred for 1 h at this temperature. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and ammonium sulfate (193 g liter-1) was added. After centrifugation the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in a small volume of 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, dialyzed into 2 × 5 liters of the same buffer. The proteins were then applied to a MonoS column and eluted with a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient. Liquid Culture Cell Death Assays—To measure cell death in liquid culture an overnight culture of E. coli HDL11 was diluted 1:100 into 50 ml of LB broth with or without IPTG (20–500 μm) and grown at 37 °C with shaking. After 180 min the appropriate purified colicin was added (A600 =∼0.6). The A600 of each culture was taken at 30-min intervals throughout the experiment. For spot test assays of purified colicin, LB agar plates were overlaid with 5 ml of molten 0.7% (w/v) non-nutrient agar, to which was added 100 μl of a culture of the appropriate indicator strain with an A600 of 0.6–0.8. For AR3291, 500 μl of culture was used, because this strain grows slowly on LB agar. Aliquots of 2 μl of 5-fold dilutions of colicin were spotted on the plates, which were then incubated at 37 °C overnight. To test the cytotoxicity of colicins without prior purification of the protein, colicin expressing cultures were stabbed into LB agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The plates were exposed to chloroform vapor for 15 min to break the cells and then overlaid with 5 ml of molten 0.7% (w/v) non-nutrient agar containing the indicator strain prepared as described above. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and then inspected for a clear zone of growth inhibition around the test culture. Lux Reporter Assay—All of the assays were done as described previously using the DPD1718, a strain housing an SOS-inducible lux reporter system (27Vankemmelbeke M. Kim B. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Penfold C.N. James R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4900-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DPD1718 cells were grown to mid-log (A ∼ 0.35–0.45), after which they were diluted 1:2 (100 μl total volume) into black 96-well plates with an optical bottom (Nunc), and wild type colicins or mutant proteins were added to a final concentration of 0.4 nm. Trypsin (final concentration, 0.05 mg/ml) was added at regular time intervals between 0 and 30 min after colicin addition. Induction of luminescence was followed over a period of up to 2 h with readings taken every 300 s. Gamma values (27Vankemmelbeke M. Kim B. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Penfold C.N. James R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4900-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for the luminescence induction by each colicin were calculated, and the amount of protection offered by trypsin treatment was obtained by comparing the luminescence induced by colicin in the presence and absence of trypsin. All of the assays were performed at least twice, and error bars, where shown, represent the means ± S.E. for at least two independent experiments. Cell Survival Assay—HDL11 was grown in LB broth at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A600 =∼0.6) in the presence or absence of 100 μm of IPTG. Colicin at a final concentration of 80 nm was added to 1-ml aliquots of the cells with trypsin (1 mg ml-1) added at defined time points after the addition of the colicin. Each sample was left to incubate at 37 °C for a further 30 min, after which cells were diluted in LB and plated onto LB agar with the appropriate antibiotics. After overnight growth at 37 °C, the cells were counted, and the percentage of survival was calculated relative to a control sample to which no colicin was added. Colicin DNase Domain Charge Modulates Cell Killing Efficiency in E. coli Cells Depleted of Anionic Phospholipids—We have demonstrated previously that the colicin E3 rRNase and E9 DNase domains (12 and 15 kDa, respectively) interact with anionic but not neutral phospholipid vesicles, with these electrostatically driven associations causing the domains to become destabilized (29Mosbahi K. Kim D. Lea E. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22145-22151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Mosbahi K. Kim D. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Colicin DNases also have the ability to form voltage-independent ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (5Mosbahi K. Kim C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E.J. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Considering that the E. coli IM is normally composed of 70–80% neutral phospholipids and 20–30% anionic phospholipids (31Kadner R.J. Curtis R. II I Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1996: 58-87Google Scholar), these experiments pointed to the possibility that colicin nucleases, which are positively charged domains, might interact directly with one or both of the membrane systems of E. coli en route to the cytoplasm. The present work set out to test this hypothesis. In addressing the importance of electrostatically driven protein-lipid interactions in the translocation of the E9 DNase domain, we used an E. coli strain depleted in anionic phospholipids. The strain HDL11 contains a single copy of the pgsA gene under the control of the lac operon and so is IPTG-inducible (18Kusters R. Kim W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the pgsA gene is responsible for the production of the major anionic phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol. In the absence of IPTG, HDL11 produces little phosphatidylglycerol (2%) or cardiolipin (1%) but does contain phosphatidic acid (6%) and so has a total content of anionic lipid of around 10% (18Kusters R. Kim W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is increased to ∼20% in the presence of 50 μm IPTG, with phosphatidylglycerol accounting for the majority (15%) as is the case in wild type K-12 strains (18Kusters R. Kim W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of concentrations of IPTG in excess of this does not increase the proportion of anionic phospholipid in the IM. We found that killing of strain HDL11 by an excess of colicin E9 (5 μg ml-1), where cell death was monitored by measurement of the optical density of the growing culture, was dependent on IPTG concentration (Fig. 1a). In the absence of IPTG, cell growth continued for several hours after the addition of the colicin, although cell death eventually ensues. In the presence of 50 μm IPTG, however, the rate of cell killing was restored to a level similar to that observed in wild type K-12 strains (data not shown). The addition of higher IPTG concentrations (100 or 500 μm) did not increase the level of cell killing further; with 20 or 30 μm IPTG, the level was intermediate between 0 and 50 μm (Fig. 1a). The data show that although HDL11 is not resistant to colicin E9, the kinetics of cell killing are strongly dependent on the level of anionic phospholipid expressed by the bacterium. The phospholipid composition of the IM bilayer and the inner leaflet of the OM is affected in the HDL11 strain. Consequently, the effect of IPTG concentration on colicin E9 toxicity could reflect changes at either surface. The outer leaflet of the OM is comprised predominantly of LPS and so is unlikely to be grossly affected in HDL11. Nevertheless, the phospholipid:LPS ratio of the OM would be expected to change, and this could affect early steps in colicin import involving receptor binding and translocation across the OM. To help address this issue, we analyzed the susceptibility of HDL11 to the group A pore-forming colicins E1 and A, which translocate across the OM by the same basic mechanism as nuclease colicins; both colicins parasitize BtuB as their primary receptor and then recruit OM translocators (TolC and OmpF, respectively) followed by translocation to the periplasm through binding of the Tol·Pal complex. We found that both pore-forming colicins killed HDL11 with identical killing profiles irrespective of whether IPTG was added to the culture (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the machinery for translocating colicins across the OM has remained largely unaltered. We conclude therefore that the effect of reduced anionic phospholipid content on colicin E9 toxicity most likely concerns effects at the IM. We also investigated other naturally occurring DNase type E colicins, E2, E7, and E8, which have been characterized extensively (32Pommer A.J. Kim U.C. Cooper A. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27153-27160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33van den Bremer E.T. Kim A.H. Jiskoot W. Spelbrink R.E. Maier C.S. van Hoek A. Visser A.J. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Heck A.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). DNase colicins are 60-kDa toxins that share a high degree of sequence identity in their receptor-binding and translocation domains (>90%) but are less conserved in their respective 15-kDa DNases (∼65%), and although all are basic domains (pI > 9.6), they differ in the number and type of charged residues. In particular, the net positive charge for all four DNase domains varies considerably, with E7, E2, E8, and E9 having +13, +11, +9, and +7 charges, respectively. We found that in contrast to colicin E9, where killing of E. coli HDL11 was dependent on the IPTG concentration, colicins E7 (Fig. 1c) or E2 (Fig. 1d) were equally cytotoxic against HDL11 regardless of whether IPTG was added to the culture (only data in the absence of IPTG are shown in Fig. 1d). Thus, for the most positively charged variants reducing the proportion of negatively charged lipid does not retard the level of cell killing. With colicin E8 (+9) (data not show) the absence of IPTG had some effect on cell killing, but not to the extent observed with colicin E9 (+7) (Fig. 1c). DNase E colicins are essentially identical in the sequences of their receptor-binding and translocation domains, and so these are unlikely to explain the differing behavior of these toxins on HDL11. Two effects could reasonably account for the influence of colicin DNase charge and inducing agent on cell killing: (i) The endonucleolytic activities and hence cytotoxicities of the most positively charged variants (E2 and E7) are significantly greater than those of E8 and E9. This can be discounted because a comparison of the enzymatic activities of all DNase colicins shows no such trend. Indeed, colicin E8 has the greatest relative activity in vitro in both plasmid-nicking and spectrophotometric assays, with E2, E7, and E9 having approximately equivalent activities (33van den Bremer E.T. Kim A.H. Jiskoot W. Spelbrink R.E. Maier C.S. van Hoek A. Visser A.J. James R. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Heck A.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). (ii) The differing net positive charge of the DNases affects their ability to associate with the IM of HDL11. If this explanation is correct, then we rationalized it should be possible to engineer enhanced or diminished cell killing activity merely by increasing or decreasing, respectively, the positive charge on a single colicin nuclease domain. This would also discount the possibility that the different levels of activity against HDL11 was due to subtle structural differences between the enzymes of the DNase colicin family and so unrelated to the amount of positive charge. To test this hypothesis we engineered charge variants in the DNase of colicin E9, both increasing and decreasing the net positive charge. Positions outside of the enzyme active site were chosen that are not involved in catalysis or DNA binding (34Mate M.J. Kim C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34763-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Single and double Lys-to-Glu substitutions (at Lys21 and Lys45; numbering for the isolated domain) were engineered to reduce the amount of positive charge to +5 and +3, respectively. Both mutants showed reduced killing against HDL11 relative to the wild type colicin E9, with the double mutant more strongly impaired (Fig. 1d). In contrast, the introduction of additional positive charges into the DNase domain of colicin E9 (S77K/S78R and S77K/S78R/S80K) showed enhanced cell killing of HDL11 relative to wild type colicin E9 (Fig. 1d). We tested the enzymatic activities of all the engineered charge variants and found no correlation with their biological activity; indeed, both sets of mutants had slightly reduced plasmid DNA nicking activities relative to wild type colicin E9 (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that the cell killing efficiency of a colicin DNase against E. coli HDL11 with reduced anionic phospholipid content can be enhanced or reduced merely by changing the number of net positive charges and that this is not due to differences in enzymatic activity between the colicin DNases. To ascertain whether there is a quantitative relationship between cell killing ability and colicin DNase charge, we plotted all of the HDL11 IPTG cell killing data (quantified as the change in A600 following the addition of colicin) as a function of the positive charge of the domain. From the resulting plot it is clear that there is a strong correlation between the net positive charge on a colicin DNase domain and its cytotoxicity activity against HDL11 (Fig. 2). We also looked for systematic variations in toxicity when HDL11 was induced with 100 μm IPTG and compared this to a wild type strain of E. coli K-12 (SD12). In both cases a weak correlation with enzyme charge was apparent (data not shown) but was less clear-cut; the most-to-least positively charged variants displayed only small differences in optical density (<0.3) compared with HDL11-IPTG. Hence, the correlation between enzyme charge and cytotoxicity, at least as measured by changes in culture optical density, is masked when the IM carries wild type negative charge and only becomes readily apparent in E. coli that is depleted of anionic phospholipids. Electrostatic Interactions Gate Entry of DNase Colicins into Wild Type E. coli Cells—To probe further the involvement of electrostatic interactions in colicin entry, particularly in wild type strains, and to provide quantitative date on cell entry kinetics, we resorted to trypsin-protection assays of colicin toxicity. Trypsin rapidly degrades colicins, rendering them inactive, and has been used extensively to investigate colicin entry kinetics (35Braun V. Kim J. Hantke K. Schaller K. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 162-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Benedetti H. Kim R. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Trypsinolysis of colicin-treated cells was used by Benedetti et al. (36Benedetti H. Kim R. Lazdunski C. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to show that the pore-forming toxin colicin A is unfolded and exposed to the extracellular environment even when its cytotoxic domain is depolarizing the IM. Similar experiments have been reported recently by Duché (37Duché D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4217-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for the DNase colicin E2, demonstrating that the toxin remains attached to its OM receptor while contacting the Tol proteins in the periplasm. Colicins must span large distances (100–200 Å) to simultaneously contact one or more proteins in the OM and periplasm, and this likely explains why colicins such as E3 and Ia have elongated hairpin structures with long coiled-coil regions connecting their cytotoxic and translocation domains (38Wiener M.

https://openalex.org/W2034705617,"We recently reported that the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 was suppressed in monocytes infected with measles virus, but not in infected epithelial cells. This cell-type-specific suppression of the inflammatory response represents a potential for measles virus to evade host immune system. In the current study, we examined the suppression mechanism of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced, namely Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated, activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in measles virus-infected monocytic cells. In the infected cells, LPS treatment failed to induce the formation of active protein kinase complex containing TAK1, TAB2 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), dissociate from TLR complexes containing Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). Ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, which is a host negative feedback regulator of NF-kappaB, was dramatically up-regulated in infected monocytic cells, but not in infected epithelial cells. Suppression of A20 expression by siRNA restored LPS-induced signaling in infected cells. Measles virus phosphoprotein (P protein) expression was necessary and sufficient for the induction of A20. P protein interacted indirectly with a negative regulatory motif in the A20 gene promoter, and released the suppression of A20 transcription, independent of the activation of NF-kappaB."

It is estimated that 3.2 billion people currently live in areas where there is a risk of malaria transmission. Three to five hundred million of these individuals become infected each year and over two million die (1Breman J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The groups most affected by malaria are children under five years of age and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Parasite resistance to most of the currently used antimalarial drugs is now widespread and resistance to new drugs is developing (2Jambou R. Legrand E. Niang M. Khim N. Lim P. Volney B. Ekala M.T.

With an effective vaccine at least 15 years away there is an urgent need for new malaria treatments. During the intraerythrocytic phase of development the parasite digests 65-75% of the host cell hemoglobin. A proportion of this digested hemoglobin (16%) is used for protein synthesis (3Krugliak M. Zhang J. Ginsburg H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin degradation is also important in reducing the colloid-osmotic pressure within the infected erythrocyte, which prevents premature cell lysis during parasite growth and establishes a concentration gradient by which rare amino acids enter the malaria-infected erythrocyte from host serum (4Lew V.L.

There are eight aminopeptidases within the genome of the most clinically significant malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum (www.plasmodb.org): four methionine aminopeptidases, two neutral aminopeptidases (leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP) and membrane alanine aminopeptidase (M1MAA)), a prolyl aminopeptidase (PAP), and an aspartyl aminopeptidase (M18AAP). Using specific enzyme inhibitors, one of the methionine aminopeptidases has been validated in vitro and in vivo as a potential drug target (7Chen X. Chong C.R. Shi L. Yoshimoto T. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Liu J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 14548-14553Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and inhibitors of the M1MAA and M17LAP have been shown to prevent malaria growth in culture (8Nankya-Kitaka M.F. Curley G.P. Gavigan C.S. Bell A. Dalton J.P. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, other aminopeptidases may also prove to be good targets for new antimalarial agents, particularly as part of drug combinations. Aspartyl aminopeptidases are members of the M18 family of metalloproteases (www.merops.sanger.ac.uk). Unlike the methionine and neutral aminopeptidases, few aspartyl aminopeptidases (M18AAP) have been characterized; at present, there is only limited information reported for the aspartyl aminopeptidase of mammals (9Wilk S. Wilk E. Magnusson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15961-15970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), yeast (10Yokoyama R. Kawasaki H. Hirano H. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and bacteria. 10T. Min and L. Shapiro, unpublished data. The lack of available substrate and inhibitor reagents has contributed to our poor understanding of the function of these enzymes. However, because of their restricted specificities for the N-terminal acidic amino acids, aspartic and glutamic acid, which cannot be cleaved by any other aminopeptidases, they are thought to act in concert with other aminopeptidases to facilitate protein turnover. In humans, a more specific function in the conversion of angiotensin II to the vasoactive angiotensin III within the brain has been implicated (12Wright J.W. Harding J.W. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 25: 96-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Here, we report for the first time the physicobiochemical properties, cellular expression, and distribution of the P. falciparum aspartyl aminopeptidase (PfM18AAP). We have produced a functionally active recombinant form of the enzyme that exhibits comparable properties to the native form measured in malaria cytosolic extracts. Our studies show that the PfM18AAP is expressed in the parasite cytosol and exported to the parasitophorous vacuole of the parasite indicating that whereas the enzyme may function in the final stages of hemoglobin digestion it may also have an additional function outside the parasite. Antisense-mediated inhibition of the PfM18AAP results in a lethal phenotype as a result of significant morphological changes to the parasite and, therefore, pinpoints the enzyme as a promising target for new anti-malarial drug development. However, novel inhibitors of aspartyl aminopeptidases that exhibit modest activity against the native and recombinant PfM18AAP do not prevent the growth of the parasites in culture. Parasites and Preparation of Parasite Extracts—P. falciparum clone D10 was cultured as described (13Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). For experiments investigating the stage-specific expression of PfM18AAP, parasites were synchronized using two rounds of sorbitol treatment (14Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar), and parasites harvested at ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages. After washing infected red blood cells in PBS, parasites were released by incubation with either (1Breman J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) 0.03% saponin/PBS on ice or (2Jambou R. Legrand E. Niang M. Khim N. Lim P. Volney B. Ekala M.T. Bouchier C. Esterre P. Fandeur T.

Resulting parasite pellets were washed three times with PBS, re-suspended in 100 μl of PBS, and extracted by two cycles of freezethaw at -80 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were stored at -20 °C. Membrane preparations of infected red blood cells were produced by hypotonic lysis followed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g (15Spielmann T. Gardiner D.L. Beck H.P. Trenholme K.R. Kemp D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 779-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The crude membrane pellets were treated with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium carbonate or 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 and separated into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. Proteins in the supernatant were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). Production, Purification, and Characterization of Functionally Active Recombinant Aspartyl Aminopeptidase—The PlasmoDB annotated gene sequence PFI1570c encoding the putative PfM18AAP was chemically synthesized by GENEART GmbH (GeneArt, Germany) using codons for optimized gene expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. As reported by Stack et al. (16Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P.

Potential N-linked glycosylation sites were removed in gene synthesis by replacing the asparagine of all Asn-X-Thr/Ser with Gln. This construct was recombined with BaculoDirect™ C-terminal linear DNA (Invitrogen) and transfected into Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells (16Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S.

Like the M17 leucine aminopeptidase, the malaria PfM18AAP gene while synthesized in the codon style of P. pastoris, was not able to be expressed successfully in yeast (16Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For protein expression, Sf9 insect cells were infected at the cell density 3 × 106 cells/ml with PfM18AAP recombinant Baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 2-5 plaque forming units/cell. rPfM18AAP, which was expressed bearing a His6 tag, was isolated from insect cells by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA-agarose column as previously described (16Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The purity and molecular size of isolated rPfM18AAP was analyzed using 12% reducing SDS-PAGE and gel filtration HPLC on a Superdex-200 column using a Pharmacia Biotech Smart System. The mobile phase was PBS, the column was run at a flow rate of 40 μl per min, and 40-μl fractions were collected. The activity and substrate specificity of purified rPfM18AAP was determined by measuring initial rates of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrates H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm using a Bio-Tek KC4 microfluorimeter (16Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Teuscher F. Grembecka J. Mucha A. Kafarski P. Lua L. Bell A. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2069-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). rPfAAP (60 nm) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min before addition to the substrate. The pH profile for rPfM18AAP activity was determined from the initial rates of H-Asp-NHMec hydrolysis carried out in constant ionic strength (I = 0.1) with acetate/Mes/Tris buffers, pH 4-11 (17Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The pH stability was determined by incubating rPfM18AAP in these buffers for 1 h at 37 °C before assaying for residual activity at pH 7.5. To investigate the effect of metal ions on enzymatic kinetic parameters, rPfM18AAP was incubated with various metal ions for 30 min prior to initiation of the enzymatic reaction. Initial rates were obtained at 37 °C over a range of H-Asp-NHMec substrate concentrations spanning Km (0.2-500 μm) and at fixed enzyme concentrations. The effect of bestatin, metal chelators, and dithiothreitol on rPfM18AAP activity was investigated by measuring the initial rate of hydrolysis of 25 μm H-Asp-NHMec at pH 7.5 in the presence of each compound. Each rate was compared with the control rate containing only enzyme and substrate. M18AAP activity in parasite extracts were determined by first incubating aliquots of the extract in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm CoCl2 for 20 min before addition to 25 μm H-Asp-NHMec. Leucyl aminopeptidase activity in the extracts was measured using 10 μm H-Leu-NHMec as described (16Stack C.M. Lowther J. Cunningham E. Donnelly S. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S.

Phosphorus Containing Inhibitors—A series of α-phosphonic (compounds 1, 4, 7, and 8) and α-phosphinic (2 and 5) analogues of acidic amino acids (18Kafarski, P., and Zon, J. (2000) in Aminophosphonic and Aminophosphinic Acids, Chemistry and Biological Activity (Kukhar, V. P., and Hudson, H.

Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 14635-14648Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were tested for their inhibitory activity toward PfM18AAP using the fluorogenic peptide assay described above. Polyclonal Antibody Production and Immunoblotting Analysis—Polyclonal antiserum was prepared against a 15-mer peptide, C*FSHKENSQNKRDDQ, corresponding to amino acid residues 211-224 of the putative P. falciparum aspartyl aminopeptidase (PFI1570c) as described previously (20Gardiner D.L. Spielmann T. Dixon M.W.A. Hawthorne P.L. Ortega M.R. Anderson K.L. Skinner-Adams T.S. Kemp D.J. Trenholme K.R. Parasitol. Res. 2004; 93: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Proteins of saponin-lysed parasite extracts were resolved on reducing 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the anti-PfM18AAP antisera (1:250 dilution) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000 dilution, Chemicon International Inc.) (21Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielmann T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W.A. Ortega M.A. Anderson K.L. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The membrane was stripped and re-probed with an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilution) to demonstrate equal loading and transfer of malaria proteins (22Daubenberger C.A. Tisdale E.J. Curcic M. Diaz D. Silvie O. Mazier D. Eling W. Bohrmann B. Matile H. Pluschke G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence and phase-contrast images were collected with an Axioscope 2 Mot+ (Zeiss) equipped with a Zeiss ×63/1.4 Plan Apochromat lens. Live parasites were mounted in PBS and observed at ambient temperature. Parasite DNA was visualized by adding Hoechst dye (0.5 μg/ml) and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min prior to mounting. For indirect fluorescence, concanavalin A (0.5 mg/ml) was added to each well of a multiwell slide and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C after which infected red blood cells were added, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and unbound cells were removed by washing with PBS. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.005% glutaraldehyde and probed with anti-PfM18AAP antiserum or with a mouse monoclonal antibody to GFP or c-myc (all diluted 1:500). Bound antibody was visualized with goat anti-mouse Ig-Cy2 (10 μg/ml). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Infected red blood cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and processed according to standard methods (23Glauert, A. M. (1974) in Practical Methods in Electron Microscopy, Part I (Glauert, A. M., ed) Vol. 3, pp. 1-207, North-Holland Publishing Co., AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). After embedding in Spurr low viscosity resin, ultrathin sections (∼50-60 nm thick) were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed with total RNA extracts prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) (21Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielmann T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W.A. Ortega M.A. Anderson K.L. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with a purified 1713-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the full-length CDS of the aspartyl aminopeptidase (PFI1570c) amplified from genomic P. falciparum DNA using primers PFI1570ASF (ctgcagatggataagaaagctagggaa) and PFI1570ASR (agatcttttgtcgtggacacatgtgga). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming (DECAprime II, Ambion Inc). The probe was hybridized overnight at 40 °C in a hybridization buffer containing formamide (Northern Max; Ambion). The filter was washed once at low stringency and twice at high stringency (Northern Max; Ambion), then exposed overnight. For specific sense and antisense probes, 26 ng of the above purified PCR product was primed with either a 3′ primer (acttcgctaagagatcctatt) to generate a probe that specifically binds to the endogenous mRNA or a 5′ primer (atggttcgatagaagtttagg) to produce a probe that binds specifically to the transgenic antisense RNA. Geometric amplification of the PCR product was performed using Taq polymerase under the following cycling conditions: denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, followed by extension at 68 °C for 2 min, for 30 cycles. These probes were hybridized to blots containing RNA extracted from both D10 wild-type parasites and transgenic cultures. Construction of the Transgenic Expression Plasmids—PFI1570c was amplified from P. falciparum clone D10 genomic DNA. The forward primer for PFI1570c was PFI1570F (agatctatggataagaaagctagggaa) and contained a BglII restriction site (in bold). The reverse primer was PFI1570R (ctgcagtttgtcgtggacacatgtgga) and contained a PstI site (in bold). Antisense primers were designed with restriction sites in the reverse orientation (PstI forward and BglII reverse). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM using a TA cloning system (Promega) and sequenced to confirm that no Taq-associated errors had occurred. In the case of GFP and c-myc constructs full-length fragments were digested out of the pGEM vector using BglII and PstI and subcloned into the Gateway™ compatible entry vectors pHGFPB and pHcmycB (Gateway, Invitrogen) that had previously been digested using BglII and PstI. Either a GFP tag or a c-myc tag were ligated in-frame at the 3′ end of the introduced gene sequence, respectively (24Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Stack C.M. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1741-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These introduced genes were under the control of the HSP86 promoter. The antisense sequence was cloned into the pHcmycB vector. These entry vectors were designated pHB-PFI1570c-GFP and pHB-PFI1570c-cmyc, respectively, whereas the antisense plasmid was designated pHB-PFI1570-AS. Using those entry vectors and Gateway™ compatible destination vectors with a destination cassette and a second cassette containing the human dihydrofolate reductase synthase gene under the control of the P. falciparum calmodulin promoter as a selectable marker, clonase reactions were then performed. These final plasmids were designated pHH1-PFI1570c-GFPB (GFP tag), pHH1-PFI1570c-cmycB (c-myc tag), and pHH1-PFI1570c-AS (antisense). For transfection, ring stage parasites were subjected to electroporation in the presence of 50 μg of plasmid DNA as described (25Spielmann T. Dixon M.W.A. Hernandez-Valladares M. Hannemann M. Trenholme K.R. Gardiner D.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 2006; 36: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Parasites resistant to WR99210 were obtained up to 25 days later. Sequence Analysis—Aspartyl aminopeptidase proteases from various species were retrieved from the NCBI data base. BLAST hits were aligned using CLUSTAL W at PBIL and alignments drawn using ESPrit 2.0. Interrogation of PlasmoDB Discovered a Putative Aspartyl Aminopeptidase—PFI1570c, the putative aspartyl aminopeptidase of P. falciparum is located on chromosome 9 and as annotated by PlasmoDB consists of a single open reading frame of 1713 bp that translates into a protein of 570 amino acids. PFI1570c contains two signature domains, an N-terminal aspartyl aminopeptidase domain (LAP4: residues 1-186, e value 5e-34), and a C-terminal aminopeptidase 1 zinc metalloprotease M18 domain (Peptidase_18: residues 246-556, Pfam0217; e value 2e-47). The overall sequence identity between the aspartyl aminopeptidases (M18AAP) of the various rodent Plasmodium sp. is 61-65% and would be in the region of 83-88% only for the fact that PfM18AAP possesses two unique sequence insertions. These insertions, which are predicted to form loops, are present in the central portions of the enzymes and clearly do not prevent the enzyme from forming an octomeric structure (see below). Whereas low levels of identity exists between the PfM18AAP and the human (31%) and yeast M18 aspartyl aminopeptidases (27%) the three histidine residues (His-94, His-170, and His-440) that are predicted from site-directed mutagenesis studies to be critical for enzymatic activity and another (His-352) essential for stabilization of quaternary structure of human M18AAP are conserved and are indicated in the alignment presented in supplementary materials Fig. S1. Biochemical Characterization of Functionally Active Recombinant rPfM18AAP—Recombinant rPfM18AAP was purified from Baculovirus-transformed insect cells by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA resin and resolved as a single protein of ∼65 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Purified rPfM18AAP efficiently cleaved the simple fluorogenic substrates H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec with kcat/Km values of 129.9 and 82.3 m-1 s-1, respectively (Table 1). The purified enzyme exhibited aminopeptidase activity against the fluorogenic substrate H-Asp-NHMec between pH 6.0 and 9.0 with optimal activity at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1B). The enzyme was stable when stored for 1 h at 37°C over the pH range 6 to 11. No hydrolysis was observed against the fluorogenic substrates H-Leu-NHMec, H-Phe-NHMec, H-Ala-NHMec, H-Pro-NHMec, H-Gly-NHMec, H-Val-NHMec, H-Arg-NHMec, and H-Ile-NHMec when the substrate concentration was 100 μm.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec by rPfM18AAP at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of cobaltSubstrate1 mm CoKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1Asp-NHMec-384.8 ± 32.10.050 ± 0.002129.9Asp-NHMec+327.3 ± 2.20.354 ± 0.0081081.6Glu-NHMec-135.1 ± 15.60.011 ± 0.000482.3Glu-NHMec+136.3 ± 8.70.33 ± 0.0062421.1 Open table in a new tab rPfM18AAP activity was reduced to 14 and 8.3% after incubating with 10 mm EDTA and 20 mm o-phenanthroline, respectively, demonstrating that metal ions are necessary for enzyme activity (data not shown). A study of the effect of various metal ions on the activity of the enzyme showed that it was enhanced by Co(II), but not by Ca(II), Fe(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), and Ni(II), whereas Zn(II) at a concentration of 1 mm abolished enzyme activity (data not shown). When the enzyme was incubated for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and containing 1 mm Co(II) the kcat/Km values of the enzyme for substrates H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec increased ∼8- and 30-fold, respectively (Table 1). These enzyme kinetics studies showed that kcat values increased while the Km values remained unchanged, which indicates that the metal ion does not affect binding of the substrate but does increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. PfM18AAP Activity in Soluble Extracts of Malaria Parasites—Activity against the M18AAP-specific substrates H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec was detected in soluble extracts of malaria parasites and had similar characteristics to the activity of purified rPfM18AAP. The Km values with parasite extracts of 216 and 251 μm for H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec, respectively, are similar to the Km values of 327 and 136 μm obtained with rPfM18AAP for the same substrates (Table 1). The specific activity (μmol of NHMec released/min/mg of protein) for the enzyme in these extracts was 662.5 and 607 for H-Asp-NHMec and H-Glu-NHMec, respectively. Furthermore, the activity against these substrates was enhanced almost 10-fold by Co(II) but was not enhanced by other metal ions studied (data not shown). The molecular size of the rPfM18AAP and native enzyme in parasite extracts were determined by HPLC size chromatography by assaying fractions for activity toward H-Asp-NHMec. H-Asp-NHMec-cleaving activity in parasite extracts eluted from the HPLC molecular size column at the same retention time as the activity of purified rPfM18AAP corresponding to a molecular size of 560 kDa (Fig. 1C). The data suggest that both native and recombinant PfM18AAP possess an octomeric structure consistent with that observed for human M18AAP (26Wilk S. Wilk E. Magnusson R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PfM18AAP Is Transcribed and Translated in Intra-erythrocytic Stage Parasites—Northern blot analysis showed that wild type D10 parasites transcribed a single species of mRNA with an apparent size of ∼3 kb when hybridized using a 1713-bp fragment comprising the complete CDS of the PfM18AAP (Fig. 2A). PfM18AAP appeared to be most abundantly expressed in ring stage parasites (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis showed that when saponin-lysed parasite extracts of the same cultures were probed with anti-PfM18AAP antiserum a single protein species with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa was observed, which corresponded closely with the theoretical molecular mass of 65.6 kDa (Fig. 2B).

We used site-directed mutagenesis to characterize the binding site on sAnk1, specifically addressing the role of two putative amphipathic, positively charged helices. We measured binding qualitatively by blot overlay assays and quantitatively by surface plasmon resonance and showed that both positively charged sequences are required for activity. We showed further that substitution of a lysine or arginine with an alanine or glutamate located at the same position along either of the two putative helices has similar inhibitory or stimulatory effects on binding and that the effects of a particular mutation depended on the position of the mutated amino acid in each helix. We modeled the structure of the binding region of sAnk1 by homology with ankyrin repeats of human Notch1, which have a similar pattern of charged and hydrophobic residues. Our modeling suggested that each of the two positively charged sequences forms pairs of amphipathic, anti-parallel α-helices flanked by β-hairpin-like turns. Most of the residues in homologous positions along each helical unit have similar, though not identical, orientations. CD spectroscopy confirmed the α-helical content of sAnk1, ∼33%, predicted by the model.

The intracellular membrane systems of striated muscle, transverse tubules, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), 4The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; sAnk1, small ankyrin 1; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. play essential roles in the contractile cycle. Muscle contraction requires the release of Ca2+ from the terminal cisternae of the SR, through a process that is initiated by an action potential propagating along the plasma membrane and transverse tubules into the interior of the muscle cells (1Flucher B.E.

The rise in intracellular Ca2+ promotes cross-bridge formation between thin filaments of actin and myosin head groups, leading to contraction. Relaxation follows the re-uptake of Ca2+ into the network compartment of the SR by the Ca2+-ATPase of the SR membrane (3Franzini-Armstrong C.

The regular organization of the network compartment of the SR around each sarcomere, at the level of the Z-disks and M-bands, is typical of skeletal muscle, and essential for activity (4Takekura H. Kim X. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 102-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We and others have proposed that at least two molecules are responsible for aligning the SR around each sarcomere, small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1) and obscurin (5Bagnato P. Kim V. Giacomello E. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol.

Genomics. 1998; 50: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is a member of the ankyrin superfamily, which is composed of proteins that are ubiquitously expressed and typically found within the membrane-associated cytoskeleton. Three genes in vertebrates, ANK1, ANK2, and ANK3, encode ankyrin proteins 1, 2, and 3 (also known as R, B, and G, respectively (10Mohler P.J. Kim A.O. Bennett V. J.

Canonical ankyrins contain ∼24 ankyrin repeat domains within their N-terminal region (12Michaely P. Kim V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3985-3991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ankyrin repeats are typically found in tandem arrays and are composed of 33 amino acid residues, with high conservation of the positions of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids within each repeat. Characteristic of these sequences is the formation of short anti-parallel α-helices separated by a short loop and linked to neighboring repeats by β-hairpin-like turns (18Mosavi L.K. Kim T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Prot. Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). At ∼17 kDa in mass, sAnk1 differs from the much larger ankyrins 1, 2, and 3 (∼200 kDa) by the absence of the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (∼90 kDa), responsible for binding integral membrane proteins, and the central domain (∼65 kDa), responsible for binding β-spectrin (9Birkenmeier C.S. Kim J.J. Gifford E.J. Deveau S.A. Barker J.E. Genomics. 1998; 50: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim R.J. J. Biol.

These large binding domains are replaced at the N terminus of sAnk1 by a unique, alternatively spliced sequence of 73 amino acids (Fig. 1A). The most N-terminal 22 amino acids are highly hydrophobic and are sufficient to confer on sAnk1 the properties of an integral membrane protein (7Porter N.C. Kim W.G. O'Neill A. Van Rossum D.B. Stone M.R. Bloch R.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Following the 22-amino acid transmembrane segment, the unique sequence contains a stretch of positively charged residues interspersed with hydrophobic residues that can be modeled as an amphipathic α-helix, which is identical in rat, mouse, and human (see Fig. 1A). The C-terminal 83 amino acids of sAnk1 are common to larger forms of Ank1 and share considerable homology with the C-terminal regions of splice isoforms of Ank2 and Ank3 (Fig. 1B). This conserved region also contains a sequence, similar to that in the unique sequence, that can be modeled as a positively charged, amphipathic α-helix and binds the co-chaperone Hdj1/Hsp40 in Ank2.2 (21Mohler P.J. Kim J.A. Davis J.Q. Abdi K.M. Kim C.R. Jones S.K. Davis L.H. Roberts K.F. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our previous results suggested that the portion of sAnk1 containing these putative helices is exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the SR membrane (7Porter N.C. Kim W.G. O'Neill A. Van Rossum D.B. Stone M.R. Bloch R.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), where it localizes around the M-bands and Z-disks of skeletal muscle and forms a high affinity binding site for obscurin, its major ligand in striated muscle (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A.

Obscurin is a multifunctional, ∼800-kDa protein composed of multiple Ig and FnIII domains, as well as several signaling motifs (22Borisov A.B. Kim A. Bloch R.J. Westfall M.V. Russell M.W. J.

Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Obscurin is firmly anchored to the contractile apparatus, where it is concentrated around the periphery of the Z-disks and M-bands of each sarcomere and so co-distributes with sAnk1 (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Young P. Kim E. Gautel M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of obscurin in primary cultures of skeletal myotubes with targeted small inhibitory RNAs dramatically disrupts the striated organization of sAnk1 and presumably of the network SR, where it resides (29Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim D.H. Strong J.C. Sutter S. Borisov A.B. Pumplin D.W. Russell M.W. Bloch R.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding, as well as recent studies of splice variants of sAnk1 by Armani et al. (30Armani A. Kim S. Giacomello E. Bagnato P. Barone V. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3546-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggests that the interaction of sAnk1 and obscurin contributes to the sarcomeric alignment of the network SR around Z-disks and M-bands. Yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that the binding of sAnk1 to obscurin is mediated primarily by sequences in the non-modular, C-terminal region of obscurin (5Bagnato P. Kim V. Giacomello E. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and by amino acids 61-130 of sAnk1, which include the two positively charged regions that are likely to form amphipathic α-helices. Here we focus on the role of these charged residues in binding obscurin. We use site-directed mutagenesis to show that both sequences are essential for high affinity binding to obscurin, and that the two residues at homologous positions along the putative helices play qualitatively similar roles in binding, consistent with a binding site composed of two functionally similar units. In agreement with these results, homology modeling suggests that the two regions are indeed helical and are organized as two ankyrin repeats, with very similar structures. These form a large charged region on the surface of sAnk1, similar to the C-terminal repeats of the ankyrin repeat domain of human Notch1 (31Ehebauer M.T. Kim D.Y. Hayward P. Martinez Arias A. Blundell T.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), that mediates binding to obscurin. Generation of sAnk1 Mutation Constructs—Mutated constructs were produced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides (see supplemental Table S1) were used with cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 29-155) of wild-type (or mutant, for sequential mutations) sAnk1 (sAnk129-155). The cDNA was subcloned in the pMal-c2X vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using the EcoR1 and SalI restriction sites. The authenticity of all constructs was verified by sequence analysis. Generation and Purification of Fusion Proteins—All mutant and wild-type forms of the cytoplasmic portion of sAnk129-155, produced as MBP fusion proteins, and its primary binding site on obscurin (Obsc6316-6436 (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)), prepared as a GST fusion protein in pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), were expressed in BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS One Shot (Invitrogen) bacterial cells. A truncated version of the cytoplasmic portion of sAnk1 (sAnk160-130), prepared as a 10× histidine-tagged protein in pET-19b (Novagen, San Diego, CA), was also expressed in BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS One Shot. Expression of all fusion proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3.5 h for the GST and MBP fusion proteins and 5 h for the His-tagged protein. Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (for MBP fusion proteins), glutathione-agarose (for GST fusion proteins), or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (for His-tagged protein), following the manufacturers’ instructions. After purification, MBP and GST fusion proteins were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 10 mm NaN3 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1.5 mm). His-sAnk160-130 was dialyzed into 20 mm sodium tetraborate, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The purity of all proteins was >90%, as determined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Blot Overlay Assays—Blot overlays were performed as described (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Aliquots containing 1.0 μg of bacterially expressed, affinity-purified GST-Obsc6316-6436 protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gradient gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Equivalent loading and transfer were confirmed by staining with Ponceau Red. Blots were incubated in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm maltose) for 16 h at room temperature, followed by buffer A containing 0.75 μg/ml of either MBP, wild-type MBP-sAnk129-155, or mutants of MBP-sAnk129-155, for 4 h at room temperature. Blots were washed extensively with buffer A and twice with buffer B (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaN3, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% dry milk). Membranes were probed with antibodies to MBP (1:5000, New England Biolabs), followed by goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:5000). Labeled bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Western Light Detection, Tropix Laboratories, Bedford, MA). Surface Plasmon Resonance—The binding of GST-Obsc6316-6436 to wild-type and mutant forms of MBP-sAnk129-155 was also studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with a Biacore 3000 biosensor (GE Healthcare, Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden), as described previously (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. After activation of the sensor chips, ∼14,000 resonance units of affinity-purified goat anti-GST antibody were immobilized on flow cells 1 and 2 (FC1 and FC2). GST-obscurin6316-6436 was used as ligand and MBP-sAnk1 constructs as analytes. Control lanes were bound to GST alone. Two sets of experiments were performed: (i) binding of all sAnk1 mutants to obscurin was evaluated and compared with the binding of the wild-type proteins; (ii) kinetic analysis of binding was performed using selected mutant forms of MBP-sAnk129-155. For the former, we used wild-type and mutant forms of MBP-sAnk129-155 at a standard concentration of 1 μm. The kinetics of binding between GST-Obsc6316-6436 and wild-type or mutant MBP-sAnk129-155 proteins was studied over a range of concentrations from well below to well above the measured dissociation constant determined for each construct. All kinetic data were evaluated with the 1:1 Langmuir model (BIAevaluation Software 3.1, Biacore). Statistical significance was calculated with the Student’s t test. Modeling—We used the structure of the ankyrin repeat domain of human Notch1 (31Ehebauer M.T. Kim D.Y. Hayward P. Martinez Arias A. Blundell T.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the Homology and Biopolymer modules of Insight software (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) to model the portion of the cytoplasmic sequence of sAnk1 (amino acids 29-122) that contains the binding site for obscurin. The pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the cytoplasmic region of sAnk1 is very similar to the sequence of ankyrin repeats 4-6 of Notch1 (1YYH, Protein Data Bank (31Ehebauer M.T. Kim D.Y. Hayward P. Martinez Arias A. Blundell T.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). Our initial model was created by aligning the hydrophobic residues of the helical regions of sAnk1 (amino acids 29-35, 61-76, and 94-112) with ankyrin repeats 5 and 6 from Notch1. Some manual folding of the long loop regions between these helices (amino acids 36-60 and 85-92) was performed to alleviate steric hindrances and reduce hydrophobic surface area. The most N-terminal portion of sAnk1, included in the working model but not shown (amino acids 29-56), was fit to the C-terminal portion of the fourth ankyrin repeat of Notch1. This included an α-helix (amino acids 29-35) and a large loop region (amino acids 36-56) bridging the gap from an initial α-helix to the first full ankyrin repeat. The axis of the N-terminal α-helix was rotated ∼45° and shifted ∼4 Å (measured at the level of Cys-34) from that of Notch1 to permit disulfide-linked dimerization through cysteine 34 (7Porter N.C. Kim W.G. O'Neill A. Van Rossum D.B. Stone M.R. Bloch R.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Modeling of the last 33 amino acids was not performed, due to reduced homology to Notch1. The modeled structure underwent three rounds of unrestrained minimization plus dynamics in a periodic water box (300 steps minimization, 3000 steps dynamics, 1-fs timestep, and constant valence force field) followed by one round of similar minimization plus dynamics (consistent force field 91), with restraints applied to hydrogen bonds in α-helical structures to preserve the helices. Insight and Discover software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) were used for all simulations. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) at 25 °C. Spectra were collected from 192 to 260 nm with a 0.2-mm resolution and a 1.0-cm bandwidth. His-sAnk160-130 was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium tetraborate, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and diluted in 50% trifluoroethanol to a final concentration of 10 μm. Background signal (buffer alone) was sub-tracted, and the mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol-1) was calculated using CDPRO software supplied by the manufacturer. The percent α-helical content was determined from the spectra with the CONTINLL and SELCON3 methods within CDPro analytical software (32Sreerama N. Kim R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Binding Requires Unique and Conserved Sequences—Yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that the minimal binding site for Obsc6316-6436 on sAnk129-155 is confined to a 70-amino acid sequence within the cytoplasmic region of sAnk1. This sequence (61-130) is composed of residues that are conserved among the larger ankyrin isoforms (amino acids 75-130), C-terminal to residues that are unique to sAnk1 (amino acids 61-74) (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We performed overlay assays with Obsc6316-6436 and wild-type as well as truncated forms of sAnk129-155 to learn if portions of both the unique and conserved regions mediate binding in vitro. A set of sAnk1 deletion constructs was generated that contained truncations of the cytoplasmic portion of sAnk1. One construct included amino acids 29-89 and contained most of the unique cytoplasmic sequence of sAnk1 along with the first 16 amino acids of the conserved sequence, whereas a second included amino acids 90-155, in the conserved sequence only (Fig. 1). As a positive control, we also expressed a construct containing the minimal binding site (amino acids 61-130 (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)), consisting of the last 12 amino acids of the unique sequence and most of the conserved sequence. Fig. 2A shows the results of SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified fusion proteins that were used. Equivalent amounts of Obsc6316-6436 were probed in far Western blots with MBP fusion proteins of these sAnk1 variants, or with MBP alone. sAnk161-130 bound almost as well to Obsc6316-6436 as to the full cytoplasmic construct, sAnk129-155 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4), confirmed by kinetic analysis that revealed a binding affinity very close to wild-type (data not shown). However, the two other constructs did not bind nearly as well (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). We found no significant binding of MBP alone (Fig. 2B, lane 5). These results confirm in vitro the results of yeast two-hybrid assays (6Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Kim E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), i.e. that the binding of sAnk1 to Obsc6316-6436 requires amino acids in both its unique and conserved sequences. Mutating the Lysines and Arginines of the Proposed Binding Site to Alanine—The region of sAnk1 that binds obscurin includes two stretches of positively charged amino acids that can be modeled as amphipathic α-helices (see below), one in the sequence unique to sAnk1, the other in the sequence conserved among many ankyrin isoforms. We hypothesized that these residues in each of the putative helical regions were essential for binding to obscurin. We systematically mutated these residues individually and in groups to test this. A complete list of the mutations and the oligonucleotides used to prepare them are given in supplemental Table S1. We examined all our sAnk1 mutant forms with dynamic light scattering (data not shown) to assess the effects of mutagenesis on the sizes of the mutant proteins in solution. Most mutations showed no significant differences in the relative size of the molecules compared with wild type, suggesting that the mutations did not disrupt the overall structure of the cytoplasmic domain of sAnk1. We then evaluated the ability of these mutant forms of sAnk1 to bind to Obsc6316-6436 by blot overlay and SPR. Below, we first consider the conserved sequence and then examine the unique sequence. Initially, we used blot overlays to assay the relative abilities of wild-type MBP-sAnk129-155 and alanine mutants of the lysines and arginines in the conserved region (Fig. 3) to bind to GST-Obsc6316-6436. MBP alone served as a negative control. The effects of individual K-to-A and R-to-A substitutions varied with their position in the sequence. Mutating the first amino acid in the conserved sequence (K100A) had a greater inhibitory effect on binding than mutating any of the middle residues (K101A, R104A, and K105A), whereas mutating the last residue (R108A) increased binding significantly (Fig. 3B, lanes 3-7). Mutating these amino acids in combination also gave differing results, again depending on their locations. Mutation of three or more residues simultaneously appeared to abolish binding completely (all five are mutated in K100A/K101A/R104A/K105A/R108A, Fig. 3B, lane 2; others not shown). Mutating the first and last amino acids (K100A/R108A) resulted in a protein that bound to Obsc6316-6436 better than the K100A construct alone but not as well as wild-type sAnk1 (see also Fig. 3B, lane 8). As in Fig. 2, no specific binding was detected when the identical blot was overlaid with MBP alone (not shown). These results show that the first four positively charged residues in the conserved region of sAnk129-155 (Lys-100, Lys-101, Arg-104, and Lys-105) promote binding to Obsc6316-6436, but that the last positively charged amino acid (Arg-108) inhibits binding to a modest extent. We used SPR to confirm and quantify the binding of wild-type and mutant forms of sAnk1 to Obsc6316-6436. In these experiments, we immobilized GST-Obsc6316-6436 on one flow cell of the sensor chip, and immobilized GST, on a separate flow cell, as a control. We then introduced wild-type or mutant forms of MBP-sAnk129-155 at concentrations of 1 μm onto the GST-obscurin and GST surfaces and measured binding and dissociation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data from representative sensograms are shown in Fig. 3C, and, after normalization to binding of the wild-type proteins (100%), as bar graphs in Fig. 3D. These results confirmed quantitatively all the results of our blot overlay assays of the effects of mutating the lysine and arginine residues in the conserved region of sAnk1 on binding to GST-Obsc6316-6436. Differences from wild type were statistically significant (p < 0.01). We used identical approaches to study the role of the homologous, positively charged amino acids in the unique region of sAnk129-155 on binding (Fig. 4). All constructs were purified as stable fusion proteins and were assayed as above. As we observed with the conserved sequence, mutation of the first amino acid (R64A) had a greater inhibitory effect than similar mutations of the three middle residues (R67A, R68A, and R69A), whereas mutation of the last amino acid (K73A) enhanced binding to GST-Obsc6316-6436, compared with wild-type sAnk1. Double mutation of the first and last residue (R64A/K73A), however, produced a fusion protein that bound GST-Obsc6316-6436 better than wild-type sAnk1, in contrast to the K100A/R108A mutant form. The blot overlay assays described above, and SPR studies (Fig. 4, B-D) gave similar results. Collectively, these results show that each of the positively charged sequences in the unique and conserved regions of sAnk1 plays a qualitatively similar role in the binding of sAnk1 to obscurin and suggest that they form a binding site on sAnk1 for obscurin that is composed of two similar structures, both of which are required for bindin"

HIV-1 Gag and GagPol, as well as host cell factor lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), are required for specific packaging of tRNALys into virions. Gag alone is sufficient for packaging of LysRS, and these two proteins have been shown to interact in vitro with an equilibrium binding constant of ∼310 nm. The capsid (CA) domain of Gag binds to LysRS with a similar affinity as full-length Gag. In this work, we report further characterization of the interaction between HIV-1 CA and human LysRS using truncation constructs and point mutations in the putative interaction helices. Fluorescence anisotropy binding measurements reveal that a LysRS variant lacking the N-terminal 219 residues still displays high affinity binding to CA. The CA C-terminal domain (CTD) is also sufficient for binding to LysRS. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies using 15N-labeled CA-CTD reveal chemical shift perturbations of residues in and proximal to helix 4 of CA-CTD upon LysRS binding. A synthetic peptide that includes helix 4 binds to LysRS with high affinity, whereas peptides derived from the other three helical domains of CA-CTD do not.

Upon infection of a cell by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LysRS, lysyl-tRNA synthetase; FA, fluorescence anisotropy; CTD, C-terminal domain; CA, capsid protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PDB, Protein Data Bank; h, helix. the viral RNA genome is reverse-transcribed into double-stranded proviral DNA. The resulting DNA translocates into the nucleus and integrates into the DNA of the host cell. Transcription of viral DNA yields spliced and unspliced mRNAs, progeny RNA genomes, and viral proteins. Among these viral proteins are two large precursor proteins, Gag and GagPol. During viral maturation, Gag is processed into the mature viral proteins matrix, capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid. In the last step of the viral life cycle, Gag, GagPol, genomic RNA, and specific host cell components assemble at the plasma membrane where packaging and assembly of newly formed virus particles occurs. HIV-1 utilizes human tRNALys3 as the primer for initiating reverse transcription of minus-strand strong-stop DNA (1Jiang M. Kim J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three major tRNALys isoacceptors, tRNALys1, tRNALys2, and tRNALys3, are selectively packaged into newly forming HIV-1 virions (2Mak J. Kim L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8087-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). tRNALys1 and tRNALys2 differ from tRNALys3 by 14 and 16 bases, respectively, and from each other by only one base in the anticodon. The fact that all three isoacceptors are packaged, but only tRNALys3 is used as the primer, strongly suggests that lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) plays a role in specifically targeting tRNALys for viral packaging. Indeed, human LysRS, the only cellular factor known to interact specifically with all three tRNALys isoacceptors, is also selectively packaged into HIV-1, independently of tRNALys, via its interaction with Gag (3Cen S. Kim A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Selective packaging of tRNALys depends on the ability of the synthetase to bind tRNALys, but aminoacylation activity is not required (4Cen S. Kim H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, the reduction of cytoplasmic LysRS with short interfering RNA results in reduced tRNALys packaging into virions, reduced tRNALys3 annealing to viral RNA, and reduced viral infectivity (5Guo F. Kim S. Niu M. Javanbakht H. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9817-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between host cell LysRS and the HIV-1 packaging machinery represents a novel target for the development of anti-HIV therapy. The minimal complex required for packaging of tRNALys includes HIV-1 precursor proteins Gag and GagPol, human tRNALys, and LysRS (6Kleiman L. Kim S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The tRNALys packaging complex is formed when a Gag-GagPol complex interacts with a tRNALys-LysRS complex. Gag interacts specifically with LysRS (7Javanbakht H. Kim R. Cen S. Saadatmand J. Musier-Forsyth K. Göttlinger H. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27644-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and GagPol interacts with both Gag and tRNALys (8Park J. Kim C.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mak J. Kim M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LysRS can be packaged into viral-like particles composed only of Gag, but tRNALys packaging requires GagPol as well (4Cen S. Kim H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly suggest the importance of the LysRS-Gag interaction in tRNALys primer packaging. The regions critical for the protein-protein interaction between LysRS and Gag have been mapped using in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, in vivo LysRS viral packaging studies, and studies of Gag-LysRS coimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates (7Javanbakht H.

The interaction depends on Gag sequences within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CA and amino acids 208-259 in motif 1 of LysRS. Interestingly, these two regions contain elements involved in the formation of the dimerization interface of each protein. Recent in vitro studies show monomer units of each protein interacting to form a heterodimeric Gag-LysRS complex (10Kovaleski B.J. Kim R. Hong M.K. Datta S.A. Kleiman L. Rein A. Musier-Forsyth K. J.

Brick P. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus LysRS (12Cusack S. Kim A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6321-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have been solved. LysRS is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of an N-terminal anti-codon binding domain, a dimerization domain formed by motif 1, and motifs 2 and 3 that together constitute the aminoacylation active site. LysRS is one of the most highly conserved synthetases, and sequence alignments suggest that prokaryotic and eukaryotic LysRSs are structurally similar (13Shiba K. Kim T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although high resolution structural information for Gag is not available, the crystal structure of the isolated HIV-1 CA-CTD (PDB number 1A43) has been solved (14Worthylake D.K. Kim H. Yoo S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This domain consists of a 310 helix followed by four α-helices (Fig. 1, h1-h4). Dimerization of CA occurs through parallel packing of helix 2 and by packing of the 310 helix into a groove created by helices 2 and 3 of the partner molecule. In this work, we report studies aimed at high resolution mapping of the residues in HIV-1 CA that are involved in interaction with human LysRS. Fluorescence anisotropy (FA) binding measurements were used to identify minimal constructs of both LysRS and CA-CTD that are still able to interact. NMR spectroscopy, alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and peptide binding assays are consistent with a critical role for residues in and around the C-terminal helix of CA-CTD. Plasmid Construction—The plasmids encoding HIV-1 CA (WISP98-85) and HIV-1 CA-CTD(WISP97-07, CA146-231) were a gift from Dr. Wesley Sundquist (The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). CA alanine mutants T210A, E212A, M214A, M215A, T216A, H226A, K227A, and R229A were constructed using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Residue numbers given throughout this report refer to CA numbering and not to Gag numbering. Plasmid pM368 was constructed by cloning a 1.8-kbp fragment from pM116 into pKS583, a derivative of pET19b (13Shiba K. Kim T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid produces a fusion protein that contains the N-terminal MRGSHHHHHHHSSGWVD sequence appended to full-length (1-597 amino acids) human LysRS and contains genes conferring ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance. LysRS Δ1-219 was constructed by amplifying the LysRS gene from residues 220-597 while incorporating an NdeI site near the 5′ end and an XhoI site near the 3′ end. In addition, the primer positions an alanine codon on the 5′ side of codon 220. The digested PCR product was ligated into NdeI-XhoI-digested pET21b. Candidates were screened by restriction enzyme digestion followed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification and Sample Preparation—The expression and purification for all CA (10Kovaleski B.J. Kim R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) proteins was according to previously published procedures. For 15N CA-CTD labeling, the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal growth medium containing 15N-ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole nitrogen source. For uniform 13C/15N CA-CTD labeling, the bacteria were grown in M9 medium containing 13C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole carbon source and 15N-ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. Amino acid-specific 15N-labeled CA-CTDs (Leu, Lys, and Val) were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 medium lacking nitrogen source and supplemented with unlabeled amino acids (100 mg/liter each) and the 15N-labeled amino acid (100 mg/liter). The labeled proteins were purified by the same procedure as wild-type proteins. Samples for NMR experiments contained CA-CTD alone or CA-CTD and LysRS dialyzed into 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phospine), and 5% D2O. NMR Spectroscopy and Data Processing—A two-dimensional 1H-15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of free 15N-labeled CA-CTD (130 μm) was collected at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer. The experiment was repeated with the addition of unlabeled human Δ1-219 LysRS (130 μm). The data were processed and visualized using NMRPipe and NMRdraw, respectively (16Delaglio F. Kim S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). For peak assignments, NMR spectra were recorded using 15N- and 13C-labeled CA-CTD as well as amino acid-specific 15N-labeled Leu, Lys, or Val CA-CTD. Sequential assignment of chemical shift values to backbone atoms was accomplished using conventional triple resonance experiments (17Matsuo H. Kim E. Li H. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 111: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Powers R. Kim D.S. March C.J. Frieden E.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4334-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorophore Labeling of Protein—A solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Invitrogen) was prepared in dimethyl formamide. The concentration of the stock solution of FITC was determined at pH > 9 using the extinction coefficient ε494 nm = 73,000 m-1 cm-1. The CA proteins were labeled with FITC at a 10:1 FITC:protein ratio for 10 min at room temperature in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8. Unreacted dye was removed by buffer exchanging at 4 °C using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff Microcon concentrator (Millipore). Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Ultraviolet illumination of the gels confirmed that proteins were labeled and contained little or no free fluorophore. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis of CA-CTD-Derived Helices—Helix h1 (158-174: KEPFRDYVDRFYKTLRA) and h3 (194-204: ANPDCKTILKA) of HIV-1 CA-CTD were synthesized by standard solid-phase methods. Labeling at the N-terminal amine of each peptide was achieved by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of FITC in dimethylformamide (pH ∼ 9), whereas the peptide was still resin-bound (at the C terminus) and each amino acid was still side chain-protected. Following an overnight incubation, peptides were cleaved from the resin, purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, and confirmed by mass spectrometry. Helix h2 (176-190: QASQEVKNWMTETLL) and h4 (211-227: LEEMMTACQVGGPGHK) of HIV-1 CA-CTD were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Peptides were received in purified, lyophilized form and reconstituted in water. Labeling with FITC was achieved essentially as described above. FITC reacts with non-protonated aliphatic amine groups, including the N terminus of proteins or peptides and the amino group of lysines. Thus, labeling of h2/h4 peptides results in the possibility of the label being attached either at the N terminus or at lysine residues within the peptides (Lys-182 of h2 or Lys-227 of h4). Selective labeling of the N terminus is favored at pH 7, and thus, these reactions were performed at lower pH. High performance liquid chromatography purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis confirmed a 1:1 peptide:dye ratio. Circular Dichroism (CD) Analysis—CD spectra of wild-type and truncated LysRS and CA were measured at room temperature using a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) with a 0.1-mm path length cuvette. Prior to analysis, proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, and diluted to a concentration of 5 μm. Spectra were accumulated over six scans. CD spectra of each synthesized peptide were also recorded and used to confirm the helical nature of each. Peptides were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol was added to 25% (19Goodman M. Kim I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 3770-3771Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). FA Measurements—Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by measuring the FA of 50 nm fluorescently labeled species (CA:FITC, CA-CTD:FITC, or peptide:FITC) as a function of increasing concentrations of unlabeled protein (LysRS or Δ1-219 LysRS). The labeled protein was incubated with varying amounts of the desired unlabeled protein for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Anisotropy measurements were made either on a Photon Technology International spectrofluorimeter (Model QM-2000) or on an Analyst AD fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 520 nm, respectively (slit widths = 5 nm). Data analysis was performed as described previously (10Kovaleski B.J. Kim R. Hong M.K. Datta S.A. Kleiman L. Rein A. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19449-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Docking Model of LysRS and CA—A homology model of human LysRS was generated using the program MODELLER 4 (20Sali A. Mol. Med. Today. 1995; 1: 270-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The available coordinates from the x-ray structure of E. coli LysRS (1E1O) were used as a template (11Onesti S. Kim A.D. Brick P. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). LysRS-CA docking studies were performed using the Chimera/BiGGER software package. The docking models of LysRS-CA were generated using the algorithms implemented in Chimera 2.0 (21Palma P.N. Kim L. Wampler J.E. Moura J.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). BiGGER was run with two docking partners, selecting the monomeric CA structure (Protein Data Bank code 1E6J chain P) as the probe and the modeled structure of human LysRS as the target. The first round of docking experiments factored in the protein geometry, electrostatic contacts, as well as hydrophobic interactions. The parameters used were as follows: resolution 1.0; added radius of 1.0; angular steps of 15 with a minimal overlap of 100. Ten thousand solutions were obtained by this procedure. After the docking run, models were filtered usinga4Å cutoff to give 2000 unique clusters. The docking models were scored based on the in vivo data generated from deletion mapping of the binding regions of LysRS and Gag (7Javanbakht H. Kim R. Cen S. Saadatmand J. Musier-Forsyth K. Göttlinger H. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27644-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). FA Binding Assays Show Interaction between Minimal Gag and LysRS Constructs—Previous studies mapped the regions critical for the LysRS-Gag interaction to Gag sequences within CA-CTD and amino acids within motif 1 of LysRS (7Javanbakht H. Kim R. Cen S. Saadatmand J. Musier-Forsyth K. Göttlinger H. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27644-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays also revealed that CA binds LysRS with a similar affinity as full-length Gag (∼420 nm) (10Kovaleski B.J. Kim R. Hong M.K. Datta S.A. Kleiman L. Rein A. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19449-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To further delineate the minimal domains required for the LysRS-Gag interaction, we prepared two truncation mutants. The CTD of CA has previously been purified and shown to fold independently of the N-terminal domain (22Gamble T.R. Kim S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The CA-CTD construct encoding residues 146-231 of CA was purified from E. coli. Expression and purification of a truncation mutant of human LysRS lacking 219 residues from the N terminus (Δ1-219 LysRS) was also carried out. This LysRS construct preserves the catalytic domain of LysRS but lacks the anticodon binding domain and the N-terminal extension. CD analysis indicated that Δ1-219 LysRS appeared to be folded in a similar manner to wild-type LysRS (data not shown). FA measurements showed that the binding affinity between Δ1-219 LysRS and CA-CTD was only ∼2-fold reduced relative to the full-length proteins (Kd = 770 ± 160 nm, Fig. 2). These in vitro experiments validate an earlier in vivo observation that Δ1-207 LysRS is incorporated into Gag viral-like particles ∼70% as efficiently as WT LysRS and supports previous data mapping the LysRS-Gag interaction to the CTD of CA and the catalytic domain of LysRS (7Javanbakht H.

NMR Studies of Minimal Gag and LysRS Constructs—The sequential assignment of NMR signals of H15N, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ atoms of CA-CTD was achieved, with the exception of amino acids 147-153 and 172-192. These residues are located at the monomer-dimer interface, and due to the relatively weak dimer (full-length CA Kd = 18 ± 1 μm; CA-CTD Kd = 10 ± 3 μm) and a heterogeneous dimer interface (22Gamble T.R. Kim S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), their amide nitrogen and amide proton correlation signals were broadened and missing from the spectra. Chemical shift perturbation of 15N-labeled-CA-CTD was observed upon the addition of unlabeled Δ1-219 LysRS. A two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of free 15N-labeled CA-CTD is shown in Fig. 3A (black peaks). In this spectrum, main chain amide protons are observed, with one signal for each residue. The same experiment was also performed in the presence of equimolar amounts of unlabeled Δ1-219 LysRS (Fig. 3A, red peaks). Although many peaks did not change upon LysRS addition, nine peaks displayed small to moderate chemical shift perturbations (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, all the shifted residues are either in or proximal to helix 4 of CA-CTD. The largest perturbations occur at positions Thr-210 and His-226, which are located at the N terminus of helix 4 and in the adjacent C-terminal tail, respectively (Fig. 3B). FA Binding Studies between CA-CTD-derived Peptides and LysRS—To further probe the interaction between CA-CTD and LysRS, four peptides derived from h1-h4 of the CA-CTD were labeled with FITC (Fig. 1). The helical nature of each peptide was verified by CD spectroscopy measurements performed in 25% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (data not shown). All four CA-derived helices were tested for their ability to bind LysRS using FA measurements. The peptides were kept at a constant concentration of 50 nm, and LysRS was varied from 0 to 20 μm. Strikingly, the peptide derived from h4 was the only peptide that showed significant binding to LysRS (Kd = 270 ± 60 nm; Fig. 4). Little or no binding of peptides derived from h1, h2, or h3 was observed (Fig. 4, inset). These data support the NMR findings and suggest that h4 plays a critical role in CA-CTD binding to LysRS. Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis—Based on the NMR results shown in Fig. 3 and the helix binding data shown in Fig. 4, eight point mutants in the predicted h4-interacting region of CA-CTD were prepared. FA was used to test the effect of each single point mutant on CA-CTD binding to LysRS. As shown in Table 1, mutations to alanine at positions Thr-210, Met-214, Met-215, and His-226 have significant (∼3-fold) effects on the binding affinity. An alanine substitution at Glu-212 had a more modest 2-fold effect. Changes at Thr-216, Lys-227, and Arg-229 had little or no effect on binding to LysRS. Taken together, these results support the NMR and peptide binding studies, suggesting a critical role for h4 in binding to LysRS.TABLE 1Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for human LysRS binding to wild-type (WT) and mutant FITC-labeled CA variants obtained from fluorescence anisotropy measurements Measurements were performed in the presence of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl.

In these studies, multiple high scoring models were clustered into three basic binding modes. One of these three modes, shown in Fig. 5, correlates well with the NMR data, FA peptide binding studies, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis and shows a close interaction of CA-CTD h4 to the polar face of the amphoteric helix H7 of LysRS. Disruption of the Gag-LysRS interaction, which is essential for specific tRNALys primer packaging, represents a novel therapeutic strategy. As a first step toward this goal, we have begun to map the interaction domain at high resolution. In this work, minimal constructs of HIV-1 Gag (CA-CTD) and human LysRS (Δ1-219 LysRS) have been identified and used in NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments. These studies show that residues within and flanking helix 4 of CA-CTD are perturbed upon LysRS binding. Based on the crystal structure of the isolated HIV-1 CA-CTD (PDB number 1A43), dimerization of CA can occur through parallel packing of helix 2 (14Worthylake D.K. Kim H. Yoo S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent x-ray structure of CA-CTD containing a single alanine deletion (residue 177) revealed a significantly different dimer interface (PDB number 147Q) (23Ivanov D. Kim O.V.

The mutant structure is described as a domain-swapped homolog of the wild-type protein, with the dimer formed by exchange of the protein segment that contains the N-terminal strand and helix 1 between the two monomers. In this structure, the major homology region in helix 1, a highly conserved domain present in all retroviral CA proteins (24Wills J.W. Kim R.C. AIDS. 1991; 5: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), forms a major part of the dimer interface, providing an explanation for the conservation of the major homology region, as well as its critical role in assembly (25Strambio-de-Castillia C. Kim E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7021-7032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mammano F. Kim A. Hoglund S. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4927-4936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, helix 4 is not intimately involved in the dimer interface of either structure and is therefore available for interaction with other proteins, such as LysRS. In all three wild-type crystal structures of the CA-CTD (PDB numbers 1A43, 1AUM, and 1A80) (14Worthylake D.K. Kim H. Yoo S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Gamble T.R. Kim S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), there is a disulfide bond between Cys-198 and Cys-218 that links the N terminus of helix 3 to the C terminus of helix 4. In freshly lysed viral particles, Cys-218 is present as a free thiol (14Worthylake D.K. Kim H. Yoo S. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that disulfide bond formation may modulate CA-CA interactions and facilitate uncoating of the core structure upon infection. With the exception of this possible disulfide bond, helix 4 has not, to our knowledge, been reported to be involved in any protein-protein interactions. The observed chemical shift perturbations were consistent with an interaction between LysRS and residues in and proximal to helix 4 of CA-CTD. This conclusion is strongly supported by peptide binding studies (Fig. 4) and alanine-scanning mutagenesis data (Table 1). The largest NMR perturbations occurred at positions Thr-210 and His-226. The latter residue also displayed significantly reduced peak intensity upon LysRS addition. This result is consistent with a direct interaction, and indeed, individually mutating these two residues to alanine resulted in a significant (∼3-fold) decrease in binding affinity to LysRS. Although Lys-227 and Arg-229 undergo modest chemical shift changes, mutation of these residues does not result in altered binding affinity, suggesting that they do not directly interact with LysRS. The direct interaction of nearby residues, such as His-226, may have induced a structural change that resulted in the observed chemical shift changes. Surprisingly, mutations at Met-214 and Met-215, residues that did not shift in the NMR experiments, also resulted in similar decreases in binding affinity. Helix 4 is only six amino acids long, and Met-214/Met-215 are in the middle of the helix. Mutation of these residues may have resulted in a conformational change that affected the binding of LysRS, although they are not directly involved in the interaction. In summary, we have localized the LysRS interaction domain on Gag to the residues within and proximal to h4 of the CA-CTD. Previous LysRS mapping studies, together with computational docking studies carried out here (Fig. 5), support a direct interaction between h4 of CA-CTD and H7 of LysRS. High resolution mapping of the interaction surface on H7 is underway. Taken together, these results will help to inform both rational design and screening approaches to find inhibitors of this novel anti-HIV target.

Although the ring-shaped Rho factor exhibits in vitro RNA-dependent ATPase and directional RNA-DNA helicase activities, the actual molecular mechanisms used by Rho to disrupt the intricate network of interactions that cement the ternary transcription complex remain elusive. Here, we show that Rho is a molecular motor that can apply significant disruptive forces on heterologous nucleoprotein assemblies such as streptavidin bound to biotinylated RNA molecules. ATP-dependent disruption of the biotin-streptavidin interaction demonstrates that Rho is not mechanistically limited to the melting of nucleic acid base pairs within molecular complexes and confirms that specific interactions with the roadblock target are not required for Rho to operate properly. We also show that Rho-induced streptavidin displacement depends significantly on the identity of the biotinylated transcript as well as on the position, nature, and length of the biotin link to the RNA chain. Altogether, our data are consistent with a “snow plough” type of mechanism of action whereby an early rearrangement of the Rho-substrate complex (activation) is rate-limiting, physical force (pulling) is exerted on the RNA chain by residues of the central Rho channel, and removal of structural obstacles from the RNA track stems from their nonspecific steric exclusion from the hexamer central hole.

J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At present, the exact mechanism by which Rho dissociates the TEC remains unknown. It has been believed for some time that the Rho helicase could directly unwind the RNA-DNA hybrid that the 3′-end of the nascent transcript forms with the DNA template within the TEC. However, recent structural data indicate that this short ∼9-base pair-long RNA-DNA hybrid is too deeply buried within the TEC interior for direct helicase action (19Vassylyev D.G. Kim M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Artsimovitch I. Nature. 2007; 448: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 20Cramer P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This observation has prompted alternative models whereby the Rho enzyme, once positioned on the polymerase surface, applies NTPase-driven physical force to pull the RNA from the TEC and/or drive forward the polymerase into an hypertranslocated and unstable state (21Richardson J.P. Cell. 2003; 114: 157-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Park J.S. Kim J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Importantly, these models imply that the RNA and RNA-DNA unwinding activities of Rho are essentially nonspecific in vitro byproducts of the enzyme progression along the RNA track. This proposal is reminiscent of the “snow plough”-type of mechanisms proposed for various helicases and is consistent with the emerging view of helicases being able to perform a larger set of remodeling tasks on nucleic acid (NA) and nucleoproteic assemblies than simply separating NA strands (24von Hippel P.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Jankowsky E. Kim H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4181-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Mackintosh S.G. Kim K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rho function can be tightly regulated by transcription factors, such as NusA and NusG (27Sullivan S.L. Kim M.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 989-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Burns C.M. Kim L.V. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), that alter the conformation of the TEC (29Artsimovitch I. Kim R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 30Toulokhonov I. Kim I. Landick R. Science. 2001; 292: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although these alterations are likely to modulate the strength and/or elongation rate of the TEC, Rho may also respond differentially to specific, factor-induced, structural features of the TEC isoforms. Similarly, defects in Rho-dependent termination induced by single-point mutations of the α-C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) may stem from altered Rho-RNAP contacts (31Kainz M. Kim R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the presence of specific Rho-RNAP interactions would support a mechanism slightly more elaborate than simple snow plough displacement of structural obstacles from the NA track. Although the TEC is a macromolecular assembly that is much more complex than regular helicase substrates (i.e. bare NA helices), it derives a large part of its thermodynamic stability from NA base pairings (see Ref. 32Tadigotla V.R. Kim D. Sengupta A.M. Epshtein V. Ebright R.H. Nudler E. Ruckenstein A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4439-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and references therein). This raises the possibility that Rho mechanochemical work may be limited to the disruption of NA pairings within molecular complexes. This proposal, however, would also not be totally consistent with a snow plough-type of mechanism since the strength rather than the chemical nature of the roadblock interactions with the NA track should impact the efficiency (processivity) of the helicase (“translocase”) enzyme. To clarify these important aspects of the Rho mechanism, we have evaluated the ability of the enzyme to displace a heterologous protein from a transcript substrate. We selected the biotin-streptavidin complex as a model system because it has a number of interesting advantages to probe the Rho mechanism: a biotin moiety can be readily introduced at various positions of the RNA chain by chemical and enzymatic methods; the biotin-streptavidin interaction is stronger (Kd ∼ 10-13 m) (33Howarth M. Kim D.J. Gerrow K. Dorrestein P.C. Grandy M.R. Kelleher N.L. El-Husseini A. Ting A.Y. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 34Klumb L.A. Kim V. Stayton P.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7657-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) than most NA-protein interactions; the spontaneous dissociation of biotin from streptavidin is significantly slower (koff ∼ 3 × 10-3 min-1 at 37 °C) (33Howarth M. Kim D.J. Gerrow K. Dorrestein P.C. Grandy M.R. Kelleher N.L. El-Husseini A. Ting A.Y. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 34Klumb L.A. Kim V. Stayton P.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7657-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) than the ATP-dependent Rho dissociation activity inferred from unwinding of model RNA-DNA substrates (kobs > 0.1 min-1 at 37 °C) (35Walstrom K.M. Kim J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); the biotin and streptavidin moieties are held together by interactions that differ markedly from the hydrogen bond networks involved in NA base pairs (Ref. 34Klumb L.A. Kim V. Stayton P.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7657-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and references therein). Here, we show that Rho can displace streptavidin from biotinylated transcript substrates in an ATP-dependent fashion. This indicates that Rho activity is not very much modulated by the nature of the roadblock target. This observation is consistent with a snow ploughtype of mechanism of steric exclusion of the roadblock from the central channel of the Rho hexamer (where the RNA strand is pulled in by the enzyme) (38Wei R.R. Kim J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Wei R.R. Kim J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Yet, we also show that the position and nature of the chemical link of biotin to the RNA strand as well as the identity of the transcript can significantly impact the efficiency of streptavidin displacement by the Rho enzyme. These observations are in line with the idiosyncratic responses of the Rho helicase to modifications of model RNA-DNA substrates (36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and suggest that the same kinetic and RNA structure factors control the NA strand and protein displacement reactions. Materials—Chemicals and enzymes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and New England Biolabs, respectively. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Biomers.net and Dharmacon and were systematically purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Core streptavidin (13.3 kDa/monomer) was obtained from Promega. The Rho protein (concentrations expressed in units of hexamers throughout this report) was prepared and characterized as described previously (37Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Nowatzke W. Kim L. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The DNA templates encoding the R107 and R132 transcripts were obtained by PCR amplification of specific regions of the pAS02 plasmid that contains the R157 sequence downstream from a T7 promoter (36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These templates, or the pAS02 plasmid linearized with SmaI (for the preparation of the R157 transcripts), were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (42Schwartz A. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using larger reaction volumes (500 μl) and longer incubation times (2–3 h). The resulting transcripts were purified by 5–7% denaturing PAGE and stored at -20 °C in M10E1 buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA). Preparation of the Biotinylated Transcripts—We used two distinct synthesis routes to attach biotin-derivatized linkers to various positions of aRut (artificial Rut; see Refs. 9Guerin M. Kim N.

Biol. 2004; 342: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) containing RNA molecules. On the one hand, the transcripts were biotinylated specifically at their 3′-ends by controlled oxidation with sodium periodate followed by coupling with EZ-link biotin hydrazides (Pierce), as described (43Qin P.Z. Kim A.M. Methods. 1999; 18: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, synthetic RNA oligonucleotides containing primary amine linkers at specific positions were reacted with EZ-link biotin succinimidyl esters (Pierce). Biotinylated R132 molecules were then obtained by ligating these modified oligonucleotides to the 3′-ends of R107 transcripts using T4 RNA ligase and DNA splints, as described (44Persson T. Kim D.K. Hartmann R.K. Hartmann R.K. Bindereif A. Schön A. Westhof E. Handbook of RNA Biochemistry. 2005: 53-74Google Scholar). Because neither synthesis route ensured 100% biotinylation of the RNA molecules, the correct products were selected through their ability to bind streptavidin: 10 pmol 32P-labeled molecules were incubated with streptavidin (1 μm) in hybridization buffer (150 mm potassium acetate (Kac), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 30 °C. Streptavidin-RNA complexes were then purified by 7% native PAGE (gels contained 0.3% SDS to maximize the fractions of specific complexes), eluted from the gel bands in streptavidin buffer (0.3 m KAc, 100 nm streptavidin) for 1.5 h at 30 °C, and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol before being stored at -20 °C in helicase buffer (150 mm KAc, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The amounts of byproducts (such as complexes containing more that one RNA strand/streptavidin tetramer or biotinylated RNA strands bound to streptavidin dimers) were substantially reduced (<10%) with this procedure. However, it is possible that a small fraction of the biotinylated RNA-streptavidin complexes evolve into an unstable population (see “Results”) during the elution step. The RNA concentrations were determined by UV measurements with a μl-spectrophotometer (Nanodrop) and/or from specific activities of the samples. The DINAmelt server (45Markham N.R. Kim M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (Web Server issue): W577-W581Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) was used to predict the secondary structures of the RNA constructs. Streptavidin Displacement Reactions—Purified streptavidin-RNA complexes (∼1 nm, final concentration) were mixed with Rho hexamers (20 nm) in helicase buffer and incubated for 3 min at 30 °C. The displacement reaction was initiated with a mixture of ATP, MgCl2 (1 mm, final concentrations), and free biotin (10 μm, final concentration). Reaction aliquots were taken at various times, mixed with 3 volumes of quench buffer (150 mm Kac, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 26 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 5% Ficoll-400), and immediately loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.3% SDS to selectively denature Rho-RNA complexes. All displacement reactions were performed at least in triplicate but could not be repeated under single-turnover conditions because poly[rC], which is used as the Rho trap (35Walstrom K.M. Kim J.M.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9366-9379Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Detection and quantification of gel bands were performed with a Storm-860 imager and related software (GE Healthcare). The fractions of individual products present in the reaction at a given time were determined with the following formula, Ft = (It - F0 ×ΣIi,t)/((1 - F0) ×ΣIi,t) (with F0 = I0/ΣIi,0), where I0 and It are the intensities of the product bands after incubation of the helicase reaction for 0 or t min at 30 °C, respectively (ΣIi,0 and ΣIi,t are the sums of the intensities of the bands per gel lane measured under the same respective conditions). Note that F0 < 0.05 in most experiments. Rho Can Disrupt a Biotin-Streptavidin Complex Linked to the 3′-End of an RNA Substrate—To probe the capacity of the Rho enzyme to disrupt the biotin-streptavidin interaction, we have used 132-nucleotide (nt)-long RNA constructs containing a synthetic Rho loading site (aRut sequence; see Refs. 9Guerin M.

To avoid potential interference of the biotin-streptavidin complex with the formation of a productive Rho-RNA complex (36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a large distance (>60 nt) was set initially between the aRut site and a 3′-terminal BtN residue (R132-3′Bt construct; Fig. 1A). In a first series of experiments, 32P-labeled R132-3′Bt constructs were mixed with core streptavidin (this mature form lacks the C-terminal polypeptide domain that can compete for the biotin binding site) (47Le Trong I. Kim N. Ward T.R. Stenkamp R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the resulting complexes were purified by PAGE (see “Experimental Procedures”). The RNA-streptavidin complexes were then incubated with Rho for 3 min at 30 °C before addition of an initiation mixture containing ATP, MgCl2, and an excess of biotin (to trap free streptavidin molecules). Reaction aliquots were removed at various times and immediately loaded on a native (with respect to NA species) gel containing 0.3% SDS (in these electrophoretic conditions, Rho-RNA complexes are selectively denatured; data not shown). The spontaneous release of core streptavidin from the biotinylated transcripts was also monitored in control experiments containing ADP instead of ATP. As shown in Fig. 1B (ADP lanes and graph), this reaction is very slow with the R132-3′Bt-streptavidin complexes (koff ∼ 0.6 × 10-3/min at 30 °C), which is in good agreement with published work on the biotin-streptavidin interaction (koff ∼ 3 × 10-3/min at 37 °C) (33Howarth M. Kim D.J. Gerrow K. Dorrestein P.C. Grandy M.R. Kelleher N.L. El-Husseini A. Ting A.Y. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 34Klumb L.A. Kim V. Stayton P.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7657-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, dissociation of the R132-3′Bt-streptavidin complexes was dramatically accelerated under conditions promoting Rho helicase activity (Fig. 1B, ATP lanes). This effect was strictly dependent on the presence of Rho, MgCl2, and excess biotin in the reaction mixture and was inhibited by pairing of a complementary oligonucleotide to the aRut sequence (data not shown). Altogether, these data are consistent with the active displacement of streptavidin from the R132-3′Bt transcript promoted by the Rho enzyme. The kinetic profile of the streptavidin displacement reaction is complex, probably reflecting distinct reaction phases and pathways (Fig. 1B, graph). On the one hand, a small fraction (Afast < 5%) of the RNA-streptavidin complexes were quickly dissociated (kfast ≥ 10 min-1) in an ATP-independent fashion. This minor reaction was unaffected by the presence of nonspecific competitors (bovine serum albumin or tRNA) in the mixture, the absence of the Rho enzyme, or the lack of SDS in the gel (in control reactions without Rho) but required biotin in the initiation mix (data not shown). On the other hand, most RNA-streptavidin complexes (>95%) were actively dissociated by the Rho enzyme in two distinct ATP-dependent reaction phases (Fig. 1B), mimicking the pre-steady state profiles of multirun Rho helicase reactions (35Walstrom K.M. Kim J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From this analogy, one can speculate that streptavidin is removed from ∼15% of the RNA substrates during the first Rho translocation run (exponential phase; Aexp, kexp). This, in turn, suggests that the first run is unproductive for a significant fraction of the initial Rho-substrate complexes (i.e. Rho dissociates from the substrates before being able to displace streptavidin). However, streptavidin is also actively displaced from the complexes during subsequent Rho turnovers with an efficiency that is probably similar to the first run (∼15%) and at a rate (linear phase, klin ∼ 7 × 10-3/min) that remains higher than for spontaneous dissociation of streptavidin (koff ∼ 0.6 × 10-3/min, ADP conditions). The Efficiency of Streptavidin Displacement Depends on the Position of Biotin Attachment to the RNA Substrate—The data presented above demonstrate that the ATPase-fueled mechanochemical work of the Rho enzyme is not restricted to the disruption of NA pairing interactions. Yet, the fraction of R132-3′Bt-streptavidin complexes that are dissociated in a single Rho enzymatic run does not seem very high (∼15%, Fig. 1B), especially when compared with the amplitude of single-turnover RNA-DNA helicase reactions (36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This moderate efficiency of the Rho motor may be due to the nature of the biotin-streptavidin interaction or, alternatively, to the position of the streptavidin roadblock at the 3′-end of the RNA chain. To evaluate these possibilities, we have prepared another substrate in which the BtN residue is located at an internal position of the RNA chain (R132-U8Bt; Fig. 2, inset). Rho displacement reactions were performed with R132-U8Bt-streptavidin complexes under the experimental conditions described above. In this case, however, Rho could not actively displace streptavidin from the biotinylated RNA substrate (Fig. 2). Thus, the displacement efficiency of the Rho enzyme depends on the position of biotin attachment to the RNA chain (note, however, that Rho can displace a DNA oligonucleotide hybridized to the 110–132 region of the R132-U8Bt substrate with normal helicase efficiency; data not shown). The formation of a productive Rho-RNA complex, the likely crucial rate-limiting step during in vitro RNA-DNA helicase reactions, is sensitive to the local steric environment (36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether structural hindrance due to the binding of a bulky streptavidin tetramer closer to the Rho loading site could account for the loss of streptavidin displacement activity with the R132-U8Bt substrate. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a biotin moiety at the 3′-end of the R107 transcript (R107-3′oxBt substrate; see “Experimental Procedures”), thereby generating an 8-nt shorter distance between the BtN residue and the aRut site than in R132-U8Bt. Interestingly, Rho actively displaced streptavidin from R107-3′oxBt (Fig. 3A), which rules out a simple distance effect to explain the absence of Rho activity with R132-U8Bt (Fig. 2). Because the displacement reaction was moderately efficient with the R107-3′oxBt substrate, we also tested longer RNA substrates bearing the same biotin linker at their 3′-end (R132-3′oxBt and R157-3′oxBt substrates). Although Rho-induced displacement of streptavidin was improved significantly with R132-3′oxBt (with an efficiency per enzyme run now comparable with NA unwinding reactions), it was not better with the longer R157-3′oxBt substrate (Fig. 3B). From these data, it appears that the position of the BtN residue within the RNA chain rather than its mere distance to the aRut site (a minimal spacer of single-stranded RNA is likely required, however; see Ref. 36Walmacq C. Kim A.R. Boudvillain M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) affects the streptavidin displacement reaction triggered by Rho. Variations in the reaction efficiency upon small changes of the RNA sequence that might affect the secondary structure in the vicinity of the BtN residue (data not shown) suggest that the RNA fold may be an important factor. However, factors such as the length of the RNA chain or how biotin is attached to the RNA (i.e. internally or at the 3′-end) may also contribute significantly to the differences"

In particular they play a determinant role in the formation of cartilage molds and their replacement by bone during endochondral ossification. In cell culture, BMP-2 favors chondrogenic expression and promotes hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. In mouse chondrocytes we have identified a BMP-2-sensitive gene encoding a protein of 301 amino acids. This protein, named mIFT46, is the mouse ortholog of recently identified Caenorhabditis elegans and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. After generation of a polyclonal antibody against mIFT46, we showed for the first time that the endogenous protein is located in the primary cilium of chondrocytes. We also found that mIFT46 is preferentially expressed in early hypertrophic chondrocytes located in the growth plate. Additionally, mIFT46 knockdown by small interfering RNA oligonucleotides in cultured chondrocytes specifically stimulated the expression of several genes related to skeletogenesis. Furthermore, Northern blotting analysis indicated that mIFT46 is also expressed before chondrogenesis in embryonic mouse development, suggesting that the role of mIFT46 might not be restricted to cartilage. To explore the role of IFT46 during early development, we injected antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in Danio rerio embryos to reduce zebrafish IFT46 protein (zIFT46) synthesis. Dramatic defects in embryonic development such as a dorsalization and a tail duplication were observed. Thus our results taken together indicate that the ciliary protein IFT46 has a specific function in chondrocytes and is also essential for normal development of vertebrates.

Thus our results taken together indicate that the ciliary protein IFT46 has a specific function in chondrocytes and is also essential for normal development of vertebrates. In vertebrates endochondral bone formation involves first the formation of cartilage primordia, followed by its replacement by bone. This process is associated with several changes in the differentiation status of chondrocytes in the growth plate and results in a modification of the extracellular matrix composition. The cartilage matrix contains predominantly type II collagen. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes enter a process of maturation characterized by cellular hypertrophy, a decrease in type II collagen expression, and the onset in type X collagen expression. After full differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes the cartilage matrix calcifies. Ossification begins with the invasion of the calcified cartilage by blood capillaries. This neo-vascularization of the growth plate is concomitant with apoptosis of most hypertrophic chondrocytes. The resulting cartilage matrix provides a scaffold for osteoblasts, which invade the cartilage mold, along with blood vessels, so laying down a bone matrix characterized by the presence of osteocalcin (reviewed in Ref. 1Ortega N. Behonick D.J. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 86-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The successive steps of chondrocyte differentiation are finely regulated by different signaling molecules. Several cytokine families are involved in cartilage development such as Hedgehog (Hh), transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 4The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR1, FGF receptor 1; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; IFT, intraflagellar transport; siRNA, small interference RNA; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PEC, primary embryonic mouse chondrocyte; hpf, hours post fertilization; MO, morpholino. or Wnt. These signals coordinate proliferation, hypertrophy, and extracellular matrix protein production to maintain growth plate homeostasis and function. Among the members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play an essential role not only during the formation of cartilage molds for long bones, vertebrae, and ribs, but also in their transition to bone during endochondral ossification (reviewed in Ref. 2Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). BMPs are also involved in other important physiological events such as dorsoventral determination during gastrulation in early embryogenesis. Originally BMPs were described for their ability to induce ectopic bone formation by reproducing the events occurring during endochondral ossification (3Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4503) Google Scholar). In fact, recent experiments have shown that only a few BMP members can induce de novo bone formation in the classic subcutaneous implantation assay (4Wang E.A. Rosen V. D'Alessandro J.S. Bauduy M.

We previously reported that BMP-2 and BMP-4, but not BMP-12 or BMP-13, can stimulate chondrogenic expression, hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes, and their osteoblastic differentiation (15Valcourt U. Ronziere M.C. Winkler P. Rosen V. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Valcourt U. Gouttenoire J. Moustakas A. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33545-33558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). BMP-2 is also able to reverse the program of chondrocyte de-differentiation induced in cell culture, as attested by re-expression of the cartilage-characteristic type IIB procollagen pre-mRNA (17Valcourt U. Gouttenoire J. Aubert-Foucher E. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus BMP-2 is a strong anabolic agent with regard to cartilage biology. The fact that Bmp-2 mRNA is expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate in mouse embryos (18Chung U.I. Schipani E. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that BMP-2 plays a physiological role during endochondral ossification. As an approach to attaining better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in chondrocyte differentiation and maturation, we examined differentially expressed genes in mouse chondrocytes cultured in the presence or absence of BMP-2, by using the differential display reverse transcription-PCR technique. We isolated a gene encoding the mouse ortholog of an intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein, IFT46, recently identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (19Bell L.R. Stone S. Yochem J. Shaw J.E. Herman R.K. Genetics. 2006; 173: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (20Hou Y. Qin H. Follit J.A. Pazour G.J. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We have termed this gene mIFT46 (mouse IFT46) and showed that its expression is up-regulated in mouse chondrocytes upon BMP-2 treatment and that endogenous mIFT46 protein is located in the primary cilium in mouse chondrocytes. In situ hybridization analyses in mouse embryo limb buds revealed that mIFT46 is expressed in cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification. Interestingly, the siRNA-mediated silencing of mIFT46 mRNA in primary chondrocytes modulated the expression of certain genes related to skeletogenesis. Additionally Northern blotting analysis indicated that mIFT46 is also expressed well before chondrogenesis during embryonic mouse development. To explore the role of IFT46 during early development, we used antisense morpholinos to deplete the zebrafish ortholog of IFT46 protein (zIFT46). Firstly, we found that zIFT46 is expressed at a very early stage of zebrafish development. Secondly, we observed morphological defects in embryos, such as dorsalization and tail duplication, as a consequence of zIFT46 knockdown. Thus our results taken together indicate that the ciliary protein IFT46 has a specific function both in chondrocytes and during the early development of vertebrates. Cell Culture—The MC615 cell line was characterized previously (21Mallein-Gerin F. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3289-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the studies with freshly isolated chondrocytes, embryonic mouse chondrocytes were extracted from the ventral part of the rib cages of 17.5 days post coitum mice, as described (22Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Zhou G. Metsaranta M. Vuorio E. De Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The MC615 cells and rib chondrocytes were maintained in 1:1 high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% FBS and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all products from Amersham Biosciences-Invitrogen) on Corning dishes. Cultured rib chondrocytes were designated P0 after their isolation and P1 after their first passage. For the different experiments, MC615 cells and embryonic rib chondrocytes were grown for the indicated days in 1% FBS-supplemented medium and treated with BMP-2 (0-400 ng/ml). Recombinant human BMP-2 was produced and purified by Wyeth (Cambridge, MA). The culture medium supplemented or not with BMP-2 was replaced each day. Zebrafish—Zebrafishes (a cross between AB and Tübingen) were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (23Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 4th. University of Oregon Press, Portland, OR2000Google Scholar). Morpholino and mRNA Microinjections—Morpholinos (labeled with fluorescein) were designed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Gene Tools): zIFT46-MO (5′-GGTGCTCTGCTTCTGCCTACCCGTC-3′) hybridizes with zIFT46 mRNA from position -25 to -1 relative to the start codon. We used the same sequence with five mismatches (underlined) as negative control: 5mis-MO (5′-GGTCCTGTGCTTGTGCCTAGCCCTC-3′). Morpholinos were injected (5-10 nl) into 1-4 cell stage embryos at 1 mm concentration in Danieau buffer (58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mm Ca(NO3)2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). For rescue experiments, full-length zIFT46 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from zebrafish embryos using the following sense (5′-ATGATGGGATCCACCATGTCAGGTTATGCT-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGATGCTCGAGTCAGTCCAGAGTGAGTCT-3′) primers and then cloned between BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of the pCS2+ vector for in vitro transcription (SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ kit, Ambion). After NotI linearization, the reaction was performed using 1 μg of plasmid template as indicated by the manufacturers. RNAs were micro-injected at a 100 ng/μl concentration in nuclease-free water. RNA Isolation—Total RNAs from MC615 cells and embryonic rib chondrocytes were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNAs were isolated from (i) rib cages of 2-day-old-mice, (ii) 8.5-16.5 days post coitum mouse embryos, and (iii) different mouse adult tissues, as described previously (24Bluteau G. Gouttenoire J. Conrozier T. Mathieu P. Vignon E. Richard M. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 247-258PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos or tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered with a mortar and pestle, homogenized in lysis buffer containing 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. After phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation, pellets were treated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K until complete dissolution. RNA was then purified by ultracentrifugation on a cesium trifluoroacetate cushion. Total RNAs from zebrafish embryos were extracted at different developmental stages using a similar method except that RNAs were not treated with proteinase K and were purified in a cesium chloride gradient (25Arnaud E.

Differential Display RT-PCR—PCR-based differential screening was performed essentially as previously described (24Bluteau G. Gouttenoire J. Conrozier T. Mathieu P. Vignon E. Richard M. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 247-258PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). Total RNAs extracted from MC615 cells were digested with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. For RT, a 40-μl reaction contained 500 ng of total RNA, 1 μm oligo(dT12VN) primers (V represents A, G, or C and N represents A, T, G, or C), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 320 μm dNTPs. Samples were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min then at 42 °C for 5 min prior to addition of 400 units of SuperScript II-RNase H- (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 42 °C. The reverse transcriptase was then heat-inactivated for 15 min at 70 °C. For PCR amplification, each 20-μl reaction contained a 2 μl of RT aliquot. Different subsets of oligo(dT12VN) and arbitrary primers were tested to enrich the diversity of differentially expressed mRNA (27Sokolov B.P. Prockop D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR reactions were performed with 5 units of Ampli-Taq® DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in the presence of 0.2 μm oligo(dT12VN) primers, 0.2 μm arbitrary primers, 2 μm dNTPs, and 1 μl of [α-35S]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1200 Ci/mmol). Amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp 2400 PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Following an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C, amplification consisted of 40 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 2 min at 42 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on a 6% DNA sequencing gel, which was exposed for autoradiography after drying. The selected bands were excised from the gel, and DNA was eluted. The eluted cDNAs were re-amplified by PCR by using the same subset of oligo(dT12VN) and arbitrary primers, cloned into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO vector according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Invitrogen) and sequenced (Genome Express SA, Meylan, France).

In parallel, controls without reverse transcriptase were performed to demonstrate the specificity of the reactions (data not shown). Quantitative PCR were performed using the iQ SYBR Green PCR Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a total volume of 20 μl with 4 μl of 10-fold-diluted cDNA, in the presence of 300 nm of specific primers published by other authors (25Arnaud E.

Reactions were carried out in an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) in triplicate, using the following conditions: an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C and an extension step of 10 s at 72 °C. Levels of gene expression in each sample were determined by using the comparative Ct method with Gapdh and zHistone 2A genes as endogenous controls for mouse cells and zebrafish embryos, respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—Equal amounts (20 μg) of total RNAs were size-fractionated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose-formamide gels and transferred to nylon N-membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Northern hybridization was carried out as previously described (21Mallein-Gerin F. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3289-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with a mIFT46-specific probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Full-length mIFT46 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned into BamHI-XhoI sites of pBluescript SK+ vector using the following primers: sense (5′-catcatggatccacgatggctgataacagc-3′) and antisense (5′-TTCGAACTCGAGGATGAAAGTCAGTGTCTC-3′). A 462-bp EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment corresponding to mIFT46 cDNA was used as a probe. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridizations on limb sections of 17.5-day post coitum mice were performed as described (29Mallein-Gerin F. Gouttenoire J. Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 100: 105-108PubMed Google Scholar, 30Le Guellec D. Mallein-Gerin F. Treilleux I. Bonaventure J. Peysson P. Herbage D. Histochem. J. 1994; 26: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Probes corresponding to mouse cDNAs encoding α1(II) procollagen and α1(X) procollagen were previously described (16Valcourt U. Gouttenoire J. Moustakas A. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33545-33558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A 445-bp PvuII restriction fragment of the pBluescript SK+ plasmid was routinely used as a control probe for nonspecific hybridization (data not shown). Whole mount in situ hybridizations in zebrafish embryos were performed using antisense and sense (as a negative control) digoxigenin-labeled Riboprobes, as described before (31Thisse C. Thisse B. Schilling T.F. Postlethwait J.H. Development. 1993; 119: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate a zIFT46 DNA probe, a zIFT46 cDNA sequence was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from zebrafish embryos. The amplicon was then cloned into a pBluescript SK+ plasmid to synthesize Riboprobes. The zCol2a1 and the zeve1 Riboprobes were gifts of Dr. Y. Yan (University of Oregon) and Dr. B. Thisse (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France), respectively. siRNA and PCR Array Analysis—Two siRNA oligonucleotides for mIFT46 were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO): siRNA IFT46 #1 (5′-UCAAGAACUCCCAGCAUUUUU-3′) and siRNA IFT46 #2 (5′-CGUAUGAUCCUGCCGACUAUU-3′). The siRNAs were independently transfected into P1 chondrocytes by using the Human Chondrocyte Nucleofector kit (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Program U-24). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of electroporation buffer with 250 nm of each siRNA. An siRNA directed against the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and provided with the siRNA test-kit (Amaxa) was used as control. After electroporation, cells were immediately transferred into 6-well plates in 1:1 high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% FBS. After 24 h of culture, total RNAs were extracted as described above and were analyzed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) to determine RNA quality and quantity. PCR array analysis was performed by using 450 ng of total RNA of each sample and the RT2 Profiler™ PCR array mouse osteogenesis (SuperArray, Bioscience Corp.), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Levels of gene expression were determined with the comparative Ct method. The -fold change of gene expression in mIFT46 knocked-down chondrocytes compared with control GFP siRNA-nucleofected chondrocytes was calculated with Microsoft Excel software. Candidate genes with -fold changes >3.5 were selected. Similar results were obtained using independently either IFT46 #1 (Fig. 7) or IFT46 #2 (data not shown) siRNAs. Construction of Recombinant Adenovirus-transducing mIFT46—A recombinant adenovirus carrying a full-length cDNA encoding mIFT46 was constructed, amplified, and titrated by Genethon (Evry, France). Expression of mIFT46 was under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Mouse chondrocytes were infected with this adenovirus preparation as previously described (16Valcourt U. Gouttenoire J. Moustakas A. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33545-33558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Production and Purification of Recombinant IFT46 Protein—For the heterologous production of mIFT46 protein in bacteria, full-length mIFT46 cDNA was cloned into a pT7.7 vector harboring a His6 tag sequence between PstI and HindIII restriction sites. First, mIFT46 coding sequence was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from mouse chondrocytes, by using the sense (5′-CATCATGGATCCATGGCTGATAACAGCAGT-3′) and the antisense (5′-ATGATGCTGCAGGATGAAAGTCAGTGTCTC-3′) primers, and the amplicon was cloned into BamHI and PstI restriction sites of the pT7.7 vector. The resulting construct expresses C-terminal His-tagged mIFT46. Recombined plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The mIFT46 protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β d-galactopyranoside and purified from the insoluble fraction after solubilization in 8 m urea by metal chelating affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Qiagen). Preparation and Affinity Purification of Antibodies—Anti-IFT46 serum was prepared by immunizing rabbits (IUT A-Lyon 1, France) with the IFT46 recombinant protein. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, antibodies were affinity-purified over a column of IFT46, which was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot Analysis, and Immunofluorescence—Rib chondrocytes freshly isolated from 17.5-day post coitum mice were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by the BCA protein assay (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein (300 μg) were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of antibodies to IFT46 or rabbit IgG. Protein-G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 75 min. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20), and once with TBS (TBS-T without Tween). The immunoprecipitation products were dissolved in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and run on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots were probed with affinity-purified antibodies to IFT46 followed by goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Bound antibodies were detected on x-ray films using a Bio-Rad Immun-star chemiluminescent substrate. Indirect immunofluorescence detection was performed as previously described (17Valcourt U. Gouttenoire J. Aubert-Foucher E. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Double staining was obtained using polyclonal anti-IFT46, monoclonal anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibodies (Sigma), and anti-rabbit IgG Cy2-coupled (Chemicon) anti-mouse IgG Cy3-coupled (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as secondary antibodies. Identification of mIFT46 as a BMP-2-sensitive Gene in Chondrocytes—MC615 chondrocytes were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 1% FBS alone or supplemented with 50 or 100 ng/ml BMP-2 to modulate their phenotype. In these conditions we previously reported that BMP-2 favors chondrogenic expression and promotes hypertrophic maturation and osteoblastic-like differentiation of chondrocytes (16Valcourt U. Gouttenoire J. Moustakas A. Herbage D. Mallein-Gerin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33545-33558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Total RNA extracts from these cells were used for differential display PCR to identify BMP-2-responsive genes in MC615 cells. By using dT12VC and DD57 primers (Table 1), we isolated a cDNA fragment, which appeared only in the display of mRNA from MC615 cells treated with 50 or 100 ng/ml BMP-2 (data not shown). Sequencing of the corresponding fragment identified it as an mRNA encoding a hypothetical protein previously named ORF-2 (accession number AJ249981) and found by an expressed sequence tag based in silico gene cloning (32O'Brien K.P. Tapia-Paez I. Stahle-Backdahl M. Kedra D. Dumanski J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RT-PCR using specific primers derived from ORF-2 sequence confirmed that this gene is up-regulated by BMP-2 in MC615 chondrocytes (Fig. 1A) as well as in primary embryonic mouse chondrocytes (Fig. 1B). Total RNAs were also extracted from rib cage of 2-day-old mice. This tissue undergoes endochondral ossification and, therefore, was"
https://openalex.org/W2079192580,"A 15-amino acid long selenopeptide (15SeP) was recently reported to possess nearly the same catalytic activity as glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by glutathione (Sun, Y., Li, T. Y., Chen, H., Zhang, K., Zheng, K. Y., Mu, Y., Yan, G. L., Li, W., Shen, J. C., and Luo, G. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 37235–37240). Such a finding is startling considering the high efficiency of the natural enzyme and the modest catalytic properties of most short peptides. As 15SeP had been subjected only to limited chemical characterization, we prepared it by a new route involving selenocysteine-mediated native chemical ligation. High resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the reaction product, whereas circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that 15SeP assumes a random coil conformation in solution. Although low levels of peroxidase activity were detectable under standard assay conditions, the peptide is >5 orders of magnitude less active than native Gpx. Our observations are incompatible with claims ascribing remarkable catalytic properties to 15SeP and suggest that the efficiency of Gpx derives from its well defined three-dimensional structure.

Glutathione peroxidase (Gpx 2The abbreviations used are: Gpx, glutathione peroxidase; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization.; EC 1.11.1.9) is a naturally occurring selenoenzyme that protects cells against oxidative damage by organic hydroperoxides (1Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 2Arthur J.R. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological efficacy of the enzyme derives from catalytic efficiency approaching the diffusion limit for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by glutathione (3Flohé L. Loschen G. Günzler W.A. Eichele E. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The enzyme possesses an essential selenocysteine at its active site, and a catalytic cycle involving interconversion of the selenol (Fig. 1, ESeH), selenenic acid (ESeOH), and selenenylsulfide (ESeSR) forms of the protein has been proposed (4Ganther H.E. Kraus R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Structural (5Ren B. Huang W. Åkesson B. Ladenstein R. J. Mol.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studies suggest that the enzyme enhances the nucleophilicity of the selenol via a hydrogen bonding network with Nϵ1 of Trp148 and Nϵ2 of Gln70 and the helical dipole of the α1 helix. However, many questions remain about its detailed mechanism of action. Alternate catalytic cycles have been suggested (7Wendel, A. (1980) in Enzymatic Basis of Detoxication (Jakoby, W. B., ed) Vol. 1, pp. 333–353, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar), and the functional roles of other amino acids in the active site have yet to be elucidated. A variety of selenium-containing compounds mimic Gpx activity. For example, the enzymes subtilisin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glutathione S-transferase have been successfully converted into peroxidases by introducing selenocysteine into their active sites (8Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5647-5648Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 9Boschi-Muller S. Muller S. Van Dorsselaer A. Böck A. Branlant G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A protein environment is not required for antioxidant activity, however, and many low molecular weight organoselenium compounds have been shown to promote peroxide reduction (11Mugesh G. Singh H.B. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2000; 29: 347-357Crossref Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 12Mugesh G. du Mont W.W. Sies H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2125-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). One such compound, 2-phenyl-1,2-benzoisoselenazol-3-(2H)-one, commonly known as ebselen, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, and cytoprotective properties (13Sies H. Masumoto H. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These have spurred efforts to optimize ebselen and to design new Gpx mimics for potential therapeutic applications. Although significant peroxidase activity has been achieved in some cases, the efficiency of Gpx mimics generally lags far behind that of the natural enzyme. Given this, a recent study describing a 15-amino acid long selenocysteine-containing peptide with activity similar to that of native Gpx attracted our attention (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Luo and co-workers (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prepared a series of glutathione-binding peptides by phage display and subsequently optimized their structures by computer modeling. Chemical conversion of the C-terminal serine to a selenocysteine afforded molecules that were claimed to have a homodimeric, diselenide-cross-linked, β-hairpin structure, with specific binding sites for glutathione and peroxide. More significantly, 15SeP, the most active variant, reportedly promoted the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides by glutathione, with apparent second-order rate constants (kcat/Km(GSH) and kcat/Km(H2O2)) in excess of 106 m–1 s–1. The properties accorded to 15SeP are astonishing, the more so in light of the characteristic failure of small peptides to catalyze reactions with the rates and selectivities of full-length enzymes (15Matthews B.W. Craik C.S. Neurath H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4103-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Corey M.J. Corey E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11428-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because only rudimentary chemical characterization of the selenopeptide had been reported, we resynthesized 15SeP by an unambiguous route. Upon re-examination, we found no evidence that it adopts a defined conformation in solution, nor does 15SeP possess significant Gpx activity in our hands. Rather, our results indicate that the privileged microenvironment of the Gpx active site (5Ren B. Huang W. Åkesson B. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 869-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) enormously enhances the intrinsic reactivity of the selenium prosthetic group. Materials—Buffers were prepared with ultrapure water. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Fluka, or Acros. Glutathione reductase from bakers' yeast and Gpx from bovine erythrocytes were obtained from Sigma. Peptide Synthesis—The protected peptide t-butoxycarbonyl-WPFLRHNVYGRPRA (14P) was assembled in a stepwise fashion on a 0.1-mmol scale on commercially available trityl resin preloaded with alanine using an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Standard HBTU/HOBt (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole) activation protocols for Fmoc chemistry (FastMoc® protocol, Applied Biosystems) (17Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar) were used. Amino acid side chains were protected as follows: Arg(Pbf) (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl), Asn(trityl), His(trityl), Trp(t-butoxycarbonyl), and Tyr(t-butoxy). After the Fmoc group of the last coupled amino acid was deprotected, the peptide was capped with tert-butyl pyrocarbonate (0.4 m, 10 eq) in N-methylpyrrolidone containing N,N′-diisopropylethylamine (10 eq). Following completion of the reaction as judged by the trinitrobenzene sulfonate test (18Hancock W.S. Battersby J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), the resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone and then with dichloromethane. The protected peptide was cleaved from the solid support by stirring in 10 ml of dichloromethane/AcOH/trifluoroethanol (3:1:1) for 2.5 h. After removal of the resin by filtration, hexane (350 ml) was added, and the solvent was evaporated. The recovered solid was resuspended in a small amount of dioxane, flash-frozen, and lyophilized. The crude protected peptide was dissolved in a 2:1 mixture of N,N′-dimethylformamide/dichloromethane (0.02 m) and converted to a thioester by adding PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate; 3 eq) in the presence of p-acetamidothiophenol (ArSH; 3 eq) and N,N′-diisopropylethylamine (3 eq) at 0 °C (19von Eggelkraut-Gottanka R. Klose A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Beyermann M. Tetrahedron Lett. 2003; 44: 3551-3554Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, and the solvent was evaporated after 3 h. A small amount of water was added to the crude mixture, which was then lyophilized. The crude thioester was deprotected with 10 ml of trifluoroacetic-acid/triisopropylsilane/H2O (95:2.5:2.5) for 2.5 h at room temperature and subsequently precipitated by adding at least 8 volumes of cold diethyl ether. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, the ether was decanted, and the trituration procedure was repeated twice. The crude thioester was purified by preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a Macherey-Nagel C18 column (250 mm × 21 mm × 100 Å, 7 μm), eluting with a linear gradient of 5–50% solvent A (acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) in solvent B (water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 110 min (flow rate of 10 ml/min). Under these conditions, the desired thioester, 14P-SAr, eluted with a retention time of ∼70 min (120 mg, corresponding to a 50% yield based on the initial resin loading): electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, [M + H]+, 1916.973 expected and 1916.972 measured; and analytical RP-HPLC (Macherey-Nagel C8 column, 250 mm × 4.6 mm × 300 Å, 5 μm; eluted with a linear gradient of 5–60% solvent A in solvent B over 45 min), Rt = 28.3 min. Selenocysteine-mediated Ligation—The thioester 14P-SAr (12 mg, 5 μmol, 1 eq) and selenocystine (1.0 mg, 3 μmol, 0.6 eq) were mixed under nitrogen in 2.5 ml of degassed 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 6 m guanidinium chloride and 5% thiophenol. The reaction was complete after 18 h as judged by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Chromatography was performed with linear gradients of CH3CN and H2O containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a Waters Atlantis dC18-3 column (3 × 100 mm), and masses were determined at an electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer. After the addition of 25% AcOH (1.5 ml) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.75 ml), the mixture was extracted four times with diethyl ether to remove excess thiophenol. The aqueous solution was centrifuged and injected onto a preparative Macherey-Nagel C8 HPLC column (250 mm × 21 mm × 300 Å, 7 μm). The selenopeptide 15SeP was eluted with a linear gradient of 5–50% solvent A in solvent B over 110 min as the diselenide dimer (6.2 mg, 25% yield; Rt =∼54 min): high resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), [M + H]+, 3836.792 calculated and 3836.785 measured; analytical RP-HPLC (C8; 5–60% solvent A in solvent B over 45 min), Rt = 29.6 min. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded using an Aviv Model 202 spectropolarimeter. Measurements were performed with 60 μm 15SeP in the presence and absence of glutathione (1 mm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaN3 at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded 10 times in 0.5-nm steps with a 1-s averaging time and corrected for the corresponding solvent background. Fluorescence Titration—The interaction of glutathione with 15SeP was assessed by fluorescence quenching using λex = 295 nm and λem = 345 nm as described previously (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K.

Glutathione Peroxidase Activity—The catalytic activities of Gpx and 15SeP were determined by the method of Wendel (20Wendel A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathione (0.5–8 mm) was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with either 60 μm 15SeP or 0.6–6 nm Gpx in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 250 μm NADPH, and 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of H2O2. Initial rates were determined by monitoring the disappearance of NADPH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6220 m–1 cm–1) and were corrected for the background reaction measured in the absence of either 15SeP or Gpx. Luo and co-workers (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prepared the selenopeptide 15SeP from its serine homolog via a two-step chemical modification procedure (Fig. 2a). The peptide Trp-Pro-Phe-Leu-Arg-His-Asn-Val-Tyr-Gly-Arg-Pro-Arg-Ala-Ser was first treated with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to convert the C-terminal serine into a sulfonate ester. Displacement of the sulfonate with hydrogen selenide then afforded 15SeP (Trp-Pro-Phe-Leu-Arg-His-Asn-Val-Tyr-Gly-Arg-Pro-Arg-Ala-Sec). The final product, which was isolated as a diselenide dimer, was purified only by centrifugation and dialysis. Further chemical characterization was meager at best: the selenium content of 15SeP was determined by an indirect colorimetric assay, and no HPLC or mass spectroscopic data were provided to document identity or purity. We resynthesized 15SeP by a straightforward route based on selenocysteine-mediated native chemical ligation (Fig. 2b) (21Quaderer R. Sewing A. Hilvert D. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2001; 84: 1197-1206Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Hondal R.J. Nilsson B.L. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem.

The 14-amino acid long peptide Trp-Pro-Phe-Leu-Arg-His-Asn-Val-Tyr-Gly-Arg-Pro-Arg-Ala was prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and cleaved from the resin in protected form. Following activation of its C terminus as a thioester (19von Eggelkraut-Gottanka R. Klose A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Beyermann M. Tetrahedron Lett. 2003; 44: 3551-3554Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), side chain-protecting groups were removed, and the peptide was purified by RP-HPLC. The deprotected thioester reacted cleanly with selenocysteine under denaturing conditions in the presence of thiophenol to give 15SeP. The selenopeptide was isolated as the diselenide in 25% yield after RP-HPLC purification. As shown in Fig. 3, the synthetic material is >98% pure. High resolution MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 3, inset) confirmed that the product is the desired diselenide of 15SeP ([M + H]+, 3836.792 calculated and 3836.785 measured). The small contaminant visible at 29 min in the chromatogram has a mass that corresponds to the mixed diselenide between 15SeP and selenocysteine ([M + H]+, 2086.1 expected and 2086.0 measured), which should have a reactivity profile like that of the homodimer. Luo and co-workers (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) originally proposed a two-stranded, antiparallel, β-hairpin structure for 15SeP sharing “similarity with the active central structure of Gpx”, but presented no corroborating biophysical evidence. We therefore investigated the conformation of the selenopeptide by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, 15SeP is a random coil in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), as expected for a peptide of this size. The addition of high glutathione concentrations leads to a shift in the peak minimum from 203 to ∼208 nm, suggesting either the induction of some secondary structure or aggregation. Nevertheless, attempts to quantify the interaction by fluorescence quenching afforded only small changes in the initial signal (<4%) and failed to confirm the published association constant of 3.1 × 104 m–1 (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ability of 15SeP to promote the reduction of hydrogen peroxide by glutathione was monitored by a standard coupled assay (20Wendel A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Oxidized glutathione produced in the course of the reaction was catalytically reduced in situ by NADPH and glutathione reductase. As a positive control, commercial bovine Gpx was assayed in parallel with the selenopeptide. As shown in Fig. 5a, saturation kinetics were observed when glutathione was held constant at 2.0 mm and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was varied. For Gpx, the data afforded apparent kcat and kcat/Km(H2O2) values of 160 ± 10 s–1 and (2.4 ± 0.4) × 107 m–1 s–1, respectively. Under identical conditions, the 15SeP selenopeptide is essentially inactive, but at peptide concentrations that are 104-fold greater than those of Gpx, modest peroxidase activity was detected. The steady-state parameters for 15SeP (kcat = 0.0017 ± 0.0001 s–1 and kcat/Km(H2O2) = 11 ± 1.0 m–1 s–1) are >105 times smaller than the values we obtained for authentic Gpx and >105 times smaller than those reported by Luo and co-workers (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with a report that the Km value for glutathione is >10 mm (24Flohé L. Brand I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 191: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), only slight curvature was observed in analogous experiments in which the concentration of glutathione was varied and hydrogen peroxide was held constant at 200 μm (Fig. 5b). The apparent second-order rate constant kcat/Km(GSH) was therefore estimated from data obtained at low glutathione concentration. Again, however, the value for the selenopeptide (0.46 m–1 s–1) is >5 orders of magnitude smaller than the value for Gpx (9.3 × 104 m–1 s–1) and 1 million-fold smaller than that reported by Luo and co-workers (14Sun Y. Li T.Y. Chen H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Li W. Shen J.C. Luo G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37235-37240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The basis for the enormous discrepancy between our results and the previously published data is unclear, but we are forced to conclude that selenopeptide 15SeP is an extremely poor Gpx mimic. The lack of significant 15SeP peroxidase activity is in keeping with previous findings that short peptides (<30 amino acids) typically fail to match the rates and selectivities of natural enzymes (15Matthews B.W. Craik C.S. Neurath H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4103-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Corey M.J. Corey E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11428-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There are few reliable examples of efficient peptide catalysis (25Miller S.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and previous claims attributing extraordinary capabilities to such molecules (26Atassi M.Z. Manshouri T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Science. 1990; 248: 1544-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have invariably been proven mistaken upon careful reinvestigation (16Corey M.J. Corey E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11428-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Wells J.A. Fairbrother W.J. Otlewski J. Laskowski Jr., M. Burnier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Efficient catalysis generally requires accurate placement of functional groups within a precisely defined three-dimensional structure, something that is difficult to achieve with short peptide sequences. Comparison of Gpx and 15SeP indicates that the inherent reactivity of selenocysteine is enormously enhanced when the prosthetic group is placed within the active site of the enzyme. The magnitude of this activation is similar to that observed for the reactive nucleophile in the catalytic triad of serine proteases (30Carter P. Wells J.A. Nature (Lond.). 1988; 332: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1964307864,"It has previously been shown that incubation of mammalian cell cytosolic extracts with the protein kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 results in enhanced transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine to proteins. These findings were interpreted as demonstrating tyrphostin stimulation of a novel type of protein carboxyl methyltransferase. We find here, however, that tyrphostin A25 addition to mouse heart cytosol incubated with S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine or S-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]methionine stimulates the labeling of small molecules in addition to proteins. Base treatment of both protein and small molecule fractions releases volatile radioactivity, suggesting labile ester-like linkages of the labeled methyl group. Production of both the base-volatile product and labeled protein occurs with tyrphostins A25, A47, and A51, but not with thirteen other tyrphostin family members. These active tyrphostins all contain a catechol moiety and are good substrates for recombinant and endogenous catechol-O-methyltransferase. Inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase activity with tyrphostin AG1288 prevents both base-volatile product formation and protein labeling from methyl-labeled S-adenosylmethionine in heart, kidney, and liver, but not in testes or brain extracts. These results suggest that the incorporation of methyl groups into protein follows a complex pathway initiated by the methylation of select tyrphostins by endogenous catechol-O-methyltransferase. We suggest that the methylated tyrphostins are further modified in the cell extract and covalently attached to cellular proteins. The presence of endogenous catechols in cells suggests that similar reactions can also occur in vivo.

S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent protein methylation is a common post-translational modification, occurring at N-terminal amino, arginine, lysine, modified aspartyl, and C-terminal carboxyl residues (1Walsh C.T. Posttranslational Modification of Proteins: Expanding Nature's Inventory. Roberts and Company, Englewood, CO2006: 121-149Google Scholar). These reactions not only create additional diversity in protein amino acids but also provide opportunities for biological regulation by reversible modifications (2Paik W.K. Paik D.C. Kim S.

In 1999, Bilodeau and Béliveau (10Bilodeau D. Béliveau R. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) demonstrated that S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet) 2The abbreviations used are: [3H]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine; [14C]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]methionine; COMT, catechol-O-methyltransferase.2The abbreviations used are: [3H]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine; [14C]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-[methyl-14C]methionine; COMT, catechol-O-methyltransferase.-dependent protein methylation in rat kidney cytosolic extracts is greatly stimulated by the addition of the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A25 and the protein phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate. These results suggested a regulatory interplay between protein phosphorylation and methylation systems. We were able to confirm these results in mouse kidney cytosol (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We were also able to show that tyrphostin A25, in the presence or absence of vanadate, stimulates protein methylation in mouse heart cytosol, but not in testes or brain cytosol (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Of a variety of tyrphostins tested only the A25 and A47 derivatives were active in stimulating protein methylation in kidney cytosol. Analysis of a 3H-methylated 15-kDa polypeptide indicated that the radioactivity was not due to protein lysine or arginine methylation. The radioactivity was volatilized after base treatment, suggesting that the modification is a type of carboxyl methylation, but is not due to the known protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase or C-terminal carboxyl methyltransferases (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These results suggested that tyrphostin A25 could stimulate a novel signaling pathway involving methylation. However, the identity of the methylated substrate and methyltransferase remained elusive. The tyrphostins are a family of synthetic small molecule inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases based on the naturally occurring inhibitor erbstatin (12Levitzki A. Mishani E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Levitzki A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3275-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Due to the importance of kinases in many cellular signaling pathways, including those leading to cell proliferation and cancer, the tyrphostins have been extensively studied as possible therapeutic agents (12Levitzki A. Mishani E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Blackledge G. J. Urol. 2003; 170: S77-S83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Traxler P. Bold G. Buchdunger E. Caravatti G. Furet P. Manley P. O'Reilly T. Wood J. Zimmermann J. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Tyrphostins have also been shown to have inhibitory activities toward adenylate cyclase (16Jaleel M. Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8247-8255Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and a variety of GTP-utilizing enzymes (17Wolbring G. Hollenberg M.D. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22470-22472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significant up-regulation of methylation by tyrphostin A25 may thus be highlighting new roles of methylation in signal transduction pathways. We sought to further understand tyrphostin-stimulated methylation in mouse heart cytosol by identifying the methyl-accepting proteins and the specific methyltransferases involved. In the course of this work, we discovered that the methyltransferase responsible is catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) acting on the tyrphostin molecule itself. We show here that a cellular modification of the methylated species can then be covalently attached to various cytosolic polypeptides mimicking a typical protein methylation reaction. Although catechol-protein adducts are known in the literature, the addition of methylated catechols has not been previously observed (18Schweigert N. Zehnder A.J.B. Eggen R.I.L. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 19Bindoli A. Rigobello M.P. Deeble D.J. Free Radic. Biol.

The reactions described here may represent a novel cellular pathway for methylated catechols. Chemicals—All tyrphostins were obtained from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO to a stock concentration of 1 mm. Catechol (pyrocatechol, 1,2-benzenediol) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and brought up in water to a stock concentration of 1mm. Cytosolic Extract Preparation and Methylation Assay—Wild-type mice were used that had a genetic background of ∼50% 129svJae and 50% C57BL/6 (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mice were weaned at 20 days and maintained on a NIH-31 Modified Mouse/Rat Diet #7013 on a 12-h dark/light cycle. 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES buffer (adjusted to pH 7.2 with Tris base) at 0 °C was added to harvested organs (5 ml/g wet weight). Homogenates were made in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the recommended concentration of Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science) using a tight-fitting Teflon pestle rotating at 310 rpm for 1 min. Lysates (0.5-1 ml) were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 50 min in 1.5-ml plastic microcentrifuge tubes, and supernatants were collected and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentrations (5-20 mg/ml) were determined after precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid using the Lowry method with bovine serum albumin standards. Supernatants of the tissue lysate (30 or 60 μg of protein) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 30 μl with either 1 μl of 0.30 mm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine ([14C]AdoMet, Amersham Biosciences, 50-60 mCi/mmol, in dilute sulfuric acid, pH 2.5-3.5) or 3 μ1 of 12 μm [3H]AdoMet (Amersham Biosciences, 70-81 Ci/mmol, in dilute HCl:ethanol (9:1), pH 2-2.5) in 150 mm HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris base. Tyrphostins (in Me2SO) were added when indicated to a final concentration of 100 μm (10% Me2SO final concentration). For controls, Me2SO was used at 10% final concentration. SDS-PAGE—An equal volume of SDS gel sample buffer (180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) was added to samples, which were then heated at 100 °C for 3 min. Samples were then electrophoresed for 14 h at 8 mA followed by 4 h at 12 mA on a 1.5-mm thick gel containing 4.3% acrylamide, 0.15% N,N-methylenebisacrylamide in a 2-cm stacking gel and 12.1% acrylamide, 0.42% N,N-methylenebisacrylamide in a 10.5-cm resolving gel. Gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 24 h and de-stained with 10% methanol, 5% acetic acid for 48 h. After a photograph was taken, gels were treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h and rinsed in water for 20 min. Gels were dried at 80 °C for 2 h under vacuum and exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film at -80 °C to obtain fluorographs. Vapor-diffusion Assay for Base-labile Methyl Groups—An assay for quantitating radiolabeled methyl groups in ester linkages has been developed based on the detection of volatile radioactivity (as methanol) after ester hydrolysis by base treatment (22Bergo M.O.

This assay will also detect methyl groups in non-ester linkages where base treatment results in methanol or other volatile derivatives of the methyl group. For a typical 30-μl reaction mixture, 2 μl is first taken for determination of total radioactivity with 5 ml of Safety-Solve Complete Counting Mixture (Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL). NaOH (28 μl of a 2 n solution) was then added to the remaining 28 μl of the reaction mixture. A total of 40 μl of this mixture was then spotted onto an accordion-folded strip (8.5 cm by 3.5 cm) of thick filter paper (Bio-Rad 1650962) and wedged into the neck of a 20-ml vial containing 5 ml of scintillation Fluor. After capping, the samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The filter paper, containing the non-volatile radioactive components, was then removed, and the vials were recapped and counted in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. COMT Assay—Recombinant porcine liver COMT was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and brought up in 1% bovine serum albumin to a stock concentration of 0.01 unit/μl (one unit produces 1 nmol of total O-methylated products from 3,4-dihydroxyacetophenone per hour at pH 7.6, 37 °C). This enzyme was assayed in a final volume of 50 μl by modifications of previously described methods (25Chen J. Lipska B.K. Halim N. Ma Q.D. Matsumoto M. Melhem S. Kolachana B.S. Hyde T.M. Herman M.M.

Dispos. 2003; 31: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained COMT at 0.001 unit/μl in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 500 μm dithiothreitol with 1.25 μm [3H]AdoMet and 100 μm of methyl-accepting substrate. After 30 min at 37 °C, 50 μl of water was added followed by 100 μl of 2 n HCl and 200 μl of ethyl acetate. Samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 17,900 × g for 5 min. Finally, 100 μl of the top ethyl acetate layer was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid and counted for the 3H-methylated catechol product. Previous studies suggested that tyrphostin A25 greatly stimulates a potentially novel protein methylation reaction when added to mouse heart cytosolic extracts in the presence of [3H]AdoMet (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To identify and characterize the methylated polypeptides, we first compared the fractionation of 3H-labeled heart cytosolic proteins by size-exclusion chromatography for samples incubated with and without tyrphostin A25 (Fig. 1). When fractions were analyzed by total radioactivity, we found a large increase with tyrphostin in the labeling of protein fractions in the void volume eluting at 125 min and in the included volume eluting from 200 to 300 min (Fig. 1A and inset). Peaks corresponding to unreacted [3H]AdoMet were found as expected in the total volume eluting at ∼330-450 min. However, we were surprised to see a relatively large peak of radioactivity eluting between 510 and 570 min, after the total volume, suggesting an interaction of this material with the column resin. Significantly, this material was only detected in the tyrphostin-containing sample. To attempt to identify this material, we applied tyrphostin A25 to the column and observed (by its orange color) that it was adsorbed to the resin and was not eluted even in two column volumes of buffer. This result suggested that the late eluting peak at 510-570 min in the tyrphostin sample of Fig. 1A may be a modified form of tyrphostin. Previous analysis of tyrphostin-stimulated protein methylation suggested that the 3H-methyl groups were incorporated as methyl esters, because they could be detected as a volatile species, presumably [3H]methanol, following base hydrolysis (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We thus further analyzed the gel-filtration fractions for base-labile volatility (Fig. 1B). We found that a significant fraction (40%) of the radioactivity in the protein fractions eluting between 200 and 300 min was volatilized under these conditions. We also showed that ∼25% of the radioactivity in the late peak at 510-570 min could be volatilized after base treatment. These results suggest that the methylation stimulated by tyrphostin may be complex and that the products may include both proteins and tyrphostin or its derivatives. Significantly, we found that the total volatile radioactivity produced in all of the fractions of the tyrphostin-treated sample was much greater than that of the control sample (Fig. 1B). We thus realized that methylation stimulated by tyrphostin A25 could be assayed directly by analyzing the total production of base volatile radioactivity in a single reaction mixture. Following these results, we developed an assay where the reaction of cytosolic extracts, [14C]AdoMet, and tyrphostin could be monitored by detecting volatile radioactivity after base treatment in a vapor-diffusion assay. We validated this assay to show that it reflected the previously seen tyrphostin A25-stimulated formation of methylated proteins. We first asked whether the specificity for different tyrphostin derivatives seen in protein methylation (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S.

In Table 1, we show that stimulation of methylation is clearly seen in heart cytosol with tyrphostin A25 and A47, two derivatives previously shown to stimulate protein methylation in kidney cytosol (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Of the compounds previously shown to be inactive, we also found little or no stimulation in the vapor-diffusion assay (11Miranda T.B. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). We then tested additional tyrphostin derivatives with structural similarity to the active tyrphostins A25 and A47. We found that A51 was even more active than A25, but little or no activity was found for AG30 and B40 (Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of the effect of tyrphostin derivatives on methylation of heart cytosolic extracts with their activity as substrates for recombinant catechol-O-methyltransferase Open table in a new tab Analysis of the structures of the most active tyrphostin derivatives suggest the importance of three hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring present in A25 and A51. It is unclear, however, why A47 is more active than A23 or related compounds that also have two ring hydroxyl groups. We then asked if the specific tyrphostin dependence of protein labeling in heart cytosol corresponded to the results of the vapor-diffusion assay shown in Table 1. Using an SDS-PAGE assay, we observed only tyrphostins A25, A47, and A51 showed an increase in labeled peptide bands, consistent with the results of the vapor-diffusion assay (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Additionally, we observed a significant amount of radioactivity midway in the stacking gel of the tyrphostin A25 and A51 samples, suggesting the formation of labeled protein aggregates. Aggregated species can also be seen in the Coomassie-stained gel at the interface of the stacking and running gel for the A25 and A51 samples (Fig. 2, top panel). Smaller amounts of radiolabeled aggregates at these positions are also seen with the B tyrphostins. The results in Fig. 1 suggested the possibility that tyrphostin could stimulate small molecule as well as protein methylation. We thus paired the vapor-diffusion assay with a separation of protein and small molecules in the heart cytosolic reaction mixtures by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Fig. 3). This experiment showed that the bulk of the tyrphostin stimulation measured occurs in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble small molecule fraction (Fig. 3) and may represent the material eluting from 510 to 570 min in the gel-filtration analysis (Fig. 1). Given these results, we asked whether the tyrphostin molecules themselves were being methylated. All of the active tyrphostins contained adjacent aromatic hydroxyl groups (Table 1) that may be recognized and methylated by cellular COMT. Accordingly, we analyzed the ability of the tyrphostin derivates in Table 1 to serve as substrates for recombinant porcine COMT. As shown in Table 1, all tyrphostins containing catechol (two adjacent aromatic ring hydroxyl groups) or pyrogallol (three adjacent aromatic ring hydroxyl groups) structures were found to be good substrates for COMT. In fact, only four or the compounds shown in Table 1 were not substrates for COMT. Tyrphostins A1, A8, and A9 do not have catechol or pyrogallol structures. Significantly, tyrphostin AG1288 contains a nitrocatechol structure that is known in other compounds to be associated with strong inhibition of COMT activity (27Lautala P. Ulmanen I. Taskinen J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This result suggests that tyrphostin AG1288 may also be an inhibitor of COMT activity. We tested this possibility directly and confirmed that AG1288 was an effective inhibitor of recombinant COMT with catechol (1,2-benzenediol) or with tyrphostin substrates (Fig. 4). Our finding that tyrphostins A25, A47, and A51 are good COMT substrates and that AG1288 is an effective COMT inhibitor then provided us with an approach to determine if tyrphostin-stimulated methylation depends on COMT activity. We thus asked whether COMT inhibition in heart cytosol could inhibit the tyrphostin-dependent production of the base-volatile product. We found that COMT inhibition by AG1288 was sufficient to abolish the base-volatile product for all three active tyrphostin compounds (Fig. 5; see also Fig. 3). We then analyzed the effect of adding AG1288 to reaction mixtures analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 6, AG1288 prevented the tyrphostin A25-dependent methylation of heart and kidney cytosolic proteins, both as polypeptides within the running gel and as aggregated species in the stacking gel. These results indicate that the tyrphostin-stimulated methylation of both proteins and small molecules is dependent upon the activity of COMT, thus identifying the methyltransferase responsible for these modification reactions.FIGURE 6SDS-PAGE analysis of the effect of the tyrphostin AG1288 COMT inhibitor on tyrphostin A25-stimulated protein labeling from [3H]AdoMet in heart, kidney, testes, brain, and liver cytosol. Mouse cytosolic extracts were incubated with [3H]AdoMet and the polypeptides analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described in Fig. 2. Coomassie-stained gels are shown in the upper panel; a 2-month fluorograph is shown in the lower panel. Molecular weight markers, listed in Fig. 2, were electrophoresed in parallel lanes, and their positions are indicated on the left side of each gel panel. In each case lane 1 is a control without further additions and lane 2 is a control with the addition of 10% Me2SO. In the samples electrophoresed in lane 3 100 μm tyrphostin A25 was added; in lane 4 samples contained both 100 μm tyrphostin A25 and 100 μm of the COMT inhibitor tyrphostin AG1288.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We confirmed the presence of endogenous COMT in mouse tissue cytosolic extracts and the ability of the endogenous enzyme to methylate tyrphostin A25. In Table 2, we show AG1288-inhibitable COMT activity in mouse heart, kidney, testes, and liver cytosol using both tyrphostin A25 and catechol (1,2-benzenediol) as substrates. These results suggest that these extracts are capable of modifying tyrphostin for possible protein attachment and methyl group base-labilization.TABLE 2Endogenous COMT activity in mouse cytosolic extractsMethyl-accepting substrateTissueControlTyrphostin A25 (100 μm)Catechol (1,2-benzenediol) (100 μm)−AG1288 (100 μm)−AG1288 (100 μm)−AG1288 (100 μm)pmol/min/mg proteinHeart1.8 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.34.7 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.37.0 ± 1.82.8 ± 0.3Kidney0.8 ± 0.00.9 ± 0.08.1 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.138.4 ± 1.31.5 ± 0.0Testes0.6 ± 0.00.7 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.16.6 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.1Brain1.5 ± 0.01.7 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.3Liver1.3 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.119.4 ± 0.83.0 ± 0.355.2 ± 3.01.8 ± 0.1No extract2.0 ± 2.70.4 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab If this scenario is correct, we should be able to replicate the increased base-labile volatile radioactivity seen with [14C]AdoMet, tyrphostin, and cytosol by simply adding 3H-methylated tyrphostin A25 to the tissue extract. We thus sought to bypass COMT involvement by using pre-methylated tyrphostin A25 as the sole radioactive methyl donor. As shown in Fig. 7A, significant stimulation of base-labile volatile radioactivity is seen in both heart and kidney cytosolic extracts with 3H-methylated tyrphostin A25. In these experiments, we saw no effect of adding AG1288, confirming that the role of COMT was simply the initial methylation of tyrphostin. As a control, we show in Fig. 7B the expected dependence upon COMT activity when [14C]AdoMet is used as a radiolabel donor. We were then interested in asking how the methyl groups present as methyl ethers on tyrphostin became volatile after base treatment. We were able to demonstrate that the 3H-methylated tyrphostin A25 product resulting from incubation with recombinant COMT is not base-volatile (data not shown). This result indicates that there are additional steps occurring in the tissue cytosolic extracts that lead to the labilization of the methyl group. A possible chemical scheme for these reactions based on known catechol chemistry is presented in Fig. 8 and discussed below. In the experiments described so far, we have used heart and kidney cytosolic extracts to examine tyrphostin-stimulated methylation. We then wanted to see if similar reactions occurred in other tissues. In cytosolic extracts of brain, we observe no tyrphostin A25 stimulation of [3H]-or[14C]AdoMet-dependent methylation using SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6) or the vapor-diffusion assay (Fig. 7B). However, when 3H-methylated tyrphostin A25 was used in a vapor-diffusion assay, activity was seen (Fig. 7A). Given the near absence of COMT activity in brain cytosolic extracts (Table 2), these results suggest that methylation in brain may be similar to heart and kidney, but that the COMT required is found in the membrane rather than the cytosolic fraction (28Zhu B.T. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 29Tenhunen J. Ulmanan I. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A different situation was found in testes where we observed no tyrphostin stimulation of methylation in any of our assays (Figs. 6, 7A, and 7B), despite the fact that COMT activity was present (Table 2). Here, it appears that one or more factors responsible for subsequent steps leading to protein adduct formation and base-labile volatilization of the methyl group were lacking in testes. These results suggest that the full methylation pathway described here does not occur in all tissues. The situation with tyrphostin-stimulated methylation in liver cytosol is more complex. In Fig. 6, using SDS-PAGE analysis, we showed that tyrphostin A25 can stimulate protein methylation in liver cytosol but that it is only partially inhibited by the AG1288 COMT inhibitor. 3H-Methylated tyrphostin A25 could stimulate a moderate production of base-labile volatile radioactivity (Fig. 7A), but there appeared to be COMT-independent pathways as well, because tyrphostin AG1288 itself could increase such labeling (Fig. 7B), and AG1288 could at most only partially inhibit the volatile product formation stimulated by tyrphostin A25. We have not further characterized the liver enzymes involved in the COMT-independent pathway. In Fig. 8, we present a model that can explain the results obtained in this work. In select tissues, COMT can methylate tyrphostin derivatives that then can be modified further into derivatives that release the methyl group as a volatile product upon base treatment and that can be covalently attached to proteins. The pathway shown in the model is not meant to be exclusive; other pathways employing similar chemistries are possible (see the figure legend and discussion below). Tyrphostin Stimulation of Protein Methylation in Mammalian Cells—In the results presented above, we provide evidence that an apparent simple protein methylation event can originate from a more complex series of reactions. Although a methylation step is involved, it is not due to a protein methyltransferase but to COMT that methylates tyrphostin itself and the subsequent attachment of this species to proteins (Fig. 8). It is also possible that COMT can methylate tyrphostin-protein adducts directly. Additionally, what appears to be protein methyl ester formation is likely to reflect the base lability of methylated and oxidized tyrphostins (Fig. 8). The reaction scheme shown in Fig. 8 explains why tyrphostins A25 and A51 are most active in protein labeling. These are the only tyrphostin derivatives tested that contain three adjacent hydroxyl groups (pyrogallol structures) and that participate in the mechanism shown in Fig. 8. The tyrphostins containing two adjacent hydroxyl groups cannot be oxidized to the ortho-quinone once methylated by COMT (28Zhu B.T. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Werner P. Di Rocco A. Prikhojan A. Rempel N. Bottiglieri T. Bressman S. Yahr M.D. Brain Res. 2001; 893: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Zhu B.T. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 13: 343-353PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the pyrogallol derivatives may have a higher affinity for COMT (27Lautala P. Ulmanen I. Taskinen J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, why some activity is seen with tyrphostin A47, which does not have three hydroxyl groups. Catechols are known to form protein adducts and to lead to protein cross-linking, presumably through ortho-quinone intermediates (32Montine T.J. Farris D.B. Graham D.G. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Scheulen M. Wollenberg P. Bolt H.M. Kappus H. Remmer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Gottlieb A.J. Wurzel H.A. Blood. 1974; 43: 85-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation of methylated species in the stacking gel in our SDS-PAGE analysis is consistent with tyrphostin-dependent protein cross-linking. That such cross-linking is largely specific to tyrphostins A25 and A51 is explained by the chemistry described in Fig. 8 where oxidation to the ortho-quinone can occur after the methylation reaction. COMT and Tyrphostin Pharmacology—We have shown that a number of the commonly used tyrphostin protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors undergo methylation by COMT. We have also shown that tyrphostin AG1288 is a potent COMT inhibitor, consistent with its nitrocatechol structure (27Lautala P. Ulmanen I. Taskinen J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that COMT activity might attenuate or potentiate their kinase inhibitory action. Optimal kinase inhibition is generally seen with tyrphostins containing a 3,4-dihydroxylcatechol ring (35Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). For example, replacement of a hydroxyl group with a methoxy group on tyrphostin AG538 reduces its kinase inhibitor effect (36Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40442-40454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although catechol-containing tyrphostins are more active, they are generally less stable (see below) (36Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40442-40454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Levitzki A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Tyrphostins, including the species shown here to stimulate protein methylation, have been shown to have inhibitory effects on adenylate cyclase (16Jaleel M. Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8247-8255Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and enzymes that use GTP as a cofactor (17Wolbring G. Hollenberg M.D. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22470-22472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrphostins, including A23 and A25, have also been seen to effect cellular GSH levels, reactive oxygen species production, and glutamate-stimulated cell death (38Sagara Y. Ishige K. Tsai C. Maher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36204-36215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see if these effects may be linked to their stimulation of the reactions described in this study. The inherent reactivity of the catechol moiety present in most active tyrphostin compounds can lead to instability. For example, tyrphostin A23 (Table 1) breaks down into two major oxidation products that are also protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (39Ramdas L. Obeyesekere N.U. McMurray J.S. Gallick G.E. Seifert Jr., W.E. Budde R.J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The more active product was found to be a dimer of A23 joined at the β-carbon, creating a di-catechol (39Ramdas L. Obeyesekere N.U. McMurray J.S. Gallick G.E. Seifert Jr., W.E. Budde R.J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This instability, which may include the chemistry described in this study, can limit the usefulness of the catechol-containing tyrphostins for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases. In fact, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have progressed to clinical trials to date do not contain a catechol moiety (12Levitzki A. Mishani E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Blackledge G. J. Urol. 2003; 170: S77-S83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Traxler P. Bold G. Buchdunger E. Caravatti G. Furet P. Manley P. O'Reilly T. Wood J. Zimmermann J. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Physiological Implications—Many cells contain endogenous catechols that can form covalent adducts with cellular proteins (19Bindoli A. Rigobello M.P. Deeble D.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 33Scheulen M. Wollenberg P. Bolt H.M. Kappus H. Remmer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kappus H. J. Steroid Biochem. 1974; 5: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results of this work suggest that COMT-modified catechols can also participate in these reactions. Both rat liver microsomes and tyrosinase catalyze the formation of covalent protein adducts with the catechols DOPA and dopamine (33Scheulen M. Wollenberg P. Bolt H.M. Kappus H. Remmer H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, toxicity of the anti-convulsant drug phenytoin has been linked to its metabolism to a catechol and its subsequent oxidation to the ortho-quinone (43Cuttle L. Munns A.J. Hogg N.A. Scott J.R. Hooper W.D. Dickinson R.G. Gillam E.M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 945-950PubMed Google Scholar, 44Munns A.J. DeVoss J.J. Hooper W.D. Dickinson R.G. Gillam E.M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A number of “quinone-tanned” structures in nature, including eggshell matrices, biological cements, and mussel byssal threads, are also based on the oxidation of protein-bound catechols (45Waite J.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 97B: 19-29Google Scholar). In some of these systems, methylation by COMT can attenuate the oxidation and subsequent reactions (28Zhu B.T. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Werner P. Di Rocco A. Prikhojan A. Rempel N. Bottiglieri T. Bressman S. Yahr M.D. Brain Res. 2001; 893: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Zhu B.T. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 13: 343-353PubMed Google Scholar); in other cases methylation may play a different role. The results shown in this report suggest that care should be taken in analyzing protein methylation reactions in cellular extracts and intact cells radiolabeled with methionine or AdoMet. This is of particular concern, because the base lability of endogenous catechol methyl ether derivatives can mimic the properties of protein methyl esters. Furthermore, our results suggest that it may be important to consider the role of cellular methylation reactions in understanding the effects of catechol-containing tyrphostins used as experimental reagents and as possible therapeutics. We are grateful to Dr. Jonathan Lowenson (UCLA) for providing us with mouse tissues. We are also thankful to Dr. Michael Jung (UCLA) for sharing his expertise on catechol reaction chemistry."

RITS findsthe DNA repeats through siRNA base pairing with the nascent transcript and recruits the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) and Clr4, a histone methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me). RdRP in RDRC uses the Ago-cut nascent RNA as template to synthesize more dsRNA, which in turn will be cut into siRNAs to reinforce heterochromatin formation. Chp1 in the RITS complex binds to H3K9me, resulting in stable interaction of RITS and heterochromatic DNA. H3K9me also binds to another chromodomain protein, Swi6, an HP1 homolog, leading to the spreading of heterochromatin."
