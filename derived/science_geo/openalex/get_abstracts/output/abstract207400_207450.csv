https://openalex.org/W2045537855,"Most hypoxia-induced malformations are caused by a syndrome involving tremendous edema followed by formation of clear blisters and hematomas. These, in turn, mechanically interfere with development. Studies of blood pH and lactic acid indicate that lactate accumulation initiates this syndrome. The effects of lactic acid injections parallel those of subjection to hypoxia, confirming this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2090315292,"The serial propagation of influenza B (Lee) virus has been demonstrated in a transmissible line of canine kidney cells, as evidenced by the presence of cytopathic effects and hemagglutinins in each of six consecutive tissue-culture passages, and by egg infectivity titers of 10-4.3 and 10-4.1 per 0.1 ml in 3rd and 5th tissue culture fluids, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1973747239,"To judge from reports in the literature, thermophilic Actinomycetes have proved difficult to isolate. For isolations from mouldy hay we have developed a convenient method which promises to be useful in other contexts1. The method uses the fact that dry air removes spores of the Streptomycetaceae in preference to bacteria. Instead of suspending the spores in water and plating dilutions in the traditional manner, dry spores are suspended in air and impacted with the Andersen sampler2 directly on surface-dried medium. In our work, samples of hay are shaken in a small wind tunnel and the air drawn into an Andersen sampler loaded with Petri dishes which had been poured the day before with half-strength nutrient agar (agar content made up to 2 per cent) containing 0.5 mgm./ml. actidione to suppress growth of mould. A slit-sampler could be used as an alternative to the Andersen sampler, and instead of using a wind tunnel, hay or other material can be shaken in a box (pre-sterilized with propylene oxide if required) and a few minutes allowed for larger particles to settle before sampling the air."
https://openalex.org/W2059835263,"THE discovery of a new potent analgetic with a reduced liability to addiction1 in the benzomorphan series, namely, 2′-hydroxy-5,9-dimethyl-2-phenylethyl-6,7-benzomorphan2 (I), has suggested further work in the series. 2′-Hydxoxy-5,9-dimethyl-2-allyl-6,7-benzomorphan (III) is a potent antagonist of phenazocine, morphine, meperidine, and other analgetic agents. This compound is of special interest in that combinations of phenazocine and III in ratios of 5 : 1 to 100 : 1 retain analgetic activity in animals yet seem to be relatively devoid of physical dependence properties in the monkey in both acute and chronic experiments (biological details of this work will be described elsewhere)."

https://openalex.org/W1979403061,"The isolated hearts of a comprehensive selection of bivalves were tested to determine the distribution of the excitor and depressor effects of acetylcholine. No broad relationships are obvious although some intrafamily uniformity of response exists. The hearts of most species were both excited and depressed, probably by separate actions of acetylcholine. From these data we can conclude that bivalve heart muscle conforms closely to other molluscan muscle in its pharmacological reactions to acetylcholine."

https://openalex.org/W1981602309,"AN X-linked blood group system, Xg, was described this year jointly by investigators in the United States and at the Medical Research Council, Blood Group Research Unit, at the Lister Institute1. More recently it was shown, at the University of North Carolina2, that while ‘classical’ hæmophilia (hæmophilia A) is closely linked to colour blindness, as was already known from the work of Haldan and others, hæmophilia B (ptc deficiency, Christmas disease) is very loosely linked to colour blindness, if linked at all. In English families the loci for Xg and for hæmophilia A have been found to be widely separated3. Though work in progress is showing no hint of linkage between Xg and colour blindness the two should, in theory, be within measurable distance of each other because colour blindness is close4–6 to the locus for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g-6-pd) and g-6-pd is within measurable distance7 of Xg."

https://openalex.org/W1995587071,"ALTHOUGH many vertebrates have retained to a considerable degree the ability to regenerate organs, adult anurans are generally believed to have lost the power to replace limbs or digits. Isolated cases of regeneration in anurans have been observed, but were considered simply as anomalous occurrences1–3. In 1932, Rostand4 reported that adults of the African ‘clawed toad’, Xenopus laevis, regularly formed heteromorphic regenerates of amputated digits. This has been confirmed for limbs as well as digits by Gallien and Beetschen5, Beetschen6, Gitlin7, and Skowron and Komala8. As part of an extensive analysis of regeneration in the anurans, the present communication reports the normal occurrence of regeneration in another African frog."

https://openalex.org/W1981756855,"WHOLE-BODY X-irradiation delivered within 6 hr. of hepatectomy will inhibit the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in regenerating liver. This inhibition has been elegantly demonstrated to be a result of the failure to synthesize certain enzymes concerned with the formation of DNA1. The nature of this inhibition of enzyme formation is suggested by two recent reports. Myers2 has reported that synthesis of DNA in regenerating liver is not completely inhibited following X-irradiation of liver only, and Benjamin and Yost3 have observed that the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation seen in liver mitochondria following whole-body irradiation is due to a pituitary stimulation with subsequent activation of the adrenal cortical hormones. These observations suggest that this interesting and rather unusual effect of low doses of whole-body X-irradiation on synthesis of DNA in the intact animal may be due to a pituitary stimulation which ultimately results in a decreased amount of energy being available for enzyme synthesis. The possibility of a pituitary effect on synthesis of DNA in regenerating liver following whole-body X-irradiation was confirmed in the experiments reported here."

https://openalex.org/W2028086995,"SERUM, plasma, lysed blood cells, urine and pleural fluid or ‘lymph’ (inflammatory exudate) were obtained from cattle naturally and experimentally infected with Mycoplasma mycoides. These materials were examined for antigens of M. mycoides by means of the agar-gel double diffusion precipitin test and the quantitative agar-gel precipitin test1. They were also examined for antibodies against M. mycoides by means of the complement fixation test2 and the slide agglutination test3, and for viable M. mycoides by growth in broth cultures."

https://openalex.org/W2083648470,"RECENT reports have stressed the advantages of using highly specific ‘glucose oxidase’ methods for the clinical determinations of blood sugars1–3. Traditional methods, such as those of Folin and Wu, measure the total reducing capacity of the blood, and include the so-called saccharoid fraction as well as the true glucose-level. The exact nature of this fraction, and its significance in pathological conditions, is not yet fully understood."

https://openalex.org/W2066697849,"The hypothesis is that such displacement produces no disturbance of behavior within a limited ""normal"" range, but that a breakdown angle can be found beyond this range which will produce disturbance in motion in proportion to the magnitude of the feedback displacement. Results with two tasks specifically support the hypothesis that limiting angles of neurogeometric control of motion and variation in performance occur with varying magnitudes of angular displacement of feedback."
