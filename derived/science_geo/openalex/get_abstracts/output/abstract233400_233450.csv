https://openalex.org/W2151567220,"It is now widely accepted that global warming is occurring, yet its effects on the world's largest ecosystem, the marine pelagic realm, are largely unknown. We show that sea surface warming in the Northeast Atlantic is accompanied by increasing phytoplankton abundance in cooler regions and decreasing phytoplankton abundance in warmer regions. This impact propagates up the food web (bottom-up control) through copepod herbivores to zooplankton carnivores because of tight trophic coupling. Future warming is therefore likely to alter the spatial distribution of primary and secondary pelagic production, affecting ecosystem services and placing additional stress on already-depleted fish and mammal populations."
https://openalex.org/W1995087505,"The first structure of an ammonia channel from the Amt/MEP/Rh protein superfamily, determined to 1.35 angstrom resolution, shows it to be a channel that spans the membrane 11 times. Two structurally similar halves span the membrane with opposite polarity. Structures with and without ammonia or methyl ammonia show a vestibule that recruits NH 4 + /NH 3 , a binding site for NH 4 + , and a 20 angstrom–long hydrophobic channel that lowers the NH 4 + p K a to below 6 and conducts NH 3 . Favorable interactions for NH 3 are seen within the channel and use conserved histidines. Reconstitution of AmtB into vesicles shows that AmtB conducts uncharged NH 3 ."

A low-temperature, high–magnetic field scanning tunneling microscope was used to measure the spin excitation spectra of individual manganese atoms adsorbed on Al 2 O 3 islands on a NiAl surface. We find pronounced variations of the spin-flip spectra for manganese atoms in different local environments."
https://openalex.org/W1976720677,"To assess the coextinction of species (the loss of a species upon the loss of another), we present a probabilistic model, scaled with empirical data. The model examines the relationship between coextinction levels (proportion of species extinct) of affiliates and their hosts across a wide range of coevolved interspecific systems: pollinating Ficus wasps and Ficus , parasites and their hosts, butterflies and their larval host plants, and ant butterflies and their host ants. Applying a nomographic method based on mean host specificity (number of host species per affiliate species), we estimate that 6300 affiliate species are “coendangered” with host species currently listed as endangered. Current extinction estimates need to be recalibrated by taking species coextinctions into account."
https://openalex.org/W2078889580,"We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the collapse of a two-domain protein, the BphC enzyme, into a globular structure to examine how water molecules mediate hydrophobic collapse of proteins. In the interdomain region, liquid water persists with a density 10 to 15% lower than in the bulk, even at small domain separations. Water depletion and hydrophobic collapse occur on a nanosecond time scale, which is two orders of magnitude slower than that found in the collapse of idealized paraffin-like plates. When the electrostatic protein-water forces are turned off, a dewetting transition occurs in the interdomain region and the collapse speeds up by more than an order of magnitude. When attractive van der Waals forces are turned off as well, the dewetting in the interdomain region is more profound, and the collapse is even faster."
https://openalex.org/W1628893287,"Transition to turbulence in pipe flow is one of the most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds. This transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for the transition process has been suggested. We report experimental observation of these traveling waves in pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid turbulence."
https://openalex.org/W1979194107,"Although bacteria use different iron compounds in vitGro, the possibility that microbes distinguish between these iron sources during infection has hitherto not been examined. We applied stable isotope labeling to detect source-specific iron by mass spectrometry and show that Staphylococcus aureus preferentially imports heme iron over transferrin iron. By combining this approach with computational genome analysis, we identified hts (heme transport system), a gene cluster that promotes preferred heme iron import by S. aureus . Heme iron scavenging by means of hts is required for staphylococcal pathogenesis in animal hosts, indicating that heme iron is the preferred iron source during the initiation of infection."

Keeping the dendron core and linear PEO chain compatible allows for the combination of dendritic core-shell and conventional blockcopolymer characteristics for complex mesophase behavior. An unexpected sequence of crystalline lamellar, cubic micellar ( \batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \(Pm{\bar{3}}n\) \end{document} ), hexagonal columnar, continuous cubic ( \batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \(Ia{\bar{3}}d\) \end{document} ), and lamellar mesophases is observed. Multiple phase behavior within single compounds allows for the study of charge transport and mechanical property correlations as a function of structure. The results suggest an advanced molecular design concept for the next generation of nanostructured materials in applications involving charge transport."
https://openalex.org/W1992970966,"The turnover of Jun proteins, like that of other transcription factors, is regulated through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Usually, such processes are regulated by extracellular stimuli through phosphorylation of the target protein, which allows recognition by F box–containing E3 ubiquitin ligases. In the case of c-Jun and JunB, we found that extracellular stimuli also modulate protein turnover by regulating the activity of an E3 ligase by means of its phosphorylation. Activation of the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade after T cell stimulation accelerated degradation of c-Jun and JunB through phosphorylation-dependent activation of the E3 ligase Itch. This pathway modulates cytokine production by effector T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2123555845,"Signaling proteins are tightly regulated spatially and temporally to perform multiple functions. For Cdc42 and other guanosine triphosphatases, the subcellular location of activation is a critical determinant of cell behavior. However, current approaches are limited in their ability to examine the dynamics of Cdc42 activity in living cells. We report the development of a biosensor capable of visualizing the changing activation of endogenous, unlabeled Cdc42 in living cells. With the use of a dye that reports protein interactions, the biosensor revealed localized activation in the trans-Golgi apparatus, microtubule-dependent Cdc42 activation at the cell periphery, and activation kinetics precisely coordinated with cell extension and retraction."
https://openalex.org/W2038747238,"Siderophores are extracellular iron-binding compounds that mediate iron transport into many cells. We present evidence of analogous molecules for copper transport from methane-oxidizing bacteria, represented here by a small fluorescent chromopeptide (C 45 N 12 O 14 H 62 Cu, 1216 daltons) produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. The crystal structure of this compound, methanobactin, was resolved to 1.15 angstroms. It is composed of a tetrapeptide, a tripeptide, and several unusual moieties, including two 4-thionyl-5-hydroxy-imidazole chromophores that coordinate the copper, a pyrrolidine that confers a bend in the overall chain, and an amino - terminal isopropylester group. The copper coordination environment includes a dual nitrogen- and sulfur-donating system derived from the thionyl imidazolate moieties. Structural elucidation of this molecule has broad implications in terms of organo-copper chemistry, biological methane oxidation, and global carbon cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2006696807,"ICBP90, inverted CCAAT box-binding protein of 90 kDa, has been reported as a regulator of topoisomerase IIα expression. We present evidence here that ICBP90 binds to methyl-CpG when at least one symmetrically methylated-CpG dinucleotides is presented as its recognition sequence. A SET and RING finger-associated (SRA) domain accounts for the high binding affinity of ICBP90 for methyl-CpG dinucleotides. This protein constitutes a complex with HDAC1 also via its SRA domain, and bound to methylated promoter regions of various tumor suppressor genes, including p16INK4Aand p14ARF, in cancer cells. It has been reported that expression of ICBP90 was upregulated by E2F-1, and we confirmed that the upregulation was caused by binding of E2F-1 to the intron1 of ICBP90, which contains two E2F-1-binding motifs. Our data also revealed accumulation of ICBP90 in breast-cancer cells, where it might suppress expression of tumor suppressor genes through deacetylation of histones after recruitment of HDAC1. The data reported here suggest that ICBP90 is involved in cell proliferation by way of methylation-mediated regulation of certain genes."

https://openalex.org/W1993850239,"We studied the dynamics of a single cobalt (Co) atom during lateral manipulation on a copper (111) surface in a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. The Co binding site locations were revealed in a detailed image that resulted from lateral Co atom motion within the trapping potential of the scanning tip. Random telegraph noise, corresponding to the Co atom switching between hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) sites, was seen when the tip was used to try to position the Co atom over the higher energy hcp site. Varying the probe tip height modified the normal copper (111) potential landscape and allowed the residence time of the Co atom in these sites to be varied. At low tunneling voltages (less than ∼5 millielectron volts), the transfer rate between sites was independent of tunneling voltage, current, and temperature. At higher voltages, the transfer rate exhibited a strong dependence on tunneling voltage, indicative of vibrational heating by inelastic electron scattering."
https://openalex.org/W2016339654,"The ZIP5 gene encodes a protein closely related to ZIP4, a zinc transporter mutated in the human genetic disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica. Herein, we demonstrate that mouse ZIP5 and ZIP4 genes are co-expressed in several tissues involved in zinc homeostasis (intestine, pancreas, embryonic yolk sac). However, unlike expression of the ZIP4 gene, which is induced during periods of zinc deficiency, ZIP5 gene expression is unaltered by dietary zinc. Immunohistochemistry localizes ZIP5 to the basolateral surfaces of enterocytes, acinar cells, and visceral endoderm cells in mice fed a zinc-adequate diet. However, this protein is removed from these cell surfaces and internalized during dietary zinc deficiency. In contrast, ZIP4 is induced and recruited to the apical surface of enterocytes and endoderm cells during zinc deficiency. In the pancreas, ZIP4 is expressed in β-cells, whereas ZIP5 is expressed in acinar cells. These results suggest that the function of ZIP5 is antagonistic to that of ZIP4 in the control of zinc homeostasis; rather than functioning in the acquisition of dietary zinc, as does ZIP4, ZIP5 may function in the removal of zinc from the body. Thus, during periods when dietary zinc is replete, ZIP5 may function to remove zinc from the blood via the pancreas and intestine, the major sites of zinc excretion in mammals, whereas the acquisition of dietary zinc by intestinal ZIP4 would be minimal. In contrast, during periods of dietary zinc deficiency when secretion of zinc by the pancreas and intestine is minimized, ZIP5 is removed from the cell surface, and the intestinal uptake of zinc is augmented by induction of ZIP4.

Members of the ZIP superfamily of metal ion uptake transporters (solute carrier family 39A) are found in all eukaryotes (1Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr.

In mice 14 members of the ZIP family have been identified based on sequence homology, and almost all of these genes are conserved in humans (1Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Guerinot M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 5Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). ZIP proteins have eight predicted transmembrane domains, and transmembrane domain IV contains conserved histidyl, seryl, and glycyl residues in an amphipathic α-helix. These proteins often contain an intracellular loop between transmembrane domains III and IV and an extracellular amino terminus that is histidine-rich and may play roles in metal transport. Members of the ZIP superfamily have been shown to transport zinc, iron, or manganese into cells (6Eide D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in early development of the zebrafish embryo (7Yamashita S. Miyagi C. Fukada T. Kagara N. Che Y.S. Hirano T. Nature. 2004; 429: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and zinc homeostasis in humans (8Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 9Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Despite this growing body of knowledge, little is known about the structure and function of most members of this diverse family of proteins.The ZIP family can be subdivided into four subfamilies, named Subfamilies I and II, gufA, and LIV-1 (5Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The three members of subfamily II (ZIP1-3) have been well conserved in mammals, and each functions as zinc-specific transporter (10Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50142-50150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the physiological roles of these transporters remain to be determined. The LIV-1 subfamily in mice contains 9 members (5Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) of which only three (ZIP4, -6, and -7) have been characterized in any detail (13Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The founding member of this family, LIV-1 (ZIP6; SLC39A6), was identified as a breast cancer-associated protein whose expression is induced by estrogen in breast cancer cells (13Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Manning D.L. Daly R.J. Lord P.G. Kelly K.F. Green C.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 59: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In transfected cells, ZIP6 localizes to the plasma membrane and may function to increase zinc uptake (13Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Very recently, ZIP7 was found to localize to intracellular membranes in transfected cells and to enhance zinc accumulation (14Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, ZIP6 expression appears to be at its lowest level in the human intestine, and ZIP7 appears to be fairly ubiquitously expressed at low levels (13Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This suggests that they do not play key roles in the acquisition of dietary zinc.In contrast, ZIP4 (SLC39A4) is mutated in the human genetic disorder of zinc metabolism acrodermatitis enteropathica (8Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 9Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). ZIP4 is also well conserved during evolution, and the mouse ZIP4 gene is induced, and this protein is recruited to the apical surface of enterocytes and embryonic visceral endoderm cells during periods of zinc deficiency (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The intracellular trafficking of ZIP4 is also regulated (e.g. zinc stimulates the endocytosis of ZIP4) (17Kim B.E. Wang F.D. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, ZIP4 plays a key role in zinc homeostasis by sensing dietary zinc levels.Herein, we studied ZIP5 (SLC39A5), a member of the mouse LIV-1 subfamily that is closely related to ZIP4. We demonstrate that the mouse ZIP5 gene is most actively expressed in tissues involved in zinc homeostasis (intestine, visceral endoderm, pancreas) but is not induced during zinc deficiency. Instead, ZIP5 is localized to the basolateral surface of these cells under zinc-replete conditions but is internalized during periods of dietary zinc deficiency. In related studies, it was recently demonstrated that mZIP5 functions as a bona fide zinc transporter that is specific for zinc as a substrate (18Wang F. Kim B.E. Petris M.J. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (August 20, 10.1074/jbc.M408361200)Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that ZIP5 plays a central role in mammalian zinc homeostasis by antagonizing the actions of ZIP4.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Care and Use; Dietary Zinc ManipulationAll experiments involving mice were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. CD-1 mice (48-60 days old) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (criver.com). Mouse diets were purchased from Harlan Teklad (Teklad.com) and have been described in detail previously (12Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Zinc levels in the diets were as follows: zinc-deficient (ZnD), 1The abbreviations used are: ZnD, zinc-deficient; ZnA, zinc-adequate; HA, hemagglutinin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 1 ppm Zn; zinc-adequate (ZnA), 50 ppm Zn.To examine the tissue-specific expression of ZIP5, CD-1 female or male mice (6 per group) maintained on ZnA feed were killed, and the indicated tissues were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent extraction of RNA and Northern blot analysis. Pancreas RNA was extracted from fresh tissue.To examine the effects of zinc on ZIP5 expression, female mice (six mice per group) were subjected to dietary zinc deficiency during pregnancy as described previously (15Dufner-Beattie J.

The visceral yolk sac and maternal small intestine were harvested and either fixed for immunohistochemistry, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for Northern blotting, or processed fresh for Western blotting. Dietary zinc deficiency was initiated on day 8 of pregnancy, and tissues were harvested on the days of pregnancy indicated in the figure legends (up to day 15). The maternal intestine was isolated as an intact tissue (not a mucosal scrape) but was subdivided as follows. The first six centimeters were considered the proximal (nearest the duodenum), and the next 6 cm were considered the distal small intestine. Previous studies have documented that little anorexia occurs under these experimental conditions, and results using pair-fed controls do not differ from those obtained using mice allowed free access to feed (19Dalton T.P.

Total RNA (3 μg) was size-fractionated by agarose formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred, and cross-linked to nylon membranes. Northern blot membranes were hybridized and washed under stringent conditions as described (19Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet membranes. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was recovered, and the membranes were rinsed with wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture) and collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer mix (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture), sonicated, and allowed to sit on ice for 30-60 min. This solution was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble debris. The supernatant was collected, and its protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (piercenet.com).Immunoblotting—Membrane proteins (25 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution (1:500 for ZIP5 and 1:1000 for ZIP4) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL Plus Western blotting detection system with Hyperfilm ECL (amershambiosciences.com). As a positive control for ZIP5, the plasmid pcDNA3.1Puro(+)-mZIP5HA was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells and grown for 48 h, and a total protein lysate was prepared in 1× SDS sample buffer. As a negative control, the antisera were each neutralized by preincubation for 2 h at room temperature with 6 × 10-5m peptide before incubation with the membranes.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry was performed using the Zymed Laboratories Inc. Histostain-SP kit (zymed.com) for rabbit primary antibody and diaminobenzidine substrate staining. Tissues were fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative at 4 °C, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections were deparaffinized, and subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mm citrate (pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 6-8 min (28Shi S.R. Chaiwun B. Young L. Cote R.J. Taylor C.R. J. Histochem.

Sections were then treated with 1% peroxide for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antiserum (ZIP5, 1:300 dilution; ZIP4, 1:600 dilution). Controls included antisera neutralized by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with 6 × 10-5m peptide before application to the tissue sections, use of preimmune serum, and omission of primary antiserum (results not shown). All of these controls confirmed the specificity of these antisera.ImmunofluoresenceTissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and 5-μm cryosections were prepared as described (30Barthel L.K. Raymond P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)) containing 50 mm lysine for 20 min, permeabilized by incubation for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked using 10% normal goat serum or 10% normal donkey serum during insulin detection. Co-expression of insulin and mZIP4 in the pancreas was examined by immunofluoresence using guinea pig anti-porcine insulin (DakoCytomation.com) detected with donkey fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-guinea pig serum (JacksonImmuno.com) and rabbit anti-mouse ZIP4 incubated with biotin-labeled anti rabbit anti-serum (JacksonImmuno.com) and detected using Qdot-605-streptavidin conjugate (Qdots.com) with a TRITC filter set. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.Accession NumbersGenBank™ accession numbers for mouse the ZIP5 cDNA are AK008448 and AK007473 and those for the mouse ZIP5 gene are AC124670 and AC122159.RESULTSIdentification of the Mouse ZIP5 Gene and mRNA and Evolutionary Conservation of the Predicted ZIP5 Peptide—While searching the mouse-translated non-redundant data base for the ortholog of the human acrodermatitis enteropathica gene ZIP4, a cDNA was identified that encoded a protein with significant amino acid similarity to the carboxyl-terminal half of ZIP4. When aligned with mouse ZIP4, this protein was found to be 36% similar to ZIP4 across the entire length of the protein, but when only the carboxyl-terminal halves of the proteins were aligned, the similarity increased to 49%. Like ZIP4, this protein is also predicted to contain a peptide motif specifically found in transmembrane domain 5 of the other members of the LIV-1 subfamily (HEXPHEXGDFAXLLXXG) (5Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition, this protein was predicted to have eight transmembrane domains, as expected for a ZIP family member (Fig. 1A). Based on these results, the gene encoding this protein was referred to as ZIP5 (SLC39A5), which was found later to be consistent with the nomenclature used on the NCBI website. Alignment of mouse and human ZIP5 revealed 87% amino acid similarity, with amino acid differences scattered throughout the protein (Fig. 1A).There were two entries in the mouse non-redundant data base that encoded the ZIP5 protein, AK008448 and AK007473. These sequences were used to search the mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) data base, identifying an additional 49 base pairs of sequence at the 5′ end of the cDNA, although it has not yet been experimentally determined whether this represents the actual 5′ end of the transcript. There were several notable differences between AK008448 and AK007473. First, there were three single nucleotide differences within the coding region. Two of these altered the encoded amino acid, whereas the third was silent (Fig. 1A). A survey of the entire EST data base revealed that each of these differences was present in several ESTs, suggesting that they likely represented polymorphisms rather that mutations or sequencing errors. The second difference between AK008448 and AK007473 was the deletion of 175 base pairs in AK08448 relative to AK007473, presumably due to the splicing in of a noncoding exon. Several other sequences demonstrated identical deletions, and an additional set of ESTs contained an extended deletion, again suggesting that these changes were not mutations or sequencing errors. These differences probably reflect alternate splicing that occurs within exon 2 but that does not alter the protein-coding sequence.The mZIP5 gene was identified by using the 5′ end-extended cDNA sequence to search the mouse high-throughput genomic sequences data base. The intron-exon structure of the gene was determined by aligning the gene with the cDNA and identifying splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences. From this alignment, it was determined that the two deletions noted previously in the cDNA sequences were not due to the splicing out of exons but, rather, due to the use of cryptic splicing signals (Fig. 1B). In addition, as was seen with the mZIP4 gene (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the mZIP5 gene contained 12 exons and was relatively short, spanning ∼5300 base pairs (Fig. 1B). Using the Map-Viewer application on the NCBI server, the mZIP5 gene was localized to chromosome 10D3.The Mouse ZIP5 Gene Is Expressed in Tissues Involved in Zinc Homeostasis—Northern blotting was used to examine the expression of the mZIP5 gene in total RNA extracted from several adult organs as well as from the embryonic visceral yolk sac (Fig. 2). The ZIP5 and ZIP4 transcripts were readily detectable in the proximal and distal small intestine as well as in the embryonic visceral yolk sac. However, ZIP5 mRNA was also detected in the pancreas and kidney, whereas ZIP4 mRNA was not.Fig. 2Northern blot detection of mZIP5 transcripts in mouse organs. The indicated mouse organs were collected from adult mice, whereas the visceral yolk sac was collected from embryos on day 14 of pregnancy. Total RNA was extracted and assayed by Northern blotting using cDNA probes for mZIP5, mZIP4 (15Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of zinc deficiency during pregnancy on the abundance of ZIP5 and ZIP4 transcripts in the maternal intestine (Fig. 3A) and embryonic visceral yolk sac (Fig. 3B). Pregnant mice were fed a ZnA or ZnD diet beginning on day 8 of pregnancy, and the maternal small intestine was harvested every 24 h thereafter (days 9-15). The relative abundance of MT-I mRNA was also examined because the transcription of this gene is diminished during dietary zinc deficiency (21Andrews G.K. Lee D.K. Ravindra R. Lichtlen P. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In mice fed the ZnD diet, ZIP5 mRNA abundance was unaffected, whereas ZIP4 mRNA levels were detectably increased by 24 h of zinc deficiency and continued to increase dramatically for 5 days (Fig. 3A). MT-I mRNA abundance during this period was severely reduced. Similar overall effects of zinc deficiency on these mRNAs were noted in the visceral yolk sac, and by 5 days of a zinc-deficient diet, ZIP5 mRNA levels remained unchanged, whereas ZIP4 mRNA was dramatically induced, and MT-I mRNA was repressed (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Effects of dietary zinc deficiency on mZIP5 mRNA abundance in the maternal intestine and embryonic visceral yolk sac. Pregnant CD-1 mice were fed the ZnA (dietary zinc +) or ZnD (dietary zinc -) diet beginning on day (d) 8 of pregnancy. Six mice per group were sacrificed on days 9-15 of pregnancy (from 1 to 7 days of ZnD diet), and the relative abundance of mZIP5 mRNA in the maternal small intestine (A) and embryonic visceral yolk sac (B) was determined by Northern blotting. Membranes were hybridized with mZIP5, mZIP4, mZIP1, metallothionein-I (MT-I) and β-actin probes. MT-I mRNA abundance is down-regulated by dietary zinc deficiency in these tissues (15Dufner-Beattie J.

To quantify H2O2 formation, we have generated strains of Escherichia colithat lack intracellular scavenging enzymes. The H2O2 that is formed within these mutants diffuses out into the medium, where it can be measured. We sought to test the prevailing hypothesis that this H2O2 is primarily generated by the autoxidation of redox enzymes within the respiratory chain. The rate of H2O2 production increased when oxygen levels were raised, confirming that H2O2 is formed by an adventitious chemical process. However, mutants that lacked NADH dehydrogenase II and fumarate reductase, the most oxidizable components of the respiratory chain in vitro, continued to form H2O2 at normal rates. NADH dehydrogenase II did generate substantial H2O2 when it was when overproduced or quinones were absent, forcing electrons to accumulate on the enzyme. Mutants that lacked both NADH dehydrogenases respired very slowly, as expected; however, these mutants showed no diminution of H2O2 excretion, suggesting that H2O2 is primarily formed by a source outside the respiratory chain. That source has not yet been identified. In respiring cells the rate of H2O2 production was ∼0.5% the rate of total oxygen consumption, with only modest changes when cells used different carbon sources.

Superoxide ((O2.¯)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are partially reduced oxygen species that are substantially more reactive than is oxygen itself. Treatments that artificially generate large amounts of these species inside living cells, including the administration of hyperoxia, redox-cycling drugs, or authentic hydrogen peroxide, can disrupt metabolism and generate mutagenic or even lethal doses of DNA damage (1Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 2Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 92-112Crossref Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Even absent such forcing conditions, some(O2.¯)and H2O2 are generated when molecular oxygen chemically oxidizes reduced metabolites or enzymes inside the cell. For this reason, it has been suggested that endogenous(O2.¯)and H2O2 may create the cell damage that underlies important human pathologies, including those that derive from carcinogenesis and the aging process. A key question, then, is whether(O2.¯)and H2O2 are produced inside cells in doses sufficient to account for these disabilities. To answer that question we need to know both the rates at which they are formed and the doses that can cause toxicity.Evidence for the toxicity of endogenous oxidants was first obtained in Escherichia coli. In the mid-1980s, Carlioz and Touati created mutant strains of E. coli that lack cytosolic superoxide dismutase (3Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). These mutants exhibited defects in amino acid biosynthesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle function that led to the discovery that superoxide can inactivate dehydratases containing iron-sulfur clusters (4Kuo C.F. Mashino T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4724-4727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Analogous phenotypes were subsequently discovered in superoxide dismutase-deficient yeast (9Chang E.C. Crawford B.F. Hong Z. Bilinski T. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4417-4424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10van Loon A.P.G.M. Pesold-Hurt B. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mouse mutants that lacked mitochondrial superoxide dismutase died within 10 days, an occurrence that may also have reflected deficiencies in tricarboxylic acid function (12Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). These phenotypes demonstrated that endogenous superoxide production is sufficiently rapid to poison a cell that lacks superoxide dismutase activity. Subsequent dosimetric analysis indicated that wild-type E. coli synthesizes just enough superoxide dismutase to keep its superoxide-sensitive enzymes predominantly active (13Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Similarly, mutants of E. coli that cannot scavenge endogenous H2O2 also exhibit severe growth defects (14Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Although the underlying injuries have not yet been identified, the phenotype confirms that H2O2 is also generated inside the cells at rates that require the presence of scavenging enzymes.How are the intracellular(O2.¯)and H2O2 formed? Molecular oxygen is a triplet species, meaning that it cannot remove more than one electron at a time from organic molecules (15Naqui A. Chance B. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 137-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This spin restriction has an important consequence: because molecular oxygen has a weak affinity for that first electron (Em = –0.16 V), there are few biomolecules that can spontaneously transfer an electron to it. This feature greatly diminishes the potential toxicity of oxygen. It also suggests that the respiratory chain is among the few plausible sites of(O2.¯)and H2O2 formation, because its flavins, quinones, and metal centers are all univalent electron carriers of sufficiently low potential to react with oxygen.Indeed, both(O2.¯)and H2O2 have been detected as trace by-products when mitochondrial or bacterial membrane vesicles respire in vitro (16Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4782) Google Scholar, 17Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10119-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When mitochondrial complex III is inhibited with antimycin, electrons are rapidly transferred from its Qo site to oxygen (19Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Superoxide is produced stoichiometrically, although it subsequently dismutates to produce H2O2 as a secondary product. This(O2.¯)is evidently formed on the outer aspect of the mitochondrial membrane so that it would contribute to oxidative stress in the inner membrane space but not within the matrix (20Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) generates H2O2in vitro either when downstream inhibitors favor reverse electron flow from reduced ubiquinone or when rotenone blocks turnover of the NADH-reduced enzyme (21Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In both cases, the specific site of electron transfer to oxygen is unclear. Furthermore, it is difficult to know whether the same mechanisms of oxidation pertain when inhibitors are not present.In contrast to the mitochondrial studies, in vitro analyses of the E. coli respiratory chain have indicated that(O2.¯)and H2O2 are generated primarily by the autoxidation of reduced dehydrogenases (22Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase I, the bacterial homologue of complex I, was not a major contributor, but the much simpler NADH dehydrogenase II reacted with oxygen at a substantial rate. Succinate. dehydrogenase produced scanty but still detectable(O2.¯). Its anaerobically synthesized isozyme, fumarate reductase, autoxidized rapidly when exposed to air. With each of these enzymes, the(O2.¯)and H2O2 are formed when molecular oxygen adventitiously oxidizes a reduced, solvent-exposed flavin. Although the spin restriction dictates that(O2.¯)must be the initial product of these electron transfer reactions, in most cases a second electron was transferred to(O2.¯)before it diffused out of the active sites of these enzymes, thereby producing more H2O2 than(O2.¯)as a product. The flavins lie in cytoplasmic domains of these membrane-bound proteins so that the(O2.¯)and H2O2 they generate would be formed inside the intact cell.These mechanisms were identified in vitro. Because enzyme behavior in vitro does not always represent what happens in vivo, it is important to test whether these enzymes are actually responsible for most(O2.¯)and H2O2 formation inside cells. Small amounts of H2O2 are indeed released by intact state 4 mitochondria in which electrons are backed up on the respiratory chain due to the absence of ADP as a F1-F0-ATPase substrate. When ADP was provided or the membrane potential was otherwise dissipated, the amount of H2O2 fell to undetectable levels (23Boveris A. Cadenas E. Oberley L.W. Superoxide Dismutase. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton1982: 15-30Google Scholar, 24Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). The fact that H2O2 production depends upon the respiratory state confirms that the respiratory chain is the likely site of state 4 mitochondrial H2O2 production but makes it difficult to estimate the amount of H2O2 that would be generated in actively respiring cells in vivo. Furthermore, recent calculations indicate that most H2O2 is scavenged by glutathione peroxidase before it diffuses out of the matrix (25Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Thus, these efflux experiments may have detected only the H2O2 that was produced on the outer aspect of the mitochondrial membrane.Until recently, it was not possible to measure the H2O2 formed inside living E. coli, as this bacterium contains an NADH peroxidase and two catalases and does not release the H2O2 that is generated in its cytosol (26Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7182-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, this problem can now be circumvented by the use of mutants that lack these enzymes (14Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In the present study, the stepwise elimination of respiratory enzymes allowed us to appraise directly their contribution to the overall rate of H2O2 formation in vivo. Surprisingly, the results indicate that most H2O2 is formed elsewhere.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Enzymes—Catalase, cytochrome c, horseradish peroxidase (type II), 4-hydroxybenzonic acid, hydrogen peroxide (30% w/v), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, deamino-NADH, NADH, NADPH, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, o-dianisidine, plumbagin, potassium cyanide, riboflavin, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, and uracil were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Total protein was measured with Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce). β-Mercaptoethanol, EDTA, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Fisher, and Amplex Red was purchased from Molecular Probes. Water for the buffers was purified with a Labconco Water Pro PS system using house deionized water as a feedstock. Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were used at 100, 20, and 14 μg/ml, respectively.Strain Construction—The strains used in this study were derived from E. coli K-12 and are listed in Table I. Mutant strains were constructed by P1 transduction (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). The tetracycline-sensitive version of JI377 (LC106) was created by transducing into JI372 a Δ(katG17::Tn10)1 allele linked to argE86::Tn10, selecting for tetracycline resistance, and then replacing the argE mutation by transduction of argE+, with selection for arginine prototrophy. The resultant strain was confirmed to be hydroperoxidase I-deficient (a katG mutant) by enzyme assay (14Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The menA null allele was created using the λ Red recombinase method (28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). Transduction of the menA allele was done by chloramphenicol selection on Luria broth with glucose (LBg) 1The abbreviations used are: LBg, Luria Broth with glucose; Frd, fumarate reductase; Hpx–, hydroperoxidase-deficient; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. medium. Isolates were then screened by PCR for anaerobic growth on glycerol/fumarate (40 mm each). All frd and menA mutants were supplemented with uracil (1 mm) to bypass the requirement for function of the respiration-linked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. menA mutants were all screened for hydroperoxidase I activity, because these genes can be co-transduced. The loss of the chloramphenicol marker in the menA deletion was achieved by using pCP20, which encodes FLP recombinase (28Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). The frd deletion was co-transduced with zjd::Tn10 and screened for the inability to grow on minimal medium containing glycerol/fumarate (40 mm each). The ubiA420 point mutation was co-transduced with malE52::Tn10 and then screened for growth aerobically without 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (29Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The undefined nuo point mutation was co-transduced with a zej-223::Tn10 (30Calhoun M.W. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3013-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ndh, nuo, frd, and fre mutants were all screened using the appropriate enzyme assays that are described below.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). When glucose was added to LB, its final concentration was 0.2%. To prevent the photochemical formation of hydrogen peroxide, LB medium was shielded from light and used within 24 h of its preparation. Minimal growth medium consisted of minimal A salts (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar), 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 5 mg thiamine per liter, and a specified carbon source. Minimal glucose-casamino acids medium contained both glucose and casamino acids (2 g/liter each). l-amino acid supplements were used at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Histidine was routinely added to minimal media for the growth of any derivative in the MG1655 background. This strain requires the addition of histidine to grow anaerobically (data not shown). To minimize the chemical production of hydrogen peroxide (14Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), the minimal media used in experiments (as noted) were prepared immediately before use and sterilized by filtration.Aerobic cultures were routinely grown in flasks at 37 °C unless noted otherwise. Anaerobic cultures were grown in a Coy chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc.) under 85% N2, 10% H2, and 5% CO2. Optical densities of cultures were measured at 600 nm. For studies of growth on various carbon sources, cells were grown in minimal growth media containing 0.5 mm histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine (each) in order to foster better aerobic growth of the Hpx– strain without providing an additional carbon source. 2J. Sobota and J. A. Imlay, unpublished data. Carbon sources tested were glucose (0.2%), casamino acids (2.0%), gluconate (0.2%), glycerol (40 mm), pyruvate (0.4%), lactate (0.4%), succinate (40 mm), and acetate (0.25%). Cells were first grown in standing overnight cultures because the resulting microaerobic conditions disfavored the outgrowth of suppressors of the Hpx– strain. To grow a standing culture overnight with glycerol, nitrate (40 mm) was added. All overnight cultures were then diluted to an OD of 0.005 into fresh aerobic media and grown aerobically with vigorous shaking to log phase (OD of 0.1–0.2). The glycerol/nitrate overnight culture was washed twice in minimal salts before dilution into fresh glycerol medium lacking nitrate. The rates of respiration and H2O2 formation were measured from the same cell cultures within 15 min of each other.For β-galactosidase measurements, anaerobic overnights were grown in LB. Overnights were then diluted into anaerobic LB to an OD of 0.01. Cultures were grown to ∼0.1 OD anaerobically and then shifted to aerobic conditions for one to two generations. β-galactosidase activity was then measured (see below).Measurement of Respiration Rate—Respiration by whole cells was measured using a Rank Brothers digital model 10 oxygen sensor. Oxygen consumption was determined using 5 ml of log-phase cells in growth medium at 37 °C.Enzyme Assays—Each data set presented in this study was derived from at least three independent experiments. All assays were performed on log-phase cells at an OD600 of 0.1–0.2.β-Galactosidase—Cultures were centrifuged, and pellets were washed with 50 mm cold potassium Pi buffer (pH 7). Cells were resuspended in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7) at one-tenth the culture volume and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed from crude extracts by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed in a 1.2-ml reaction consisting of 0.2 ml of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml), extract, and Z buffer (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar) at 28 °C. Absorbance was monitored at 420 nm.Flavin Reductase—Cells were centrifuged and washed in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) twice. Final resuspension was in one-hundredth of the original culture volume in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8). Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were then removed by ultra-centrifugation (100,000 × g for 2 h). The soluble fraction was assayed for flavin reductase activity at room temperature by monitoring A340 in the presence of 0.25 mm NADPH and 15 μm riboflavin (32Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Fumarate Reductase—Anaeobically grown log-phase cultures were incubated on ice for 10 min with 150 μg/ml chloramphenicol. This prevented the induction of succinate dehydrogenase during subsequent aerobic processing. Cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and pellets were washed twice with cold 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.8). Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell, and cell debris was removed. Inverted membrane vesicles were then isolated from the supernatant by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The inverted vesicles were resuspended in cold 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.8) at 0.5% the original culture volume. The inverted vesicles were then assayed for succinate:plumbagin oxidoreductase activity at room temperature at A550 in the presence of 0.4 mm plumbagin, 3.3 mm potassium cyanide (pH 7.8), 20 mm succinate, and 10 μm cytochrome c (33Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).NADH Dehydrogenase I—Cells were centrifuged and washed twice with cold 50 mm MES buffer containing 10% glycerol (pH 6). Final resuspension was in one-fortieth the original culture volume. Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell, and cell debris was removed. Inverted membrane vesicles were then isolated from the supernatant by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The inverted vesicles was resuspended in cold 50 mm MES buffer with 10% glycerol (pH 6) at one-fortieth the original culture volume. Vesicles were assayed immediately, because NADH dehydrogenase I activity declines when membranes are stored on ice. The inverted vesicles were assayed for NADH dehydrogenase activity at A340 with 200 μm either deamino-NADH or NADH as the substrate. Deamino-NADH is a substrate for NdhI but not for NdhII (34Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). NdhI utilizes deamino-NADH and NADH with equal efficiency (30Calhoun M.W. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3013-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NADH Dehydrogenase II—Inverted membrane vesicles were isolated as described above. The inverted vesicles were resuspended in cold 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.8) at one-fortieth the original culture volume. Vesicles were held on ice overnight to eliminate the activity of NdhI activity, which is unstable at this pH. The inverted vesicles were then assayed for NADH dehydrogenase II activity at A340 in the presence of 100 μm plumbagin, 3 mm potassium cyanide (pH 7.8), and 200 μm NADH (33Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Superoxide Dismutase—Cells were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Cells were then washed in cold 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.8) and resuspended in one-hundredth the original culture volume in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 7.8) with 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8). Extracts were made by passage through a French pressure cell, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Superoxide dismutase was assayed using the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method (35McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).H2O2 Measurements—Cells were grown for at least four generations (to an OD of 0.1–0.3). This preculture typically was aerated; however, when experiments included strains lacking quinone (which cannot grow aerobically), the preculture medium was anaerobic. Log-phase cells were immediately pelleted by room temperature centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min. Because components of complex media interfere with H2O2 measurements, cells grown in LBg were washed and assayed in fresh, prewarmed minimal media containing 0.02% of both glucose and casamino acids. There is no loss of respiration due to this medium switch (data not shown). Cells grown in minimal media did not require washing and were resuspended after pelleting in the same minimal media containing one-tenth of the original concentration of carbon source. The lower concentration of carbon source was used in the assay because some carbon sources autoxidize and thereby contribute to H2O2 formation (14Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar).Cells were finally resuspended at an OD of ∼ 0.1 with shaking at 37 °C. At selected time points the aliquots were removed, cells were removed by 1-min centrifugation in a microfuge, and H2O2 levels were determined by the Amplex Red/horseradish peroxidase method (14Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured in a Shimadzu RF Mini-150 fluorometer and converted to H2O2 concentration using a curve obtained from standard samples in the same assay medium. Rates were normalized to the OD of cells at the 20-min time point. A small amount of H2O2 is generated by the dye/horseradish peroxidase detection system itself; this amount was accounted for by the standard curves. H2O2 formation rates were also corrected for any background H2O2 formed by medium alone. These backgrounds were ≤0.001 μm H2O2/min. Measurements in pyruvate medium were corrected for the ability of pyruvate to scavenge H2O2 using the equation d[H2O2]/dt = (cellular rate of H2O2 formation) – (k[pyruvate][H2O2]). k was determined by measuring H2O2 concentration over time after the addition of 1.5 μm H2O2 to the assay medium (k = 0.350). All rates were averaged from three separate measurements and presented with standard deviation. p values were calculated using Student's t test.To increase O2 concentration during H2O2 measurements, pure O2 was bubbled vigorously through the resuspended cells at 37 °C during the period of measurement. Under these conditions, H2O2 formation rates were also corrected for any H2O2 formation due to bubbled med"

Although IAPP amyloid deposits are associated with areas of pancreatic islet β-cell dysfunction and depletion and are thought to play a role in disease, their structure is unknown. We used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to analyze eight spin-labeled derivatives of IAPP in an effort to determine structural features of the peptide. In solution, all eight derivatives gave rise to electron paramagnetic resonance spectra with sharp lines indicative of rapid motion on the sub-nanosecond time scale. These spectra are consistent with a rapidly tumbling and highly dynamic peptide. In contrast, spectra for the fibrillar form exhibit reduced mobility and the presence of strong intermolecular spin-spin interactions. The latter implies that the peptide subunits are ordered and that the same residues from neighboring peptides are in close proximity to one another. Our data are consistent with a parallel arrangement of IAPP peptides within the amyloid fibril. Analysis of spin label mobility indicates a high degree of order throughout the peptide, although the N-terminal region is slightly less ordered. Possible similarities with respect to the domain organization and parallelism of Alzheimer's amyloid β peptide fibrils are discussed.

Pancreatic amyloid deposits have been identified as a hallmark of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus. More than 90% of patients with type II diabetes exhibit amyloid deposits in areas of β-cell dysfunction and death (1Kahn S.E. Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B.

Although pancreatic amyloid deposits in a diabetic patient were first identified more than a century ago, structural features of these deposits were not described until recently. Electron microscopy (EM) studies of IAPP deposits revealed the presence of long fibrillar structures (9Westermark P. Li Z.C. Westermark G.T. Leckstrèom A. Steiner D.F.

Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism (CD) analysis of IAPP fibrils made from full-length as well as shorter fragments indicates the presence of significant amounts of β-sheet structure in the fibrillar form (12Higham C.E. Jaikaran E.T. Fraser P.E. Gross M. Clark A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). X-ray and electron diffraction studies using aligned fibrils have shown that the peptide chains are arranged in a cross-β-conformation with the individual β-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis (14Sumner Makin O. Serpell L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Jaikaran E.T. Higham C.E. Serpell L.C. Zurdo J. Gross M. Clark A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Beyond these observations, little is known about the molecular details of IAPP in the fibrillar form. Amyloid deposits have been identified in a number of human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (16Soto C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Although the primary structure of amyloid forming proteins varies widely, most amyloid deposits appear to share common characteristics, such as the cross-β-structure, and the ability to bind thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (17Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Because of the non-crystalline and insoluble nature of amyloid deposits, it has been difficult to obtain a detailed molecular structure of amyloidogenic proteins in the fibrillar form using conventional biophysical techniques such as x-ray crystallography and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In contrast, other magnetic resonance techniques, such as solid-state NMR (18Griffiths J.M. Ashburn T.T. Auger M. Costa P.R. Griffin R.G. J. Am. Chem.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used EPR spectroscopy in combination with SDSL to obtain structural features of full-length IAPP. In SDSL, a cysteine-specific nitroxide spin label is introduced at selected sites of the protein molecule, resulting in a nitroxide-labeled side chain (R1, see Fig. 1). EPR spectra of these R1 reporter groups reflect the local environment of the label and can be used to classify a given site as a loop region, as an exposed or buried site, or as a tertiary contact site (26McHaourab H.S.

Furthermore, the distance between two R1 side chains can be estimated from EPR spectra, given the presence of spin-spin interactions between spin labels (29Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). We find that most regions of IAPP in its fibrillar form are arranged in a highly ordered fashion with the same residues from different strands in close proximity to one another, indicating a parallel arrangement of IAPP peptides within the fibril. The organization of IAPP in the fibrillar form is similar to that observed for Alzheimer's Aβ peptide fibrils obtained using EPR/SDSL (23Torok M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G.

Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) spectroscopy. These similarities suggest that the molecular architecture of IAPP and Aβ fibrils could be related. Chemicals and Peptides—Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and ThT were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Synthetic wild-type human IAPP was obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). The spin label, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSL), was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). The thiol-reactive pyrene label, N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide, was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). An analog of IAPP containing no cysteine residues (wherein the native cysteines were replaced by alanine) was synthesized using fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl chemistry on an automatic peptide synthesizer (ABI 433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Single cysteine substituted mutants of full-length IAPP based on our cysteine-less template were purchased from Synpep Corp. (Dublin, CA). Crude peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and were characterized for correct molecular weight by electrospray mass spectrometry. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at -70 °C until further use. For spin labeling, purified peptides were reacted with 3-fold molar excess of MTSL for ∼1 h at room temperature. Unreacted MTSL was removed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and spin-labeled peptides were characterized for correct molecular weight using electrospray mass spectrometry. Preparation of Peptide Stock Solutions—We prepared peptide stock solutions under conditions found to reproducibly generate unstructured, monomeric forms of IAPP (30Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Purified peptides were dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl and loaded onto a spin column packed with C18 reverse phase separation media (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). After loading, the column was washed once with deionized distilled water, and the peptide was eluted using 100% HFIP. Peptide concentrations were calculated by UV absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine HCl using an extinction coefficient of 1400 m-1 cm-1 for the wild-type peptide (30Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and 1160 m-1 cm-1 for the cysteine-less peptide (based on an extinction coefficient of 120 m-1 cm-1 for cysteine (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar)). Stock solutions in HFIP were stored at -70 °C. Fibril Formation—Aliquots of peptide stock solutions in HFIP were pipetted into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and the HFIP was evaporated using a speed vac system (Savant Instruments, Halbrook, NY). The dry peptide was redissolved in buffer. Fibril formation was allowed to proceed at room temperature for a minimum of 3 days. At the end of the incubation period, fibrils were separated from any smaller aggregates by centrifugation and repeated washing with buffer. For spin-dilution experiments, aliquots of each R1-labeled IAPP analog in HFIP were mixed with the appropriate amount of either wild-type IAPP or cysteine-less IAPP in HFIP, and fibrils formed as described above. EPR Spectroscopy—For EPR spectroscopy, fibril suspensions were taken into quartz capillaries (0.6 mm inner diameter × 0.84 mm outer diameter, VitroCom, Mt. Lakes, NJ). Spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA) fitted with an ER4123D resonator. EPR spectra were obtained at room temperature using a field modulation amplitude of 1 (solution spectra) or 3 (fibrillar spectra) gauss at an incident microwave power of 12 mW with a scan range of 150 gauss. Spectra were normalized to the same number of spins using the double integral and are presented accordingly. CD Spectroscopy—For CD spectroscopy, aliquots of peptide stock solutions in HFIP were pipetted into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, mixed with 500 μl of deionized distilled water, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized overnight. The dry lyophilized peptide was dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer to yield 25 μm solutions prior to use and transferred into a 1-mm path-length quartz cell. Spectra of IAPP fibril suspensions in buffer were obtained from fibrils grown from freshly dissolved IAPP as described above. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco 815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Inc., Easton, MD). Measurements were taken every 0.5 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm/min with an averaging time of 1 s. Typically, 20–50 scans were averaged between 190–260 nm. All spectra were corrected using appropriate backgrounds. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fibril solutions for the ThT binding assay were prepared as described for CD spectroscopy. To each fibrillization reaction, 25 μm ThT was added and emission intensities were measured at 482 nm with excitation at 450 nm. Measurements were performed at room temperature with excitation and emission slit widths of 1 and 10 nm, respectively. Emission spectra of pyrene-labeled IAPP fibrils were obtained with excitation at 350 nm, a scan rate of 100 nm/min, and excitation and emission slit widths of 1 and 5 nm, respectively. For comparison, emission spectra of pyrene-labeled IAPP were normalized using the peak at 395 nm. Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. Electron Microscopy—5–10 μl of fibrillar IAPP solution was adsorbed onto glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids. Excess sample was removed by blotting on filter paper. Grids were stained with 5 μl of 3% uranyl acetate for 3 min. After blotting excess uranyl acetate and washing with 5 μl of distilled deionized water, staining was repeated for 1 min with 5 μl uranyl acetate. Native Cysteines Are Not Required for Fibril Formation by Full-length IAPP—IAPP contains two native cysteine residues that can form a disulfide bridge under oxidizing conditions (32Cornish J. Callon K.E. Lin C.Q. Xiao C.L. Mulvey T.B. Coy D.H. Cooper G.J. Reid I.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E827-E833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether the link is always present in the fibrillar state and/or whether it is required for fibril formation in vivo. Synthetic peptides lacking the N-terminal seven residues of IAPP have been found to form amyloid fibrils with a morphology similar to that of the full-length native peptide (11Goldsbury C. Goldie K. Pellaud J. Seelig J. Frey P. Mèuller S.A. Kistler J. Cooper G.J. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), which implies that the two native cysteines are not necessary for the formation of amyloid fibrils in vitro. To determine whether fibril formation by full-length IAPP requires the two native cysteine residues, we used CD and ThT binding. Immediately after they were dissolved in phosphate buffer, both wild-type and cysteine-less IAPP produced far UV CD spectra (Fig. 2, A and B, solid lines) with minima at ∼200 nm. These spectra are characteristic of an unordered backbone structure. To observe structural changes associated with fibril formation, far UV CD spectra were collected from aged samples containing fibrillar aggregates (see EM below). For both wild-type and cysteine-less IAPP, we observed a reduction of the minimum at 200 nm, with a concomitant increase in the negative ellipticity at ∼220 nm upon fibril formation (Fig. 2, A and B, dotted lines). These changes are indicative of a conformational change from an unordered to a β-sheet structure and are in agreement with published data on IAPP (12Higham C.E. Jaikaran E.T. Fraser P.E. Gross M. Clark A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The ability of wild-type and cysteine-less IAPP to form fibrillar structures was also monitored using ThT, a dye known to bind strongly to amyloid fibrils (33Kudva Y.C. Mueske C. Butler P.C. Eberhardt N.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). To monitor fibril formation, ThT emission intensity at 482 nm was measured at different time points (Fig. 2C). For both wild-type and cysteineless IAPP, we observed increases in ThT emission intensity similar to those reported previously (30Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In both cases, the observed increases in ThT intensity indicate the formation of fibrils with highly similar (yet not identical) kinetics. Although the subtle difference in kinetics is close to the inherent variability of the ThT assay, it is possible that the N-terminal conformation of IAPP could make minor contributions to the kinetics of fibril formation (15Jaikaran E.T. Higham C.E. Serpell L.C. Zurdo J. Gross M. Clark A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Next, we used EM to test whether the absence of the two native cysteines influenced the fibril morphology. We observed similar fibril morphologies for the wild-type and cysteine-less peptides (Fig. 2, D and E). Taken together with our CD and ThT data, these similarities imply that the absence of the two native cysteine residues does not alter the ability of full-length cysteine-less IAPP to form amyloid fibrils. EPR Spectra of Soluble and Fibrillar Forms of Spin-labeled IAPP Analogs—To obtain insight into the molecular architecture of IAPP monomers in their soluble and fibrillar forms, we R1-labeled eight single cysteine analogs of IAPP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cysteines were placed at selected sites throughout the sequence to sample structural information from different regions of the peptide. We found that R1-labeled IAPP analogs in solution gave rise to EPR spectra with sharp lines with a narrow spectral width, as illustrated in Fig. 3A (black line) for the representative R1-labeled position 21. These spectral features are characteristic of highly mobile R1 label with a rotational correlation time in the sub-nanosecond time scale in agreement with the unordered structure indicated by CD (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the soluble form, fibrillar IAPP gave rise to spectral broadening and very low signal amplitude (Fig. 3A, red line). To assist in visualizing spectral features, the fibrillar spectrum is plotted at ×10 magnification (Fig. 3A, green line). These spectral features for IAPP fibrils could, in principle, arise from R1 labels experiencing spin-spin interactions and/or a reduction in mobility. EPR Spectra of Spin-labeled IAPP Co-mixed with Unlabeled Peptide—To test for the presence of spin-spin interactions in the spectra obtained for fibrils from R1-labeled IAPP derivatives, we carried out spin dilution experiments wherein fibrils were grown from a mixture of R1-labeled and unlabeled IAPP. The rationale for these experiments is as follows: If unlabeled and R1-labeled IAPP co-mix in the fibril, the likelihood of an R1 label located on a given IAPP molecule coming into close proximity to another label on a neighboring molecule will be reduced with increasing amounts of unlabeled IAPP. Spin dilution should, therefore, reduce spin-spin interactions and in turn give rise to EPR spectra with reduced spectral width and lines that are sharper as compared with spectra from undiluted samples. Results obtained from diluting the IAPP 21R1 analog with increasing amounts of wild-type IAPP and the cysteineless derivative are shown in Fig. 3, B and C. Spectra from spin-diluted samples show reduced spectral width and contain sharper EPR lines as compared with the spectrum obtained in the absence of dilution, which indicates the presence of significant spin-spin coupling in the undiluted form. In addition, our observation of spectral changes upon spin dilution indicates that the R1-labeled and unlabeled peptides can co-mix and form fibrils because fibrils formed from these co-mixing experiments have a morphology similar to that obtained for fibrils from wild-type IAPP alone (EM data, data not shown). These data suggest that the R1 label is tolerated well within the fibril, and that the cysteine-less, wild-type, and R1-labeled peptides can take up similar fibrillar structures. Next, we obtained EPR spectra for fibrils formed from undiluted (100% R1-labeled) and spin-diluted (at an R1-labeled to unlabeled wild-type IAPP peptide ratio of 1:4, 80% dilution) samples from all eight R1-labeled single cysteine analogs of IAPP (Fig. 4). All spectra obtained from undiluted samples were broadened beyond 100 G and were of low amplitude, indicating the presence of immobilization and/or spin-spin interactions. In contrast, spectra of diluted samples (Fig. 4, black lines) at all eight sites showed increased spectral amplitude, indicating the existence of intermolecular spin-spin interactions and close proximity of sites from neighboring molecules (see “Discussion”). To confirm the close proximity of R1-labeled sites using an independent approach, we employed a pyrene-labeled analog of IAPP. Fig. 3D shows the emission spectra for IAPP labeled with pyrene at the 21 position in the monomeric form in solution (black line), and after the formation of fibrillar aggregates (red line). In the case of the fibrillar sample, we observed a broad emission band at ∼472 nm characteristic of excited state pyrene dimer (excimer) emission, which was not observed in monomeric IAPP. Pyrene excimers are formed from the precise stacking of two monomers that are in physical contact and proper orientation. Therefore, the occurrence of pyrene excimer fluorescence in fibrillar IAPP indicates the close proximity of pyrene molecules from neighboring IAPP peptides and is in agreement with the interpretation of our EPR data. EPR Spectra of Spin-diluted Fibrils—To obtain additional details on the molecular structure of IAPP, we analyzed the mobility of R1 in the fibrillar form. Our spin dilution experiments indicate that spin-spin interactions significantly contribute to the spectral broadening and low signal amplitude observed in the fibrillar spectra. In the absence of spin-spin interactions, EPR line shapes provide information on the dynamics of R1. At sufficiently high dilution with unlabeled peptide, the EPR spectra from spin-labeled, fibrillar IAPP are determined primarily by R1 mobility. As shown in Fig. 4 (black lines), all spin-diluted spectra showed increased separation between the outer EPR lines and broad spectral lines compared with solution spectra, indicating the immobilization of R1 at all eight sites. Thus, in addition to R1-labeled sites on neighboring molecules being in close proximity to one another, each labeled site became much more ordered upon fibril formation. This immobilization was most pronounced at sites located in the central region of IAPP (sites between residues 12–29). Slightly less immobilization was observed for sites in the N terminus of the peptide as indicated by the larger signal amplitude and the slightly less narrow spectral lines for sites 2R1 and 7R1 (Fig. 4, arrows). A more quantitative comparison of mobility of the R1 label can be obtained using the inverse central line width, wherein larger values indicate higher mobility. The N-terminal residues 2R1 and 7R1 exhibited inverse line widths of 0.32 and 0.27 G-1, respectively, whereas sites between residues 12–29 had inverse line width values ranging from 0.13 to 0.17 G-1, suggesting that the two N-terminal sites experience less immobilization than do sites within the center of the peptide. Our objective was to characterize the structural organization of IAPP in its fibrillar form. Using EPR and SDSL, we found that IAPP undergoes a transition from a highly dynamic structure in solution to a very ordered, specific, and parallel structure in the fibril. Although the mobility of all eight sites was significantly reduced in the fibrillar form, we observed variations in R1 mobility that likely indicate distinct structural regions within IAPP. We found that the central region of IAPP (residues 12R1, 21R1, 27R1, 28R1 and 29R1) exhibited the least amount of mobility. Together with our observation of the presence of pronounced spin-spin interactions within this region, this lack of mobility suggests that these residues are located within the central β-sheet-containing core of the IAPP fibril. This interpretation agrees with previous analyses of IAPP fragments showing that residues 1–7 are not required for fibril formation (15Jaikaran E.T. Higham C.E. Serpell L.C. Zurdo J. Gross M. Clark A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35Westermark P. Engstrèom U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5036-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 36Nilsson M.R. Raleigh D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have observed that in addition to a reduction in mobility there was the presence of spin coupling at all eight sites, suggesting that the R1 label on each site of a given peptide is in close proximity to the same site on neighboring molecules. This interpretation is further supported by our observation of pyrene excimer fluorescence that constrains the pyrene molecules from neighboring peptides to be within physical contact. In a recent SDSL study of tau fibrils from singly labeled tau molecules, exchange-narrowed single-line EPR spectra lacking hyperfine structure (i.e. two outer peaks) were observed (21Margittai M. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10278-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Such exchange narrowing requires orbital overlap of the nitroxides from many spin labels on the EPR time scale, suggesting an extended stacking of R1 labels within the fibril. We observed reduced hyperfine structure (reduced intensity of outer peaks) for sites within the proposed core region, although not as pronounced as in the case of tau; thus, we cannot exclude the presence of spin exchange and possible contact between R1 labels from neighboring molecules for these sites. It is difficult to determine the precise amount of exchange present in our spectra; nevertheless, the presence of spin exchange could be significant. To establish an approximate upper limit, we used spectral subtraction to determine the relative contribution of the hyperfine peaks. Based upon these subtractions, we found that the contribution from spin exchange could be high at all sites within the core region and up to 50–90% for positions 21, 27 and 28 (data not shown). Thus, the presence of spin coupling at all eight sites in IAPP, coupled with the observation of pyrene excimer fluorescence, indicates a parallel arrangement of strands within the fibril. The present data on IAPP are strikingly similar to those obtained from our laboratory for the Alzheimer's Aβ peptide (23Torok M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the case of Aβ, we observed spin-spin interactions and EPR spectra quite comparable with those observed here. The EPR data, together with numerous solid-state NMR studies (37Benzinger T.L. Gregory D.M. Burkoth T.S. Miller-Auer H. Lynn D.G. Botto R.E. Meredith S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13407-13412Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 38Antzutkin O.N.

Therefore, given the similarity between our EPR data and that of Aβ, it is highly likely that a similar in-register parallel structure also applies to IAPP. In fact, a parallel arrangement might be much more common for proteins/peptides with longer core regions, such as IAPP, Aβ (23Torok M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J.

Soc. 1995; 117: 3539-3546Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 44Ashburn T.T. Auger M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 790-791Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, anti-parallel β-sheet arrangements have been reported. Recently, the role of amphipathicity in determining the parallel/anti-parallel organization of amyloid fibrils has been described (45Gordon D.J. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In Aβ-(1–40), the C terminus is considerably hydrophobic, whereas the charged hydrophilic residues are found toward the N-terminal half of the peptide. Gordon et al. (45Gordon D.J. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Meredith S.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 428-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) propose that this amphipathicity of Aβ-(1–40) is responsible for its parallel arrangement within fibrils, whereas a lack of amphipathicity facilitates the anti-parallel arrangement of shorter fragments of Aβ. Although comparable studies have not yet been performed for IAPP, inspection of the sequence points to the possibility that amphipathicity may also play a role in the organization of IAPP within fibrils. In full-length IAPP, the N-terminal 11-residue segment is hydrophilic, containing all three charged residues of IAPP. In contrast, the remaining two-thirds of the peptide contain 10 hydrophobic residues, 6 of which are found clustered within the C-terminal 15 residues. Such a separation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues imparts an amphipathicity to IAPP that may favor the parallel arrangement of full-length peptides within fibrils. The similarities between IAPP and Aβ could also extend to the organization of their respective domains, given the similarities observed between the primary sequence of IAPP and Aβ peptides (Fig. 5). O'Nuallain et al. (46O'Nuallain B. Williams A.D. Westermark P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17490-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) found a 65% sequence similarity when the overlap region was confined to residues 15–37, or the central core region, of Aβ. Furthermore, O'Nuallain et al. found that Aβ fibrils can act as efficient seeds for IAPP aggregation (but curiously, not the converse) (46O'Nuallain B. Williams A.D. Westermark P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17490-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), implying that at least under certain conditions IAPP could adopt a structure similar to that of Aβ (20Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 47Williams A.D. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J.T. Cook K.D. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) in the fibrillar form. Aβ contains a central ordered region that exhibits pronounced spin-spin interactions. The N-terminal region of Aβ is of lower order overall and exhibits weaker coupling, implying that the N terminus lies outside of the core. For the two IAPP N-terminal sites, 2R1 and 7R1, we observed inverse line with values of 0.32 and 0.27 G-1, respectively, suggesting a lower order for these sites. Although we have not yet tested every single site in the N terminus, these two values at least are very close to those obtained for similar sites from the N terminus of Aβ (23Torok M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), indicating the likelihood that the N terminus of IAPP is not within the most highly ordered core region. Furthermore, we find that the N-terminal cysteines are not required for fibril formation, and that the cysteine-less and wild-type peptides co-mix with labeled IAPP, suggesting that all three forms of the peptide can take up similar fibrillar structures. If the disulfide link between residues 2 and 7 remains intact during wild-type IAPP fibril formation in vivo, conformational constraints render it unlikely that the N-terminal region would facilitate the formation of a β-sheet structure. In summary, our EPR/SDSL data have allowed us to identify several structural features of IAPP in the fibrillar form. Our EPR data are consistent with a situation wherein IAPP fibrils are formed from the ordered parallel arrangement of IAPP monomers. Based upon side-chain mobility, we have been able to identify distinct structural regions of IAPP fibrils. Further EPR/SDSL studies should enable us to identify additional structural features of IAPP fibrils, such as bend or turn regions (48Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and ultimately to generate sufficient experimental constraints to develop a three-dimensional model of IAPP in the fibrillar form.

https://openalex.org/W2071878775,"The growth of human breast tumor cells is regulated through signaling involving cell surface growth factor receptors and nuclear receptors of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor gene family. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs), members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor gene family, are ligand-dependent transcription factors, which have in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory activity against breast cancer cells. RAR-agonists inhibit the proliferation of many human breast cancer cell lines, particularly those whose growth is stimulated by estradiol (E2) or growth factors. Additionally, RAR-agonists and synthetic retinoids such as Ferentinide have been shown to induce apoptosis in malignant breast cells but not normal breast cells. To better define the genes involved in RAR-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to create a database of genes that are potentially regulated by RAR-agonists in breast cancer cells. We found that PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4), a tumor suppressor gene presently being evaluated as a target for chemoprevention, was induced about three-fold by the RARα-selective agonist Am580, in T-47D breast cancer cells. RAR pan-agonists and Am580, but not retinoid X receptors (RXR)-agonists, stimulate the expression of PDCD4 in a wide variety of retinoid-inhibited breast cancer cell lines. RAR-agonists did not induce PDCD4 expression in breast cancer cell lines, which were not growth inhibited by retinoids. We also observed that antiestrogen and the HER-2/neu antagonist, Herceptin (Trastuzumab), also induced PDCD4 expression in T-47D cells, suggesting that PDCD4 may play a central role in growth inhibition in breast cancer cells. Transient overexpression of PDCD4 in T-47D (ER+, RAR+) and MDA-MB-231 (ER−, RAR−) cells resulted in apoptotic death, suggesting a role for PDCD4 in mediating apoptosis in breast cancer cells. PDCD4 protein expression has previously been reported in small ductal epithelium of normal breast. To date, there has been no report of induction of PDCD4 expression by RAR-agonists, antiestrogen or HER2/neu antagonist in breast cancer cells and its potential role in apoptosis in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966125710,"Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a member of the KLF family of zinc-finger transcription factors and is involved in maintaining T-cell quiescence, regulating preadipocyte differentiation, endothelial cell function and lung development. We used a tetracycline-inducible system in Jurkat T leukemia cells to study the biological role of KLF2 in cellular growth and differentiation. Our results show that expression of KLF2 inhibits cell growth in autonomously proliferating Jurkat cells. Further, 3H-thymidine uptake assays indicate that KLF2 inhibits DNA synthesis in these cells. Moreover, both activation and inhibitory domains are required for KLF2 to suppress Jurkat cell proliferation. In addition, KLF2 upregulates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. Additionally, we found that KLF2 upregulates p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activity in Jurkat, HepG2 and SW480 cells. Our analysis shows that the potential KLF2 responsive elements are located between −124 and −60 of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter. The sole CACCC site, a sequence recognized by KLF2, in this region is not the element responsive to KLF2. Finally, we determined that the Sp1-3-binding site is the functional responsive element of KLF2 in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, and we conclude that KLF2 directly regulates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2031607563,"The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) is regulated by interaction with various coregulators, one of which is beta-catenin. Interest in the role of beta-catenin in prostate cancer has been stimulated by reports showing that it is aberrantly expressed in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in up to 38% of hormone-refractory tumours and that overexpression of beta-catenin results in activation of AR transcriptional activity. We have examined the effect of depleting endogenous beta-catenin on AR activity using Axin and RNA interference. Axin, which promotes beta-catenin degradation, inhibited AR transcriptional activity. However, this did not require the beta-catenin-binding domain of Axin. Depletion of beta-catenin using RNA interference increased, rather than decreased, AR activity, suggesting that endogenous beta-catenin is not a transcriptional coactivator for the AR. The glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)-binding domain of Axin prevented formation of a GSK-3-AR complex and was both necessary and sufficient for inhibition of AR-dependent transcription. A second GSK-3-binding protein, FRAT, also inhibited AR transcriptional activity, as did the GSK-3 inhibitors SB216763 and SB415286. Finally, inhibition of GSK-3 reduced the growth of AR-expressing prostate cancer cell lines. Our observations suggest a potential new therapeutic application for GSK-3 inhibitors in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2008120376,"Protection against UV-mediated DNA damage and the onset of oncogenesis is afforded by the tanning response in which UV irradiation triggers melanocytes to increase production of melanin that is then transferred to keratinocytes. A key component of the tanning process is the UV-mediated induction of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and MC1R genes encoding the α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and its receptor, respectively, which play a crucial role in pigmentation by regulating the intracellular levels of cAMP. How these genes are regulated in response to UV irradiation is not known. Here we have shown that UV-induced activation of the POMC and MC1R promoters is mediated by p38 stress-activated kinase signaling to the transcription factor, upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF-1). Importantly, melanocytes derived from USF-1 -/- mice exhibit a defective UV response and fail to activate POMC and MC1R expression in response to UV irradiation.

The incidence of melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, is increasing at an alarming rate, with metastatic melanoma being notoriously refractive to treatment. Protection against UV-mediated DNA damage is afforded by the tanning response in which UV irradiation triggers melanocyte production of melanin. Melanin synthesis takes place in specific organelles, the melanosomes, which are transferred to keratinocytes (3Kadekaro A.L. Kavanagh R.J. Wakamatsu K. Ito S. Pipitone M.A. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Pigm.

Tyrosinase encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of melanin and is absolutely necessary for pigmentation and solar protection. POMC and MC1R gene expression are UV-inducible (5Chakraborty A.K. Funasaka Y. Slominski A. Ermak G. Hwang J. Pawelek J.M. Ichihashi M. Biochim. Biophys.

However, no molecular mechanism has yet been proposed to explain how UV irradiation might activate their expression. The cellular response to stress-inducing agents such as UV irradiation is known to be mediated by the activation of specific kinase cascades, the stress-activated protein kinase families, which include the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 signaling pathways. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) and the upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF-1) (23Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11985-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) are members of the evolutionary conserved family of b-HLH-LZ; significantly, both are downstream targets of the p38 stress-activated kinase (25Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 26Mansky K.C. Sankar U. Han J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although Mitf is restricted to the melanocyte lineage, USF-1 is expressed ubiquitously (28Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), yet both factors can bind the same specific E-box motifs (CANNTG) (20Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Specific interaction between E-box regulatory elements and b-HLH-LZ transcription factors is conferred by the composition of the residues within and outside the core E-box motif. However, a defined E-box motif can be the target site for different transcription factors depending on their relative amount and affinities. In silico analysis of the POMC and MC1R promoters revealed that both proximal promoters displayed several E-box motifs (29Moro O. Ideta R. Ifuku O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3492-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2342-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with only a small number conserved in humans, mouse, and rat species that could potentially interact with the Mitf and USF-1 transcription factors to mediate the response of POMC and MC1R to UV irradiation. We have shown here that the p38-activated USF-1 transcription factor is responsible for UV-induced POMC and MC1R gene expression and that only a restricted set of E-box motifs within the POMC and MC1R proximal promoters mediates the UV response. Using a genetic approach, we defined USF-1 as a key UV-responsive activator of genes implicated in protection from solar radiation. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Melan-a and melan-usf1 mouse melanocytes and 501 mel human melanoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (catalogue number 21875–034; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen) in a controlled atmosphere (10% CO2). For melanocytes the medium was supplemented with 200 nm tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, (TPA; Sigma). XB2 keratinocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalogue number 41966–029; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics in a controlled atmosphere (5% CO2). Immortalized USF-1 -/- mouse melanocytes (melan-usf1) were derived from USF-1 knockout mice and were grown as previously described (32Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), except in RPMI 1640 medium. Mitomycin C-treated XB2 feeder cells were used in establishment and thawing out of frozen stocks of this cell line. UVB Irradiation—Cells were irradiated using a UV Stratalinker apparatus (Stratagene); physiological UVB irradiation was 312 nm, 50–80 mJ/cm2, i.e. about 1 minimal erythemal dose. Cells were plated at 50–70% confluence, depending on their doubling time, in 10- and 3.5-cm diameter Petri dishes for RNA and protein preparation, respectively, such that they reached 80% confluence 48 h later (i.e. on UVB induction day). The medium was completely removed following overnight serum starvation and replaced immediately after UVB stimulation. When required, cells were pretreated with p38-specific family kinase inhibitor (10 μm SB203580) or with mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (10 μm U0126 or PD98059) for 30 min prior to UVB irradiation. Monolayer cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and then centrifuged at a low speed 3, 5, 8, 24 h following UVB treatment. Cell pellets were resuspended in either 300 μl of RNA-plus (Q-BIO-gene) solution for immediate mRNA extraction and storage at –80 °C until use or resuspended in Laemmli buffer for Western blotting analysis. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with RQ DNase (Promega) within the column to ensure the absence of genomic DNA. Reverse transcription reactions were done with the Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 1 μg of total RNA. Gene Expression Analysis—Real-time PCR was done in sealed 96-well microtiter plates using the SYBR Green™ PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was analyzed by using the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), and results were evaluated with the associated software (version 1.0; Applied Biosystems). The 18 S ribosomal RNA subunit, the values of which remain constant over 24 h, was used as an internal positive control. The relative amounts of POMC, MC1R, EDN1, TYR, and USF-1 transcripts were determined using the cycle threshold method as described by the manufacturer. The mRNA levels at each time point following UVB irradiation are expressed as -fold increase compared with non-irradiated control cells. Each experiment was performed at least twice, and each time point was done in duplicate. Forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were designed using the Primer Express software (version 2.0-PE; Applied Biosystems). The mouse (m) and human (h) primers used for real-time PCR were, respectively, as follows for the POMC, MC1R, END1, USF-1, TYR, and 18S genes. mPomc-F, 5′-ggtgaaggtgtaccccaacgt-3′; mPomc-R, 5′-gacctggctccaagcctaatgg-3′; mMc1r-F, 5′-ctctgcctcgtcactttctttcta-3′; mMc1r-R, 5′-tcgtgaacatgtgggcataca-3′; mEdn1-F, 5′-ccatgctggctgggatctt-3′; mEdn1-R, 5′-cctctgcccgtctggaacaa-3′; mUSF-1-F, 5′-acccttattccccgaagtcaga-3′; mUSF-1-R, 5′-cggcgtccacttcgttatgt-3′; mTyr-F, 5′-tccttctgtccagtgcaccat-3′; mTyr-R, 5′-cacagagggccaggactca-3′; m18S-F, 5′-aggttctggccaacggtctag-3′; m18S-R, 5′-ccctctatgggctcgaatttt-3′; hPOMC-F, 5′-aagcgctacggcggtttc-3′; hPOMC-R, 5′-tcttgtaggcttcttgatgatg-3′; hMC1R-F, 5′-tggacaatgtcattgacgtgatc-3′; hMC1R-R, 5′-tggtagcgagtgcgtagaa-3′; h18S-F, 5′-cctagcaatggtctggacaa-3′; h18S-R, 5′-tctatgggcccgaatcttctt-3′. Western Blotting Analysis—Whole cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE using a 200:1 acrylamide: bis-acrylamide ratio. Following blotting, membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and positive signals detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by using the ECL Super Signal detection kit (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were a polyclonal anti-USF-1 Ab (USF-C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology; Biolabs Inc.), and a monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma). Immunolocalization—Immunolocalization experiments were performed as described previously (33Costin G.E. Valencia J.C. Vieira W.D. Lamoreux M.L. Hearing V.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3203-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), using anti-tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and Dct antibodies (kindly provided by V. Hearing, National Institutes of Health) and nonspecific antibody for negative control. Mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vectashield®; Vector Laboratories) was used for nuclear localization. Melanin Content—The melanin content of each cell line was determined by spectrophotometry. Briefly, melanocyte cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and counted. Melanin was solubilized in 0.2 m NaOH (106 cells/ml). Melanin concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 475 nm and comparing with a standard curve of known synthetic melanin concentrations (Sigma). Melanin content is expressed in μg/106 cells. Transient Transfection Assays—For in vivo gene expression analysis, cells were plated in supplemented medium in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes and allowed to grow overnight to 80% confluence. Following medium removal, cells were transfected for 1 h using the specific transfection medium OptiMEM (catalogue number 51985–026; Invitrogen) containing up to 5 μg of total plasmid DNA, including 4 μg of USF-1 constructs (WT pCMV-USF-1 or T153E and T153A mutants), 500 ng each of p38 and MKK6(b)E expression vector (pCDNA p38; pCDNA MKK6(b)E), or empty vector mixed with the Transfast™ reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, OptiMEM was removed and replaced with fresh medium. 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and subjected to RNA extraction as previously described. The RNA was subjected to POMC and MC1R gene expression analysis using real-time PCR. For luciferase reporter analysis, cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected as described above using up to 1 μg of plasmid DNA. 48 h post-transfection, harvested cells were passively lysed using Promega's buffer. Cell lysates (100 μl/well) were screened for luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were quantified using a luminometer apparatus (Turner Design). POMC and MC1R promoters were isolated by PCR, cut with BamH1 and EcoRI, and cloned into the luciferase reporter pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega). The POMC and MC1R E-boxes were mutated with the GeneTailor™ mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) using five specific oligonucleotides (sequences available on request). The pCMV-USF-1 WT and point-mutated constructs have been described previously (27Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The p38 expression vector and MKK6(b)E were provided by Dr. Jiahan Han and have been described previously (34Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Gel Shift Assay—Gel electrophoresis DNA binding assays with crude 501 mel nuclear extracts (4 μg) were performed as previously described (35Galibert M.D. Miyagoe Y. Meo T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6099-6109PubMed Google Scholar) along with Klenow-labeled probes (0.5 ng). For supershift experiments, the DNA binding reactions were incubated for a further 45 min on ice with a polyclonal anti-USF-1 antibody (200 ng; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with nonspecific IgG (anti-rabbit Ab; Amersham Biosciences). The products were loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio) and subjected to electrophoresis at 200 V for 1 h. The sequences of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes and competitors were as follows: hMC1R-E-box (-461)-F, 5′-agacgcccccggcatgtggccgccctct-3′; hMC1R-E-box (-461)-R, 5′-agacagggcggccacatgccgggggcgt-3′; hPOMC-E-box (-200)-F, 5′-agagcgagcggccaggtgcgccttcggt-3′; hPOMC-E-box (-200)-R, 5′-agaccgaaggcgcacctggccgctcgct-3′; hTYR-E-box (-183)-F, 5′-agaaaagtcagtcatgtgcttttcagat-3′; hTYR-E-box (-183)-R, 5′-agatctgaaaagcacatgactgactttt-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed in human and mouse cell lines (melan-a, 501 mel, XB2) essentially as described previously (36Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) using 10 μl of specific antibody (USF-1 Ab; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nonspecific IgG (anti-rabbit Ab; Amersham Biosciences). The recovered DNA was subjected to PCR, ensuring that the reaction stayed in the log phase. The primers used to amplify the promoters of the human (h) and mouse (m) TYR, MC1R, POMC, and HSP70 genes were as follows (F: forward, R: reverse): hTYR-F, 5′-gtgggatacgagccaattcga-3′; hTYR-R, 5′-cctctagtcctcacaaggtctgca-3′; mTyr-F, 5′-tcatgagattcaaattgcctagagat-3′; mTyr-R, 5′-cagacagtaaatcccaagccaagat-3′; hMC1R-F, 5′-cgcgcgatgtgccaaactcctg-3′; hMC1R-R, 5′-gtcgttctcagagcccctcc-3′; mMc1r-F, 5′-gtttcagacaacccaggaaagtg-3′; mMc1r-R, 5′-cagaccggcctctttccata-3′; hPOMC-F, 5′-gacccaacgccatccataat-3′; hPOMC-R, 5′-ggagagacgcgctggaaa-3′; mPomc-F, 5′-aagtggagattcaacaccattcttaa-3′; mPomc-R, 5′-gtccagagctgagacacccttac-3′; h,mHSP70-F, 5′-aatcccagaagactctggagagt-3′; h,mHSP70-R, 5′-ggcttttataagtcgtcacggag-3′. POMC and MC1R UV Response—α-MSH, derived from POMC, and the MC1R receptor are key upstream regulators of the pigmentation cascade (4Abdel-Malek Z. Swope V.B. Suzuki I. Akcali C. Harriger M.D. Boyce S.T. Urabe K. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Although both α-MSH and the MC1R receptor genes are UV-inducible (5Chakraborty A.K. Funasaka Y. Slominski A. Ermak G. Hwang J. Pawelek J.M. Ichihashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 22Scott M.C. Suzuki I. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism that mediates their UV responsiveness has yet to be defined. As a first step, we examined constitutive and UV-induced POMC and MC1R expression levels in different skin cell types implicated in the pigmentation process: mouse keratinocytes (XB2), mouse melanocytes (melan-a), and human melanoma (501 mel). Using real-time PCR, we were able to show that POMC and MC1R respond to a physiological dose of UVB irradiation (50 mJ/cm2 UVB), although time courses and amplitudes differed (Table I).Table IPOMC, MC1R response to UVB irradiationCell typeConstitutive expressionUVB inducibilityXB2POMC303×2, 8 at 24 hMC1R1037×3 at 8 hMelan-aPOMC100×7, 2 at 3 hMC1R1374×7, 9 at 3 h501 MelPOMC19×7, 2 at 8 hMC1R971×7, 7 at 8 h Open table in a new tab p38 Kinase Pathway Mediates POMC and MC1R UV-induced Expression—UV irradiation activates stress signaling via both the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 pathways (25Ono K.

To identify the signaling pathway required for regulation of POMC and MC1R UVB expression, we used real-time PCR to examine the response over time of the POMC and MC1R genes to UV irradiation in 501 mel cells in the presence or absence of the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (34Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or, as controls, inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (U0126, PD96059). 501 mel cells were used because they exhibit a robust response of these genes to UVB irradiation. The results (Fig. 1, A and B) indicate that the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 inhibited UV-mediated induction of both POMC and MC1R gene expression, strongly suggesting that the p38 stress-activated protein kinase is implicated in the UV responsiveness of POMC and MC1R gene expression. By contrast, neither U0126 nor PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors) had any effect (data not shown). USF-1 Transcription Factor and POMC, MC1R UV-induced Expression—The b-HLH-LZ transcription activators Mitf and USF-1 are both expressed in melanocytes, bind the same E-box motifs in vitro and in vivo (20Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and-significantly-both are phosphorylated and activated by the p38 stress-activated kinase (26Mansky K.C.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because the POMC and MC1R promoters contain E-box elements that are potentially responsive to both Mitf or USF-1 (see below), either factor could potentially mediate the response of these genes to UV irradiation. We therefore sought a genetic approach to resolve this key issue. Because Mitf-null mice lack all pigment cells (38Steingrimsson E. Moore K.J. Lamoreux M.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Zimring D.C. Skow L.C. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), it was not possible to examine the UV responsiveness of Mitf -/- melanocytes. By contrast, USF-1-null mice exhibit normal levels of pigmentation (39Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20175-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), indicating that USF-1 is unlikely to play a major role in melanocyte development. We therefore derived a melanocyte cell line (melan-usf1) from newborn USF-1 knockout mice. In agreement with the genetic modification of the melan-usf1 cell line and unlike the WT melanocyte cell line, no USF-1 transcripts were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 2A), although we observed similar steady state expression of the POMC, MC1R, Tyrosinase, and EDN1 genes (Fig. 2A) as well as TYRP1 and DCT mRNA levels (not shown). In agreement with the lack of USF-1 mRNA, no USF-1 protein was detected by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2B). As expected, inactivation of the USF-1 gene did not affect the p38 kinase signaling pathway, which was still activated by UV irradiation as determined by Western blotting for phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 2B) 3 h post-UV irradiation in both WT and USF-1-null melanocytes and inhibited by SB 203580 (not shown). Western blotting also confirmed that in WT cells the presence of phosphorylated p38 correlated with the appearance of a low mobility form of USF-1 that corresponds to the p38-phosphorylated USF-1. Further characterization of the USF-1-negative melanocytes (melan-usf1) suggested they shared most characteristics of their WT counterparts. Both cell lines are dendritic and express the melanosomal proteins (Tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and Dct) with a similar cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the lack of USF-1 does not affect the accumulation of a basal level of melanin (19.62 and 18.1 μg/106 cells, respectively) (Fig. 2C). The doubling time of the USF-1-null melanocytes was evaluated by time lapse analysis and appeared to be slightly longer than that of WT cells (about 24 and 20 h, respectively), although M phase was completed in about 70 min and no mitotic abnormalities could be observed in the daughter cells (not shown). In contrast to WT melanocytes, those lacking USF-1 exhibited a dramatically altered ability to respond to UV irradiation. Although the levels of both POMC and MC1R mRNA peaked after 3 h in the melan-a cell line (>7-fold increase), no substantial effect of UV irradiation was detected in expression of these genes in the USF-1-null melanocytes in the 8 h following UV exposure (Fig. 2, D and E) or at 48 h (not shown), ruling out the possibility that the kinetics of activation were severely delayed. As a positive control for the ability of UV irradiation to activate gene USF-1-independent expression, we chose the Endothelin-1 gene (EDN1) that is implicated in the pigmentation process independently of the POMC and MC1R genes and that has been previously shown to be up-regulated in response to UV irradiation (5Chakraborty A.K.

Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although no clear regulatory pathway has been identified for the EDN1 UV response, in silico analysis failed to find any E-box element within the EDN1 promoter with the potential to bind either Mitf or USF-1. Following UV irradiation, the EDN1 gene was induced to a similar degree in both WT and USF-1-null melanocytes. Taken together these data strongly suggest that the USF-1 transcription factor is implicated in the up-regulation of POMC and MC1R gene expression following exposure to UVB irradiation. USF-1-expressing Vector Restores POMC and MC1R UV Response in USF-1-null Cells—To confirm that the defective response of USF-1-null melanocytes to UV irradiation was caused by the absence of USF-1, we transiently transfected the USF-1-negative melanocyte cell line with vectors expressing either WT USF-1 or mutant forms of USF-1 in which the p38 phosphorylation site (Thr-153) (27Galibert M.D. Carreira S. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) is mutated to either alanine or glutamic acid. The glutamic acid substitution acts to mimic p38 phosphorylation and renders USF-1 largely independent of p38. Cells were then exposed to physiolo"

In various studies, the proteasome and the vacuole have each been reported to be the major site of FBPase degradation. Because different growth conditions were used in these studies, we examined whether variations in growth conditions could alter the site of FBPase degradation. Here, we demonstrated that FBPase was degraded outside the vacuole (most likely in the proteasome), when glucose was added to cells that were grown in low glucose media for a short period of time. By contrast, cells that were grown in the same low glucose media for longer periods of time degraded FBPase in the vacuole in response to glucose. Another gluconeogenic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) showed the same degradation characteristics as FBPase in that the short term starvation of cells led to a non-vacuolar degradation, whereas long term starvation resulted in the vacuolar degradation of this protein. The N-terminal proline is required for the degradation of FBPase and MDH2 for both the vacuolar and non-vacuolar proteolytic pathways. The cAMP signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of glucose were needed for the vacuolar-dependent degradation of FBPase and MDH2. By contrast, the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway was not involved in the non-vacuolar degradation of these proteins, although the phosphorylation of glucose was required."

We therefore examined directly by flow cytometry the capacity of mast cells to generate intracellular ROS and NO using the respective cell-permeable fluorescent probes dichlorodihydrofluorescein and diaminofluorescein and evaluated the effects of inhibitors of ROS and NO synthesis on cell degranulation.

In contrast, we found that interferon (Ifn)-γ stimulated or spontaneous NO production by rat or mouse peritoneal mast cells diminished as mast cells were progressively purified, such that even in preparations that contained 98–99% mast cells, the NO production could be fully accounted for by the residual 1–2% non-mast cells (27Eastmond N.C.

Furthermore, mixed populations of macrophages and mast cells produced NO in response to Ifn-γ only when the macrophages expressed the Ifn-γ receptor (29Brooks B. Briggs D.M. Eastmond N.C. Fernig D.G. Coleman J.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

We used exclusively tissue-derived or primary culture-derived mast cells rather than mast cells of tumor phenotype as used in many previous studies. Our results show that activated tissue type or primary cultured rodent and human mast cells generate intracellular ROS. Inhibition of ROS production led to suppression of IgE/antigen-mediated degranulation in all mast cell types, indicating a functional link between these responses. However, activated rodent and human mast cells did not generate intracellular NO or express NOS2 protein, and inhibitors of NO synthesis were without effect on cell activation. Animals and Reagents—Female Brown Norway rats (150–200 g) were obtained from Harlan Olac (Bicester, UK) and maintained in the university animal housing unit where food and water were provided ad libitum. Rats were sensitized by subcutaneous injection of ovalbumin (OVA)/alum (2 × 0.2 ml, total dose of 80 μg of OVA, 8 mg of aluminum hydroxide) on days 0 and 7, and the rats were sacrificed humanely on day 14 by asphyxiation in CO2. Experimental procedures were approved by the University of Liverpool and were in accordance with guidelines set by the Home Office (London, UK). Aluminum hydroxide, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), l-glutamine, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), OVA, mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody, toluidine blue, trypan blue, sulfanilamide and N-(1-napthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride were purchased from Sigma. Fetal calf serum, gentamicin, and Hanks' balanced saline solution were from Invitrogen. 4,5-Diaminofluorescein (DAF-2) diacetate, dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) diacetate, aminoguanidine (AG), and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) were obtained from CN Biosciences (Nottingham, UK). Cytokines were obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Lysis buffer and SDS-polyacrylamide gels were from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal anti-NOS2 and rabbit anti-Lyn antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-NOS2 was from Calbiochem. Cell culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen or BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Cell Isolation and Cultures—Rat mast cells and macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage and purified by density gradient fractionation as described previously (16Swindle E.J. Hunt J.A. Coleman J.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5866-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified mast cell preparations contained >98% mast cells, whereas the macrophage preparations contained >95% monocyte/macrophages and <1% mast cells by metachromatic staining in 0.05% toluidine blue and by Giemsa staining of cytospin preparations. Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) were grown from femoral marrow cells of BALB/c mice and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, 0.0035% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30 ng/ml mouse interleukin-3. Cells were used after 4–6 weeks of culture. Human mast cells (HUMC) were grown from CD34-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells, obtained following informed consent. CD34-positive cells were cultured in interleukin-3 (week 1 only), stem cell factor, and interleukin-6 as described (30Kirshenbaum A.S. Goff J.P. Semere T. Foster B. Scott L.M. Metcalfe D.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HUMC were >95% pure by toluidine blue staining of cytospin preparations and were used after 8–10 weeks of culture. Cell Degranulation and Nitrite Assays—Mast cells from OVA-sensitized rats, as well as BMMC or HUMC optimally sensitized with mouse IgE anti-DNP or biotinylated human IgE, respectively (both at 100 ng/ml for 24 h), were seeded at 10–50,000/well in 80 μl in a 96-well cell culture plate. Enzyme inhibitors (10 μl) were added for 1 h, the cells were challenged with 10 μl of the appropriate antigen (OVA (1 μg/ml), DNP30-HSA (100 ng/ml), or streptavidin (SA, 100 ng/ml), respectively), and degranulation was measured as the release of serotonin or β-hexosaminidase as described (16Swindle E.J. Hunt J.A. Coleman J.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5866-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E. Satterthwaite A.B. Nahm D.H. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mediator release was expressed as the percentage of total cell content after subtracting background release from unstimulated cells. NO production was monitored as accumulated supernatant nitrite (the stable product of NO) by Griess assay as described (27Eastmond N.C. Banks E.M.S. Coleman J.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1444-1450PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent Detection of Intracellular ROS and NO—Intracellular ROS and NO were measured by flow cytometry employing the fluorescent probes DCF (the intracellular product of DCF diacetate that fluoresces in the presence of ROS) and DAF-2 (the intracellular product of DAF-2 diacetate that fluoresces in the presence of NO). Macrophages and purified RPMC, BMMC, or HUMC (at 105-106/ml) were incubated for 1 or 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with or without l-NMMA (100–500 μm), AG (100 μg/ml), or DPI (1–5 μm). Then DAF-2 diacetate or DCF diacetate was added (2–20 μm) for 0.5–1 h before stimulation. Forward light scatter (FS), side scatter (SS), and cell fluorescence were analyzed (10,000 events) at various times from 1 min to 48 h after stimulation (FACscan flow cytometer and associated Lysis II software, BD Biosciences). Macrophage fluorescence was monitored over the entire log FS versus log SS plot, whereas BMMC and HUMC were gated according to FS and SS parameters, and RPMC were gated in areas defined as mast cells by fluorescent staining with phycoerythrin-rabbit anti-rat IgE serum (Liverpool University in-house preparation). After flow cytometric analysis, samples were centrifuged (400 × g, 5 min), and supernatants were removed (50 μl) in duplicate for a nitrite assay. Viability of the pelleted cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Immunoblots for NOS2 Protein—IgE-loaded BMMC and HUMC were incubated in complete medium with or without the appropriate antigen or LPS and Ifn-γ under conditions that optimally induced cell activation measured as degranulation and ROS production. At various times (2–24 h), the cells were washed twice in serum-free medium, suspended at 2 × 106/ml, and then mixed with an equal volume of boiling lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture, and 2-mercaptoethanol as described (32Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were boiled for 3 min and electrophoresed on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-NOS2 or rabbit polyclonal anti-NOS2. To monitor protein loading, blots were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin or rabbit anti-Lyn. Blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescent reagent and then exposed to x-ray film. Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by two-tailed Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Intracellular ROS Production and Relationship to Degranulation in Antigen-stimulated Mast Cells—Intracellular ROS production was monitored using the ROS-sensitive fluorescent probe DCF, and the effects of the flavoenzyme inhibitor DPI and the NOS inhibitor l-NMMA on both ROS production and cell degranulation were evaluated. In the case of RPMC, OVA produced a dramatic shift to the left of mast cell SS after 30 min (Fig. 1A), reflecting the loss of granularity associated with degranulation. As shown in scatter plots of FL1 versus SS (Fig. 1, B–E), after 30 min, OVA increased the number of ROS-positive cells (FL1, upper left and upper right quadrants) from 13% to 54% and increased the number of fully degranulated cells (lower left and upper left quadrants) from 10% to 31% (compare Fig. 1, B and C). The number of cells that were both fully degranulated and ROS-positive (upper left quadrant) increased from 1% to 19% (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, a substantial proportion of antigen-activated RPMC degranulated and simultaneously produced intracellular ROS. Pre-exposure to DPI returned OVA-induced numbers of ROS-positive cells to control levels (from 54% back to 12%) and reduced the number of fully degranulated mast cells from 30% to 15% (Fig. 1D). l-NMMA was without effect on OVA-induced degranulation and ROS production (Fig. 1E). Histograms of cell number versus FL1 for IgE-positive RPMC populations confirmed antigen-induced DCF fluorescence (Fig. 1F) and inhibition by DPI (Fig. 1G) but not l-NMMA (Fig. 1H). Antigen stimulation of BMMC and HUMC led to ROS production that peaked at 2 min (Fig. 1, I and L). The BMMC ROS response to antigen was considerably greater than that of RPMC (compare Fig. 1, F–I), whereas the HUMC ROS response was less than that of BMMC but comparable with that of RPMC (compare Fig. 1L with I and F). In both BMMC and HUMC, the ROS response was inhibited by DPI (Fig. 1, J and M) but not l-NMMA (Fig. 1, K and N). Analysis of data pooled from replicated experiments confirmed that for each mast cell type, antigen elicited significant ROS generation, and this was blocked by DPI but not l-NMMA (Fig. 2, A–C). To investigate the possible functional roles of ROS or NO in mast cell degranulation, we studied the effects of DPI and l-NMMA on antigen-induced mediator release. DPI almost completely blocked antigen-induced degranulation of RPMC and HUMC (Fig. 2, D and E) but produced only a small inhibitory effect on BMMC responses (Fig. 2F). l-NMMA, at concentrations that routinely inhibited NO production by macrophages, was without effect on antigen-induced degranulation of all three mast cell types (Fig. 2, D–F). The relationship between intracellular ROS production and mast cell degranulation was further explored in RPMC as in this mast cell type, both responses can be measured concurrently by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3A, the OVA-induced shift to the left of SS, reflecting cell degranulation, was blocked by DPI. Over five separate experiments, OVA stimulation increased significantly the number of cells that were simultaneously positive for degranulation (SS shift) and ROS production (from ∼12 to 60%), and this response was blocked by DPI but not l-NMMA (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with Figs. 1D and 2A showing that DPI blocked ROS production and Fig. 2D showing that DPI blocked antigen-induced serotonin release by RPMC. It is evident from these data that inhibition of ROS production is associated with inhibition of cell degranulation. Antigen-activated Mast Cells Do Not Produce Intracellular NO—Intracellular NO was measured by DAF-2 fluorescence in OVA- and LPS- and Ifn-γ-stimulated RPMC, DNP-HSA-stimulated BMMC, and SA-stimulated HUMC, and the effects of NOS inhibitors on FL1 fluorescence were examined. In the first series of experiments, RPMC were incubated overnight with the NOS inhibitors l-NMMA or AG before incorporation of DAF-2 for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with OVA under optimized conditions, and DAF-2 fluorescence and degranulation were monitored as described above. Following OVA stimulation for 0.5 h, the percentage of mast cells fully degranulated (upper left and lower left quadrants) increased from 3 to 18%, but there was only a negligible change in DAF-2 fluorescence (upper left and upper right quadrants) (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, in contrast to ROS detection (Fig. 1C), OVA did not lead to the appearance of cells in the upper left quadrant, i.e. FL1-positive degranulating cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, the FL1 signal was not reversed by either l-NMMA (Fig. 4C) or AG (Fig. 4D). Histograms of DAF-2-dependent fluorescence confirmed that OVA produced no DAF-2 signal (Fig. 4E) and that l-NMMA (Fig. 4F) and AG (Fig. 4G) were without effect. Similar responses were observed for BMMC or HUMC. Stimulation with the appropriate antigen produced no DAF-2 signal (Fig. 4, H and K, respectively), and l-NMMA or AG had no effect (Fig. 4, I–J and L–M). The unresponsiveness of all types of antigen-stimulated mast cells with respect to DAF-2 fluorescence was in sharp contrast to rat macrophages. When these cells were stimulated with LPS and Ifn-γ, a dramatic shift in DAF-2 fluorescence was observed that was fully inhibited by both l-NMMA and AG (Fig. 4, N–P). Averaged data across experiments confirmed that OVA, SA, or DNP-HSA did not induce NO production (elevated FL1) within 30 min of stimulation of RPMC, HUMC, or BMMC, respectively, and accordingly, l-NMMA and AG were without effect (Fig. 5, A–C). In RPMC, later time points of 1, 7, and 24 h after OVA stimulation were also investigated and produced similar results showing a lack of NO production over 24 h. In the same experiments, OVA did not induce the release of NO detectable as nitrite (Table I). The unresponsiveness of mast cells to antigen was in sharp contrast to rat macrophages, which showed a marked increase in DAF-2 fluorescence following stimulation with LPS and Ifn-γ, which was fully inhibited by both l-NMMA and AG (Fig. 5D).Table INitrite levels (μm) in supernatants from mast cells and macrophagesMast cellsMacrophagesOVALPS + Ifn-γLPS + Ifn-γLPS + Ifn-γLPS + Ifn-γ24 h24 h48 h24 h48 hUnstimulatedNDNDND2"
https://openalex.org/W1980443338,"The bilateral cardiac mesoderm migrates from the lateral region of the embryo to the ventral midline, where it fuses to form the primitive heart tube. It is generally accepted that migration and fusion are essential for subsequent stages of cardiac morphogenesis. We present evidence that, in Foxp4 mutant embryonic mice, each bilateral heart-forming region is capable of developing into a highly differentiated four-chambered mammalian heart in the absence of midline fusion. These data demonstrate that left-right chamber specification, cardiac looping, septation, cardiac myocyte differentiation, and endocardial cushion formation are preprogrammed in the precardiac mesoderm and do not require midline positional identity or heart tube fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1987721350,"The diverse checkpoint responses to DNA damage may reflect differential sensitivities by molecular components of the damage-signalling network to the type and amount of lesions. Here, we determined the kinetics of activation of the checkpoint kinases ATM and Chk2 (the latter substrate of ATM) in relation to the initial yield of genomic DNA single-strand (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs). We show that doses of γ-radiation (IR) as low as 0.25 Gy, which generate vast numbers of SSBs but only a few DSBs per cell (<8), promptly activate ATM kinase and induce the phosphorylation of the ATM substrates p53–Ser15, Nbs1–Ser343 and Chk2–Thr68. The full activation of Chk2 kinase, however, is triggered by treatments inflicting >19 DSBs per cell (e.g. 1 Gy), which cause Chk2 autophosphorylation on Thr387, Chk2-dependent accumulation of p21waf1 and checkpoint arrest in the S phase. Our results indicate that, in contrast to ATM, Chk2 activity is triggered by a greater number of DSBs, implying that, below a certain threshold level of lesions (<19 DSBs), DNA repair can occur through ATM, without enforcing Chk2-dependent checkpoints."
https://openalex.org/W2122644281,"We previously showed that mice lacking galectin-3/AGE-receptor 3 develop accelerated diabetic glomerulopathy. To further investigate the role of galectin-3/AGE-receptor function in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease, galectin-3 knockout (KO) and coeval wild-type (WT) mice were injected for 3 months with 30 microg/day of N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML)-modified or unmodified mouse serum albumin (MSA). Despite receiving equal doses of CML, KO had higher circulating and renal AGE levels and showed more marked renal functional and structural changes than WT mice, with significantly higher proteinuria, albuminuria, glomerular, and mesangial area and glomerular sclerosis index. Renal 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal content and NFkappaB activation were also more pronounced in KO-CML vs. WT-CML. Kidney mRNA levels of fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV, and TGF-beta were up-regulated, whereas those of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -14 were down-regulated, again more markedly in KO-CML than WT-CML mice. Basal and CML-induced RAGE and 80K-H mRNA levels were higher in KO vs. WT mice. MSA injection did not produce any significant effect in both genotypes. The association of galectin-3 ablation with enhanced susceptibility to AGE-induced renal disease, increased AGE levels and signaling, and altered AGE-receptor pattern indicates that galectin-3 is operating in vivo as an AGE receptor to afford protection toward AGE-dependent tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W1983831398,"Otoacoustic emissions or OAEs (reflections of cochlear energy produced during the processing of sound) were measured in response to two types of stimuli, rapid clicks and sustained tones, in each ear of neonates. OAEs were larger to tones when elicited in the left ear and to clicks when elicited in the right. This finding is similar to those of enhanced processing of tones in right auditory cortical areas and of rapid stimuli on the left, given strong crossed connections from ear to brain. These findings indicate that processing at the level of the ear may facilitate lateralization of auditory function in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2107550277,"Edema and insufficient blood perfusion are common problems in reconstructive surgery. The blood vasculature is reconstructed in microvascular flaps, whereas lymphatic vessel function is lost after surgical incision. Here, we demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) gene transfer can be used to reconstruct a lymphatic vessel network severed by incision of skin flaps. We used adenoviral VEGF-C gene transfer at the edges of epigastric skin flaps in mice. Our results show that VEGF-C gene expression results in the formation of anastomoses between the lymphatic vessels of the skin flap and the surrounding lymphatic vasculature. Some spontaneous lymphangiogenesis also took place in the control mice, but the lymphatic vessels generated remained nonfunctional even 2 months postoperatively. In contrast, the VEGF-C treated mice demonstrated persistent lymphatic vessel function during the 2 month follow-up despite the transient nature of the adenoviral VEGF-C gene expression. The restoration of lymphatic function by VEGF-C in skin flaps provides new tools to promote vascular perfusion and to reduce tissue edema in skin and muscle flaps. These results have important implications for the prevention and treatment of surgically induced secondary lymphedema."
https://openalex.org/W2011590696,"Survivin regulates cell division and inhibits apoptosis by blocking caspase activation. The tumor suppressor p53 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis. Since Survivin overexpression and loss of wild-type p53 expression/function occur in most cancers, we investigated whether Survivin regulates p53. Stable overexpression of Survivin protects BaF3 cells from Adriamycin-induced apoptosis, while dominant-negative (T34A) and antisense (AS) Survivin accelerate apoptosis. In BaF3 cells and transiently transfected MCF7 breast cancer cells, elevation of total and phospho-Ser15-p53 in response to Adriamycin is blocked by Survivin and enhanced by Survivin disruption. Furthermore, in Adriamycin-treated MCF7 cells, ectopic Survivin decreased p53 mRNA and increased mRNA and protein of the p53 homologues DeltaNp63 and TAp73 and mRNA for DeltaNp73, suggesting that Survivin may differentially regulate p53 family transcription. Concomitant with decreasing p53 mRNA, Survivin decreased Mdm2 mRNA. Survivin disruption by T34A or AS Survivin resulted in reduced Mdm2 protein. The caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, blocked the decrease in Mdm2 as well as the increase in p53 resulting from Survivin disruption, indicating that Survivin regulates Mdm2 at the post-translational level. Proteosome inhibition confirmed that reduced p53 protein observed in cells overexpressing Survivin is due to enhanced p53 degradation resulting from Survivin-mediated inhibition of Mdm2 cleavage by caspases. In summary, our results identify regulatory interactions between Survivin and p53 at the mRNA and protein levels, and suggest that the p53 homologues DeltaNp63, TAp73 and DeltaNp73 may also be regulated by Survivin."

https://openalex.org/W2053441326,"Estrogen stimulates the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens into estrogens, and synthetic aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane have proven to be effective endocrine regimens for ER-positive breast cancer. In a recent study, we have found that 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxycoumarin is a potent competitive inhibitor of aromatase with respect to the androgen substrate. Its Ki value was determined to be 84 nm, significantly more potent than several known aromatase inhibitors. The specific interaction of this compound with aromatase was further demonstrated by the reduction of its binding by several mutations at the active site region of aromatase and evaluated by computer modeling analysis. The structure-activity studies have revealed that three functional groups (i.e. 3-(4′-chlorophenyl), 4-benzyl, and 7-methoxyl) of this coumarin are important in its inhibition of aromatase. In addition, through a matrigel thread three-dimensional cell culture, this compound was shown to behave like known aromatase inhibitors that suppress the proliferation of aromatase and estrogen receptor positive MCF-7aro breast cancer cells. This coumarin has been shown not to be cytotoxic at up to 40 μm. It was found not to be an inhibitor of steroid 5α-reductase that also utilizes androgen as the substrate and not to be a ligand of ERα, ERβ, estrogen-related receptors, or androgen receptor. These results demonstrate that coumarins (a common type of phytochemical) or their derivatives can be potent inhibitors of aromatase and may be useful in suppressing aromataseand ER-positive breast tumors. Estrogen stimulates the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells.

Phytochemicals are powerful food factors, found in fruits, vegetables, herbs, and other whole foods, that elicit profound effects on our health. The research into how phytochemicals work and the role they play in human bodies is expanding rapidly. A significant number of phytochemicals have been found to interact with enzymes and nuclear receptors in specific manners, leading to the modulation of selective physiological mechanisms. For example, genistein in soybeans is known to be an agonist of estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERR, estrogen-related receptor; AR, androgen receptor. (1Martin P.M. Horwitz K.B. Ryan D.S. McGuire W.L. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), thus, this chemical is thought to compete with estrogen for binding to ER. Furthermore, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in green tea has been recently reported to be an inhibitor of 5-cytosine DNA methyltransferase (2Fang M.Z. Wang Y. Ai N. Hou Z. Sun Y. Lu H. Welsh W. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7563-7570PubMed Google Scholar). It was predicted that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate could prevent or reverse gene silencing by suppressing DNA methylation. In our laboratory, several flavones have been demonstrated to be effective inhibitors of aromatase (estrogen synthetase) (3Kao Y.C. Zhou C. Sherman M. Laughton C.A. Chen S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and NADPH:quinone reductase 1 and 2 (4Liu X.F. Liu M.L. Iyanagi T. Legesse K. Lee T.D. Chen S.A. Mol.

Recently, isoflavones and flavones have also been shown to be agonists of estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) (7Suetsugi M. Su L. Karlsberg K. Yuan Y.C. Chen S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 981-991PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, these chemicals can modulate the biological activity of these receptors. Furthermore, we have isolated and identified procyanidin B dimers from red wine and grape seeds that act as competitive inhibitors of aromatase, and oral intake of these chemicals suppresses the growth of aromatase-mediated breast tumors in nude mice (8Eng E.T.

Coumarins are a major type of phytochemicals, and the therapeutic potential of several coumarins have been discussed (9Hoult J.R. Paya M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several coumarin derivatives have been reported to be steroid sulfatase inhibitors and evaluated for breast cancer therapy (10Shields-Botella J. Bonnet P. Duc I. Duranti E. Meschi S.

Aromatase, a cytochrome P450, is the enzyme that synthesizes estrogens by converting C19 androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to aromatic C18 estrogenic steroids (estrone and 17β-estradiol). This and other laboratories have shown that aromatase is expressed at higher levels in breast cancer cells and/or surrounding adipose stromal cells than in non-cancerous breast cells (12Esteban J.M.

Aromatase inhibitors have been found to be valuable in treating these estrogen-dependent and aromatase-mediated diseases including breast cancer (16Johnston S.R.D. Smith I.E. Dowsett M. Miller W.R. Santen R.J. Aromatase Inhibition and Breast Cancer. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2001: 29-49Google Scholar). The United States Food and Drug Administration approved two new aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole and letrozole, for use as first-line agents against estrogen-responsive cancer in postmenopausal women. In the recent arimidex, tamoxifen, alone, or in combination (ATAC) trial, anastrozole was found to be more effective than tamoxifen in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and anastrozole treatment was shown to significantly prevent contralateral cancers (17Winer E.P.

Therefore, suppression of in situ estrogen formation in the breast of postmenopausal women by aromatase inhibitors is considered to be a useful way to prevent and treat breast cancer in these women. In this study, we have examined 21 coumarin derivatives and found 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxycoumarin to be a potent competitive inhibitor of aromatase with respect to the androgen substrate. Its Ki value was estimated to be 84 nm, which is significantly lower than several well characterized anti-aromatase phytochemicals. Biochemical properties and biological action of this newly identified aromatase inhibitor have been examined. Materials—We have examined the interaction of 21 coumarins with aromatase. The names of these compounds are shown in Table I. These coumarins were purchased from Indofine Chemical Co., Inc. (Somerville, New Jersey). A stable aromatase-expressing the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 line (i.e. MCF-7aro) has been prepared in our laboratory by aromatase cDNA transfection and G418 (neomycin) selection (19Sun X.Z. Zhou D. Chen S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and was used in this study. Aromatase activity in the MCF-7aro cell line was determined to be 73 ± 6 pmol/mg/h. MCF-7aro cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1× antibiotics, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 15 mm Hepes at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Aromatase wild-type and mutant expressing Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were prepared in our laboratory (20Zhou D. Cam L.L. Laughton C.A. Korzekwa K.R. Chen S. J. Biol.

Briefly, the wild-type aromatase and its mutants were cloned in pHβ-Apr-1-Neo, and the expression plasmids were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, using the Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells expressing the enzyme or its mutants were selected with G418 (up to a final dosage at 680 μg/ml). The expression of the aromatase protein was determined by aromatase activity measurement and by immunoprecipitation analysis. The latter analysis was performed using polyclonal antisera against aromatase that was prepared by Kao et al. (21Kao Y.C. Cam L.L. Laughton C.A. Zhou D. Chen S.

Dimethysulfoxide, tamoxifen, 17β-estradiol, and 4-androstene-3,17-dione were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The anti-estrogen, ICI 182780, was purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO). The aromatase inhibitors, letrozole and anastrozole, were provided by Dr. A. S. Bhatnager at Novartis, Switzerland, and Dr. Michael Dukes at Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, UK, respectively. The phenol red-free matrigel basement membrane matrix was purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. Aromatase Assay, Placental Microsomal Assay, and In-cell Assay— Using a human placental microsomal preparation that is enriched with aromatase, aromatase activities (in the presence of various coumarins at five different concentrations) were determined by the tritiated water release method of Thompson and Siiteri (23Thompson Jr., E.A. Siiteri P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5364-5372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with [1β-3H]4-androstene-3,17-dione as the substrate (specific activity 24.1 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The procedures were described in a publication by Eng et al. (8Eng E.T. Ye J. Williams D. Phung S. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Gruntmanis U. Braunstein G. Chen S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8516-8522PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic analyses were performed with the substrate concentrations ranging from 16 to 200 nm. For the inhibition studies, the Ki values of the inhibitors were determined according to a published method (22Kao Y.C. Korzekwa K.R. Laughton C.A. Chen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the “in-cell” aromatase assay, aromatase-expressing cells were plated on 6-well plates in growth medium. When approximately confluent, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 1 ml of serum-free medium containing inhibitor at various concentrations along with 100 nm [1β-3H]androstenedione, as well as 1 μm progesterone, used to suppress the endogenous 5α-reductase that also consumes the androgen substrate. The incubation was carried out for 1 h after which time the substrate mixture was removed and extracted with an equal volume of chloroform. The samples were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the aqueous upper layer from each sample was loaded onto a charcoal-dextran pellet to remove any trace of unreacted substrate. The samples were vortexed and subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of the supernatant preparations were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Aromatase activity was calculated as pmol of tritiated water released/mg of protein/h (pmol/mg/h). The cells in each well were solubilized in 0.5 n sodium hydroxide, and the protein concentrations were quantified by the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). The tritiated water release assay has been previously validated in our laboratory by the product isolation assay (25Zhou D. Pompon D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6949-6954PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the activities of the wild-type aromatase and its mutants have been recently evaluated by the reaction intermediate profile analysis along with the tritiated water release assay (22Kao Y.C. Korzekwa K.R. Laughton C.A. Chen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—The expression plasmid for the human ERRα, named pSG5-ERRα, was constructed as described previously (26Yang C. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar). The ERRβ and ERRγ expression plasmids, pSG5-ERRβ and pSG5-ERRγ, were generated by Suetsugi et al. (7Suetsugi M. Su L. Karlsberg K. Yuan Y.C. Chen S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 981-991PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of the human ERα expression plasmid, pSG5-hERα, and two luciferase reporter plasmids, pGL3(ERE)3-luciferase and pGL3(steroidogenic factor 1 site)3-luciferase, was described by Zhou and Chen in a previous publication (28Zhou D. Chen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3939-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, the preparation of ERβ expression plasmid, pSG5-hERβ, was described by Kinoshita and Chen (29Kinoshita Y. Chen S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3546-3555PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium Earle's salts medium and supplemented with a solution of 5% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Afterward, the cells were transfected with 3 μg of Lipofectin and a total 0.75 μg of plasmid DNA containing various amounts of the test plasmids as indicated in each experiment and appropriate amounts of empty vector, pSG5, to maintain the same overall amount of total DNA in all transfections. After 5 h of incubation, the medium containing Lipofectin and DNA was removed, and the cells were cultured in the 5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum containing growth medium with or without ligands. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells in each well were lysed in 400 μl of 1× lysis buffer and harvested from the plates by scraping. The luciferase activities in the cell lysate with the same amount of protein were then measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Each experiment was repeated at least three independent times, and each sample was tested in triplicate. Computer Modeling—To rationalize our experimental results, we superimposed the five coumarins demonstrating the most potent anti-aromatase activity with the natural substrate of aromatase, androstenedione, using the Sybyl FlexS program version 1.10 (30Lemmen C. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4502-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) interfaced with Tripos Sybyl 6.9 (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) on a Silicon Graphics O2+ work station with the IRIX 6.5 operating system (31Sybyl Version 6.9. Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO2002Google Scholar). The goal for the alignments is to find three-dimensional structural characteristics that confer biological activity. FlexS makes use of an incremental construction algorithm. The reference molecule is kept rigid, whereas the ligands to be superimposed are treated as flexible. The first step involves breaking the reference and test ligands down into small rigid fragments, followed by the selection of a core fragment from each ligand. The program aligns these core fragments, and then the remaining fragments are added iteratively. At each step, flexibility is considered by allowing the newly added fragment to adopt a discrete set of conformations. The volume overlap with the reference is checked, and a similarity ranking is performed to score the achieved similarity in three-dimensional space. The FlexS scoring function is based upon paired intermolecular interactions and overlapping density functions (30Lemmen C. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4502-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). An accurate superposition is a prerequisite for subsequent exploitation of ligand-based computer virtual screening using either three-dimensional QSAR analyses or pharmacophore analyses. In our case, androstenedione was selected as the reference ligand. Three-dimensional conformations of both reference molecule and test compounds (5 coumarins) were generated with the CONCORD program within the Sybyl package (32Pearlman R.S. CONCORD, Version 4.0.8. Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO1998Google Scholar), and partial atomic charges were calculated within FlexS using the Gasteiger-Hückel algorithm (33Inc Tripos Force Field Manual. Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO2003Google Scholar). In addition, prior to the superpositioning, all structures were minimized using the Tripos force field with all its parameter settings at their default values. The FlexS alignment for each compound was visually inspected. Matrigel Thread Three-dimensional Cell Culture—The procedures for the preparation of the matrigel thread were similar to those reported by Daly et al. (34Daly P.F. Lyon R.C. Straka E.J. Cohen J.S. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2596-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 1.0 × 106 MCF-7aro cells were prepared by a brief trypsinization of cells (at ∼80% confluency), which were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× antibiotics (Gemini), 100 units of penicillin (g/ml), 100 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml, and 0.25 μg of fungizone/ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cell pellet that was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min was gently mixed with 2 ml of matrigel solution for 10 min on ice so that the agitation would not introduce bubbles. Once the cells were homogeneously mixed with the matrigel solution, the mixture was allowed to settle for 30 min on ice for bubble diffusion from the matrigel. Prechilled and sterilized 6-cm × 0.8-mm (inner diameter) Teflon tubes were filled with a cell-matrigel mixture by pulling gently using 35-ml syringe pistons that were attached at the one end of the Teflon tubes. Upon exposing the matrigel-filled Teflon tubes at room temperature for about 2–3 min, the congealed matrigel threads were extruded out by the pressure created from the syringe in 5 ml of phenol red-free RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (charcoal-coated dextran-treated serum) and delivered into a 6-well plate. After confirmation of homogeneous single cell distribution in the matrigel by microscope, the matrigel threads containing MCF-7aro cells were incubated in 5 ml of phenol red-free RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (charcoal dextran-treated) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. For the positive controls, 10 nm of estradiol or testosterone was added to the culture media. The treated samples were cultured in media containing 100 nm letrozole, anastrozole, ICI 182780, tamoxifen, or coumarins, with or without 10 nm testosterone, and were examined for their ability to inhibit MCF-7aro cell proliferation. The colony formation and the cell proliferation of MCF-7aro in the three-dimensional matrigel threads were photographed with 40x magnification using a Polaroid MicroCam (Polaroid Corporation, Cambridge, MA). To quantify the effects of hormones, aromatase inhibitors, and/or anti-estrogens on the proliferation of MCF-7aro cells in the three-dimensional matrigel model, the matrigel threads were incubated in the presence of 5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine for 12 or 30 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. Each thread was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to reduce the background tritium count caused by nonspecific tritium-labeled thymidine absorption by the matrigel. Each matrigel thread was then placed on a quadruply Kimwipe and allowed to completely dry under the hood. The matrigel threads together with Kimwipes were placed in scintillation vials and presoaked in 5 ml of scintillation fluid for 10 min to make sure that they were completely soaked, followed by a [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation count. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. Inhibition of Human Aromatase by Coumarins—Research from this and other laboratories have identified a number of phytochemicals that can act as inhibitors of aromatase. The anti-aromatase chemicals identified so far are mainly flavones and isoflavones. In search of novel phytochemicals or their derivatives that could selectively inhibit aromatase, we examined 21 coumarins for their anti-aromatase effects. As indicated in Table I, only six compounds were found to be capable of inhibiting aromatase. Their structures are shown in Fig. 1. Three coumarins inhibited aromatase with IC50 values at 1 μm or lower and are structurally related (Table I). The three most potent compounds were found to be competitive inhibitors with respect to the androgen substrate. The Ki values of these compounds were 0.084, 0.23, and 1.1 μm, respectively (Fig. 2). Using the same assay method, these three coumarins were found to be significantly more potent than other reported anti-aromatase chemicals including aminoglutethimide (Table II). Aminoglutethimide was the first aromatase inhibitor approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration for breast cancer treatment. Letrozole, anastrozole, and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione, the new aromatase inhibitors that are approved for breast cancer treatment, are more potent inhibitors than the coumarins. The new aromatase inhibitor development has been based primarily on inhibitor structure-activity relationship studies. Therefore, 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxycoumarin could be a lead compound to develop more potent aromatase inhibitors.Fig. 2Competitive inhibition of aromatase.A, 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxycoumarin.

The effects of aromatase inhibition by these compounds were tested with four critical mutants, E302D, T310S, S478T, and H480Q, which decrease the aromatase activity significantly, most likely because these point-mutations are located in the active site and involved in the process of aromatization. The activities of these mutants are ∼40–50% that of the wild-type aromatase. Our analysis revealed that the aromatase inhibitory profiles of T310S, S478T, and H480Q by 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxycoumarin were significantly reduced in comparison to that of the wild-type aromatase activity, demonstrating that the mutated amino acid residues are important for the binding of this coumarin (Fig. 3). Glu-302 and Thr-310 of the human aromatase have been suggested to participate in the hydroxylation reactions at the C-19 methyl group of the androgen steroid. Ser-478 and His-480 have been predicted to interact with C-4 and C-7 of the steroid (22Kao Y.C. Korzekwa K.R. Laughton C.A. Chen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our results from the aromatase mutant studies support that these coumarin inhibitors are active-site-directed. Structure-Activity Studies and Computer Modeling Analy ses—To provide some structural explanation of our experimental results, we assessed the shape similarity of the coumarins compared with each other and to androstenedione and associated that with the activity data. The IC50 value of 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxycoumarin (see Fig. 1 for structure) was estimated to be 80 nm. The potency was reduced when either the 7-methoxyl group was replaced by a hydroxyl group (i.e. 4-benzyl-3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-hydroxycoumarin) or the 4′-chloro group was eliminated from the 3-phenyl group (i.e. 4-benzyl-7-methoxy-3-phenylcoumarin) (see Table I). These results indicated that both the 7-methoxyl and 3-(4′-chlorophenyl) groups are important for the anti-aromatase activity of these coumarin derivatives. To support our conclusion, 4-benzyl-7-hydroxy-3-phenylcoumarin was found to be a very poor inhibitor of aromatase (IC50 value > 50 μm). In addition, we found that a compound with a 4-(4′-chlorobenzyl) group instead of a 4-benzyl group (i.e. 4-(4′-chlorobenzyl)-7-methoxy-3-phenylcoumarin) was not able to suppress aromatase (Table I). Furthermore, 3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-7-methoxy-4-phenylcoumarin, a compound in which the 4-benzyl group is replaced by a 4-phenyl group, was not able to suppress aromatase. Our results provided strong evidence that these three functional groups (4-benzyl, 3-(4′-chlorophenyl), and 7-methoxyl) are critical for the inhibition of aromatase by coumarin derivatives. We compared the structures of our experimental hits to that of androstenedione using the FlexS program. Fig. 4A shows the alignment of 4-be"

We describe here identification of ITGA3 encoding integrin α3 as a target of its trans-activating function, proposing that p51/p63 allows epidermal stem cells to express laminin receptor α3β1 for anchorage to the basement membrane. When activated by genotoxic stress or overexpressed ectopically in non-adherent cells, p51/p63 transduced a phenotype to attach to extracellular matrices, which was accompanied by expression of ITGA3.

Thus, true biological activities of p51/p63 essential for skin development should be identified in keratinocyte stem cells. More than 6 isoforms arise from p51/p63 by using the TA- and ΔN-type transcriptional initiation sites and by RNA splicing to form the C-terminal A/γ, B/α, and C/γ variants (2Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Reflecting the structural similarity to p53 in the DNA binding domain, many of the genes inducible by p53 are also responsive to the p51/p63 proteins (1Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C.

Each of the TA isoforms acts more or less as a trans-activation factor, whereas the ΔN isoforms lacking the TA domain exhibit dominant-negative activities against p53 and the p51/p63 TA isoforms in reporter assays (2Yang A.

More recently, however, a report revealed that a ΔN isoform of p73, another p53 homolog involved in neurogenesis, acts both as a positive and negative regulator of transcription (15Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the TA isoforms of p51/p63 are unstable because of degradation by proteasome under normal conditions, but can accumulate in response to DNA damage to induce gene expression (16Katoh I.

With all these findings, however, essential molecular and cellular mechanisms that are assigned to p51/p63 for epidermal stem cell regulation still remain obscure. We report here that p51/p63 trans-activates the ITGA3 gene coding for integrin subunit α3, also referred to as CD49c and VLA3-α. The α3 subunit pairs with β1 to form the α3β1 (VLA3) complex which falls into the category of major epidermis integrins with other members, α2β1 and α6β4 (22Adams J.C. Watt F.M.

The critical interactions between the epidermal stem cells and their niche (25Watt F.M. Hogan B.L.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar) may be facilitated by p51/p63 through its ability to induce ITGA3. Cell Culture—U937 cell culture has been described (26Katoh I. Tomimori Y. Ikawa Y. Kurata S.-i. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15515-15523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ECM binding assays were performed using culture dishes coated with laminin, fibronectin, collagen, or polylysine (BioCoat, BD Biosciences). Sixteen hours after incubation with actinomycin D, dishes were once washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent and non-adherent cells were counted. Neonatal human keratinocyte (NHK) preparations from foreskin were from Cambrex. The basal medium was supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor (0.2 ng/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), gentamicin (0.1 mg/ml), amphotericin-B (100 ng/ml), and bovine pituitary extract (Keratinocyte Growth Medium BulletKit, Cambrex). Experiments with NHK were accomplished within three subculturing cycles, during which cells maintained a high proliferating potential: more than 80% of the cells grew to form 16- to 32-cell colonies on day 3 after attachment to the basement (day 0). RNA Purification and RT-PCR—Total RNA was purified with RNAwiz (Ambion) in combination with DNase I (Invitrogen) treatment. One-step RT-PCR was performed with the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). After the RT reaction with 0.2–0.5 μg of RNA and PCR primers for 30 min at 50–54 °C, synthesized DNA was directly amplified by 28–34 cycles of PCR consisting of annealing at 55–60 °C, elongation at 72 °C, and DNA strand dissociation at 94 °C. 18 S rRNA was amplified for 16 cycles. The following primer pairs were used: p21waf1, 5′-GTTCCTTGTGGAGCCGGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTACAAGACAGTAGCAGGT-3′ (reverse); glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′; integrin α3 (#1), 5′-TCCATGAACTACTCTTTACCTTTGCGGATGC-3′ and 5′-TGCCAGACTCACCCATCACTGTC-3′; for integrin α3 (#2), 5′-AAGCCAAGTCTGAGA CT-3′ and 5′-GTAGTATTGGTCCCGAGTCT-3′ (27Hashida H.

Kihara K. Ikawa Y. Katoh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An anti-integrin α3 antibody (Biogenesis, 5355–1305), an anti-p51/p63 antibody (4A4, Santa Cruz), an anti-p21waf1 (H164, Santa Cruz), a rabbit anti-human p53 antibody (FL393, Santa Cruz), and an anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15, Sigma) were purchased. Proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 7, 8.5, or 10% gel were transferred to polyvinyldene difluoride (Millipore) membrane, pore size 0.45 μm. For detection of p21waf1, 12% polyacrylamide gel and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with 0.2-μm pores were used. Transfection—Plasmids were transfected into HeLa and Saos-2 cells with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Luciferase assay was performed with a Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System and Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega). DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transient and permanent transfection of U937 cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with sequences 113–130 (p51/p63-siRNA1) and 282–300 (p51/p63-siRNA2) were synthesized (Greiner Japan), in which nucleotide number 1 corresponded to the A residue of the translation start codon of the ΔN cDNAs. siRNAs were transfected into NHK by an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa Biosystems) with human keratinocyte nucleofector solution. Inducible p51/p63 Expression in HEK293 Cells—We transfected HEK293 cells with pFRT/LacZeo and selected zeocin-resistant clones. The pFRT-positive cells were next transfected with tetracyclin repressor expression plasmid pcDNA6/TR, and blasticidine S-resistant clones were obtained. The pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector with each of the p51/p63 isoform cDNAs was co-transfected with pOG44 into HEK293 clones having pFRT and pcDNA5/TR. Stable hygromycin-resistant clones were maintained as cell lines that induce p51/p63 expression in response to tetracyclin (2 μg/ml). Plasmids—Overexpression of p51/p63 with the pRcCMV vector was described, as were luciferase expression constructs, pRGC-luc (18Osada M. Inaba R. Shinohara H. Hagiwara M. Nakamura M. Ikawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and pGL-ES (32Kato T. Katabami K. Takatsuki H. Han S.A. Takeuchi K. Irimura T. Tsuji T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To construct p(1+2)luc, a synthetic double stand DNA having sequences 594–612 and 877–901 derived from intron 1 of human ITGA3 was inserted into the multiple cloning site of a Luc expression vector, pGL3-promoter. p(3+4)luc was constructed similarly, so that nucleotides 2465–2490 and 6437–6461 were inserted in tandem between the NheI and XhoI sites located 5′ to the SV40 promoter. The (3+4) segment was inserted at NheI/XhoI sites of p(1 + 2) to create p(1+2+3+4)luc. Human genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood cells obtained from a healthy volunteer donor (Y. T.). A DNA region encompassing intron 1 of ITGA3 was amplified by PCR with primers targeting the 3′ end of exon 1 and 5′ end of exon 2: 5′-CTCCGCCTTCAACCTGGATACCCGATTCCT-3′ and 5′-GGTACACAGCACCAGTCC GGTTGGTGTAGC-3′, respectively. The 7.6-kb segment containing the full intron 1 sequence was inserted into pGEM-T Easy. By BglII digestion, the 1.4-kb 5′ terminal region was excised to be cloned in the pGL3-promoter at the BamHI site (Promega). Nucleotide mutations were introduced with a GeneTailor Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen). PCR primers used were 5′-GAGAGAGGAGGACTTTTCCCAACTCT-3′ and 5′-AAGTCCTCCTCTCTCTTTCACCGC-3′ for the M1 mutation, and 5′-ATGCCCAGGAGCATTTCCAGGCTT-3′ and 5′-ATGCTCCTGGGCATGAGCGCGTCT-3′ for the M2 mutation. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed with the ABI 377 sequencer. Plasmids were purified from Escherichia coli DH5α by a GenElute Endotoxin-free Plasmid Kit (Sigma). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mouse skin sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded with paraffin, and sectioned at 8 μm. Keratinocytes cultured on slide glass were also fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Deparaffinized tissue sections and cultured samples were heated at 95 °C for 40 min in a buffer (10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0; or with 50 mm glycine HCl buffer, pH 3.5, with 0.01% (w/v) EDTA) for epitope retrieval. Samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 5% goat serum (30 min at room temperature), and incubated with a primary antibody (for 16 h at 4 °C). Samples probed with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamin-labeled secondary antibody, for 1 h at 22 °C, were washed and mounted in an anti-fade medium (Dako, Japan). Photomicrographs were obtained with a Leica DMRXA microscope equipped with an air-cooled camera (Synsys) controlled by QFISH software (Leica). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—HEK293 cells seeded on 15-cm plates were transfected with a plasmid for expression of human influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged p51A/TAp63γ (HAp51A) (1Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were fixed with formaldehyde, and the nuclei were purified. Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with non-immune rabbit IgG, an anti-TFIIB antibody (Active Motif), or an anti-HA rabbit antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 71-5500). Protein G-agarose blocked with salmon sperm DNA, RNase A, proteinase K, a proteinase inhibitor mixture, mini-columns for DNA purification, and buffers were supplied in the ChIP-IT kit by Active Motif. Adsorption of the antibody-protein-DNA complexes to protein G-agarose, washing, reversal of cross-links, removal of RNA, protein digestion, and DNA purification were performed following the manufacturer's protocol. A 166-base pair (bp) segment of the GAPDH gene promoter locus was amplified by PCR with primers: 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′. For detection of the ITGA3 intronic sequences encompassing the first and second p53(p51/p63)-binding consensus sequences, a 390-bp segment was amplified with primers: 5′-CTCTCCGTAATGGAAGACC-3′ and 5′-GCATTATGAGACATCCCCAC-3′. Induction of an ECM-binding Phenotype and Integrin α3 Expression—As we reported earlier, p51A/TAp63γ, a potent trans-activator isoform of p51/p63, accumulated in response to DNA damage to induce p21waf1 in a mouse cell line (16Katoh I. Aisaki K.I. Kurata S.I. Ikawa S. Ikawa Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3126-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Katoh I. Tomimori Y. Ikawa Y. Kurata S.-i. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15515-15523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we propagated U/p51A and U/p53 cell lines derived from p53-deficient U937 human lymphoid cells after transfection with an Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven, low-level expression vector for p51A/TAp63γ and p53, respectively (16Katoh I. Aisaki K.I. Kurata S.I. Ikawa S. Ikawa Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3126-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In U/p51A cells, p51A/TAp63γ accumulated 8–24 h after exposure to 5 nm actinomycin D without an alteration in the mRNA level (Fig. 1A). The RT-PCR and Western blot analyses also showed activation of the p21waf1 and GADD45 expression with an increase in the p21waf1 protein amount. U/p53 cells incubated with actinomycin D also stabilized p53, inducing p21waf1. Control U937 cells caused a slight up-regulation of p21waf at 16 h, probably by a p53-independent mechanism (33Michieli P. Chedid M. Lin D. Pierce J.H. Mercer W.E. Givol D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3391-3395PubMed Google Scholar). We examined those cells for attachment to basements coated with laminin, fibronectin, or collagen (Fig. 1B). More than 90% of the U/p51A cells incubated with actinomycin D attached to laminin-coated dishes within 16 h. Approximately 55 and 16% of the cells bound to fibronectin and collagen, respectively, with little evidence of their binding to polylysine. In contrast, only a 9% fraction of the drug-treated U/p53 cells bound to laminin, and a yet smaller fraction to fibronectin. Control U937 cells adhered to neither of the extracellular matrix proteins under the conditions used. To find the molecular basis of the p51A-caused cell attachment to ECM, cellular RNA was analyzed for expression of integrin genes by RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). With two different primer pairs, α3 (#1), and α3 (#2), an increase in ITGA3 mRNA was evident at 8–24 h after exposure to actinomycin D. By contrast, expression of the α4, α5, α6, and αM genes remained constant through the time course. Although β1 gene expression increased slightly, reaching maximum at 8 h, the response was not specific to U/p51A. Consistent with RT-PCR analysis, the 145-kDa α3 (Ref. 34Lubman R.L. Zhang X.-L. Zheng J. Ocampo L. Lopez M.Z. Veeraraghavan S. Zabski S.M. Danto S.I. Borok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L183-L193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) content increased in U/p51A cells during the period (Fig. 1C, bottom). Because the α3 subunit associates with β1 to form the α3β1 heterodimer whose major and minor ligands are laminin and fibronectin/collagen (35Tysnes B.B. Larsen L.F. Ness G.O. Mahesparan R. Edvardsen K. Garcia-Cabrera I. Bjerkvig R. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), respectively, we hypothesized that p51/p63 promotes ITGA3 expression directly or indirectly to cause cell-ECM attachment. Transient or Drug-controlled p51/p63 Expression also Activates ITGA3—We performed transient overexpression of p51/p63 in U937 cells using a cytomegalovirus promoter vector with a liposome-based transfection carrier. The p51A/TAp63γ expression vector, but not the vector-only plasmid, caused laminin binding activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Reflecting the transfection efficiency, 10%, determined by a G418-resistant colony formation assay, a ∼10% fraction of the cells bound to laminin (Fig. 2B). Although the apparent increases in the mRNA and protein of α3 were not so great (2–3-fold) when the entire culture was analyzed (Fig. 2A), we could speculate that there was a greater increase in α3 expression in the attached cell population (10%). Furthermore, ΔNp51A/ΔNp63γ lacking the trans-activation domain also generated cells adherent to laminin (Fig. 2B), which was accompanied by ITGA3 activation as detected by mRNA and protein analyses (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the poor retention of 57-kDa p51A/TAp63γ having the N-terminal sequences that determine its fate for degradation by proteasome (16Katoh I. Aisaki K.I. Kurata S.I. Ikawa S. Ikawa Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3126-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Osada M. Inaba R. Shinohara H. Hagiwara M. Nakamura M. Ikawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), ΔNp51A/ΔNp63γ was stable enough to form an intense band at 52 kDa in Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Thus, neither the laminin-adherent phenotype nor the α3 induction shown in Fig. 2 required a cellular signaling event caused by actinomycin D. When expressed to a certain level, the TA and ΔN proteins seemed to induce ITGA3. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were genetically engineered so that established cell lines, 293-1, -2, and -5 expressed cDNAs of p51A/TAp63γ, p51B/TAp63α, and ΔNp51A/ΔNp63γ, respectively, from the same position on the chromosome upon induction with tetracycline. Twelve hours after induction, each cell lines achieved a high level production of p51A/TAp63γ (57 kDa) (16Katoh I. Aisaki K.I. Kurata S.I. Ikawa S. Ikawa Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3126-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), p51B/TAp63α (85 kDa) (17Okada Y. Osada M. Kurata S. Sato S. Aisaki K. Kageyama Y. Kihara K. Ikawa Y. Katoh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or ΔNp51A/ΔNp63γ (52 kDa) (36Tomimori Y. Katoh I. Kurata S. Okuyama T. Kamiyama R. Ikawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, left). Expectedly, the ITGA3 mRNA increased ∼10-fold in p51A/TAp63γ-expressing 293-1 cells (Fig. 3C, right). p51B/TAp63α-or ΔNp51A/ΔNp63γ-expressing cells also caused a 3- or 2-fold activation of ITGA3, respectively, whereas control HEK293 cells showed no detectable change. Consistently, the 145-kDa integrin α3 protein increased in tetracycline-induced 293-1, 293-2, and 293-5 cells, reflecting the relative amounts of the ITGA3 mRNA (Fig. 2C, left). Processed integrin α3 light chain (30 kDa) was not detectable. Supporting the experiments with U937 cells (Figs. 1 and 2, A and B), these results indicated that ITGA3 is inducible by the TA and ΔN isoforms of p51/p63. p51/p63-responsive Elements in the First Intron of ITGA3— We found sequences matching RRRC(T/A)(T/A)GYYY at positions 597, 881, 2475, and 6422 in intron 1 of ITGA3 on human chromosome 17 (at 17q21.33), in which position numbers are relative to nucleotide 1 at the 5′ end of intron 1 (Fig. 3). Another motif was present 2594 bp upstream of the transcription start site lacking a nearby TATA box. The decanucleotide motif corresponded to a half-site of the full consensus sequence occupied by a p53 tetramer (a dimer of a dimer), RRRC(T/A)(T/A)GYYY"
https://openalex.org/W2078059827,"Brain metabolism of glucose and lactate was analyzed by ex vivo NMR spectroscopy in rats presenting different cerebral activities induced after the administration of pentobarbital, α-chloralose, or morphine. The animals were infused with a solution of either [1-13C]glucose plus lactate or glucose plus [3-13C]lactate for 20 min. Brain metabolite contents and enrichments were determined from analyses of brain tissue perchloric acid extracts according to their post-mortem evolution kinetics. When amino acid enrichments were compared, both the brain metabolic activity and the contribution of blood glucose relative to that of blood lactate to brain metabolism were linked with cerebral activity. The data also indicated the production in the brain of lactate from glycolysis in a compartment other than the neurons, presumably the astrocytes, and its subsequent oxidative metabolism in neurons. Therefore, a brain electrical activity-dependent increase in the relative contribution of blood glucose to brain metabolism occurred via the increase in the metabolism of lactate generated from brain glycolysis at the expense of that of blood lactate. This result strengthens the hypothesis that brain lactate is involved in the coupling between neuronal activation and metabolism. Brain metabolism of glucose and lactate was analyzed by ex vivo NMR spectroscopy in rats presenting different cerebral activities induced after the administration of pentobarbital, α-chloralose, or morphine. The animals were infused with a solution of either [1-13C]glucose plus lactate or glucose plus [3-13C]lactate for 20 min. Brain metabolite contents and enrichments were determined from analyses of brain tissue perchloric acid extracts according to their post-mortem evolution kinetics. When amino acid enrichments were compared, both the brain metabolic activity and the contribution of blood glucose relative to that of blood lactate to brain metabolism were linked with cerebral activity. The data also indicated the production in the brain of lactate from glycolysis in a compartment other than the neurons, presumably the astrocytes, and its subsequent oxidative metabolism in neurons. Therefore, a brain electrical activity-dependent increase in the relative contribution of blood glucose to brain metabolism occurred via the increase in the metabolism of lactate generated from brain glycolysis at the expense of that of blood lactate. This result strengthens the hypothesis that brain lactate is involved in the coupling between neuronal activation and metabolism. In the last decade, the idea of the involvement of lactate in the coupling between neuronal activation and energy metabolism has arisen from the results of various experimental investigations. Briefly, in vitro studies have evidenced lactate release from astrocytes after glycolysis stimulation by glutamate uptake (1Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10625-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar, 2Voutsinos-Porche B. Bonvento G. Tanaka K. Steiner P. Welker E. Chatton J.Y. Magistretti P.J. Pellerin L.

Poitry S. Tsacopoulos M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5179-5191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo studies on brain have demonstrated the uncoupling of oxygen and glucose utilization (4Lowry J.P. Fillenz M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the release of lactate into the extracellular fluid in response to neuronal activation (5Demestre M. Boutelle M. Fillenz M. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 825-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Hu Y. Wilson G.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, brain lactate has been demonstrated to efficiently protect neurons against delayed ischemic damage (7Schurr A. Payne R.S. Miller J.J. Tseng M.T. Rigor B.M. Brain. Res. 2001; 895: 268-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The metabolic fate of exogenous lactate in whole brain has been investigated by ex vivo NMR spectroscopy. In this way, it has been demonstrated that blood lactate enters the brain and is more specifically metabolized in neurons (8Bouzier A.K. Thiaudiere E. Biran M. Rouland R. Canioni P. Merle M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Hassel B. Brathe A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Qu H. Haberg A.

The proposed astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis (ANLSH) 1The abbreviations used are: ANLSH, astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; Lac, lactate.1The abbreviations used are: ANLSH, astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; Lac, lactate. (1Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10625-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar) as the coupling model between neuronal activity and energy metabolism requires the involvement of different components, the occurrence and localization of which have been investigated analytically at the molecular level, i.e. glutamate transporter and Na+,K+-ATPase (11Cholet N. Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Hamel E. Cereb. Cortex. 2002; 12: 515-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes (12Bittar P.G. Charnay Y. Pellerin L. Bouras C. Magistretti P.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 1079-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and monocarboxylate transporters (13Pierre K. Magistretti P.J. Pellerin L. J. Cereb.

Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although brain lactate production and lactate use by neurons as an energy source are widely admitted, the relevance of the coupling model, particularly the neuronal utilization of glia-produced lactate, is a topical issue (15Dienel G.A. Hertz L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 824-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Chih C.P. Lipton P. Roberts Jr, E.L. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 573-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Brain lactate mostly derives from glycolysis. Therefore, the comparative analysis of the contribution of brain lactate and glucose to the oxidative metabolism in brain cells cannot be achieved in a simple manner. Indeed, using labeled glucose alone is of no use, because labeled lactate will be formed and there will be no way to further discriminate between the metabolism of these two compounds. On the other hand, using labeled lactate alone gives information on the metabolism of the exogenous lactate but not on the metabolism of brain endogenous lactate. To investigate in vivo the relevance of the ANLS hypothesis, we therefore used an alternative approach in which brain lactate metabolism was investigated by analyzing the competition between the lactate endogenous to brain and the exogenous lactate intravenously administrated to the animals through the infusion of a solution of either [1-13C]glucose plus lactate or glucose with [3-13C]lactate. Thus, using rats treated with various drugs leading to different levels of cerebral activity, we recently demonstrated from the analysis of alanine, lactate, and acetyl-CoA labeling that astrocytic glycolysis was the main source of the endogenous brain lactate and that the contribution of blood glucose relative to the contribution of blood lactate to the neuronal metabolism was linked to brain activity (17Serres S. Bouyer J.J. Bezancon E. Canioni P. Merle M. NMR Biomed. 2003; 16: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using the same experimental approach, in the present study we analyzed the amino acid enrichments reached under the different conditions. A crucial requirement was the determination of brain metabolite content and enrichment in brain tissue, keeping in mind that there was a risk of bias due to the possible evolution of the metabolite content in the time interval between blood circulation arrest and tissue freezing. This was particularly important for glucose and lactate because of anaerobic glycolysis. To control this process, we determined the time dependence of brain glucose, lactate, and amino acid content and 13C-enrichments after blood circulation arrest. Thus, comparing alanine and lactate enrichments under the different conditions confirmed the compartmentation of their metabolism. Moreover, from the enrichment of the amino acids, we found that the contribution to their metabolism of blood glucose relative to that of blood lactate increased with brain activation. This increase is discussed in terms of a higher production and metabolic consumption of brain glycolytic lactate with brain activation. Animals—The experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the appropriate institutional review committees and met the guidelines of the appropriate governmental agency (authorization number 7368). Female Wistar rats (∼200 g) were fasted overnight. They received an intraperitoneal injection of the following anesthetic or analgesic drugs: 90 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, 80 mg/kg α-chloralose, or 50 mg/kg morphine sulfate. To avoid hypothermia, they were kept under a glow lamp during the experiments. Labeled Substrate Infusion—About 15 min after drug administration, the rats were infused in a tail vein for 20 min with a saline solution containing either 750 mm 99% enriched [1-13C]glucose and 500 mm lactate or 750 mm glucose and 500 mm 99% enriched [3-13C]lactate. The infusion flow was monitored to follow a time-decreasing exponential as described previously (8Bouzier A.K. Thiaudiere E. Biran M. Rouland R. Canioni P. Merle M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A few minutes before the end of infusion, a longitudinal incision was made on the scalp of the animals, and its two parts were drawn aside to make the cranium apparent. For the animals under α-chloralose or morphine, this incision was made using lidocaine as a local anesthetic. The rat head was then secured by pinning the scalp on a holder adapted to its shape. At the end of infusion, it was immediately split in two by a hammer stroke onto a sharp knife maintained on the cranium on the longitudinal axis. The two cerebral hemispheres were then easily removed and dipped into liquid nitrogen. To obtain relevant data on both the brain metabolite contents and the enrichments at the end of infusion, the post-mortem effects occurring between blood circulation arrest and tissue freezing were determined as follows. Considering the instant when the cranium was split in two as time 0, the cerebral hemispheres were removed and dipped into liquid nitrogen either immediately, i.e. at a measured time ranging from 6 to 12 s for the first removed hemisphere, or after a given delay of 30, 60, 90, or 120 s. After metabolite extraction, the time evolution of the glucose, the lactate, the amino acid contents, and the enrichments were analyzed. A minimal number of three animals were used for each time. During the last minute of infusion, a blood sample (∼400 μl) was collected by cardiac puncture. It was immediately mixed with 15 μl of perchloric acid (9 m) and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and adjusted to pH 4. A 50-μl aliquot was taken for glucose and lactate determination, and the remainder was lyophilized. The resulting powder was dissolved in 500 μl of D2O for 1H-NMR analysis The animals treated with morphine sulfate were immobilized before starting the infusion. A foam rubber cylinder (size, 20 cm; interior diameter, 4-cm) was used as a restrainer. A longitudinal (dorsal) opening was made on a side of the cylinder to put the animal inside, and four holes (2 × 1 cm) were made on the opposite side to allow the paws of the animals to stand outside. Five longitudinal windows (7 × 0.5 cm) were opened between these holes both to provide to the cylinder part that was in contact with the animal thorax and abdomen the flexibility required for breathing movements and to give access for cardiac puncture. After the animal was correctly positioned inside the cylinder, the longitudinal opening was closed with adhesive tape. During infusion, the cylinder was maintained so that the paws did not come into contact with the working surface. Control animals perfused under the same conditions with unenriched lactate and glucose were used to determine blood PaO2, PaCO2, and pH. Five minutes before the end of infusion, the carotid artery of the rats was exposed to collect a 300–500-μl blood sample. Blood gasses and pH were then immediately determined using a Radiometer ABL5 analyzer. Metabolite Extraction—The frozen cerebral tissue was pulverized under liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. A volume of 5 ml of 0.9 m perchloric acid was then added drop by drop at the nitrogen surface, and the frozen droplets were immediately pulverized. The mixture was transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and homogenized at 4 °C after thawing. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min), the supernatant was neutralized with KOH, centrifuged to eliminate perchlorate salts, and freeze-dried. The pellet was dissolved in 0.2 m Tris-base 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate for protein determination. Glucose, Lactate, and Protein Determination—Glucose and lactate contents in blood and brain extracts were determined by enzymatic assays using the kits from Sigma. Protein contents in brain tissue were determined as described (18Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR spectroscopy, each sample was dissolved in 500 μl D2O. Spectra were obtained with a Bruker Avance 500 narrow bore spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broad band probe. Measurements were performed at 30 °C. Proton-decoupled 13C-NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts were acquired under the conditions of a 5.1-μs pulse (∼52° flip angle), 1.18-s acquisition time, 0.1-s relaxation delay, 22,150 Hz sweep width, 64K memory, gated proton composite pulse decoupling, and D2O lock. The number of scans was 50,000. 1H-NMR spectra were acquired using a 7-μs pulse (∼ 90° flip angle), 3.27-s acquisition time, 8.5-s relaxation delay, 5,000 Hz sweep width, and 32K memory size. The residual water signal was suppressed by homonuclear pre-saturation. The number of scans was 32. 1H-observed/13C-edited spectra were obtained as described previously (8Bouzier A.K. Thiaudiere E. Biran M. Rouland R. Canioni P. Merle M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The acquisition sequences involved a proton spin echo with calibrated 90 and 180° pulses separated by a 3.94-ms delay corresponding to the 0.5 JCH value for the 1H-13C scalar coupling in amino acid -CH2- and -CH3 (JCH = 126–132 Hz) either with or without 13C spin inversion with a 90, 120, 120, and 90° composite pulse (8.75 μs for 90° flip angle). Other parameters were a 3.28-s acquisition time, 8-s relaxation delay, 5,000 Hz sweep width, and 32K memory size. Measurements were conducted under carbon decoupling and water proton presaturation. The free induction decays corresponding to the two types of data were alternatively acquired as three blocks of 64 scans. Proton-decoupled 31P-NMR spectra were acquired using a 8.5-μs pulse (90° flip angle), 0.81-s acquisition time, 10,080 Hz sweep width, 0.5-s relaxation delay, 32K memory size, and D2O lock. Spectra resulted from 10,000 scans. Before the 31P-NMR analysis, a 50-μl aliquot of EDTA (100 mm, pH 7) was added to the sample in order to form a complex of the divalent cations. Metabolite 13C-Enrichment Determination—The specific enrichment of blood glucose C1 was determined from the satellite peaks of the 1H-13C coupling patterns on the 1H-NMR spectra of the blood samples. The specific enrichment of blood lactate C3 and that of brain metabolite carbons were evaluated from the 1H-observed/13C-edited NMR spectra as the ratios between homologous peak areas in the 13C-edited and spin echo spectra, respectively. Each determination was made by superposition of a given resonance peak in the two spectra using the Dual routine from Bruker after careful line width, phase, and base-line adjustment. Brain Amino Acid Contents—Amino acid contents were determined from peak areas (protons bound to Ala C3, Gln and Glu C4, GABA C2, and Asp C3) in fully relaxed 1H-NMR spectra using the methyl lactate peak area as reference and the lactate content as determined by enzymatic assay. The overlapping peak from threonine (CH3) with that of lactate was taken into consideration. The content in a given amino acid, [AA], was thus calculated from its peak area (Area AA) and that of lactate plus Thr (Area Lac + Thr) according to the expression shown in Equation 1,[AA]=(AreaAA)(Area Lac+Thr)×3PAA×[Lac+Thr](Eq. 1) where PAA corresponds to the number of protons giving rise to the amino acid peak, and [Lac] and [Thr] represent the contents in lactate and threonine. The threonine content (5 nmol/mg protein) was determined from spectra wherein the lactate and threonine peaks were well resolved. It was assumed to be constant under the different conditions. Analysis of Post-mortem Effects—The post-mortem time evolutions of brain glucose, lactate, and alanine contents (designated [Glc], [Lac], and [Ala], respectively) appeared linear upon the 0–2 min time scale and were analyzed as the following linear functions shown in Equations 2, 3, 4,[Glc]=[Glc]0−k1t(Eq. 2) [Lac]=[Lac]0+k2t(Eq. 3) [Ala]=[Ala]0+k3t(Eq. 4) with [Glc]0, [Lac]0, and [Ala]0 representing the metabolite content at time 0, k1 representing the rate of glycolysis, and k2 and k3 representing the rates of lactate and alanine production, respectively. The time evolutions of lactate enrichment {Lac} were analyzed with Equation 5,{Lac}={Lac}0+({Lac}∞−{Lac}0)(1−ekt)(Eq. 5) when starting from [1-13C]glucose, and with Equation 6,{Lac}={Lac}∞+({Lac}0−{Lac}∞)ekt(Eq. 6) when starting from [3-13C]lactate. The time evolutions of alanine enrichment were analyzed as a linear function of time. Parameter values for the best fits were evaluated using the Igor program. Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as the mean ± S.D. with n ≥ 3. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test with p < 0.05 using the Statgraphics package software. Physiological Status of the Infused Rats—As reported previously, an electroencephalogram recording indicated that the rat cerebral activity was strongly depressed under pentobarbital anesthesia, whereas a slight increase in spectral power in the 1–20 Hz frequency band was noted under both α-chloralose and morphine as a consequence of a large power increase in the δ band, whereas α-chloralose induced a slight power decrease in the θ band (17Serres S. Bouyer J.J. Bezancon E. Canioni P. Merle M. NMR Biomed. 2003; 16: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At the end of infusion, PaO2 was 74 ± 5, 84 ± 1, or 82 ± 2 and PaCO2 was 53 ± 2, 51 ± 1, or 40 ± 1 under pentobarbital, α-chloralose, or morphine anesthesia, respectively. The pH was 7.37 ± 0.03 with all three drugs. Concentration and Specific Enrichment of Glucose, Lactate, and Alanine in the Blood and Brain of the Infused Rats—The rats were simultaneously infused with glucose and lactate to compare brain metabolite enrichments from [3-13C]lactate or [1-13C]glucose under the same metabolic conditions. As shown previously, infusing both substrates made it possible to reach higher blood concentrations than after the infusion of only one of them and minimized the consequences of hepatic gluconeogenesis on their labeling (8Bouzier A.K. Thiaudiere E. Biran M. Rouland R. Canioni P. Merle M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After a 20-min infusion, glucose concentration was slightly lower under α-chloralose than under pentobarbital or morphine anesthesia, whereas lactate concentration was ∼2-fold higher under morphine than under pentobarbital or α-chloralose (Table I). Glucose enrichments were the same under the three drugs as well as after [1-13C]glucose and [3-13C]lactate infusion (in this latter case, glucose enrichment reflected gluconeogenesis activity). Lactate enrichments were the same under pentobarbital and α-chloralose anesthesia; the enrichment value (∼50% with the infusion of [3-13C]lactate) revealed an important isotopic dilution by glycolytic lactate. The glycolytic activity was even higher under morphine, leading to enrichment values of only 30% with [3-13C]lactate infusion and >7% with [1-13C]glucose infusion. The blood alanine content corresponded to around one-twelfth of the lactate content with the three drugs. Alanine enrichment was similar to that of lactate with [1-13C]glucose plus lactate infusion except under morphine, where the amino acid enrichment was half that of lactate. Under the infusion of glucose plus [3-13C]lactate, alanine enrichment was 20–25% less than that of lactate.Table IBlood glucose, lactate, and alanine concentrations and enrichments after a 20-min infusion of either [1-13C]glucose plus lactate or glucose plus [3-13C]lactate in rats treated with pentobarbital, α-chloralose, or morphinePerfusionConcentration (mm) or enrichment (%)Pentobarbitalα-ChloraloseMorphine[1-13C]glucose + lactate and Glucose + [3-13C]lactate[Glc] (mm)18.3 ± 2.4 (n = 22)16.0 ± 1.5aSignificant difference between α-chloralose and morphine.

Open table in a new tab The contents and enrichments of brain glucose, lactate, and alanine at the end of infusion are reported in Table II. These data were determined by analyzing the time-dependent evolutions of brain glucose, lactate, and alanine after blood circulation arrest (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). In the post-mortem phase, the rate of lactate content increase corresponded roughly to twice that of glucose consumption, indicating that the latter was essentially degraded into lactate. Concomitantly, the alanine content increase was much slower. Lactate C3-specific enrichment increased with time under [1-13C]glucose plus lactate infusion, whereas it decreased under glucose plus [3-13C]lactate infusion as a result of the glycolytic production of either labeled or unlabeled lactate, respectively. Alanine enrichment changes were in the same direction but much less intense. The post-mortem metabolic activity was also characterized by changes in energy metabolites. From 31P-NMR spectra, it was found that the NTP/NDP ratio drastically dropped from 3.2–4 after a few seconds to 1 at 2 min. This was accompanied by a >90% decrease in phosphocreatine content. On the other hand, 13C- and 31P-NMR spectra revealed the presence of both glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, the contents of which increased at least 2-fold in the post-mortem phase. Spectra in Fig. 4 illustrate the increase in these compounds and in lactate and alanine. As reported in Table II, the glucose contents at time zero were significantly different under the three drugs, with the highest and lowest values found under pentobarbital and α-chloralose, respectively. The lactate content was higher under morphine than under pentobarbital, whereas the content in alanine was the same under the three drugs. Brain glucose enrichments were the same under the three drugs and identical to those of blood glucose. From pentobarbital to morphine, lactate and alanine enrichments either increased or decreased with the infusion of either [1-13C]glucose plus lactate or glucose plus [3-13C]lactate, respectively.Table IIAnalysis of the time dependence of brain glucose, lactate, and alanine concentrations and lactate and alanine C3-specific enrichment after blood circulation arrest in the brain tissuePentobarbitalα-ChloraloseMorphinek1 (nmol/mg/s)aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.0.39 ± 0.020.25 ± 0.070.31 ± 0.07k2 (nmol/mg/s)aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.0.67 ± 0.010.51 ± 0.080.62 ± 0.09[Glc]0 (nmol/mg)aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.62.2 ± 0.9aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.42.1 ± 1.2bSignificant difference between α-chloralose and morphine.51.6 ± 3.3cSignificant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.[Lac]0 (nmol/mg)10.6 ± 2.014.5 ± 0.818.3 ± 3.5cSignificant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.[Ala]0 (nmol/mg)3.2 ± 0.52.3 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.01Labeled substrateLabeled substrateLabeled substrate[1-13C]Glc[3-13C]Lac[1-13C]Glc[3-13C]Lac[1-13C]Glc[3-13C]Lac%%%%{Glc C1}072.5 ± 2.22.8 ± 1.271.7 ± 4.03.5 ± 1.276.1 ± 5.13.3 ± 1.6{Lac C3}011.2 ± 2.8aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.19.7 ± 0.4aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.16.2 ± 1.711.2 ± 0.722.0 ± 4.0cSignificant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.10.3 ± 0.6cSignificant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.{Ala C3}010.3 ± 0.3aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.24.5 ± 0.9aSignificant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.,dSignificant difference between {Lac0} and {Ala0}.17.9 ± 0.6bSignificant difference between α-chloralose and morphine.19.6 ± 0.9bSignificant difference between α-chloralose and morphine.,dSignificant difference between {Lac0} and {Ala0}.22.1 ± 0.7cSignificant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.12.0 ± 0.6cSignificant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.,dSignificant difference between {Lac0} and {Ala0}.a Significant difference between pentobarbital and α-chloralose.b Significant difference between α-chloralose and morphine.c Significant difference between morphine and pentobarbital.d Significant difference between {Lac0} and {Ala0}.

https://openalex.org/W2011094969,"Budesonide, a glucocorticoid, was proven to be a highly effective agent in preventing the development of lung tumors in A/J mice. In a lung tumor bioassay, budesonide produced 70% inhibition of tumor multiplicity and 94% reduction of total tumor load compared to benzopyrene (B[a]P) treated mice. Gene expression array analysis was performed on mouse lung tumors from this bioassay using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips to determine gene expression changes associated with budesonide treatment. We found 363 genes that were changed between lung tumors induced by treatment with B[a]P and similar tumors treated with budesonide. Among them, 243 genes were overexpressed and 120 genes were underexpressed after budesonide treatment. In addition, 108 genes differentially expressed during mouse lung tumorigenesis (50 genes overexpressed and 58 genes underexpressed) were modulated back to normal levels after budesonide treatment when compared with the controls group. These genes are involved in a broad range of different pathways including control of cell cycle, signal transduction, and apoptosis and may play a role in the observed preventive effect. Our results suggest that budesonide exerts its effects of chemoprevention through growth arrest via Mad2/3 and through apoptosis via Bim/Blk and, by inference, caspase-8/9. Using the pathway visualization tool GenMapp, G protein pathway and MAPK cascade were also regulated by budesonide. Thus, we have determined, for the first time, the expression profiles of genes modulated by budesonide during murine lung tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that the chemopreventive effects of budesonide in the mouse lung tumorigenesis assay involved increase and decrease expression of a wide variety of genes in multiple signaling pathways."

Here, we show that the p14ARF protein interacts with chromatin and is recovered by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in a fraction that contains a DNA sequence of the rRNA gene promoter. In addition, topoisomerase I (Topo I) that has been shown to interact with p14ARF coprecipitates with p14ARF containing chromatin. These data, in view of the function for Topo I in rRNA transcription, are consistent with a role for the p14ARF-Topo I complex in rRNA transcription and/or maturation."

https://openalex.org/W2002785652,"Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a highly poly(A)-specific 3′-exoribonuclease that efficiently degrades mRNA poly(A) tails. PARN belongs to the DEDD family of nucleases, and four conserved residues are essential for PARN activity, i.e. Asp-28, Glu-30, Asp-292, and Asp-382. Here we have investigated how catalytically important divalent metal ions are coordinated in the active site of PARN. Each of the conserved amino acid residues was substituted with cysteines, and it was found that all four mutants were inactive in the presence of Mg2+. However, in the presence of Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, or Cd2+, PARN activity was rescued from the PARN(D28C), PARN(D292C), and PARN(D382C) variants, suggesting that these three amino acids interact with catalytically essential metal ions. It was found that the shortest sufficient substrate for PARN activity was adenosine trinucleotide (A3) in the presence of Mg2+ or Cd2+. Interestingly, adenosine dinucleotide (A) was efficiently hydrolyzed in the presence of Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+, suggesting that the substrate length requirement for PARN can be modulated by the identity of the divalent metal ion. Finally, introduction of phosphorothioate modifications into the A substrate demonstrated that the scissile bond non-bridging phosphate oxygen in the pro-R position plays an important role during cleavage, most likely by coordinating a catalytically important divalent metal ion.

These amino acids are Asp-28, Glu-30, Asp-292, and Asp-382 in human PARN. Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that these conserved residues are essential for catalytic activity and that they are required for the binding of divalent metal ions to PARN (13Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it was proposed (13Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that PARN utilizes the two-metal ion mechanism for its catalysis, as suggested for the Escherichia coli 3′-exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase I (pol I) (14Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 15Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), although the stoichiometry of divalent metal ion binding in the active site of PARN is not yet known. To fully understand the catalytic mechanism of PARN it is of fundamental importance to determine metal ion binding coordination and stoichiometry in its active site.Structural analyses by x-ray or NMR are powerful strategies to reveal the presence of divalent metal ions in the active sites of enzymes. However, despite the high resolution provided by these techniques, these methods frequently fail to unambiguously locate catalytically important divalent metal ions. Furthermore, even if the divalent metal ions are correctly located in the active site by structural analysis, it is still necessary to functionally confirm the interaction between the divalent metal ions and their ligands (16Shan S. Kravchuk A.V. Piccirilli J.A. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5161-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, other techniques are required to locate functionally important metal ions. This is of particular importance when structural data, as in the case of PARN, is not available. Sulfur substitutions of oxygen believed to be in direct contact with Mg2+ ions have successfully been used to locate ligands in direct contact with catalytically important Mg2+ ions. This is commonly referred to as “metal ion switch” experiments, and it has successfully been used to locate metal ions in both enzymes and ribozymes (see for example Refs. 16Shan S. Kravchuk A.V. Piccirilli J.A. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5161-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chemically, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ are soft metal ions and coordinate soft atoms such as sulfur, whereas Mg2+, which is a hard metal ion, avoids sulfur as a ligand (23Jaffe E.K. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4823-4825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 24Verma S. Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 99-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of shifting oxygen to sulfur can be compensated to some extent by changing Mg2+ to a soft metal ion; e.g. Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, or Cd2+.Here, the metal ion switch approach has been used to locate divalent metal ions in the active site of PARN. Oxygens located both in the polypeptide chain of PARN and in the RNA substrate for PARN were replaced with sulfur. The replacement of Mg2+ by Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ could rescue PARN activity from PARN mutants where the conserved amino acids Asp-28, Asp-292, or Asp-382 had been substituted to cysteine residues, indicating that these amino acids play important roles for metal ion coordination. The replacement of oxygen to sulfur in the RNA substrate provided evidence that the pro-R oxygen of the scissile phosphorus group of the substrate interacts with divalent metal ions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—The cysteine mutant plasmids pE33-PARN(D28C), pE33PARN(E30C), pE33PARN(D292C), and pE33-PARN(D382C) were obtained from pE33PARN plasmid (13Ren Y.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using a QuikChange site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The pairs of oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: P28C-5 (5′-CGACTTCTTCGCCATCGCAGGGGAGTTTTCAGGAATC-3′), P28C-3 (5′-TTCCTGAAAACTCCCCTGCGATGGCGAAGAAGTCG-3′); P30C-5 (5′-CTTCGCCATCGATGGGGCGTTTTCAGGAATCAGTGATG-3′), P30C-3 (5′-CATCACTGATTCCTGAAAACGCCCCATCGATGGCGAAG-3′); P292C-5 (5′-GACACAATATGCTCTTGGCCGTCATGCACACAGTTC-3′), P292C-3 (5′-GAACTGTGTGCATGACGGCCAAGAGCATATTGTGTC-3′); P382C-5 (5′-CCACGAGGCAGGCTACGCAGCCTACATCACAGGC-3′), P382C-3 (5′-GCCCTGTGATGTAGGCTGCGTAGCCTGCCTCGTGG-3′). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Recombinant PARN—His-tagged recombinant wild type and mutants PARN(D28C), PARN(E30C), PARN(D292C), and PARN(D382C) were purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using a Ni2+ matrix (Novagen Inc.) as described previously (6Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and its purity was analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel following silver staining. High molecular weight silver staining marker was purchased from Sigma.Poly(A)-specific Ribonuclease Activity Assay—Adenosine di-, tri-, and pentanucleotides (A2 (5′-AA-3′), A3 (5′-AAA-3′), and A5 (5′-AAAAA-3′)) were purchased from Dharmacom Research, Inc. Before use, the short substrates were deprotected according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The A3s (5′-AAsA-3′) adenosine trinucleotide isomers I and II, which were modified with phosphorothioate by the replacement of one of the two non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms by a sulfur atom between the second and third adenosides from the 5′-end, were synthesized and purified by the manufacturer (Thermo Hybaid). The isomers I and II had 6.98- and 8.51-min retention times in the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography purification according to the purification reports provided by the company. To identify the absolute configurations of A3s(5′-AAsA-3′) isomers I and II, different concentrations of snake venom phosphodiesterase (Sigma) were used to hydrolyze 5′-32P-labeled A3s isomer I or II in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 5 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 5 min (as previously described (25Burgers P.M. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4798-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)). The resulting products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis.Approximately 20 pmol of A2, A3, and A5 were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase in 20-μl reactions at 37 °C for 1 h. The labeled RNA was then fractionated by electrophoresis on 25% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel and subsequently purified. Deadenylation reactions were carried out in buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg/μl methylated bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm of indicated divalent metal ions) at 30 °C. Recombinant wild type PARN or PARN(D28C), PARN(E30C), PARN(D292C), or PARN(D382C) mutants at 0.3–30 nm (as indicated) was used together with one of the 5′-32P-labeled A2-, A3-, A5-, and A3s-Rp or A3s-Sp substrates at indicated concentration for deadenylation assay. After incubation, the reactions were stopped and the resulting products were separated by electrophoresis in 25% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide)/7 m urea gels. The gels were visualized and quantified using a 400S PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).To kinetically compare the reactions generating A2, using 5′-32 P-end-labeled A3 or A3s-Rp A3 as substrates, deadenylation reactions were performed under single turnover conditions (0.2 nm RNA substrate, 55 nm PARN, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg/μl methylated bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm of indicated divalent metal ion). The reactions were followed over time and terminated at eight different time points. Subsequently the products were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the total amount of A2 and A1 products was quantified at each time point using a 400S PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The total amount of A2 and A1 products is identical to the amount turned over from A3 to A2, because product A2 turns over to A1 (see “Results” and Fig. 2). The calculated total amount of A2, generated in the presence of each divalent metal ion, was plotted versus time. Observed rate constants of cleavage (kobs) were determined by fitting the data to the equation for a single exponential: fcleaved = fend point (1–e–ktobs), where fcleaved = fraction of A3 cleaved to A2, t = time, fend point = maximum fraction of A3 cleaved to A2. The calculated kobs values were based on at least three independent experiments.RESULTSMinimal Substrate Length for PARN—To determine the minimal RNA substrate requirement for PARN degradation, it was investigated if PARN could degrade three short RNA substrates, i.e. adenosine penta-, tri-, and dinucleotides (A5, A3, and A2). The substrates A5 and A3 were efficiently degraded to adenosine A2, in the presence of Mg2+, whereas the A2 substrate was much less efficiently degraded under these conditions (Fig. 1). A similar result was obtained when Mg2+ was replaced by Cd2+, although hydrolysis was less efficient in the presence of Cd2+ (Fig. 2). However, in the presence of Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+, all three substrates were efficiently degraded to mononucleotides (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that A3 is the shortest efficient RNA substrate for PARN in the presence of Mg2+ and that the substrate length requirement for PARN can be modulated by the identity of the divalent metal ion.Fig. 1The shortest sufficient substrate for PARN activity. The 5′-32P-labeled adenosine nucleotides A2, A3, and A5 (0.1 nm) and recombinant human PARN (5 nm) used in the deadenylation reactions in the presence of Mg2+. The reactions were incubated for the indicated times (minutes). Reacted RNA was recovered and fractionated by electrophoresis using 25% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1, v/v). The resulting fluorogram is shown. Size markers (A5, A4, A3, A2, and A1) were fractionated in lane M.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PARN Mutants with Cysteine Substitution in the Active Site Are Inactive in the Presence of Mg2+but Can Be Rescued in the Presence of Soft Divalent Metal Ion—It has previously been shown that four conserved acidic amino acid residues Asp-28, Glu-30, Asp-292, and Asp-382 of PARN are essential for the catalytic activity of PARN (13Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fe2+-mediated hydroxyl radical cleavage provided evidence that Asp-28, Glu-30, and Asp-382, were required for coordination of catalytically important metal ions (13Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that single cysteine substitutions of the conserved acidic amino acid residues severely deteriorated PARN activity in the presence of Mg2+. Some activity could be recovered from the PARN(D382C) mutant after several hours of incubation, although we never managed to detect any hydrolytic activity when using the other cysteine-substituted PARN mutants (data not shown). This suggests that all these conserved acidic amino acid residues are essential for PARN activity, in keeping with our previous results (13Ren Y.G. Martinez J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5982-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Deadenylation activities of wild type PARN and PARN mutants in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+. The deadenylation reactions were performed using 5′-32P-labeled A3 (0.1 nm) RNA substrate and wild type PARN (0.3 nm) or indicated PARN mutants (30 nm) at 30 °C for 5 min in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (1 mm). Reacted RNA was recovered and fractionated by electrophoresis using 25% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1, v/v). The resulting fluorogram is shown. A3, A2, and A1 denote, the locations of adenosine tri-, di-, and mono-nucleotides respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Subsequently, it was investigated if PARN activity could be rescued from the cysteine-substituted PARN mutants in the presence of the soft divalent metal ions Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, or Cd2+. The rational behind this experiment was that introduction of cysteines at specific positions could potentially bring a sulfur group into the active site of PARN and replace an oxygen coordination partner for a catalytically important Mg2+ ion. Such a rescue effect has previously been observed for the V(D)J recombinase (26Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). If this is also the case for PARN, it should be possible to recover PARN activity from the cysteine-substituted mutants by the addition of a soft divalent metal ion, such as Mn2+. Fig. 3 shows that PARN activity was indeed recovered in the presence of Mn2+ for the mutants PARN(D28C), PARN(D292C), and PARN(D382C). The restoration of PARN activity for PARN(D28C), PARN(D292C), and PARN(D382C) mutants was also observed in the presence of other soft metal ions, Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ (Fig. 2 and data not shown). No activity was recovered from the PARN(E30C) mutant (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The results from these rescue experiments showed that divalent metal ions were absolutely required for the PARN reaction and suggested that amino acids Asp-28, Asp-292, and Asp-382 are involved in the coordination divalent metal ion(s) essential for catalytic activity.Phosphorothioate Modification of RNA Substrate Interferes with PARN Activity—To investigate how the one or more catalytically important divalent metal ions are coordinated by the RNA substrate, one of the non-bridging oxygen atoms of the phosphodiester bond between the second and third adenosine residues of the A3 substrate was replaced by sulfur (as shown in Fig. 4). This substrate was referred to as A3s (5′-AAsA-3′) and existed in two diastereomeric isomers, Rp- and Sp-configurations, respectively. Each isomer was purified, and subsequently the configuration of the purified isomers was investigated by snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion. Fig. 5 shows that the A3s isomer I was hydrolyzed much faster by snake venom phosphodiesterase than the isomer II. Thus, the A3s isomer I was assigned the Rp-configuration and the A3s isomer II the Sp-configuration because Rp-diastereomeric RNA is the preferred substrate for snake venom phosphodiesterase (25Burgers P.M. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4798-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This conclusion was further supported by the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography purification profile in which the isomer I had a shorter retention time than the isomer II (see “Experimental Procedures”). The separation of Rp- and Sp-isomers of a singly thio-substituted oligoribonucleotide by high performance liquid chromatography has been well documented in the literature (25Burgers P.M. Eckstein F.

The 5′-32P-labeled adenosine trinucleotides (A3s) isomer I or II (as indicated) were hydrolyzed in indicated concentrations (0.3, 0.03, or 0.003 pmol/μl) of snake venom phosphodiesterase. Reacted RNA was recovered and fractionated by electrophoresis using 25% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1, v/v). The resulting fluorogram is shown.

In lane NC the RNA substrate A3 s was incubated in the absence of snake venom phosphodiesterase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The purified A3s-Rp and A3s-Sp isomeric substrates were incubated with PARN, and the Rp-phosphorothioate-modified A3s-Rp substrate could be deadenylated both in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Fig. 6). In contrast to this, no PARN activity was recovered when the A3s-Sp substrate was used in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Fig. 6). Notably, no PARN activity was recovered when using the A3s-Sp substrate even after 7 h of incubation or in the presence of Cd2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ (data not shown). The PARN activities under single turnover conditions when using the A3 or the A3s-Rp substrates in the presence of different divalent metal ions were subsequently quantified. The results from this analysis are summarized in Table I. From this analysis it is concluded that the A3s-Rp substrate is ∼60-fold less efficiently cleaved than the A3 substrate in the presence of Mg2+. However, when Mg2+ was replaced by either Mn2+ or Zn2+ only 2.3- or 1.3-fold differences in relative catalytic efficiency, respectively, were observed between the two substrates. Thus, replacement of Mg2+ with any of the soft divalent metal ions Mn2+ or Zn2+ rescued the PARN activity significantly and improved the deadenylation reaction for the A3s-Rp substrate relative to the A3 substrate. In summary, these data suggest that the pro-R oxygen atom of the scissile phosphorus plays a key role during the cleavage of A3 to A2.Fig. 6Deadenylation of phosphorothioate-modified adenosine trinucleotides in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+. The deadenylation reactions were carried out by using 5′-32P-labeled A3s-Rp or A3s-Sp (0.1 nm) and PARN (30 nm) at 30 °C for 5 min in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (1 mm) as indicated.

In this site of DNA pol I the nucleophile (water or hydroxide ion, which is oriented by metal ion A, Glu-357 and Tyr-497 of DNA pol I) attacks the scissile phosphate to form a penta-coordinated transition state indicating an SN2 in-line mechanism. After breakage of the phosphodiester bond, the negative charge on the leaving group is stabilized by metal ion B (17Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2059156009,"We investigated the role of tumor suppressor p53 and Fas (CD95/APO-1), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, in neural progenitors response to γ-irradiation exposure. Telencephalic cells were obtained from wild-type C57Bl/6, or p53−/− or fas−/−, 15-day-old mouse embryos. They were cultured in conditions allowing neural progenitors to form proliferating clusters (neurospheres). A 2 Gy γ-irradiation induced a G1 cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis in wild-type neural progenitor cultures in correlation with an enhanced expression of p53 and of its downstream target p21WAF1, both of them acquiring a nuclear localization. These effects did not occur in p53−/− neural progenitors demonstrating the central role played by p53 in their response to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody Jo2 directed against Fas induced apoptosis of wild type but not of fas−/− neural progenitors, indicating the existence of a functional Fas signaling pathway in neural progenitors. Ionizing radiation induced an increase of Fas membrane expression related to a p53-dependent increase of fas mRNA expression in wild-type neural progenitors. Moreover, fas−/− neural progenitors exhibited delayed radiation-induced apoptosis compared to wild-type cells. Therefore, these findings establish a role for Fas/CD95 related to p53 in the response of neural progenitors to γ-radiation exposure. Similar mechanisms could be triggered in neural progenitors in case of different stresses during brain development or in the course of various diseases affecting the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1986605564,"Significant reduction in oxygen affinity resulting from interactions between heterotropic allosteric effectors and hemoglobin in not only the unligated derivative but also the fully ligated form has been reported (Tsuneshige, A., Park, S. I., and Yonetani, T. (2002) Biophys. Chem. 98, 49–63; Yonetani, T., Park, S. I., Tsuneshige, A., Imai, K., and Kanaori, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 34508–34520). To further investigate this effect in more detail, α- and β-semihemoglobins, namely, α(heme)β(apo) and α(apo)β(heme), respectively, were prepared and characterized with respect to the impact of allosteric effectors on both conformation and ligand binding properties. Semihemoglobins are dimers characterized by a high affinity for oxygen and lack of cooperativity. We found that, compared with stripped conditions, semihemoglobins responded to effectors (inositol hexaphosphate and L35) by decreasing the affinity for oxygen by 60- and 130-fold for α- and β-semihemoglobins, respectively. 1H NMR and sedimentation velocity experiments carried out with their ligated and unligated forms in the absence and presence of effectors revealed that semihemoglobins always remain as single-heme-carrying dimers. Recombination kinetics of their photolyzed CO derivatives showed that effectors did indeed interact with their ligated forms. Measurements of the Fe-His stretching mode show that the semihemoglobins undergo a large ligand binding-induced conformational shift and that both ligand-free and ligand derivatives respond to the presence of effectors. Contradictions to the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux/Perutz allosteric model arise since 1) the modulation of ligand affinity is not achieved in semihemoglobins by the formation of a low affinity T conformation (quaternary effect) but by direct interaction with effectors, 2) effectors do interact significantly with ligated forms of high affinity semihemoglobins, and 3) modulation of the ligand affinity and the cooperativity are not necessarily linked but instead can be separated into two distinct phenomena that can be isolated. Significant reduction in oxygen affinity resulting from interactions between heterotropic allosteric effectors and hemoglobin in not only the unligated derivative but also the fully ligated form has been reported (Tsuneshige, A., Park, S.

This ligation process is characterized by a phenomenon called cooperativity; each successive ligation of the hemes within a tetramer is accompanied by a progressive increase in the affinity for oxygen of the remaining hemes. Cooperativity can be described by the so-called two-state or Monod-Wyman-Changeaux (MWC) allosteric model (1Monod J. Wyman J. Changeaux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6149) Google Scholar), which proposes that Hb is allowed to assume only two conformations, T or tense, characterized by a low affinity for the ligand and typical of the unligated form, and R or relaxed, with high affinity and typical of the ligated form. Progressive ligation shifts eventually the allosteric equilibrium from T to R. With the proposal by Perutz (2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) of his stereochemical mechanism, the correlation of two distinct molecular structures, unligated and ligated, with the so-called quaternary T and quaternary R functional conformations, respectively, was tacitly established. The T conformation was stabilized by an intricate network of interdimeric interactions, namely, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed mainly between α1 and β2 (or α2 and β1). Upon ligation of the hemes, these interactions broke apart, releasing the allosteric constraint and the two heterodimers rearranged to adopt a more stable conformation, which was reached by a slight rotation of one dimer over the other, resulting in the R conformation (2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 3Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Cox J.M. Goaman L.C.G. Nature. 1968; 256: 759-761Google Scholar). Since then the R conformation was associated with the ligated state, which was characterized by a high affinity for ligands, and the T conformation was typical of the unligated form of Hb and was characterized by a low affinity for ligands. However, recently, certain experimental evidence has shown that the allosteric mechanism of Hb is far more versatile than what it has been known. For instance, the so-called Bohr effect, i.e. the change in oxygen affinity upon pH change, might not be the product of the direct interplay between protons and Hb but, rather, between heterotropic effectors and Hb, regulated by proton concentration (4Tsuneshige A. Park S.I. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Yonetani T. Park S.I. Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Kanaori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34508-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Yonetani T. Tsuneshige A. C. R. Biologies. 2003; 326: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Clear evidence was shown when only pH was allowed to vary in the absence of any other effectors, including chloride; Hb displayed an extremely diminished Bohr effect. However, upon introduction of heterotropic effectors, the Bohr effect increased dramatically, and its magnitude correlated directly with the strength of the effector: the stronger the effector (or a combination of these), the larger the Bohr effect. This enhanced Bohr effect, mediated by the interaction with effectors, is reminiscent of the so-called Root effect (exaggerated Bohr effect), found in some fish Hbs, although it was not previously observed in human Hb. It was also noticed that in the presence of strong allosteric effectors, Hb showed an extremely reduced affinity for oxygen with a near absence of cooperativity. In classical terms, this could be interpreted as if the interactions with heterotropic effectors stabilize the molecule in the low affinity T conformation in such a way that the transition of Hb to the high affinity R conformation was hindered. However, structural analysis with quaternary probes showed that the molecule once ligated indeed adopted the R conformation (4Tsuneshige A. Park S.I. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Yonetani T. Park S.I. Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Kanaori K. J. Biol.

Biologies. 2003; 326: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This implied that the R conformation does not always equate with high affinity for oxygen. This puzzling situation prompted us to formulate the question of whether the heterotropic effectors did in fact interact with the fully ligated R conformation. According to the MWC model, only the deoxy T conformation is expected to interact with heterotropic effectors, thus stabilizing the low affinity state despite the fact that some previous works have shown that some effectors, such as chloride, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, IHP, and ATP do indeed bind to the oxy-Hb (7Chiancone E. Norne J.E. Forsen S. Antonini E Wyman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Kwong S. McCord J.M. J. Mol.

Detailed functional studies of these interactions, however, were not conducted. To investigate the interactions of allosteric effectors with the R conformation of Hb, we prepared α- and β-semi-Hbs (dimers of the form α(heme)β(apo) and α(apo)β(heme), respectively) and studied systematically the effect of strong allosteric effectors, namely, IHP and L35, a potent regulator (10Lalezari I. Rahbar S. Lalezari P. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6117-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) on their oxygenation characteristics. The use of semi-Hbs allowed us to examine exclusively the intradimeric interactions (between α1 and β1, or α2 and β2), since semi-Hbs did not form tetramers under any condition, and therefore, the interdimeric interactions (between α1 and β2, or α2 and β1) were absent. According to the stereochemical model of Perutz (2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), allostery in Hb is governed primarily by events that occur upon ligation in the interdimeric interface, namely, α1β2, or α2β1, that leads to the quaternary T → R conformation transition. Surprisingly, our results with semi-Hbs suggest that this is not a necessary condition. All reagents and buffers were of analytical grade. L35 was synthesized according to Lalezari et al. (10Lalezari I. Rahbar S. Lalezari P. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6117-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and purified by double crystallization. Preparation of Hb—Human adult Hb was purified from expired red blood cells, obtained from the local branch of the American Red Cross, and processed as previously described (4Tsuneshige A. Park S.I. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hb was promptly converted to the CO form, stripped from organic phosphates, and further purified by ionic exchange chromatography using CM resin in a sodium phosphate buffer system to remove minor components. The final Hb solution was in 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, saturated with carbon monoxide, concentrated by ultrafiltration using Omega nominal molecular weight cut-off 10,000 disc membranes (Pall Filtron Corp., Northborough, MA) and stored in the cold. Before use, whenever oxy-Hb was needed, CO was removed by exposing the sample to strong illumination under a stream of pure oxygen on ice water. Preparation of Semi-Hbs—α- and β-semi-Hbs were prepared essentially as described previously (11Barnejee R. Cassoly R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 133: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Cassoly R. Bucci E. Iwatsubo M. Barnejee R. Biochim. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). α- and β-subunits were isolated from CO-Hb according to the method of Bucci and Fronticelli (15Bucci E. Fronticelli C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 250: 551-552Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and remained in the CO form throughout the preparation. ApoHb was obtained by the acid-acetone method of Rossi-Fanelli and Antonini (16Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 77: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) from a 1 mm solution of oxy-Hb thoroughly desalted. Either α- or β-subunits in the CO form were mixed with the apoHb solution and allowed to incubate in the cold for 2 days under a CO atmosphere. Replaced apo subunits appeared as a creamy precipitate and were removed by centrifugation. Semi-Hbs thus obtained were purified by ionic exchange chromatography, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored in the cold until use. A satisfactory preparation did not produce any precipitate over time and showed an electrophoretic band slightly diffuse and intermediate to α-subunits and HbA0. Conversion to the oxy form of the semi-Hbs was achieved as described above for COHb. Oxygenation Measurements—Oxygen equilibrium curves were obtained using an improved version of the Imai apparatus (17Imai K. Yonetani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 200: 189-196Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Imai K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as described previously (4Tsuneshige A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23031-23040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sample concentration was 60 μm heme (120 μm subunits in the case of semi-Hbs) in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.6–8.6, containing no chloride (stripped conditions), IHP (2 mm), L35 (0.5 mm), or a combination of IHP and L35 (2 and 0.5 mm, respectively). To prevent metHb formation, small amounts of superoxide dismutase and catalase (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the samples. All measurements were carried out at 15 °C. Oxygen was grade 4.4, and nitrogen was grade 5.0 (BOC gases, Murray Hill, NJ). 1H NMR Measurements—Spectra were measured on a Bruker ARX-500 spectrometer at 15 °C. Semi-Hb samples (1 mm heme) in the CO form were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O containing 0.1 m HEPES and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0. The water signal was suppressed by using a jump-and-return pulse sequence (20Plateau P. Guerón M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Proton chemical shifts were referred to internal sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4. CO Recombination Kinetics—Geminate and solvent phase recombination after photodissociation by 530-nm Nd:YAG second harmonic 7-ns pulses at 1 Hz was monitored and displayed according to a method previously described (21Samuni U. Dantsker D. Khan I. Friedman A.J. Peterson E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25783-25790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Dantsker D. Samuni U. Friedman A.J. Yang M. Ray A. Friedman J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The kinetics at 3.5 °C were displayed on a log-log plot of normalized absorbance versus time. Samples were 0.5 mm in dimer in a 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer using a 1-mm cuvette. Effector concentrations were 2 mm IHP and 0.5 mm L35. Visible Resonance Raman—Corresponding spectra were generated from the deoxy and CO photoproduct forms of semi-Hbs using a 436-nm 8-ns pulses at 20 Hz as previously described (21Samuni U. Dantsker D. Khan I. Friedman A.J. Peterson E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25783-25790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The samples, held in an air tight NMR tubes, were 0.5 mm in dimer and in a 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer. The sample was cooled to 4 °C and was spun throughout the measurement to ensure that each laser pulse sampled a fresh spot. The concentrations of the effectors were 2 mm IHP and 0.5 mm L35. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—To determine the molecular weight of the semi-Hbs in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors, analytical experiments were carried out on a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60-Ti rotor. HbA (60 μm on heme) or semi-Hbs (60 μm on heme, 120 μm on chain) were either in the CO- or deoxy form in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 15 °C, and the ligation state was confirmed by scanning the absorbance of the samples spinning at 3,000 rpm. Conditions for allosteric effectors were 2 mm IHP and a combination of 2 mm IHP and 0.5 mm L35. Sedimentation was monitored at 540 nm so that the total absorbance was around 0.8 absorbance units. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated with the program Sedfit (23Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar) and were corrected to s20,w using standard procedures. Effect of Allosteric Effectors on the Oxygenation Properties of HbA and α- and β-semi-Hbs—Fig. 1A shows oxygen affinity curves for HbA at 15 °C, pH 7.4, in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors. Upon the addition of allosteric effectors, the oxygenation curves experienced a right shift (decrease in oxygen affinity). The effectors in increasing order of potency under the conditions were: stripped (P50 = 0.89 torr), L35 (P50 = 17.6 torr), IHP (P50 = 26.6 torr), and a combination of IHP and L35 (P50 = 93.9 torr). Here P50 indicates the partial pressure of oxygen at 50% saturation as a way to express affinity. In other words, relative to stripped conditions, the oxygen affinity of HbA dropped more than 100-fold in the presence of strong allosteric effectors. In the presence of chloride, the upper asymptote of the curve matched roughly that of stripped HbA, which was similar to that showed by isolated β subunits (β4). However, in the presence of effectors, the upper asymptote experienced a dramatic decrease. We observed a change in Khigh, 2Klow and Khigh, oxygen association equilibrium constants for the initial and final oxygen binding (in torr–1), respectively, corresponding to the lower (low affinity) and higher (high affinity) asymptotes on the Hill plots. For the present work we preferred the use of Klow and Khigh over K1 and K4 (Adair analysis for a 4 binding site system) or KT and RK (MWC model) since they are analysis model independent. Association equilibrium constants for semi-Hbs were simply referred as K since they have only one binding site and show no cooperativity. the association equilibrium constant for the final ligation step, from 12 torr–1 for stripped conditions to 0.021 torr–1 when IHP and L35 were present (570-fold drop) at pH 7.4 and to 0.0085 torr–1 (1400-fold drop) at pH 6.6 (not shown). The lower asymptotes (Klow values) also exhibited downward shifts that correlated with the strength of the effectors, but the changes were less severe compared with those observed in the upper asymptote (Khigh values). As a result of this combined effect, the cooperativity index, nmax (indicated by the slope of the oxygenation curve on transition from a low to a high saturation degree), diminished drastically. The extreme case was detected at pH 6.6 in the presence of IHP and L35; nmax for HbA dropped to 1.06, whereas the P50 reached a value of 111.4 torr–1 (not shown). In the case of α-semi-Hb (Fig. 1B), shifts were moderate when IHP (P50 = 0.56 torr) or L35 (P50 = 1.03 torr) alone was present. However, in the presence of both IHP and L35, the oxygenation curve shifted even farther to the right. The oxygen affinity, expressed as P50, dropped from 0.34 torr (stripped conditions) to 19.5 torr (IHP + L35); that is, a modulation of ∼60×. Some apparent negative cooperativity can be observed in the curves containing IHP and IHP + L35. This was probably due to a slow oxidation of α-hemes that occurred along the oxygenation measurements. Because there is only one heme per semi-Hb molecule and the oxidized heme is minimal at the beginning of the measurements, the representative oxygenation characteristic of the sample correspond to initial stages of the measurement process. Larger effects on oxygen affinity were detected for β-semi-Hb (Fig. 1C). The effectors in increasing order were: stripped (P50 = 0.23 torr), IHP (P50 = 1.3 torr), L35 (P50 = 7.3 torr), and IHP + L35 (P50 = 29.4 torr). β-Semi-Hb exhibited the largest drop in oxygen affinity with the combined effect of IHP and L35; that is, a 130-fold increase in P50 value, which is even larger than that computed for HbA (100-fold). Strikingly, here the effect of L35 is larger than that of IHP when compared with the case of HbA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the lowering effects on oxygen affinity by IHP and L35 were almost comparable with each other. However, the effects of IHP and L35 were additive, indicating that these effectors actuated in combined action on different sites of the Hb and semi-Hbs molecules. In the case of β-semi-Hb (Fig. 2B), it is clear that the effect of IHP was much reduced compared with that of L35. The interaction of IHP was more sensitive to pH (the effect decreased considerably as pH was increased above 7.8) than that of L35, consistent with the hydrophobic nature of the latter interaction. However, like in the case of HbA, the effects of IHP and L35 were additive. 1H NMR Spectra of β-semi-Hb—As shown in Fig. 3A, in the absence of L35, the exchangeable proton signals at 12.3 and 13.1 ppm, originated from hydrogen bonds in the α1β1 subunit interface, were almost identical to those in CO-Hb, indicating that the interface in semi-β Hb is well formed. The addition of L35 caused a decrease of the signal at 13.1 ppm, with a concomitant increase of the signal at 12.8 ppm. In addition, two broad peaks appeared around 11.9 and 14.1 ppm. Upon increasing the concentration of L35, the ring-current-shifted proton resonance of E11 βValγ2-CH3 at –1.8 ppm (24Dalvit C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) disappeared, whereas a new peak appeared at –2.2 ppm (Fig. 3A). The exchangeable proton resonance and E11 Valγ2-CH3 of semi-β Hb in the CO form in the presence of L35 and IHP exhibited almost identical features to those in the presence of L35 alone (Fig. 3). However, there were some differences in the chemical shift of other ring-current-shifted protons from –0.5 to –1.5 ppm (Fig. 3B, right panel) (24Dalvit C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CO Recombination Kinetics—Fig. 4A shows the recombination of photolyzed CO to α-semi-Hb in the absence of any allosteric effector (trace b) and presence of IHP + L35 (trace c). They are compared with native COHbA (trace a) under relatively low photodissociation where there is no low affinity state rebinding as a control for the high affinity state and the corresponding α(Fe-CO)2β(Zn)2 hybrid Hb + IHP at pH 6.5 (trace d) as a control for the low affinity state. Fig 4B shows the corresponding results for β-semi-Hb under the same conditions but with α(Zn)2β(Fe-CO)2 hybrid Hb as a control for the low affinity state (25Samuni U. Jurszczak L. Dantsker D. Khan I. Firedman A.J. Perez-Gonzalez de Apodaca J. Bruno S. Hui H.L. Colby J.E. Karasik E. Kwiatkowski L.D. Mozzarelli A. Noble R. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8272-8288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The portion that extends throughout the nanosecond scale corresponds to the geminate recombination. Under the present conditions, α- and β-semi-Hbs showed only first order recombination phase that is comparable with the fast bimolecular phase observed for R state HbA. When compared with stripped conditions, the presence of effectors slightly extended the recombination phase in the case of α-semi-Hb. In contrast, the bimolecular phase for the case of β-semi-Hb is significantly altered. The geminate yield was reduced from 55 to about 35%, and the recombination phase extended for about 2.5 decades. These results indicate that the recombination process of CO to α- and β-semi-Hbs is indeed affected by the presence of allosteric effectors under conditions where these models do exhibit behavior consistent with any quaternary conformational change. It can also be seen that the recombination processes from the semi-Hbs are markedly different from those of the low affinity CO-ligated Fe-Zn hybrids in which the recombination traces showed an extremely low geminate yield and extended almost parallel to the abscissa throughout the 100-μs time scale, typical of low affinity native HbA locked in the T state conformation (25Samuni U. Jurszczak L. Dantsker D. Khan I. Firedman A.J. Perez-Gonzalez de Apodaca J. Bruno S. Hui H.L. Colby J.E. Karasik E. Kwiatkowski L.D. Mozzarelli A. Noble R. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8272-8288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CO rebinding experiments with NEM-treated β-semi-Hb (Fig. 4C) in the absence of effectors showed that only the geminate yield was reduced from 55 to 45% with no effect on the bimolecular phase. In the presence of IHP and L35, the recombination process was extended about a decade. Similar changes in the kinetic patterns were observed for NEM-treated HbA (26Khan I. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Friedman A.J. Bonaventura C. Manjula B. Acharya S. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7581-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Visible Resonance Raman—Figs. 5, A and B show the low frequency region of the Soret-enhanced resonance Raman spectra from both the semi-Hbs as well as selected reference species. The low frequency peak located between 214 and 230 cm–1 in these figures arises from the conformation-sensitive iron-proximal histidine-stretching mode often referred to as the νFe-His mode. Fig. 5A shows the spectra for the deoxy derivatives of the semi-Hbs as well as the 8-ns photoproduct spectrum of COHbA. Not shown is the corresponding spectrum from deoxy-HbA, which is very similar to that of the deoxy-α-semi-Hb in the presence of effectors seen in the bottom of the figure. Fig. 5B shows the 8-ns photoproduct spectra from the semi-Hbs along with photoproduct spectra from COHbA and CO myoglobin. The overall pattern of changes seen for the semi-Hbs as a function of ligation resembles those seen for HbA (25Samuni U. Jurszczak L. Dantsker D. Khan I. Firedman A.J. Perez-Gonzalez de Apodaca J.

In both instances (HbA and the semi-Hbs), the transition from the deoxy to the photoproduct species is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of νFe-His, a slight shift to higher frequency for the heme γ7 mode at ∼ 300 cm–1, and a decrease in intensity for the propionate-sensitive band at ∼340 cm–1. Changes of this magnitude as a function of ligation are not usually seen for either myoglobins or noncooperative Hbs. A summary of the frequencies for the νFe-His band as a function of protein and solution conditions is given in Table I. Despite being high affinity noncooperative forms under stripped conditions, semi-Hbs in their unligated forms showed νFe-His values that are substantially lower than those for the corresponding photodissociated ligated forms. In going from the photoproducts to the unligated forms, the stretching frequencies are shifted downfield by 9.4 and 11 cm–1 for α- and β-semi-Hbs, respectively. The presence of allosteric effectors produced a downshift in their frequencies of 4.5 cm–1 for α-semi-Hb and 1.2 cm–1 for β-semi-Hb in the unligated forms, whereas the shifts to lower frequencies for the photodissociated forms are 1 cm–1 for α-semi-Hb and 3.6 cm–1 for β-semi-Hbs.Table IFe-His stretching frequencies (νFe-His) for α- and β-semi-Hbs in the deoxy and the photodissociated (8 ns) forms in the absence and presence of allosteric effectorsSpeciesLigation stateEffector(s)νFe-HisP50cm-1torrα-Semi-HbDeoxyStripped218.50.34α-Semi-HbDeoxy+IHP, +L3521419.5β-Semi-HbDeoxyStripped218.20.23β-Semi-HbDeoxy+IHP, +L3521729.4α-Semi-HbCO + hνStripped227.9α-Semi-HbCO + hν+IHP, +L35226.9β-Semi-HbCO + hνStripped229.2β-Semi-HbCO + hν+IHP, +L35225.6β-Semi-Hb -NEMCO + hνStripped225.5β-Semi-Hb -NEMCO + hν+IHP, +L35223.8 Open table in a new tab There are distinct νFe-His differences between the semi-Hbs and HbA in both the frequencies and the amplitude of the frequency changes.

https://openalex.org/W2068666802,"Protein-nucleic acid interactions are responsible for the regulation of key biological events such as genomic transcription and recombination and viral replication. However, the recognition mechanisms involved in these processes are not completely understood. Here, we investigate the dominant forces involved in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions for the 80-amino-acid C-terminal domain of the E2 protein (E2c) from human papillomavirus (HPV-16). The E2c protein is a homodimer that specifically binds to double-stranded DNA containing the consensus sequence ACCG-N<sub>4</sub>-CGGT, where N is any nucleotide. DNA binding affinity is reduced by lowering water chemical potential, accompanied by an increase in cooperativity. Wyman linkage relations between affinity and water chemical potential indicate that 11 additional water molecules are bound in the formation of the complex between E2c and DNA. Salt dissociation isotherms showed that 10 counterions are released upon association, even at low water activity, indicating that this latter variable does not change the electrostatic component of the interaction. Further analysis demonstrates a strong dependence of cooperativity of binding on the protein concentration. Altogether, these results reveal a novel binding pathway in which the consolidated complex may achieve its final form via a monomer-DNA intermediate, which favors the binding of a second monomer. This molecular mechanism reveals the contributions of multiple conformers in a tight virus genome modulation that seems to be important in the cell infection scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2032253601,"Mdm2 and its homolog Mdm4 inhibit the function of the tumor suppressor p53. Targeted disruption of either mdm2 or mdm4 genes in mice results in embryonic lethality that is completely rescued by concomitant deletion of p53, suggesting that deletion of negative regulators of p53 results in a constitutively active p53. Thus, these mouse models offer a unique in vivo system to assay the functional significance of different p53 modifications. Phosphorylation of serine 389 in murine p53 occurs specifically after ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage, and phosphorylation of this site enhances p53 activity both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, mice with a serine to alanine substitution at serine 389 (p53S389A) in the endogenous p53 locus were generated. To examine the in vivo significance of serine 389 phosphorylation during embryogenesis, we crossed these mutant mice to mice lacking mdm2 or mdm4. The p53S389A allele did not alter the embryonic lethality of mdm2 or mdm4. Additional crosses to assay the effect of one p53S389A allele with a p53 null allele also did not rescue the lethal phenotypes. In conclusion, the phenotypes due to loss of mdm2 or mdm4 were not even partially rescued by p53S389A, suggesting that p53S389A is functionally wild type during embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2048028181,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its cognate receptor (EGF-R) are often dysregulated in human neoplasia. Moreover, EGF-R-transformed cell lines have constitutive EGF-R activity, which makes elucidation of its effects difficult to determine. In the following studies, the effects of a novel conditionally activated form of EGF-R, v-ErbB:ER, on the morphological transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and the abrogation of hematopoietic cell cytokine dependence were investigated. The v-ErbB ES-4 oncogene was fused to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER). This construct, v-ErbB:ER, requires beta-estradiol or 4-OH tamoxifen for activation. v-ErbB:ER conditionally transformed NIH-3T3 cells and abrogated cytokine dependence of hematopoietic cells. Stimulation of v-ErbB:ER activity resulted in the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascades. To determine the importance of these signal transduction pathways, the conditionally transformed hematopoietic cells were treated with EGF-R, PI3K and MEK inhibitors. The EGF-R inhibitor AG1478 effectively inhibited MEK, ERK and Akt activation, and induced apoptosis when the cells were grown in response to v-ErbB:ER. Apoptosis was observed at 100- to 1000-fold lower concentrations of AG1478 when the cells were grown in response to v-ErbB:ER as opposed to IL-3. Furthermore, the parental, BCR-ABL- and Raf-transformed cells were only susceptible to the apoptosis-inducing effects of AG1478 at the highest concentrations demonstrating the specificity of these inhibitors. MEK or PI3K inhibitors suppressed ERK or Akt activation, respectively, and induced apoptosis in the v-ErbB:ER-responsive cells. However, MEK and PI3K inhibitors only induced apoptosis at 1000-fold higher concentrations than the EGFR inhibitor. This novel v-ErbB:ER construct and these conditionally transformed cell lines will be useful to further elucidate ErbB-mediated signal transduction and to determine the effectiveness of various inhibitors in targeting different aspects of EGF-R-mediated signal transduction and malignant transformation."
