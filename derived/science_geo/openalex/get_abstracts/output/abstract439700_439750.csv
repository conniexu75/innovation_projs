https://openalex.org/W2005764159,"Gain of chromosome 17q correlates with high-stage disease, an adverse clinical outcome and leads to the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BIRC5/Survivin in neuroblastoma (NB). We have shown before that Survivin defines a threshold for the sensitivity of NB cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents that require FOXO3 activation for apoptosis induction. To investigate the molecular basis of apoptosis inhibition we analyzed the function of Survivin at mitochondria and uncovered that Survivin induces mitochondrial fragmentation, reduces mitochondrial respiration and represses BCL2L11/Bim. Mitochondrial fission depends on Survivin-induced recruitment of the fission regulator DNM1L/Drp1 to mitochondria. In parallel, Survivin expression inhibits the respiratory complex-I, thereby preventing reactive oxygen species accumulation and, as a consequence, FOXO3-induced apoptosis. The loss of energy production via oxidative phosphorylation is compensated by increased glycolysis in Survivin-overexpressing NB tumor cells. Glycolysis inhibitors neutralize the antiapoptotic effect of Survivin and sensitize high-stage NB to DNA-damaging drugs. This suggests that glycolysis inhibitors target an ‘archilles heel’ of Survivin-overexpressing NB and may be highly useful as chemosensitizers in the treatment of high-stage NB."

Significance: The architecture of the GE complex is defined in greater detail. As our understanding of subcellular structures in eukaryotes improves, a conclusion is emerging that proteins in common pathways often organize into complexes that facilitate the performance of the pathway's metabolic/signaling function (1Vonck J.

Binding sites of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), aldolase, and phosphofructokinase have been carefully mapped to sequences near the NH2 terminus of band 3, and association of GEs with this site has been shown to lead to enzyme inhibition (14Strapazon E.

J. 2006; 400: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, assembly of the GE complex on band 3 has been shown to be regulated by both the oxygenation state of hemoglobin and the phosphorylation state of band 3 (10Campanella M.E. Chu H. Low P.S. Assembly and regulation of a glycolytic enzyme complex on the human erythrocyte membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Recently, Su et al. (18Su Y. Blake-Palmer K.G. Fry A.C. Best A. Brown A.C. Hiemstra T.F. Horita S. Zhou A. Toye A.M. Karet F.E. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is required for band 3 (anion exchanger 1) membrane residency in the mammalian kidney.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2011; 300: F157-F166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have reported the binding of GAPDH to the COOH terminus of both erythrocyte and kidney band 3, suggesting that additional GE docking sites may exist elsewhere on the erythrocyte membrane. This hypothesis has, in fact, been strengthened by observations showing that LDH and pyruvate kinase isoform M1/M2 (PK) do not bind to the common GE site at the NH2 terminus of band 3, yet their membrane association is regulated by hemoglobin oxygenation and band 3 phosphorylation similarly to GEs that dock at the NH2-terminal site (17Chu H. Low P.S. Mapping of glycolytic enzyme-binding sites on human erythrocyte band 3.Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, an analogous band 3-centered complex of GEs has been found in murine erythrocytes (19Campanella M.E. Chu H. Wandersee N.J. Peters L.L. Mohandas N. Gilligan D.M. Low P.S. Characterization of glycolytic enzyme interactions with murine erythrocyte membranes in wild-type and membrane protein knockout mice.Blood. 2008; 112: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), where defects or deletions in band 3-associated proteins have been observed to exert profound effects on GE complex stability, suggesting the involvement of additional membrane proteins in the architecture of the GE complex. glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase isoform M1/M2 Src homology 3. In an effort to identify the other major components of the erythrocyte membrane GE complex, a method known as “label transfer” was employed to detect membrane proteins with which the major GEs interact. The method involves the labeling of a desired “bait” protein (i.e. a glycolytic enzyme) with sulfo-SBED (a photoactivatable trifunctional biotin transfer reagent) and then allowing the labeled GE to reassemble on the membrane. After exposure to UV light (which triggers biotin transfer to any proximal membrane protein), the newly biotinylated membrane proteins are identified by Western blot analysis and/or mass spectrometry. Using this method, we report that GEs associate with highly specific peptides on β-spectrin, ankyrin, actin, protein 4.2, and other GEs as well as a second prominent site on band 3. GAPDH, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), PK, all rabbit muscle enzymes, and endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade) were purchased from Roche Applied Science as suspensions in ammonium sulfate. Streptavidin HRP was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Sulfo-SBED, micro-BCA assay kit, SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, and CL-Xposure film were purchased from Pierce. Softlink Soft Release Avidin resin and sequencing grade trypsin were purchased from Promega. d-Biotin was from Supelco. RapiGest was purchased from Waters. dl-Dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and iodoacetamide were obtained from Sigma. Molecular weight markers (SeeBlue prestained standard) were purchased from Invitrogen. Enzymes were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, and pH 7.3. Sulfo-SBED (1 mg), a photocross-linking reagent that reacts in the dark with primary amines (e.g. lysine side chains), was dissolved in 100 μl of N,N-dimethylformamide in the dark and used as indicated by the manufacturer at a 1:1 molar ratio to label the GEs. Labeling was performed in the dark at room temperature for 30 min under constant stirring. Samples were then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in the dark against Hepes buffer to remove all unreacted cross-linker and then either used immediately or stored frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use. Blood was obtained from normal volunteers and sedimented immediately at 1000 × g for 10 min. Plasma and buffy coat were removed, and cells were carefully washed three times in 0.9% NaCl, each time discarding the upper layer of red cells to assure complete elimination of white cells. After washing, each red cell suspension was inspected for contaminating leukocytes using a hemocytometer and washed again until residual leukocytes constituted <0.01% of the cells. When desired, the washed erythrocytes were treated with chymotrypsin to cleave band 3 at an extracellular site (20Steck T.L. Ramos B. Strapazon E. Proteolytic dissection of band 3, predominant transmembrane polypeptide of human erythrocyte-membrane.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from washed erythrocytes following established protocols (21Bennett V. Proteins involved in membrane-cytoskeleton association in human erythrocytes. Spectrin, ankyrin, and band 3.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Membranes were invariably used within 48 h of preparation. Freshly prepared leaky membranes and enzymes were separately dialyzed against incubation buffer (5 mm PO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, pH 7.0), after which their protein concentrations were determined by a BCA assay. For GE reconstitution purposes, the band 3 content of the dialyzed membranes was assumed to be ∼29% of the total membrane protein (22Hassoun H. Wang Y. Vassiliadis J. Lutchman M. Palek J. Aish L. Aish I.S. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Targeted inactivation of murine band 3 (AE1) gene produces a hypercoagulable state causing widespread thrombosis in vivo.Blood. 1998; 92: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Disorders of the Erythrocyte Membrane.in: Gallagher P.G. Lux S.E. Nathan D. Orkin S.H. Oski F.A. Hematology of Infancy and Children. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia2003: 560-684Google Scholar), and based on this calculation, a 2–3-fold molar excess of the labeled GE over band 3 was added to the membrane suspension. Following incubation of the mixture for 90 min in the dark at 4 °C under agitation, the suspension was washed twice in the dark with incubation buffer to remove unbound GE. The washed pellet was carefully resuspended by gentle vortexing and then exposed to UV light (model UVM-57, UVP (Upland, CA)) for 15 min on ice at a distance of 5 cm from the membrane pellet. The resulting photolabeled membranes were then incubated for 15 min in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 100 mm DTT to reduce the disulfide bond linking the photolabeling reagent to the GE. After washing the sample again in the same DTT-containing buffer and then finally in the buffer lacking DTT, the samples were incubated for 15 min in 50 mm iodoacetamide to block reformation of disulfide bonds. The sample was then washed in the same buffer lacking iodoacetamide and divided into two aliquots; one was mixed with SDS sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE, and the other was frozen at −80 °C for subsequent trypsin digestion and characterization by mass spectrometry. Samples were allowed to stand at 50 °C for 15 min before electrophoretic separation in 10% polyacrylamide gels. After SDS-PAGE, samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to Bio-Rad protocols, and proteins were visualized with Ponceau S stain (24Stochaj W.R. Berkelman T. Laird N. Staining membrane-bound proteins with Ponceau S.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2006; 200610.1101/pdb.prot4543Google Scholar) and photographed. Specific visualization of those proteins that were biotinylated during the photocross-linking process was achieved by washing the membranes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and blocking nonspecific sites overnight at 4 °C with 5% powdered milk in the same buffer. Then, after 30 min of incubation with streptavidin-HRP (1:60,000), the membranes were washed for 60 min in TBS buffer and reacted with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate for 1 min. Finally, the membranes were exposed to a CL-Xposure film for 1 min, and the film was developed using standard procedures. Biotinylated membrane samples were centrifuged at 4 °C and, after discarding the supernatant, were resuspended at a final concentration of 1% RapiGest (Waters) containing 100 mm DTT. Solubilized samples were incubated for 10 min at 40 °C to promote maximal membrane dissolution and then diluted 10× with warm 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8. Samples were then sonicated for 1 h and digested overnight at 37 °C with endoproteinase Lys-C (0.1 μg per 90 μg of protein) to unfold the proteins and generate large peptide fragments. To create smaller peptides appropriate for flight in the mass spectrometer, the samples were again digested for 24 h at 37 °C with trypsin at a protease/protein ratio of 1:50. RapiGest detergent was then removed by incubation for 40 min at 37 °C in 5% acetic acid followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 23,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and neutralized to pH 7 with 1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, in preparation for affinity purification. Isolation of biotinylated peptides by avidin affinity chromatography was accomplished with monomeric avidin-derivatized beads (Promega) according to established protocols (25Simpson R.J. Stage 3. Selection of tagged proteins using an avidin column.in: Simpson R.J. Proteins and Proteomics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 529-531Google Scholar). Samples containing the eluted affinity-purified peptides were dried using a Labconco vacuum concentrator and stored frozen until mass spectrometry analysis. Eight microliters of sample were injected into an Agilent 1100 HPLC system linked to an in-house reverse phase C18 capillary column packed with 5-μm C18 Magic beads (Michrom; 75-μm inner diameter and 12-cm bed length). Peptides were eluted with a shallow linear gradient over 60 min of 0.1% formic acid in water to 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min. The electrospray ionization emitter tip was generated on the prepacked column with a laser puller (model P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co.). The Agilent 1100 HPLC system was coupled online with an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode, in which a full scan MS was followed by MS/MS scans of the 10 most abundant ions with +2 to +3 charge states. The mass exclusion time was 180 s. The MS/MS data were converted to an mzXML format using the open source Trans-Peptide Pipeline (TPP) software (version 2.9.4), and the resulting mzXML files were searched against the International Protein Index human database (Version 3.68 with 87,061 protein entries) using the SEQUEST algorithm on the Sorcerer IDA server (software version 2.5.6; SageN, Inc., San Jose, CA). Peptide mass tolerance was set at 3.0 atomic mass units, and MS/MS tolerance was set internally by the software, with values varying from 0 to 1 atomic mass unit. Search criteria allowed detection of methionine oxidation (15.9949 Da), cysteine alkylation (+57.0214 Da), and semitryptic digestion, where a maximum of 2 missed cleavages in any peptide was permitted. Minimum protein and peptide probabilities were set at 0.8 and 0.9, respectively (26Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. A statistical model for identifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar, 27Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Empirical statistical model to estimate the accuracy of peptide identifications made by MS/MS and database search.Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3897) Google Scholar). An expression vector for residues 330–391 of band 3 was generated using the ThioFusion Expression Kit from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cDNA for residues 330–391 of band 3 was amplified by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-caggcactgctcagtct-3′; reverse, 5′-gtagcggcgccggatatc-3′. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the pBAD/Thio-TOPO vector. After sequencing to assure proper insertion, the plasmid was transformed into TOP10 E. coli cells, and the band 3 peptide comprising residues 330–391 was expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein containing a His tag at the COOH terminus and thioredoxin at its NH2 terminus. The fusion protein was purified by nickel-NTA bead chromatography (Qiagen) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against CDB3. When desired, bovine enterokinase (Invitrogen) was used to remove the NH2-terminal thioredoxin. The peptide fragment described above was dialyzed into binding buffer (7.5 mm NaH2PO4, 90 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% sucrose, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.3) and mixed with increasing concentrations of GEs that had previously been dialyzed against the same buffer. Binding was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C with rotation, after which the samples and appropriate controls were allowed to interact for 30 min at 4 °C with nickel beads that had been equilibrated in the same buffer containing 1% BSA. Beads were pelleted and washed three times with binding buffer and again with the same buffer lacking BSA prior to dot blot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were spotted with the above samples/controls using a guided plastic template. When required, a set of known dilutions of pure GEs were also applied to obtain a calibration curve. Upon drying, membranes were allowed to incubate in TBS containing 5% milk to block nonspecific sites. Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 60 min, washed several times to remove unbound antibody, and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. Protein spots were analyzed and quantified using an Eastman Kodak Co. molecular imaging system. BRIC 170, nonspecific mouse IgG, or a fusion protein containing residues 330–391 of band 3 linked to thioredoxin (or buffer) were entrapped at 50% hematocrit in resealed ghosts according to published protocols (28Murphy S.C. Harrison T. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. Mohandas N. Haldar K. Erythrocyte G protein as a novel target for malarial chemotherapy.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e528Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The resealed erythrocytes were washed in PBS containing 5 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA until the supernatant was cleared of hemoglobin, and the washed resealed ghosts were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before fixation with freshly prepared 0.5% acrolein in PBS. The resealed ghosts were then processed for immunostaining as described previously (10Campanella M.E. Chu H. Low P.S. Assembly and regulation of a glycolytic enzyme complex on the human erythrocyte membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH, aldolase, LDH, and PK were each labeled with sulfo-SBED (a photoactivatable reagent that transfers biotin to adjacent proteins upon illumination with UV light) and incubated with freshly prepared erythrocyte ghosts either in the presence (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) or absence (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) of an excess of the unlabeled GE counterpart. After allowing time for the labeled GEs to exchange with the endogenous GEs (29McDaniel C.F. Kirtley M.E. Tanner M.J.

Chem. 1973; 248: 8457-8464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and washing to remove unbound GEs, biotin transfer was photoactivated, and membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Following transfer of separated proteins onto nitrocellulose, blots were analyzed for both total protein (Fig. 1A) and biotinylated protein (Fig. 1B). As seen in the Ponceau stain of Fig. 1A, all lanes showed transfer of the major erythrocyte membrane proteins to the nitrocellulose paper, with prominent transfer of the GEs that were added in excess to saturate all membrane sites. Moreover, after removal of the reversible Ponceau S dye and restaining of the same blots with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, analysis revealed multiple biotinylated proteins, suggesting association of labeled GEs with multiple proteins on the membrane. More specifically, reconstituted GAPDH transferred biotin not only to itself (Fig. 1B, lane 2, ∼36 kDa) but also to proteins that migrate with molecular masses near those of band 3 (101 kDa) and spectrin (∼240 kDa). Similarly, aldolase (lane 4, ∼40 kDa) and LDH (lane 6, ∼35 kDa) transferred biotin not only to themselves but also to polypeptides that migrate near protein 4.1 and/or 4.2 (∼78 kDa), band 3, and spectrin. Pyruvate kinase, in contrast, primarily transferred label to itself (lane 8, ∼57 kDa), band 3, and spectrin and/or ankyrin. In order to determine if the above label transfer events reflect specific interactions, parallel experiments were performed precisely as above except that a ∼10-fold excess of each unlabeled GE was included in the binding and photolabeling steps to compete for specific interactions. As seen in lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9, competition with excess GE not only prevented biotin transfer to each membrane protein but also significantly reduced biotin transfer to the labeling GE. These data suggest that the binding partners identified in the photolabeling reactions, with the exception of some autologous GE labeling, associate in a specific manner with each GE. Moreover, the inability to quantitatively block GE self-labeling was expected, because intramolecular biotin transfer always occurs with this methodology (31Hurst G.B. Lankford T.K. Kennel S.J. Mass spectrometric detection of affinity purified crosslinked peptides.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To further confirm the specificity of the sulfo-SBED label transfer reaction, we repeated the above studies except that sulfo-SBED-ovalbumin was also incubated with the leaky ghosts instead of a labeled GE (negative control). As shown in Fig. 2, sulfo-SBED-ovalbumin failed to transfer biotin to any membrane protein, although sulfo-SBED-labeled GEs transferred biotin to the usual membrane proteins in the same experiment. Together with the competition data described above, these results demonstrate that biotin transfer from sulfo-SBED-labeled GEs arises from physiological GE-protein interactions and not from transient nonspecific collisions. To confirm that the biotinylated protein of ∼100 kDa is indeed band 3, intact erythrocytes were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was treated with chymotrypsin prior to processing and analysis, and the other was left unmodified (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3, the biotinylated band at ∼100 kDa decreases to a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa (see arrows), as expected for band 3 (20Steck T.L. Ramos B. Strapazon E.

Interestingly, digestion of band 3 also reveals other biotinylated proteins that are occluded by the more intense staining of band 3 in undigested cells. Whether these minor biotinylated proteins correspond to adducin or a fragment of ankyrin, both of which are labeled by this methodology (Table 1 and supplemental Table 1), cannot be ascertained from the blots.TABLE 1Common erythrocyte membrane peptides labeled by all glycolytic enzymes derivatized with a photoactivatable cross-linking reagentTABLE 1Common erythrocyte membrane peptides labeled by all glycolytic enzymes derivatized with a photoactivatable cross-linking reagent Although the proteolysis results of Fig. 3 confirm the involvement of band 3 in GE binding, the complex banding patterns of the other biotinylated polypeptides prevent unequivocal identification of the remaining membrane binding partners of the GEs.

https://openalex.org/W2068854526,"Loss-of-function mutations in EIF2AK3, encoding the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase, PERK, are associated with dysfunction of the endocrine pancreas and diabetes. However, to date it has not been possible to uncouple the long term developmental effects of PERK deficiency from sensitization to physiological levels of ER unfolded protein stress upon interruption of PERK modulation of protein synthesis rates. Here, we report that a selective PERK inhibitor acutely deregulates protein synthesis in freshly isolated islets of Langerhans, across a range of glucose concentrations. Acute loss of the PERK-mediated strand of the unfolded protein response leads to rapid accumulation of misfolded pro-insulin in cultured beta cells and is associated with a kinetic defect in pro-insulin processing. These in vitro observations uncouple the latent role of PERK in beta cell development from the regulation of unfolded protein flux through the ER and attest to the importance of the latter in beta cell proteostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2166251582,"Wild accessions of crops and landraces are valuable genetic resources for plant breeding and for conserving alleles and gene combinations in planta. The primary genepool of cultivated common beans includes wild accessions of Phaseolus vulgaris. These are of the same species as the domesticates and therefore are easily crossable with cultivated accessions. Molecular marker assessment of wild beans and landraces is important for the proper utilization and conservation of these important genetic resources. The goal of this research was to evaluate a collection of wild beans with fluorescent microsatellite or simple sequence repeat markers and to determine the population structure in combination with cultivated beans of all known races. Marker diversity in terms of average number of alleles per marker was high (13) for the combination of 36 markers and 104 wild genotypes that was similar to the average of 14 alleles per marker found for the 606 cultivated genotypes. Diversity in wild beans appears to be somewhat higher than in cultivated beans on a per genotype basis. Five populations or genepools were identified in structure analysis of the wild beans corresponding to segments of the geographical range, including Mesoamerican (Mexican), Guatemalan, Colombian, Ecuadorian-northern Peruvian and Andean (Argentina, Bolivia and Southern Peru). The combined analysis of wild and cultivated accessions showed that the first and last of these genepools were related to the cultivated genepools of the same names and the penultimate was found to be distinct but not ancestral to the others. The Guatemalan genepool was very novel and perhaps related to cultivars of race Guatemala, while the Colombian population was also distinct. Results suggest geographic isolation, founder effects or natural selection could have created the different semi-discrete populations of wild beans and that multiple domestications and introgression were involved in creating the diversity of cultivated beans."
https://openalex.org/W2143543279,"The nucleoside diphosphate kinase Nm23-H4/NDPK-D forms symmetrical hexameric complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space with phosphotransfer activity using mitochondrial ATP to regenerate nucleoside triphosphates. We demonstrate the complex formation between Nm23-H4 and mitochondrial GTPase OPA1 in rat liver, suggesting its involvement in local and direct GTP delivery. Similar to OPA1, Nm23-H4 is further known to strongly bind in vitro to anionic phospholipids, mainly cardiolipin, and in vivo to the inner mitochondrial membrane. We show here that such protein-lipid complexes inhibit nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity but are necessary for another function of Nm23-H4, selective intermembrane lipid transfer. Mitochondrial lipid distribution was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using HeLa cells expressing either wild-type Nm23-H4 or a membrane binding-deficient mutant at a site predicted based on molecular modeling to be crucial for cardiolipin binding and transfer mechanism. We found that wild type, but not the mutant enzyme, selectively increased the content of cardiolipin in the outer mitochondrial membrane, but the distribution of other more abundant phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) remained unchanged. HeLa cells expressing the wild-type enzyme showed increased accumulation of Bax in mitochondria and were sensitized to rotenone-induced apoptosis as revealed by stimulated release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, elevated caspase 3/7 activity, and increased annexin V binding. Based on these data and molecular modeling, we propose that Nm23-H4 acts as a lipid-dependent mitochondrial switch with dual function in phosphotransfer serving local GTP supply and cardiolipin transfer for apoptotic signaling and putative other functions."
https://openalex.org/W2017063630,"Despite the recent availability of gene-specific nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like nucleases (TALENs), there is still a need for new tools to modify the genome of different species in an efficient, rapid, and less costly manner. One aim of this study was to apply, for the first time, engineered meganucleases to mutate an endogenous gene in animal zygotes. The second aim was to target the mouse and rat recombination activating gene 1 (Rag1) to describe, for the first time, Rag1 knockout immunodeficient rats. We microinjected a plasmid encoding a meganuclease for Rag1 into the pronucleus of mouse and rat zygotes. Mutant animals were detected by PCR sequencing of the targeted sequence. A homozygous RAG1-deficient rat line was generated and immunophenotyped. Meganucleases were efficient, because 3.4 and 0.6% of mouse and rat microinjected zygotes, respectively, generated mutated animals. RAG1-deficient rats showed significantly decreased proportions and numbers of immature and mature T and B lymphocytes and normal NK cells vs. littermate wild-type controls. In summary, we describe the use of engineered meganucleases to inactivate an endogenous gene with efficiencies comparable to those of ZFNs and TALENs. Moreover, we generated an immunodeficient rat line useful for studies in which there is a need for biological parameters to be analyzed in the absence of immune responses.—Ménoret, S., Fontanière, S., Jantz, D., Tesson, L., Thinard, R., Rémy, S., Usal, C., Ouisse, L.-H., Fraichard, A., Anegon, A.

https://openalex.org/W2044459945,"Changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration, resulting from activation of intracellular Ca(2+) channels within the endoplasmic reticulum, regulate several aspects of cellular growth and differentiation. Ca(2+) homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein (CHERP) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that has been proposed as a regulator of both major families of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) channels, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), with resulting effects on mitotic cycling. However, the manner by which CHERP regulates intracellular Ca(2+) channels to impact cellular growth is unknown. Here, we challenge previous findings that CHERP acts as a direct cytoplasmic regulator of IP(3)Rs and RyRs and propose that CHERP acts in the nucleus to impact cellular proliferation by regulating the function of the U2 snRNA spliceosomal complex. The previously reported effects of CHERP on cellular growth therefore are likely indirect effects of altered spliceosomal function, consistent with prior data showing that loss of function of U2 snRNP components can interfere with cell growth and induce cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2008992830,"MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) induction is a virtually constant feature of the hypoxic response in both normal and transformed cells, regulating several key aspects of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. We found that miR-210 was induced in normoxic myoblasts upon myogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. miR-210 transcription was activated in an hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (Hif1a)-dependent manner, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that Hif1a bound to the miR-210 promoter only in differentiated myotubes. Accordingly, luciferase reporter assays demonstrated the functional relevance of the Hif1a binding site for miR-210 promoter activation in differentiating myoblasts. To investigate the functional relevance of increased miR-210 levels in differentiated myofibers, we blocked miR-210 with complementary locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides (anti-miR-210). We found that C2C12 myoblast cell line differentiation was largely unaffected by anti-miR-210. Likewise, miR-210 inhibition did not affect skeletal muscle regeneration following cardiotoxin damage. However, we found that miR-210 blockade greatly increased myotube sensitivity to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, miR-210 is induced in normoxic myofibers, playing a cytoprotective role."

Bioinformatic analysis of the Arabidopsis genome suggested the existence of a putative NCX gene, Arabidopsis NCX-like (AtNCL), encoding a protein with an NCX-like structure and different from Ca2+/H+ exchangers and Na+/H+ exchangers previously identified in plant. AtNCL was identified to localize in the Arabidopsis cell membrane fraction, have the ability of binding Ca2+, and possess NCX-like activity in a heterologous expression system of cultured mammalian CHO-K1 cells. AtNCL is broadly expressed in Arabidopsis, and abiotic stresses stimulated its transcript expression. Loss-of-function atncl mutants were less sensitive to salt stress than wild-type or AtNCL transgenic overexpression lines. In addition, the total calcium content in whole atncl mutant seedlings was higher than that in wild type by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The level of free Ca2+ in the cytosol and Ca2+ flux at the root tips of atncl mutant plants, as detected using transgenic aequorin and a scanning ion-selective electrode, required a longer recovery time following NaCl stress compared with that in wild type. All of these data suggest that AtNCL encodes a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-like protein that participates in the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in Arabidopsis.

The mechanisms of production and elimination of [Ca2+]cyt have become a key topic in Ca2+ signaling and related functions. Various environmental stresses can stimulate the opening of Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma or inner membrane, leading to an influx of Ca2+ along its electrochemical gradient (12.Sanders D.

Here one NCX-like gene in Arabidopsis (AtNCL) encoded a protein similar to animal NCXs in structure, had Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, and was involved in Ca2+ homeostasis under salt stress in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis thaliana stocks described in this work were of the Columbia (Col) ecotype. atncl-1 and atncl-2 correspond to Syngenta Arabidopsis Insertion Library (SAIL)_791_D12 and SAIL_770_A10, respectively. For salt stress, 7-day-old seedlings were transferred to plates containing 1/2 MS medium or 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. After 7 days, the seedlings were photographed, and the survival rate was determined based on the number of plants with two to four true leaves that had become completely white in color; the chlorophyll content was measured as reported previously (43.Arnon D.I. Copper enzymes in isolated chloroplasts: polyphenoloxidase in Beta vulgaris.Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freezing tolerance was assayed as described (44.Xin Z.

After a 5-day recovery, survival rate and chlorophyll contents were measured. Heat stress was performed as described previously (45.Zheng S.Z. Liu Y.L. Li B. Shang Z.L. Zhou R.G. Sun D.Y. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C9 is involved in the thermotolerance of Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2012; 69: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 7-day-old seedlings were exposed to 45 °C for 75 min and recovered at 22 °C for 7days. A CAX function test was carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K667 (MATa cnb1::LEU1 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ) as described (36.Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R.

The dishes were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days before taking pictures. qRT-PCR was employed to measure the transcript levels. The RNA samples were pretreated extensively with an RNase-free DNase to remove any contaminating genomic DNA prior to use. The PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. qRT-PCRs were performed in 96-well blocks with an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system using the SYBR Green I mix in a volume of 20 μl. The specificity of the PCRs was determined by melt curve analysis of the amplified products using the standard methods installed in the system. The comparative ΔΔCT method was employed to evaluate relative quantities of each product amplified from the samples. All qRT-PCRs were performed in biological triplicates using RNA samples extracted from three independent plant materials grown under identical growth conditions. Histochemical staining and fluorometric assays were performed according to the method reported by Jefferson (66.Jefferson R. Assaying chimeric genes in plants: the GUS gene fusion system.Plant Mol.

His-tagged recombinant AtNCL was separated using Ni-affinity column (Novagen).The binding of 45Ca2+ to CaBD of AtNCL was assayed as described (47.Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S.

Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The purified protein was resolved on a 12 or 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel then transferred to PVDF membrane and incubated for 30 min with 100 mCi/ml 45CaC12. The membrane was then washed and exposed to a storage PhosphorImage screen for 12 h. Images were collected using a Typhoon 9210 imager (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length AtNCL CDS with an extra Kozak sequence (GCCACC) before the initiation codon was cloned into pDsRed1-N1 using NdeI and AgeI. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the resulting construct by electroporation as described (48.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. The Condensed Protocols from Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The fluorescence intensity was calculated at each time point before and after the addition of Ca2+ containing loading buffer (Fbasal and F, respectively). The data for each cell were plotted as follows: ΔF/F = (F − Fbasal)/Fbasal. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, Inc.). For yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and propidium iodide (PI) imaging, an argon ion laser at 514 nm was used for excitation; emission was detected using a BP500–550 nm filter for YFP and LP615 nm for PI. Fluo-3 quantitative analysis was done as described (50.Srikanth S. Banerjee S. Hasan G.

Excitation of Fluo-3 was performed using an argon ion laser at 488 nm. Emitted light was detected through a BP505-530-nm filter from a 545-nm dichroic mirror. DsRed fluorescence was excited using a green helium-neon laser at 543 nm and was detected through a 545-nm dichroic mirror and LP560-nm filter. The images were processed using LSM 4.2 software (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, Inc.). Protein extracts were prepared from the wild-type or transgenic seedlings and separated into soluble and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation as described previously (52.Tang W. Deng Z.

The fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP serum as the primary antibody. The pretreated or untreated seedlings were washed with deionized water, dried using a blast dryer, and weighed. The seedlings were then subjected to digestion by the aqueous method using the chloric acid/perchloric acid (4:1, v/v) method. Next, the digested samples were diluted with deionized water and analyzed by AAS (AA240FS+240Z, Varian). atncl was crossed with a p35S::Aequorin transgenic line. The [Ca2+]cyt level in the homozygotes was then determined as described (53.Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J.

The net fluxes of Ca2+ and H+ in the root tips of 4-day-old seedlings grown on MS plates were measured noninvasively by SIET (54.Vincent P. Chua M. Nogue F. Fairbrother A. Mekeel H. Xu Y. Allen N.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) using the BIO-001A SIET system (Xuyue (Beijing) Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The SIET system measures static ionic/molecular concentrations and concentration gradients using ion-selective microelectrodes (55.Kühtreiber W.M. Jaffe L.F. Detection of extracellular calcium gradients with a calcium-specific vibrating electrode.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The concentration gradient was measured by moving the electrode repeatedly between two positions along a predefined excursion (5–30 μm) at a fixed frequency in the range of 0.3–0.5 Hz. AtNCL (At1g53210) was predicted as a sodium/calcium exchanger family protein by the TAIR database. AtNCL comprises seven exons and six introns, encoding a putative protein with 585 amino acids. The N-terminal-most 22 amino acids in AtNCL comprise a putative signaling peptide (analyzed by SignalP). The protein had 10 putative transmembrane domains, with a hydrophilic loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains containing two predicted EF-hand domains (analyzed by SMART). The deduced structure of AtNCL is similar to HsNCX1 from Homo sapiens (supplemental Fig. S1). AtNCL was considered a relative of CAXs (56.Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. Identification of three distinct phylogenetic groups of CAX cation/proton antiporters.J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but it could not function as CAX in yeast, even if they have similar localization in yeast cells (Fig. 1). CAXs always have a conserved N-terminal autoinhibitory sequence (57.Pittman J.K. Sreevidya C.S. Shigaki T. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hirschi K.D. Distinct N-terminal regulatory domains of Ca2+/H+ antiporters.Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 58.Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D.

Regulation of CAX1, an Arabidopsis Ca2+/H+ antiporter: identification of an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain.Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); however, N-terminal deleted sAtNCL also cannot recover the yeast K667 phenotype (Fig. 1). On the other hand, AtNCL cannot work as a NHX in yeast (Fig. 1C), so we wanted to know whether it was a NCX-like protein. Because animal NCXs have intracellular loop with Ca2+ binding activity, we have tested the Ca2+ binding ability of AtNCL. Ca2+-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift and 45Ca2+ binding assays were used to examine the predicted the Ca2+ binding ability of the putative EF-hand domain in AtNCL (amino acids 262–430; CaBD). The vector pET-30(a)-CaBD was constructed as shown in supplemental Table S1, and recombinant CaBD tagged with six His residues at its N terminus was expressed in E. coli. Before loading the sample, EGTA or divalent ions were added to the sample. By SDS-PAGE, CaBD ran faster in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ than it did in the presence of EGTA or the bivalent ions Mg2+ and Mn2+ (Fig. 2A). According to our 45Ca2+ binding assay results, recombinant CaBD bound Ca2+ as did our positive control, recombinant Arabidopsis CaM isoform 2 (AtCaM2), a known Ca2+-binding protein, whereas our negative control, bovine serum albumin (BSA), did not (Fig. 2B). To assess whether AtNCL has NCX-like activity, a CHO-K1 cell-based heterologous expression system was used. CHO-K1 cells transfected with pAtNCL-DsRed were tested against CHO-K1 cells transfected with pDsRed1-N1 as a control. The [Ca2+]cyt was indicated by Fluo-3 fluorescence. In Na+-free buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+, the signal from the Na+-loaded AtNCL-expressing cells rose to saturation within 5 min whereas the vector control showed little signal (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the [Ca2+]cyt did not increase significantly if the cells were not loaded with Na+ (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the reverse NCX activity in the AtNCL-transfected cells (Fig. 3) was much higher than in the controls (Fig. 3). This activity was inhibited by 150 mm extracellular Na+ (the concentration was set approximately equal to the inner Na+ concentration to offset the Na+ gradient) or by 5 mm Ni2+, a NCX inhibitor used in animal cell (60.Kimura J. Miyamae S. Noma A. Identification of sodium-calcium exchange current in single ventricular cells of guinea pig.J. Physiol. 1987; 384: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). To confirm the ion selectivity for the exchange function of AtNCL, we performed another set of Ca2+ flux assays using cells loaded with a buffer solution containing Na+, K+, or Li+. The result demonstrated that Na+ and K+ both can drive the Ca2+ flux and Na+ is more efficient than K+. However, Li+ had no effect (Fig. 3C). Proton concentration was increased outside the cell by changing the bath buffer pH from 7.4 to 6.4, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was not significantly affected (Fig. 3D). To reveal whether the activity of AtNCL is dependent on K+-like Na+/Ca2+-K+ exchanger, we tested the bath buffer with K+ or without K+, respectively. The data indicated that outside K+ was not necessary for AtNCL activity (Fig. 3E). Mg2+ was reported not affect NCX activity (61.Kimura J. Effects of external Mg2+ on the Na-Ca exchange current in guinea pig cardiac myocytes.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the Mg2+ effect on AtNCL, by add 10 mm Mg2+ to bath buffer. The result suggested that Mg2+ can suppress the AtNCL activity (Fig. 3F). Overall, AtNCL has NCX-like Ca2+ uptake activity in CHO-K1 cells. AtNCL was reported to be localized to the vacuole by prediction and proteomics strategy (62.Mitra S.K. Gantt J.A. Ruby J.F.

Biophysical and mutagenic analyses reveal a CXCL12/heparin interaction surface that lies perpendicular to the dimer interface, does not involve the chemokine N terminus, and partially overlaps with the CXCR4-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2010322339,"Biliary pancreatitis is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis in both children and adults. A proposed mechanism is the reflux of bile into the pancreatic duct. Bile acid exposure causes pancreatic acinar cell injury through a sustained rise in cytosolic Ca(2+). Thus, it would be clinically relevant to know the targets of this aberrant Ca(2+) signal. We hypothesized that the Ca(2+)-activated phosphatase calcineurin is such a Ca(2+) target. To examine calcineurin activation, we infected primary acinar cells from mice with an adenovirus expressing the promoter for a downstream calcineurin effector, nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). The bile acid taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate (TLCS) was primarily used to examine bile acid responses. TLCS caused calcineurin activation only at concentrations that cause acinar cell injury. The activation of calcineurin by TLCS was abolished by chelating intracellular Ca(2+). Pretreatment with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) or the three specific calcineurin inhibitors FK506, cyclosporine A, or calcineurin inhibitory peptide prevented bile acid-induced acinar cell injury as measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage and propidium iodide uptake. The calcineurin inhibitors reduced the intra-acinar activation of chymotrypsinogen within 30 min of TLCS administration, and they also prevented NF-κB activation. In vivo, mice that received FK506 or were deficient in the calcineurin isoform Aβ (CnAβ) subunit had reduced pancreatitis severity after infusion of TLCS or taurocholic acid into the pancreatic duct. In summary, we demonstrate that acinar cell calcineurin is activated in response to Ca(2+) generated by bile acid exposure, bile acid-induced pancreatic injury is dependent on calcineurin activation, and calcineurin inhibitors may provide an adjunctive therapy for biliary pancreatitis."

Core molecular machinery and signaling regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Loss of autophagy in murine tissues is accompanied by accumulation of protein aggregates and disordered organelles, leading to life-threatening diseases (8Mizushima N. Levine B. Autophagy in mammalian development and differentiation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Autophagy plays a key role in protecting the cytosol from bacterial infection. The mechanisms of bacterial recognition by this pathway are starting to be elucidated. Some cellular cargos are marked for autophagy by acquiring adaptor proteins such as Calcoco2 (also known as NDP52) and neighbor of BRCA1 gene product (NBR1) (9Mostowy S. Sancho-Shimizu V.

Physiological significance of selective degradation of p62 by autophagy.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). p62 has multiple protein-protein interaction domains, including the ubiquitin-associated domain for ubiquitinated cargo binding and the LC3 interaction region for binding LC3 (10Zheng Y.T.

Accordingly, impaired autophagy is accompanied by accumulation of p62 followed by formation of aggregates containing p62 and ubiquitinated proteins. This accumulation occurs because of the nature of both self-oligomerization and ubiquitin binding of p62 (18Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J.

Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cepacia) is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that infects CF patients and leads to severe lung inflammation and lung tissue destruction.

Unfortunately, B. cepacia is resistant to most known antibiotics and, thus, is nearly impossible to treat. B. cepacia adopts an extracellular or intracellular lifestyle (23Loutet S.A.

We have demonstrated previously that in WT macrophages, the majority of B. cepacia-containing vacuoles slowly acquire the specific autophagy marker LC3 within 2 h of infection. Subsequently, these vacuoles fuse with the lysosomes, and the bacterium is degraded. In ΔF508 macrophages, B. cepacia-containing vacuoles do not acquire autophagosome markers and do not fuse with the lysosomes. Here, we demonstrate that in WT macrophages, p62 is required for targeting B. cepacia to the autophagosome. Upon p62 down-regulation, bacterial growth increases, whereas the overexpression of p62 results in a significant decrease in B. cepacia replication. On the contrary, down-regulation of p62 in ΔF508 macrophages is associated with decreased bacterial growth, and p62 overexpression results in increased B. cepacia replication. p62 down-regulation in ΔF508 macrophages releases the trapped BECN1 from CFTR aggregates, allowing its recruitment to the B. cepacia vacuole. BECN1 acquired by the B. cepacia-containing vacuole subsequently attracts LC3, thereby mediating the fusion of the maturing autophagosome containing B. cepacia with the lysosome via the autophagic machinery. These data provide mechanistic insight on how B. cepacia persists in ΔF508 macrophages. This report also suggests that p62 may be an attractive drug target to improve B. cepacia clearance by autophagic machinery. Animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ohio State University College of Medicine. WT C57BL/6 were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. ΔF508 mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Case Western University and housed in the Ohio State University vivarium. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from the femurs of 6- to 12-week-old mice and were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen, catalog no. 12440) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, catalog no. 16000), 20% L cell-conditioned medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, catalog no. 15140) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Macrophages were infected with B. cepacia K56-expressing m-RFP or the corresponding gentamicin-sensitive strain MHK1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. B. cenocepacia strain K56-2 is a clinical isolate from a CF patient. The corresponding gentamicin-sensitive strain MHK1 was described previously (29Hamad M.A. Skeldon A.M. Valvano M.A. Construction of aminoglycoside-sensitive Burkholderia cenocepacia strains for use in studies of intracellular bacteria with the gentamicin protection assay.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3170-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All bacterial strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C overnight with high-amplitude shaking. To kill extracellular bacteria, Iscove's media (Invitrogen, catalog no. 12440) plus FBS (Invitrogen, catalog no. 16000) containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen, catalog no. 3564) were added for 0.5 h, as described previously (29Hamad M.A. Skeldon A.M.

To enumerate intracellular bacteria, infected macrophages were lysed with ice-cold PBS (Invitrogen, catalog no. 14190) at designated times. Recovered bacteria were quantified by plating serial dilutions on Luria-Bertani agar plates and counting colonies using the Acolyte Colony Counter, 5710/SYN. Macrophages were stimulated with B. cepacia, and the culture supernatant was removed. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer solution supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, catalog no. 10-519-978-001). The protein concentration was adjusted to 30 μg/ml. Proteins were separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 1p62-0117). Membranes were immunoblotted for p62 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. P0067), LC3 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. L8918), Calreticulin (Stressgen, catalog no.

Protein bands were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences, ECL Western blotting detection reagents; GE Healthcare, catalog no. RPN2106). siRNA treatment was performed using siRNA against p62 (Dharmacon, catalog no. 18412) ACAGAUGCCAGAAUCGGAA, CUGCUCAGGAGGAGACGAU, GAACAGAUGGAGUCGGGAA, and CCAUGGGUUUCUCGGAUGA; siRNA against NDP52 (Dharmacon, catalog no. 76815) CAACACAGAGGGUCAAUAA, CAGAAGAGGACAUCCGGAU, CCAAGGAUGUGGAGCGCUA, and GAGUUGAGGUGUCCGUGUA; siRNA against NBR1 (Dharmacon, catalog no. 17966) GAAAUGGGAUUCUGCGACA, AGUCCGUGGAAGCGAGUAA, CAAGCAAAGCUGACGAUUU, and ACAGGAGGCAUUCGGGUUA; and siRNA against Atg7 (Dharmacon, catalog no. 49953) CAUCAUCUUUGAAGUGAAA, GCUAGAGACGUGACACAUA, AGCGAAAGCUGGUCAUCAA, and GGUCGUGUCUGUCAAGUGC. siRNA was nucleofected into primary macrophages 48 h before infection using a Lonza nucleofection kit and Amaxa equipment, as described previously (30Gavrilin M.A. Bouakl I.J.

The plasmid was nucleofected 24 h before the infection. Successful p62 overexpression was confirmed by immunoblotting. Total RNA was isolated from cells lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen, catalog no. 15596-026) and then converted to cDNA.

Briefly, Ct values of the p62 gene were subtracted from the average Ct of two housekeeping genes (GADPH and CAP1), and the resulting ΔCt was used in the following equation: RCN = (2−ΔCt) 100. The relative copy number of a gene is represented as the number of copies relative to the 100 copies of average housekeeping genes (30Gavrilin M.A. Bouakl I.J. Knatz N.L. Duncan M.D. Hall M.W.

Samples were analyzed with an Olympus Fluoview FV10i confocal microscope at the Ohio State University, Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity. All experiments were performed at least three times independently and yielded similar results. Comparisons of groups for statistical difference were conducted using Student's two-tailed t test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and Ohio State University. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee has approved our protocol number 2007A0070. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. We demonstrated previously that B. cepacia is cleared by the autophagy machinery in WT macrophages but not in their ΔF508 counterparts. To determine why the B. cepacia vacuole is not efficiently recognized by the autophagy machinery in ΔF508 macrophages, we followed the trafficking within WT and ΔF508 macrophages. Recent studies showed that p62 is required for targeting S. typhimurium, Shigella, and Listeria to the autophagic pathway (9Mostowy S. Sancho-Shimizu V. Hamon M.A. Simeone R. Brosch R. Johansen T. Cossart P. p62 and NDP52 proteins target intracytosolic ShigellaListeria to different autophagy pathways.J. Biol.

The adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 targets invading bacteria to the autophagy pathway.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 5909-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the colocalization of B. cepacia with p62 in WT and ΔF508 macrophages. The time course for infection was 0.5, 1.5, 2, and 4 h. In WT macrophages, a significant percentage of B. cepacia colocalized with p62 at 1.5 h post-infection. Colocalization then declined at later time points (Fig. 1, A and B). However, B. cepacia vacuoles in ΔF508 macrophages did not colocalize with p62 at any time point throughout infection (Fig. 1, A and B). Together, these data show that p62 labels the B. cepacia vacuole in WT but not in ΔF508 macrophages. Autophagy recognizes cargo for uptake and degradation when it becomes ubiquitinated and bound to an autophagy adaptor molecule (10Zheng Y.T. Shahnazari S. Brech A. Lamark T. Johansen T. Brumell J.H. The adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 targets invading bacteria to the autophagy pathway.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 5909-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The lack of p62 acquisition by the B. cepacia vacuole in ΔF508 macrophages could be due to defective ubiquitination of the B. cepacia-containing vacuole or because of lack of p62 expression in ΔF508 macrophages. To differentiate between these possibilities, we first infected WT and ΔF508 macrophages with B. cepacia-expressing m-RFP for 0.5 h or 2 h and examined the colocalization of B. cepacia with ubiquitin. There was no significant difference in the colocalization of B. cepacia with ubiquitin between WT and ΔF508 macrophages (Fig. 2, A and B). These data demonstrate that equivalent numbers of B. cepacia vacuoles acquired ubiquitin in WT and ΔF508 macrophages. Therefore, the lack of colocalization of B. cepacia with autophagosomes in ΔF508 macrophages is not due to the absence of ubiquitin around the B. cepacia vacuole. Next, to determine whether the failure of the autophagy machinery to target the B. cepacia vacuole is due to the lack of p62 expression in ΔF508 macrophages, we examined the level of p62 within WT and ΔF508 macrophages. Immunoblot analysis using an antibody against p62 revealed that murine macrophages harboring the ΔF508 mutation exhibited a higher level of p62 compared with WT macrophages (Fig. 3A). Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) was performed to determine whether the increase in p62 protein level in ΔF508 macrophages, compared with WT macrophages, is due to regulation of gene expression or accumulation of the p62 protein. There was no significant difference in the p62 mRNA level in both types of macrophages (Fig. 3B). Together, these data show that the increase in p62 level in ΔF508 macrophages is due to accumulation of the protein inside the cell, suggesting defective autophagy activity. p62 is well expressed in ΔF508 macrophages. However, B. cepacia infection down-regulates autophagy in both WT and ΔF508 macrophages. Thus, it is possible that B. cepacia infection is accompanied by depletion of p62 from ΔF508 macrophages upon infection. To examine this possibility, we examined the effect of B. cepacia on p62 expression upon infection in WT and ΔF508 macrophages by q-PCR and immunoblot analysis. At 4 h post infection, q-PCR analysis demonstrated increased expression of the p62 gene level in both WT and ΔF508 macrophages compared with non-infected macrophages (Fig. 3C). Similarly, immunoblotting showed a higher p62 level in both types of macrophages (Fig. 3D). Together, these data show that B. cepacia infection increases the expression level of p62 in WT and ΔF508 macrophages. To determine the role of p62 in B. cepacia replication in WT and ΔF508 macrophages, we examined B. cepacia survival in the presence of ectopically expressed p6"

We hypothesized that absence of oxidative stress markers and cell death in PDSS2 mutant fibroblasts were due to the extreme severity of CoQ10 deficiency. Here, we have investigated in vivo effects of Pdss2 deficiency in affected and unaffected organs of CBA/Pdss2kd/kd mice at presymptomatic, phenotypic-onset, and end-stages of the disease. Although Pdss2 mutant mice manifest widespread CoQ9 deficiency and mitochondrial respiratory chain abnormalities, only affected organs show increased ROS production, oxidative stress, mitochondrial DNA depletion, and reduced citrate synthase activity, an index of mitochondrial mass. Our data indicate that kidney-specific loss of mitochondria triggered by oxidative stress may be the cause of renal failure in Pdss2kd/kd mice.—Quinzii, C.

https://openalex.org/W2043999459,"Highly specific antibodies to phosphoepitopes are valuable tools to study phosphorylation in disease states, but their discovery is largely empirical, and the molecular mechanisms mediating phosphospecific binding are poorly understood. Here, we report the generation and characterization of extremely specific recombinant chicken antibodies to three phosphoepitopes on the Alzheimer disease-associated protein tau. Each antibody shows full specificity for a single phosphopeptide. The chimeric IgG pT231/pS235_1 exhibits a K(D) of 0.35 nm in 1:1 binding to its cognate phosphopeptide. This IgG is murine ortholog-cross-reactive, specifically recognizing the pathological form of tau in brain samples from Alzheimer patients and a mouse model of tauopathy. To better understand the underlying binding mechanisms allowing such remarkable specificity, we determined the structure of pT231/pS235_1 Fab in complex with its cognate phosphopeptide at 1.9 Å resolution. The Fab fragment exhibits novel complementarity determining region (CDR) structures with a ""bowl-like"" conformation in CDR-H2 that tightly and specifically interacts with the phospho-Thr-231 phosphate group, as well as a long, disulfide-constrained CDR-H3 that mediates peptide recognition. This binding mechanism differs distinctly from either peptide- or hapten-specific antibodies described to date. Surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that pT231/pS235_1 binds a truly compound epitope, as neither phosphorylated Ser-235 nor free peptide shows any measurable binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2055089337,"Representative tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in the regulation of proper DNA damage response. In this study, we have found for the first time that Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) contributes to p53-dependent DNA damage response. Upon adriamycin (ADR) exposure, p53 as well as RUNX1 were strongly induced in p53-proficient HCT116 and U2OS cells, which were closely associated with significant transactivation of p53 target genes, such as p21(WAF)(1), BAX, NOXA, and PUMA. RUNX1 was exclusively expressed in the cell nucleus and formed a complex with p53 in response to ADR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that p53 together with RUNX1 are efficiently recruited onto p53 target gene promoters following ADR exposure, indicating that RUNX1 is involved in p53-mediated transcriptional regulation. Indeed, forced expression of RUNX1 stimulated the transcriptional activity of p53 in response to ADR. Consistent with these observations, knockdown of RUNX1 attenuated ADR-mediated induction of p53 target genes and suppressed ADR-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, RUNX1 was associated with p300 histone acetyltransferase, and ADR-dependent acetylation of p53 at Lys-373/382 was markedly inhibited in RUNX1 knockdown cells. In addition, knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of p53-p300 complex following ADR exposure. Taken together, our present results strongly suggest that RUNX1 is required for the stimulation of p53 in response to DNA damage and also provide novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms behind p53-dependent DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2033296706,"IL-5 stimulates production of T15/EO6 IgM antibodies that can block the uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein by macrophages, whereas a deficiency in macrophage IL-5 expression accelerates development of atherosclerosis. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that can induce macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux, thereby inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unknown whether additional mechanisms, such as the regulation of macrophage IL-5 expression, are related to the anti-atherogenic properties of LXR. We initially defined IL-5 expression in macrophages where the LXR ligand (T0901317) induced macrophage IL-5 protein expression and secretion. The overexpression of LXR increased, whereas its knockdown inhibited IL-5 expression. Furthermore, we found that LXR activation increased IL-5 transcripts, promoter activity, formation of an LXR·LXR-responsive element complex, and IL-5 protein stability. In vivo, we found that T0901317 increased IL-5 and total IgM levels in plasma and IL-5 expression in multiple tissues in wild type mice. In LDL receptor knock-out (LDLR(-/-)) mice, T0901317 increased IL-5 expression in the aortic root area. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that macrophage IL-5 is a target gene for LXR activation, and the induction of macrophage IL-5 expression can be related to LXR-inhibited atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081299557,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D that generates the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), playing a key role in diverse physiological and pathological processes. ATX exists in distinct splice variants, but isoform-specific functions remain elusive. Here we characterize the ATXα isoform, which differs from the canonical form (ATXβ) in having a 52-residue polybasic insertion of unknown function in the catalytic domain. We find that the ATXα insertion is susceptible to cleavage by extracellular furin-like endoproteases, but cleaved ATXα remains structurally and functionally intact due to strong interactions within the catalytic domain. Through ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assays, we show that ATXα binds specifically to heparin with high affinity (Kd ∼10−8 m), whereas ATXβ does not; furthermore, heparin moderately enhanced the lysophospholipase D activity of ATXα. We further show that ATXα, but not ATXβ, binds abundantly to SKOV3 carcinoma cells. ATXα binding was abolished after treating the cells with heparinase III, but not after chondroitinase treatment. Thus, the ATXα insertion constitutes a cleavable heparin-binding domain that mediates interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, thereby targeting LPA production to the plasma membrane.

Conceivably, the ATXα insertion could confer different catalytic activity, cellular localization, processing, or binding partner preference.

In the present study, we explore the unique properties of ATXα compared with those of ATXβ, guided by the polybasic nature of the ATXα insertion and by the crystal structure of ATXβ. We show that the ATXα insertion constitutes a heparin-binding domain that mediates specific interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. As such, the insertion functions to direct ATXα to the plasma membrane thereby ensuring localized LPA production and signaling. We also show that the insertion is susceptible to processing by (an) extracellular furin-like proprotein convertase(s), which might serve to fine tune the binding of ATXα to cell surface HS proteoglycans. HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in McCoy's 5A medium containing GlutaMax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. The furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-RVKR-CMK) was obtained from Biomol International, recombinant furin from New England Biolabs, LPC(18:1) and LPA(18:1) from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa; sodium salt) from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog no.

For ATX overexpression studies, human ATXβ was ligated in the pcDNA3 vector with a 3′ Myc tag, as described previously (28van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Christodoulou E. Goding J.W. Takakusa H.

Human ATXα, ligated in pcDNA3 containing a 3′ Myc/His tag, was a generous gift from Dr. Andree Blaukat (Merck-Serono, Darmstadt, Germany). Mutant ATXα(R340A) was generated using the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis kit, with the following primers: p686-forward, GGCTAAGAGACCTAAGGCGAAAGTTGCCCC and p687-reverse, GGGGCAACTTTCGCCTTAGGTCTCTTAGCC. For production of recombinant protein, ATXα and ATXβ were ligated in pcDNA5-FRT (Invitrogen) with a C-terminal Myc tag and a His6 tag. HEK293 cells stably expressing ATXα or ATXβ were generated using the FLPin system (Invitrogen). Recombinant His-tagged ATX was purified from conditioned HEK293 medium using POROS-20 MC columns preloaded with Cu2+, as described previously (29Hausmann J. Christodoulou E. Kasiem M.

Mammalian cell expression, purification, crystallization and microcrystal data collection of autotaxin/ENPP2, a secreted mammalian glycoprotein.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 8–10 column volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). ATX protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole, and further purified using a Superose size exclusion column. Cells were grown to confluence, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit and column DNase treatment (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primers (Promega), 500 nm dNTPs (Roche Applied Science), 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 10 mm DTT (Invitrogen), and 200 units of Superscript II RT. Quantitative ATX expression was measured using the TaqMan gene expression probe Hs00196470_m1 in an ABI 7500 Fast Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Cycling parameters were 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. The relative product levels were quantified using the ddCt method and were normalized to GAPDH expression. Expression of the ATXα and ATX β isoforms was measured by RT-PCR using primers (forward 5′-ATTACAGCCACCAAGCAAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCCTCAGAGGATTTGTCAT-3′) located around the ATXα-specific insertion, resulting in a 209-bp fragment for ATXα and a 366-bp fragment for ATXβ. Human plasmid DNA was used to confirm the specificity of the primers, which were species-independent. HEK293 cells were transfected with ATX constructs using the calcium phosphate method. At 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. Conditioned medium was centrifuged (5000 rpm for 30 min) to remove cell debris. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) under either reducing or nonreducing conditions. For Western blot analysis, nitrocellulose filters were blocked using 5% nonfat powdered milk and probed with primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and proteins were visualized using ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Chemotactic migration of human A2058 melanoma cells was measured in 48-well Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe) as described previously (30Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M.

Filters (8-μm pores) were coated with gelatin, and cells were serum-starved overnight, trypsinized, and seeded in the upper chamber. ATX (2 ng ml−1) was added to the bottom chamber in the presence of 2 μm LPC(18:1) and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA. After 4 h, cells at the top side were removed, and migrated cells at the bottom side of the filter were fixed, stained, and quantified. HEK293 cells were transfected with C-terminally Myc-tagged ATXα or ΑΤXβ. At 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with ice-cold ethanol, and ATX was visualized by confocal microscopy using anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488. To measure lysoPLD activity, LPC(18:1) was used as substrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton X-100, 25 mm CaCl2, containing 2.5 mm homovanillic acid, 2 units ml−1 horseradish peroxidase, 2 units ml−1 choline oxidase, essentially as described (31Albers H.M.

Nucleotide PDE activity was measured using para-nitrophenolate (pNP)-TMP (Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg ml−1 fatty acid-free BSA. After addition of recombinant ATX, the amount of liberated pNP was determined by the absorbance at 405 nm, as described (28van Meeteren L.A. Ruurs P. Christodoulou E. Goding J.W. Takakusa H.

Binding of ATX (α or β) to heparin was evaluated by ELISA in two ways: first, application of ATX to heparin-coated wells of microtiter plates; and second, competition assays in which ATX was first incubated with heparin and then transferred to a heparin-coated plate. A 96-well flat-bottom plate was incubated for 16 h with 100 μl of 10 μg ml−1 heparin in coating buffer. As a control, wells were coated for 16 h with 1 μg ml−1 ATX in 0.05 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). After blocking with PBS containing 2% BSA (w/v) for 1 h, 1 μg ml−1 ATX (in PBS containing 2% BSA) was added and incubated for 2 h. Plates were washed six times with PBS, and bound ATX was detected using goat anti-ATX IgG (1:200), followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich), both for 1 h. Plates were washed six times with PBS, and enzyme activity was detected using 100 μl of a p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution (1 mg ml−1) containing 1 m diethanolamine and 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. For the competition assay, 0.1 μg ml−1 ATX was incubated with an increasing content of heparin (0–1 mg ml−1) for 1 h in 100 μl and transferred to a 96-well plate previously coated with heparin. Plates were washed six times with PBS before measuring bound ATX, as described above. ATX binding to heparin was measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using a Biacore T100 machine (Biacore, GE Healthcare). Recombinant ATXα and ΑΤXβ were covalently coupled to separate flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip at pH 4.0 at roughly equal amounts (about 10,000 response units). Increasing concentrations of unfractionated heparin in running buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) were injected across the chip at flow rate of 50 μl min−1. Injection of 1 m NaCl was used to regenerate the chip surface at the end of each cycle. The response units for the binding of heparin were evaluated after subtraction of the signal in a flow cell of the same sensor chip which has been left uncoated. To determine the apparent dissociation constant (Kd), the background-subtracted data were fit using a model in which the total binding results from specific binding plus a linear nonspecific component and a concentration-independent background according to the equation Rc=BmaxcKd+c+ac+bEq. 1 where c is the protein concentration, Rc the observed response for that specific concentration, Bmax the estimated maximal response, a the slope of the linear nonspecific components, and b the estimated background. The values for nonspecific binding and the background (a and b) were kept the same for both ATXα and ΑΤXβ binding, and only the Kd value was fit individually for each protein. The model used was judged to be 99.9% more probable than a model assuming only specific binding, according to the Akaike information criterion. Analysis was performed with GraphPad software, using an average molecular mass value for heparin of 15 kDa. For flow cytometry assays, SKOV3 cells were detached by enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (Millipore) and kept on ice for the remaining of the procedure. To establish ATX (α or β) binding capacity, cells were incubated with 3 μg of ATX ml−1. Bound ATX was detected by a goat anti-ATX IgG antibody (1:50) and an Alexa Fluor 488 fluorochrome-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (1:100; Invitrogen). To determine heparan sulfate or chondroitin/dermatan sulfate dependence, cells were predigested with 20 mIU of heparinase III or 100 mIU of chondroitinase ABC, respectively, ml−1 basal culture medium containing 1% FCS for 2 h at 4 °C. Omission of the first antibody was used as a negative control. Flow cytometry analyses were performed using a BD Biosciences FACScan or FACSCalibur. Viable cells were gated using forward and side scatter, and the fluorescence of this population was measured. The mammalian ATX gene is organized into 27 exons. The three best known splice variants of ATX, termed α, β, and γ, differ by the presence or absence of sequences encoded by exons 12 and 21 (Fig. 1A). ATXα contains an exon 12-encoded region of 52 residues in the PDE domain. The canonical ATXβ isoform lacks exons 12 and 21, whereas the “brain-specific” ATXγ isoform (formerly PD-1α) contains a 25-amin acid insertion encoded by exon 21 in the NUC domain (32Kawagoe H.

Although NA has been well characterized and thought to function as a tetramer, the role of the transmembrane domain (TMD) in promoting proper NA assembly has not been systematically studied. Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of the TMD, NA is synthesized and transported in a predominantly inactive state. Substantial activity was rescued by progressive truncations of the stalk domain, suggesting the TMD contributes to NA maturation by tethering the stalk to the membrane. To analyze how the TMD supports NA assembly, the TMD was examined by itself. The NA TMD formed a homotetramer and efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane, indicating the TMD and enzymatic head domain drive assembly together through matching oligomeric states. In support of this, an unrelated strong oligomeric TMD rescued almost full NA activity, whereas the weak oligomeric mutant of this TMD restored only half of wild type activity. These data illustrate that a large soluble domain can force assembly with a poorly compatible TMD; however, optimal assembly requires coordinated oligomerization between the TMD and the soluble domain.

https://openalex.org/W1998582167,"Flotillin microdomains, specialized lipid raft domains in cell membranes, serve as physical platforms for many different molecules important in crucial intracellular signaling pathways. Flotillin-2 (Flot2), together with flotillin-1, is a marker for lipid raft microdomains distinct from caveolar lipid rafts, and has been implicated in the progression of cancer and metastasis formation. Based largely on studies in xenograft models, flotillin-2 has been implicated in the progression of multiple types of human tumors, including breast cancer. In our studies, we identified flotillin-2 as highly amplified in a high-throughput comparative genomic hybridization screen of human breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples. Short hairpin RNA-mediated reduction of flotillin-2 protein levels significantly reduced the tumorigenicity and metastatic capability of a human breast cancer cell line in vivo. We generated mice deficient for flotillin-2 and also found a reduction of flotillin-1 protein levels and complete absence of flotillin-specific membrane microdomains in these mice. To examine the role of Flot2 in mammary tumorigenesis and lung metastasis, we used an in vivo molecular genetics approach, crossing a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, the MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T antigen) mouse, with gene-targeted Flot2−/− mice. Flotillin-2 deficiency lead to a striking reduction in the number of lung metastasis observed, but had no influence on primary tumor formation in this model. Our results indicate, using a novel in vivo animal model approach, that Flot2 is an important regulator of mammary tumor-derived lung metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2087679259,"In pulmonary hypertension the loss of precapillary arterioles results from vascular injury causing endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial cell migration and proliferation are critical for vascular regeneration. This study focused on the effect of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) on these critical processes. HMGB1 had no effect on human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) proliferation. In contrast, treatment of HPAECs with HMGB1 dose-dependently inhibited VEGF-stimulated HPAEC migration. The effect of HMGB1 on HPAEC migration was TLR4-dependent because it was reversed by TLR4 siRNA or TLR4-neutralizing antibody. Exposure of HPAECs to hypoxia caused translocation and release of HMGB1 and inhibition of HPAEC migration. The effect of hypoxia on HPAEC migration was mediated by HMGB1 because HMGB1-neutralizing antibody but not control IgG restored HPAEC migration. Likewise, TLR4 siRNA but not control siRNA reversed the inhibitory effect of hypoxia in HPAECs. The canonical TLR4 signaling pathway requires the adaptor protein MyD88 and leads to downstream NFκB activation. Interestingly, HMGB1 failed to stimulate NFκB translocation to the nucleus, but instead activated an alternative pathway characterized by activation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF3). This was in contrast to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in which HMGB1 stimulated nuclear translocation of NFκB but not IRF3. IRF3 siRNA, but not MyD88 siRNA, reversed the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on HPAEC migration. These data demonstrate that HMGB1 inhibits HPAEC migration, a critical process for vascular regeneration, via TLR4- and IRF3-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2061730009,"Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) by phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for both the unperturbed cell cycle and the DNA damage checkpoint. Although both WEE1 and MYT1 can phosphorylate CDK1, little is known about the contribution of MYT1. We found that in contrast to WEE1, MYT1 was not important for the normal cell cycle or checkpoint activation. Time-lapse microscopy indicated that MYT1 did, however, have a rate-determining role during checkpoint recovery. Depletion of MYT1 induced precocious mitotic entry when the checkpoint was abrogated with inhibitors of either CHK1 or WEE1, indicating that MYT1 contributes to checkpoint recovery independently of WEE1. The acceleration of checkpoint recovery in MYT1-depleted cells was due to a lowering of threshold for CDK1 activation. The kinase activity of MYT1 was high during checkpoint activation and reduced during checkpoint recovery. Importantly, although depletion of MYT1 alone did not affect long-term cell growth, it potentiated with DNA damage to inhibit cell growth in clonogenic survival and tumor xenograft models. These results reveal the functions of MYT1 in checkpoint recovery and highlight the potential of MYT1 as a target for anti-cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2073571647,"The Hedgehog-GLI (HH-GLI) signaling plays a critical role in controlling growth and tissue patterning during embryogenesis and is implicated in a variety of human malignancies, including those of the skin. Phosphorylation events have been shown to regulate the activity of the GLI transcription factors, the final effectors of the HH-GLI signaling pathway. Here, we show that WIP1 (or PPM1D), an oncogenic phosphatase amplified/overexpressed in several types of human cancer, is a positive modulator of the HH signaling. Mechanistically, WIP1 enhances the function of GLI1 by increasing its transcriptional activity, nuclear localization and protein stability, but not of GLI2 nor GLI3. We also find that WIP1 and GLI1 are in a complex. Modulation of the transcriptional activity of GLI1 by WIP1 depends on the latter's phosphatase activity and, remarkably, does not require p53, a known WIP1 target. Functionally, we find that WIP1 is required for melanoma and breast cancer cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro and melanoma xenograft growth induced by activation of the HH signaling. Pharmacological blockade of the HH pathway with the SMOOTHENED antagonist cyclopamine acts synergistically with inhibition of WIP1 in reducing growth of melanoma and breast cancer cells in vitro. Overall, our data uncover a role for WIP1 in modulating the activity of GLI1 and in sustaining cancer cell growth and cancer stem cell self-renewal induced by activation of the HH pathway. These findings open a novel therapeutic approach for human melanomas and, possibly, other cancer types expressing WIP1 and with activated HH pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2102426188,"Pasteurella multocida is the causative agent of a number of epizootic and zoonotic diseases. Its major virulence factor associated with atrophic rhinitis in animals and dermonecrosis in bite wounds is P. multocida toxin (PMT). PMT stimulates signal transduction pathways downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to effects such as mitogenicity, blockade of apoptosis, or inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. On the basis of Gαi2, it was demonstrated that the toxin deamidates an essential glutamine residue of the Gαi2 subunit, leading to constitutive activation of the G protein. Here, we studied the specificity of PMT for its G-protein targets by mass spectrometric analyses and by utilizing a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes specifically G proteins deamidated by PMT. The studies revealed deamidation of 3 of 4 families of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαq/11, Gαi1,2,3, and Gα12/13 of mouse or human origin) by PMT but not by a catalytic inactive toxin mutant. With the use of G-protein fragments and chimeras of responsive or unresponsive G proteins, the structural basis for the discrimination of heterotrimeric G proteins was studied.

https://openalex.org/W2113322383,"Neurosteroids are cholesterol-derived molecules synthesized within the brain, which exert trophic and protective actions. Infection by human and feline immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and FIV, respectively) causes neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, leading to neurological deficits. Secretion of neuroinflammatory host and viral factors by glia and infiltrating leukocytes mediates the principal neuropathogenic mechanisms during lentivirus infections, although the effect of neurosteroids on these processes is unknown. We investigated the interactions between neurosteroid-mediated effects and lentivirus infection outcomes. Analyses of HIV-infected (HIV+) and uninfected human brains disclosed a reduction in neurosteroid synthesis enzyme expression. Human neurons exposed to supernatants from HIV+ macrophages exhibited suppressed enzyme expression without reduced cellular viability. HIV+ human macrophages treated with sulfated dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA-S) showed suppression of inflammatory gene (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) expression. FIV-infected (FIV+) animals treated daily with 15 mg/kg body weight. DHEA-S treatment reduced inflammatory gene transcripts (IL-1β, TNF-α, CD3ε, GFAP) in brain compared to vehicle-(β-cyclodextrin)-treated FIV+ animals similar to levels found in vehicle-treated FIV– animals. DHEA-S treatment also increased CD4+ T-cell levels and prevented neurobehavioral deficits and neuronal loss among FIV+ animals, compared to vehicle-treated FIV+ animals. Reduced neuronal neurosteroid synthesis was evident in lentivirus infections, but treatment with DHEA-S limited neuroinflammation and prevented neurobehavioral deficits.

https://openalex.org/W2002063867,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a proclivity for locoregional invasion. HNSCC mediates invasion in part through invadopodia-based proteolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Activation of Src, Erk1/2, Abl and Arg downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) modulates invadopodia activity through phosphorylation of the actin regulatory protein cortactin. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, Abl and Arg function downstream of Src to phosphorylate cortactin, promoting invadopodia ECM degradation activity and thus assigning a pro-invasive role for Ableson kinases. We report that Abl kinases have an opposite, negative regulatory role in HNSCC where they suppress invadopodia and tumor invasion. Impairment of Abl expression or Abl kinase activity with imatinib mesylate enhanced HNSCC matrix degradation and 3D collagen invasion, functions that were impaired in MDA-MB-231. HNSCC lines with elevated EGFR and Src activation did not contain increased Abl or Arg kinase activity, suggesting that Src could bypass Abl/Arg to phosphorylate cortactin and promote invadopodia ECM degradation. Src-transformed Abl(-/-)/Arg(-/-) fibroblasts produced ECM degrading invadopodia containing pY421 cortactin, indicating that Abl/Arg are dispensable for invadopodia function in this system. Imatinib-treated HNSCC cells had increased EGFR, Erk1/2 and Src activation, enhancing cortactin pY421 and pS405/418 required for invadopodia function. Imatinib stimulated shedding of the EGFR ligand heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) from HNSCC cells, where soluble HB-EGF enhanced invadopodia ECM degradation in HNSCC but not in MDA-MB-231. HNSCC cells treated with inhibitors of the EGFR-invadopodia pathway indicated that EGFR and Src are required for invadopodia function. Collectively, our results indicate that Abl kinases negatively regulate HNSCC invasive processes through suppression of an HB-EGF autocrine loop responsible for activating a EGFR-Src-cortactin cascade, in contrast to the invasion promoting functions of Abl kinases in breast and other cancer types. Our results provide mechanistic support for recent failed HNSCC clinical trials utilizing imatinib."

The pH optimum for the repair follows the order of pK(a) values for protonation of the adduct, suggesting that positively charged substrates favorably interact with the negatively charged carboxylic group of Asp-135 side chain in the enzyme active center. This interaction is supported by molecular modeling, indicating that 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine and 3,N(4)-ethenocytosine are bound to AlkB more favorably in their protonated cationic forms. An analysis of the pattern of intermolecular interactions that stabilize the location of the ligand points to a role of Asp-135 in recognition of the adduct in its protonated form. Moreover, ab initio calculations also underline the role of substrate protonation in lowering the free energy barrier of the transition state of epoxidation of the etheno adducts studied. The observed time courses of repair of mixtures of stereoisomers of 3,N(4)-α-hydroxyethanocytosine or 3,N(4)-α-hydroxypropanocytosine are unequivocally two-exponential curves, indicating that the respective isomers are repaired by AlkB with different efficiencies.

Dietary fat contributes to this condition through the production of chylomicrons. Carboxylesterases have been mainly studied for their role in drug metabolism, but recently they have been shown to participate in lipid metabolism; however, their role in intestinal lipid metabolism is unknown. Carboxylesterase1/esterase-x (Ces1/Es-x) deficient mice become obese, hyperlipidemic and develop hepatic steatosis even on standard chow diet. Here, we aimed to explore the role of Ces1/Es-x in intestinal lipid metabolism. Six-month old wild-type and Ces1/Es-x deficient mice were maintained on chow diet and intestinal lipid metabolism and plasma chylomicron clearance were analyzed. Along the intestine Ces1/Es-x protein is expressed only in proximal jejunum. Ablation of Ces1/Es-x expression results in postprandial hyperlipidemia due to increased secretion of chylomicrons. The secreted chylomicrons have aberrant protein composition, which results in their reduced clearance. In conclusion, Ces1/Es-x participates in the regulation of chylomicron assembly and secretion. Ces1/Es-x might act as a lipid sensor in enterocytes regulating chylomicron secretion rate. Ces1/Es-x might represent an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of lipid abnormalities associated with obesity, insulin resistance and fatty liver disease."

Modes of p53 regulation.Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Thus, factors that affect the physical interaction of MDM2 with p53 or MDM2 E3 ligase activity will directly impact p53 steady-state level. Posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and p300-dependent acetylation of C-terminal lysine of p53 have been shown to regulate p53 stability in part by controlling the accessibility of p53 to MDM2 and blocking MDM2-medidated ubiquitination and degradation (1Kruse J.P. Gu W. Modes of p53 regulation.Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). A number of oncoproteins or tumor suppressor proteins affect protein stability and activity by modulating the MDM2-p53 axis. For instance, the tumor suppressor p14ARF directly interacts with and functionally inactivates MDM2, by either relocating MDM2 to the nucleolus and/or forming a tripartite complex with MDM2 and p53, which abrogates MDM2-medidated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (4Sherr C.J. Divorcing ARF and p53: an unsettled case.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Other proteins such as MdmX, YY1, gankyrin, VHL, and several ribosomal proteins also participated in MDM2-p53 axis modulation by multiple mechanisms (5Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G.

In addition to the roles in gene repression, PHF1 is also involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks in human cells. PHF1 is rapidly recruited to double-strand break sites, promoting non-homologous end-joining processes by directly interacting with Ku70/Ku80 (14Hong Z. Jiang J. Lan L. Nakajima S. Kanno S. Koseki H.

Among other proteins implicated in DNA damage response, p53 was previously found to coimmunoprecipitate with PHF1 in a proteomics analysis, although it was not determined whether the interaction is direct and what functional consequence this interaction has on p53 (14Hong Z.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 negative control propidium iodide quantitative RT-PCR luciferase. Here, we demonstrated that PHF1 is a novel activator of the p53 signaling pathway. We verified the interaction between PHF1 and p53 both in vitro and in vivo. PHF1 was found to protect p53 protein from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we showed that PHF1 promoted p53-dependent cell growth arrest and etoposide-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings unravel a novel mechanism of p53 regulation. U2OS, H1299, and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53−/− cells were generous gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University). U2OS, HepG2, HCT116 p53+/+, and HCT116 p53−/− cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, whereas H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human PHF1 cDNA were described previously (14Hong Z. Jiang J. Lan L. Nakajima S. Kanno S. Koseki H. Yasui A.

All other PHF1 and p53 deletion mutants were generated using the KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Japan). USP7 and USP10 were from Dr. Wei Gu (Columbia University). Luciferase assay (Promega) was conducted in cells that were transiently transfected with the reporter constructs (AP1-Luc, CRE-Luc, DR5-Luc, E2F-Luc, GRE-Luc, HSE-Luc, NFAT-Luc, NFκB-Luc, p53-Luc, Rb-Luc, and SRE-Luc, purchased from Clontech), pTK-galactosidase (Promega) construct, and the PHF1 expression constructs and/or with the empty vector alone. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the luciferase assay system in a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to galactosidase activity as an internal control. Each assay was performed in triplicate, and results were confirmed by at least three individually repeating experiments. The HuSH 29-mer shRNA constructs against PHF1 in pGFP-V-RS vector were purchased from OriGene, Inc. The non-effective scrambled pGFP-V-RS construct (TR30013, OriGene) was used as negative control (NC). The sequences for PHF1-specific shRNA expression and scrambled cassettes are as follows: KD-1, 5′-ACATCTGAGCAACCGACAGCAGAGTTACT-3′; KD-2, 5′-TGGTCAGCTGTGAGAAGTGTCGCCATGCT-3′; and NC, 5′-GCACTACCAGAGCTAACTCAGATAGTACT-3′. The following antibodies were used in this work: PHF1 (sc-130646; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PHF1 (AT3294a; Abgent), p53 (Do-1; sc-126; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 (FL-393; sc-6243; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), acetyl-p53 (Lys-382; 2525S; Cell Signaling), phospho-Ser-15-p53 (9286S; Cell Signaling), p21 (Calbiochem), Myc (9E10; Sigma), FLAG (M2; Sigma), HA (MM5–101R; Convance), GFP (sc-8334; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and actin (AC-74; Sigma). Cells were lysed with 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling), and the lysate was centrifuged. The supernatant was precleared with protein A/G beads (Sigma) and incubated with indicated antibody overnight. Thereafter, protein A/G beads were applied, all at 4 °C. After 2 h of incubation, pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20, washed twice in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h and followed by secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, the proteins of interest were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 293T cells were lysed 40 h after transfection with 1× cell lysis buffer at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with pull-down buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), the beads were incubated with lysates of 293T cells or Escherichia coli expressed and purified recombinant His-p53 protein for 2 h. The beads were then washed five times with binding buffer and resuspended in sample buffer. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Cells cultured and transiently transfected on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature and blocked with 10% normal horse serum plus 1% BSA (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The treated cells on the coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-HA or Myc antibody (1:500 dilution). After being washed three times in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the cells were incubated with rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300 dilution) for 1 h and stained with DAPI. Fluorescent images were captured using Olympus Inverted Microscope System. In vitro ubiquitination assay was carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 15 μm ZnCl2, and 4 mm ATP, with 100 nm E1 (Sigma), 200 nm human recombinant UbcH7, and 250 μm ubiquitin (Sigma). In vitro reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 60–90 min. Proliferation was measured by colorimetric 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells were incubated with BrdU labeling solution for additional 6 h at 37 °C and then fixed and denatured by FixDenat solution. After incubation with anti-BrdU-peroxidase working solution, substrate solution was added until the color development was sufficient for photometric detection. H2SO4 (1 mm) was applied to stop the reaction. Absorbance was measured using an automatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (450 nm). Total RNA was isolated from transiently transfected cells using the TRIzol reagent (Tiangen, China), and cDNA was reversed-transcribed using the Superscript RT kit (TOYOBO), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of primers in quantitative PCR were as follows: PHF1-F, 5′-TTACTGTTACTGTGGTGGCC-3′ and PHF1-R, 5′-GGTGATACAGGACAAGATGG-3′; p53-F, 5′-CATCCTCACCATCATCACACTG-3′ and p53-R, 5′-TGGACTTCAGGTGGCTGGAGTG-3′. PCR amplification was performed using the SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (TOYOBO). All quantization was normalized to the level of endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116−/− cells were seeded overnight in six-well plates. Forty eight h after transfection, cells were treated with 40 μm etoposide for 24 h. The cells were collected and washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A, 0.03% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature. DNA content and cell cycle were assessed by FACScan. Based on PI staining, cells in sub-G1 were considered apoptotic. The tissue microarray (OD-CT-RpBre03-004 and 005) sections were deparaffined in xylene and rehydrated in alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 3% H2O2 for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was achieved by twice heating by microwave in a citrate acid buffer (pH 6.0), and sections were blocked in 3% goat serum (Boster Bio) at 37 °C for 15 min. Slices were incubated with a primary antibody (anti-PHF1 at 1:60 dilution) at 4 °C overnight, followed by three washes in PBS and incubation with a HRP-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:100 dilution) for 30 min. Immunostaining was achieved using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were obtained by a Leica DMRI microscope (Leica Corp.) installed on a Lexica DC 500 camera (Leica). The data in this study were expressed as the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The earlier observation that p53, along with a number of other proteins involved in DNA damage response, coimmunoprecipitated with PHF1 suggested a tantalizing functional link between the two proteins (14Hong Z. Jiang J. Lan L. Nakajima S. Kanno S. Koseki H. Yasui A. A polycomb group protein, PHF1, is involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks in human cell.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2939-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To further explore the potential functional interaction between PHF1 and p53, we performed reporter gene assays to determine whether PHF1 affected the transcriptional activity of p53. In addition, we also included reporter genes for a number of other transcription factors, including AP1, CRE, DR5, E2F, GRE, HSE, NFAT, NFκB, p53, Rb, and SRE. These reporter constructs contain the luciferase gene under the control of tandem response elements of the corresponding transcription factors. The PHF1 expression construct was co-transfected with each of the reporter constructs into HepG2 cells. The luminescence outputs were measured and used to survey the effects of PHF1 on the different transcription factors. Expression of PHF1 significantly increased the p53-luciferase reporter activity (18.6-fold, p < 0.001). In contrast, PHF1 had much smaller or no effects on all other reporters tested (Fig. 1A). To further confirm that PHF1-increased p53 reporter activity is dependent on endogenous p53, we repeated the reporter activation experiment in cell lines with or without wild-type p53. As shown in Fig. 1B, PHF1 significantly increased p53 reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner in U2OS (p53 wild type) and HCT116 p53+/+ cells but had no effect on the p53 reporter in H1299 (p53 null) and HCT116 p53−/− cells, suggesting that activation of the p53 reporter by PHF1 is dependent on p53. We also determined the effects of PHF1 on the promoter activity on two well-established p53 target genes: the cell cycle regulator p21 and the proapoptotic gene Bax. PHF1 increased activities of both p21 and Bax promoters in a dose-dependent manner in U20S and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that PHF1 potentiates p53 transactivation activity and PHF1 may be a novel regulator of p53. We determined whether PHF1 directly interacts with p53. We co-expressed HA-p53 and Myc-PHF1 in H1299 cells and immunoprecipitated p53 by anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), HA-p53 coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-PHF1. Similar results were obtained in a reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiment using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Importantly, when endogenous p53 was immunoprecipitated from U2OS cells by anti-p53 antibody (FL-393), endogenous PHF1 was detected in the immunoprecipitate by Western blot (Fig. 2B). To examine the interaction between PHF1 and p53 in vivo, we determined whether these two proteins are localized to the same subcellular compartments. As shown in Fig. 2C, PHF1 was exclusively localized in nucleus. p53 was predominantly localized in nucleus, but a small fraction was also localized in cytoplasm. When p53 and PHF1 were coexpressed, the two proteins were exclusively co-localized in nucleus. To determine whether the interaction between p53 and PHF1 is direct, we assessed their interaction in vitro using purified recombinant proteins. Recombinant His-p53 and GST-PHF1 were expressed and purified from bacteria. The GST-PHF1, but not GST alone, bound to His-p53 in a pulldown assay (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicate that PHF1 interacts with p53 both in vitro and in vivo. p53 is modular with multiple domains, including a transactivation domain, a proline-rich domain, a DNA-binding domain, a tetramerization domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. To determine which domain mediates its interaction with PHF1, we generated a series of truncation mutants of p53 (C1-C3, N1-N4). A total of seven mutants were generated as GST fusion proteins and expressed and purified from bacteria. A pulldown assay with GST-p53 and the various truncation mutants was used to assess their interactions with Myc-PHF1 overexpressed in H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 is sufficient for PHF1 binding. A similar strategy was used to map the p53-interacting sequences of PHF1. We generated a series of N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of PHF1 and determined the minimal region that mediates its interaction with p53. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, there exist two discrete domains (named BD1 and BD2) that were capable of p53 binding, which are localized to the N and C termini of PHF1, respectively. p53 is a short-lived protein, and its stability is tightly controlled under normal and stressed conditions. First, we tested whether overexpression of PHF1 affected the level of p53 protein. As shown in Fig. 4A, the protein level of p53 was dramatically elevated when PHF1 was co-expressed in H1299 cells. Two deletion mutants, PHF1-ΔBD1 or ΔBD2, only moderately increased p53 protein levels. However, the deletion mutant lacking both binding domains (PHF1-ΔBD1/2) had no effect on the steady-state level of p53, suggesting PHF1 stabilizes p53 through direct interaction. The increase in p53 protein level in the presence of PHF1 can be attributed to either enhanced expression at the mRNA or protein levels or an increase in protein stability. To distinguish between those possibilities, we determined the half-life of p53 in the absence or the presence of coexpressed PHF1. We found that PHF1 significantly increased the half-life of p53 (Fig. 4B). In a complementary experiment, we knocked down the endogenous PHF1 and determined the changes in p53 protein level in p53 wild-type cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, knockdown of PHF1 in U2OS and HepG2 cells by two independent shRNAs resulted in a marked decrease in the protein levels of endogenous p53. To exclude the possibility that p53 protein decrease resulted from transcriptional down-regulation, we performed qRT-PCR to measure the mRNA levels of PHF1 and p53 in PHF1 knockdown U2OS cells. In contrast to the significant decrease in mRNA of PHF1, the mRNA level of p53 in PHF1 depleted U2OS cells stayed at a level similar to that of control cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, knockdown of PHF1 in U2OS cells also decreased the half-life of endogenous p53 (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results further support the notion that PHF1 regulates p53 protein stability in vivo. We also tested whether knockdown of PHF1 affected the expression of p53 target genes. As shown in Fig. 4F, knockdown of PHF1 in U2OS cells resulted in a marked decrease in the mRNA levels of a subset of p53 target genes examined, including p21, 14-3-3σ, MDM2, PUMA, PIG3, and cyclin G1. But knockdown of PHF1 had no obvious effect on the mRNA level of GADD45, suggesting that PHF1 may selectively regulates certain p53 target genes. Given that DNA damage is one of the major stresses that provoke p53 action, we examined the p53 protein stabilization in PHF1 knockdown U2OS cells treated with genotoxic drug etoposide. As shown in Fig. 4G, in control knockdown cells, p53 protein levels gradually increased in a time-dependent manner, followed by an increase in endogenous p21 protein levels. In contrast, knockdown of PHF1 resulted in a marked delay in the accumulation of p53 and p21. The etoposide-induced Lys-382 acetylation and Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 were also reduced in PHF1 knockdown U2OS cells (Fig. 4G), and two post-translational modifications are critical for p53-mediated transactivation activities. These results suggest that PHF1 controls p53 stability and activity both in normal states and DNA damage response. p53 stability is mainly regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a major role in regulating p53. Other E3 ubiquitin ligases have also been shown to regulate p53 stability such as COP1, Pirh2, and ARF-BP1. p53 ubiquitination can be also reversed by deubiquitinases such as USP7 (HAUSP) and USP10. Thus, it would appear that the regulation of p53 by ubiquitination and deubiquitination is a rather complex process. Because PHF1 promotes p53 stability, we examined whether PHF1 also interacts with other core components of p53 ubiquitination networks. Thus, FLAG-tagged ubiquitin ligases (MDM2, COP1, and Pirh2) or deubiquitinases (USP7 and USP10) were each co-expressed with Myc-PHF1 in 293 cells and extracts of the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. Western blots revealed that PHF1 was clearly detected in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-p53 (Fig. 5A), but none of the other ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases were able to co-immunoprecipitate PHF1 (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate the specificity of the PHF1-p53 interaction. We also demonstrated that PHF1 proteins significantly abrogated MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro. When recombinant GST-p53 and MDM2 was incubated in ubiquitin reaction buffer that contained recombinant E1, E2 (UbcH5a), and ubiquitin, ubiquitylated p53 was detected by Western blot (Fig. 5B). However, the formation of polyubiquitylated p53 was significantly decreased in the presence of GST-PHF1, but no obvious effect was observed in the presence of GST-PHF1ΔBD1/2 or GST alone (Fig. 5B). PHF1 overexpression in H1299 cells also suppressed MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in vivo (Fig. 5C). We also detected the effect of PHF1 knockdown on the ubiquitination of endogenous p53. The shRNA construct (KD-1) against PHF1 or control construct (NC) was co-transfected into U2OS cells. The results showed PHF1 knockdown in U2OS cells caused an increase in the endogenous ubiquitination of p53, compared with control cells, either with or without etoposide treatment (Fig. 5D). PHF1 binds to the C-terminal domain of p53 that contains several lysine residues can be also post-translationally modified by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO. Unlike ubiquitination, p53 sumoylation does not target proteins for rapid degradation but rather regulates its transcriptional activities and localization. We examined whether PHF1 affects the sumoylation status of p53. As shown in Fig. 5E, PHF1 overexpression had no impact on the global sumoylation level of p53, suggesting that PHF1 specifically affected p53 ubiquitination, but not sumoylation. In addition to ubiquitination and sumoylation, the C-terminal domain of p53 also harbors many conserved sites that can be regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation. We also examined whether PHF1 affects the phosphorylation or acetylation at the C-terminal domain of p53. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, we observed that the Lys-373 and Lys-382 acetylation of p53 were moderately increased when PHF1 was co-expressed with p53. However, co-expression of PHF1 had no effect on the Thr-377 and Ser-392 phosphorylation of p53. These results were interesting because it has been reported that acetylation of p53 promotes p53 stabilization by excluding ubiquitination on the same sites (15Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. MDM2-HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of p53 is required for its degradation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We also showed that p53 protein levels were dramatically decreased when p53 was co-expressed with MDM2 (Fig. 5F). However, co-expression of PHF1 significantly reversed MDM2-mediated p53 degradation in cells, but co-expression of PHF1ΔBD1/2 mutant exhibited no obvious effect on p53 degradation (Fig. 5F). Importantly, PHF1, but not the p53-binding deficient mutant PHF1ΔBD1/2 efficiently blocked the interaction between MDM2 and p53 in cells (Fig. 5G), suggesting that p53 binding capacity is essential for the protection of p53 by PHF1. Moreover, PHF1 overexpression had no impact on MDM2 self-ubiquitination in vivo (Fig. 5H). It has been reported that low levels of Mdm2 activity induce monoubiquitination and nuclear export of p53, whereas high levels promote p53 polyubiquitination and nuclear degradation (16Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Mono- versus polyubiquitination: differential control of p53 fate by Mdm2.Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). We also examined whether PHF1 antagonizes nuclear export of p53 by MDM2. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, expression of MDM2 caused accumulation of p53 in the cytoplasm, whereas addition of PHF1 restored nuclear localization of p53, indicating that PHF1 suppressed MDM2-mediated nuclear export of p53. Taken together, these results suggest that PHF1 blocks p53 ubiquitination and degradation at least in part, by preventing MDM2 from binding to p53, but not by blocking ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of MDM2. Given that PHF1 regulates p53 protein stability and the expression of a subset of its target genes, we wondered whether it also affects p53-dependent cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. First, we investigated the potential role of PHF1 in cell growth using a colony formation assay. H1299, U2OS, HCT116 p53+/+, and HCT116 p53−/− cells were transfected with a Myc-PHF1 or PHF1-ΔBD1/2 mutant expression construct and a control vector, and stable clones were counted. A significant reduction in colonies was observed in PHF1 expressing cells in comparison with control cells in p53 wild-type cell lines U2OS and HCT116 p53+/+ (Fig. 6A). However, PHF1 overexpression had no obvious effect on the colony formation of two p53 null cell lines, H1299 and HCT116 p53−/− (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, PHF1-ΔBD1/2 overexpression had no effect on the colony formation of U2OS and HCT116 p53+/+ cells, suggesting that the p53-binding capacity of PHF1 were essential for its cell growth arrest activities (Fig. 6A). BrdU incorporation assay results also showed that PHF1 overexpression reduced the DNA synthesis activities in U2OS and HCT116 p53+/+ cells but not in H1299 and HCT116 p53−/− cells (supplemental Fig. 3). In a complementary experiment, we knocked down PHF1 by two independent shRNAs in these cell lines. As shown in Fig. 6B, knockdown of PHF1 significantly enhanced the colony formation of U2OS and HCT116 p53+/+ cells but not in H1299 and HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assay results also showed that knockdown of PHF1 expression enhanced the DNA synthesis activities in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). As PHF1 was found to promote p53 protein stability and activation in cells treated with genotoxic drug etoposide, we speculated that the attenuation of p53 activation by PHF1 knockdown might be translated into a phenotypic change in apoptosis. To this end, we transfected HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53−/− cells with either control shRNA or PHF1 shRNA followed by etoposide treatment. Cells were collected at 24 h, stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptotic cells according to DNA content. As shown in Fig. 6D, basal level sub-G1 content is minimally affected by PHF1 knockdown. However, 24 h after etoposide treatment, an average of 60.6% of HCT116 p53+/+ cells transfected with control shRNA (NC) were apoptotic, whereas only 23.0% (KD-1) or 33.4% (KD-2) of cells transfected with PHF1shRNA were apoptotic (Fig. 6D). Importantly, the differential effect of PHF1 knockdown on cell apoptosis was not observed in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, introduction of HA-p53 vector into HCT116 p53−/− cells resulted in resensitization to PHF1 knockdown as measured by BrdU incorporation assay and PI staining assay (Fig. 6, E and F). Taken together, these results suggest that PHF1 is important for p53-dependent cell growth and apoptosis. Because p53 plays an important role in tumor suppression and PHF1 potentiates p53 function by protecting p53 from E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, it is possible that PHF1 also acts as a tumor suppressor and dysregulated in human cancers. Our results shown in Fig. 6 demonstrated the ability of PHF1 to promote p53-dependent cancer cell growth arrest and apoptosis, which lend support to the hypothesis that PHF1 functions as a tumor suppressor in vivo. However, the relative expression of PHF1 in various human cancers samples has not been reported yet. To further test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of PHF1 in a panel of breast cancer tissue samples. Tissue microarrays containing 57 primary ductal breast carcinoma and adjacent non-tumor tissues were immunostained using a specific anti-PHF1 antibody. Substantial PHF1 immunostaining was detected in the non-tumor samples (Fig. 7), whereas very little to moderate PHF1 staining was observed in breast cancer samples (Fig. 7). PHF1 expression was detected predominantly in the nucleus of normal mammary gland cells, which is consistent with the immunofluorescence analysis data shown in Fig. 2C. This result suggests that PHF1 may act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. In this study, we unraveled a novel function of PHF1 in p53 regulation. PHF1 is a Polycomb group protein and a component of PRC2 complex. PHF1 positively regulates the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the PRC2 complex in vitro, and PHF1 is important for H3K27 methylation and Hox gene expression in vivo (13Sarma K. Margueron R.

A polycomb group protein, PHF1, is involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks in human cell.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2939-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PHF1 was also found to be involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks in human cells. It has been shown to interact with Ku70/Ku80 and promote non-homologous end-joining process. Furthermore, a proteomics approach to identify interacting proteins of PHF1 in 293 cells showed SMC1, DHX9, p53 and Rad50 as potential interacting partners of PHF1 (14Hong Z. Jiang J. Lan L. Nakajima S. Kanno S. Koseki H. Yasui A. A polycomb group protein, PHF1, is involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks in human cell.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2939-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). But the physiological roles of these potential interactions have remained unexplored. In this study, we uncovered a novel function of PHF1 as a regulator of p53. We found PHF1 can transcactivate p53 through pathway screen assays. Subsequent studies showed that PHF1 binds to p53 in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, PHF1 can promote p53 protein stability and transactivation by protecting p53 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. PHF1 reduced cell proliferation and promoted DNA damage reagent-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that PHF1 is a novel p53 regulator. The potential roles of PHF1 in tumorigenesis and tumor progression have not been clearly characterized. Our results that PHF1 expression is significantly down-regulated in breast cancer shed light on PHF1 function as a tumor suppressor in human. Moreover, PHF1 abnormality was reported in endometrial stromal sarcomas, which were rare malignancies accounting for less than 10% of uterine sarcomas (17Chiang S. Ali R. Melnyk N. McAlpine J.N.

Recently, specific translocation events leading to the fusion of PHF1 with other two genes clearly defines a new pathogenetic subgroup of endometrial stromal sarcomas (16Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F.

PHF1 was found to be recombined with two different partners, with the JAZF1 gene in the two tumors showing a t(6p;7p) rearrangement and with the EPC1 (enhancer of Polycomb) gene from 10p11 in the third tumor, which had a t(6p;10q;10p) translocation as the sole karyotypic abnormality (18Micci F.

JAZF1/PHF1 fusion gene was also presented in a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma cell line JHU-ESS1 (19Panagopoulos I. Mertens F. Griffin C.A.

The underlined pathological functions of PHF1 fusion proteins were not fully understood. Our data showed that wild-type PHF1 promoted p53 protein stability and transactivation under normal and stressed conditions. It will be interesting to test whether p53 pathway is compromised in endometrial stromal sarcomas harboring JAZF1/PHF1 and EPC1/PHF1 chimeras. In future, pathological analysis of various human cancer specimens and genetically engineered mouse models are warranted to determine whether PHF1 is a bona fide p53-dependent tumor suppressor in animals.

Forty-one healthy Beagles, mean age 9.9 years (range 3.1 to 14.8), were fed control or one of two treatment foods for 6 months. All foods were complete and balanced and met the nutrient requirements for adult dogs, and had similar concentrations of moisture, protein, and fat (approx. 7.4%, 14.0%, and 18.1%, respectively). The treatment diets both contained added L-carnitine (300 mg/kg) and 0.6% (treatment food 1) or 1.5% (treatment food 2) added fish oil. Treatment food 2 also had increased MCT from coconut oil, added corn oil, and reduced animal fat. Composition of serum FA was determined by gas chromatography of FA methyl esters. Metabolomic profiles of serum samples were determined from extracted supernatants that were split and run on GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms, for identification and relative quantification of small metabolites. Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Among dog groups, there was no change in total-lean-body weight, or in serum total protein and serum albumin concentrations, based on time or dietary treatment. Serum concentrations of carnitine metabolites were decreased in geriatric (>7 years) vs. mature adult (≤7 years) dogs, and supplementation with L-carnitine attenuated the effects of aging. The ratio of PUFA to SFA was significantly greater in mature dogs at baseline (P≤0.05). Serum concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic FA increased in a dose-dependent manner. Dogs consuming treatment food 2 also had increased serum concentrations of lauric and myristic FA, and decreased concentrations of SFA, MUFA, and arachidonate (all P≤0.05) and their PUFA to SFA ratio increased. In summary, dietary MCT, fish oil, and L-carnitine counterbalanced the effects of aging on circulating concentrations of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2032453810,"Myristoylation occurs cotranslationally on nascent proteins and post-translationally during apoptosis after caspase cleavages expose cryptic myristoylation sites. We demonstrate a drastic change in the myristoylated protein proteome in apoptotic cells, likely as more substrates are revealed by caspases. We show for the first time that both N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) 1 and 2 are cleaved during apoptosis and that the caspase-3- or -8-mediated cleavage of NMT1 at Asp-72 precedes the cleavage of NMT2 by caspase-3 mainly at Asp-25. The cleavage of NMTs did not significantly affect their activity in apoptotic cells until the 8 h time point. However, the cleavage of the predominantly membrane bound NMT1 (64%) removed a polybasic domain stretch and led to a cytosolic relocalization (>55%), whereas predominantly cytosolic NMT2 (62%) relocalized to membranes when cleaved (>80%) after the removal of a negatively charged domain. The interplay between caspases and NMTs during apoptosis is of particular interest since caspases may not only control the rates of substrate production but also their myristoylation rate by regulating the location and perhaps the specificity of NMTs. Since apoptosis is often suppressed in cancer, the reduced caspase activity seen in cancer cells might also explain the higher NMT levels observed in many cancers.—Perinpanayagam, M.

https://openalex.org/W2062205636,"Intracellular de novo protein folding is assisted by cellular networks of molecular chaperones. In Escherichia coli, cooperation between the chaperones trigger factor (TF) and DnaK is central to this process. Accordingly, the simultaneous deletion of both chaperone-encoding genes leads to severe growth and protein folding defects. Herein, we took advantage of such defective phenotypes to further elucidate the interactions of chaperone networks in vivo. We show that disruption of the TF/DnaK chaperone pathway is efficiently rescued by overexpression of the redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33. Consistent with this observation, the deletion of hslO, the Hsp33 structural gene, is no longer tolerated in the absence of the TF/DnaK pathway. However, in contrast with other chaperones like GroEL or SecB, suppression by Hsp33 was not attributed to its potential overlapping general chaperone function(s). Instead, we show that overexpressed Hsp33 specifically binds to elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) and targets it for degradation by the protease Lon. This synergistic action of Hsp33 and Lon was responsible for the rescue of bacterial growth in the absence of TF and DnaK, by presumably restoring the coupling between translation and the downstream folding capacity of the cell. In support of this hypothesis, we show that overexpression of the stress-responsive toxin HipA, which inhibits EF-Tu, also rescues bacterial growth and protein folding in the absence of TF and DnaK.

In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the folding of newly synthesized proteins is orchestrated by three major chaperone systems, namely trigger factor (TF), 2The abbreviations used are:TFtrigger factorEFelongation factorIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. DnaK (Hsp70), and GroEL (Hsp60). The ribosome-bound TF is the first molecular chaperone to interact with most of the newly synthesized polypeptides (1.Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R.

Interaction of SRP and trigger factor with nascent polypeptides.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). TF does this by anchoring itself to the L23 ribosomal protein located at the ribosomal exit port (2.Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. L23 protein functions as a chaperone docking site on the ribosome.Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), thus enabling its early interaction with nascent polypeptide chains as short as 40 amino acids (3.Lakshmipathy S.K.

Following polypeptide chain elongation and release from the ribosome, TF may stay bound to its substrate for a prolonged period, thus facilitating folding or transfer to downstream cytosolic chaperones such as GroEL or DnaK (5.Kaiser C.M.

Recently, a quantitative ribosome profiling analysis of nascent chains bound to TF, revealed that in addition to cytosolic proteins, outer membrane proteins are also TF substrates. In addition, deletion of the tig gene, encoding TF, leads to a decrease in the steady state level of outer membrane proteins, suggesting that TF plays an important role in outer membrane proteins processing as well (6.Crooke E.

DnaK functions as a central hub in the E. coli chaperone network.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) revealed that DnaK interacts with more than 600 proteins, including ∼80% of cytosolic proteins, ∼11% of inner membrane proteins, ∼3% of outer membrane proteins, and ∼3% of periplasmic proteins (11.Calloni G.

The third major molecular chaperone involved in de novo protein folding is the chaperonin GroEL assisted by its co-chaperone GroES (Hsp10) (13.Horwich A.L. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A.

Identification of in vivo substrates of the chaperonin GroEL.Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Specifically, more than 250 GroEL substrates have been identified, 85 of which were shown to be obligate GroEL substrates, including 13 essential proteins (15.Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y.

In agreement with these results, the groEL and groES genes are absolutely essential for E. coli viability, because neither can be deleted under all conditions tested (16.Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T.

Noticeably, more than 1000 proteins, pre-existing and de novo synthesized, were shown to aggregate at 30 °C in this double tig dnaK mutant, indicating that the cooperation between TF and DnaK is indeed crucial for overall cellular protein homeostasis (11.Calloni G.

In agreement with the existence of such a chaperone network, overexpression of GroEL/GroES significantly suppresses both the temperature-sensitive phenotype and the protein folding defect observed in the simultaneous absence of both TF and DnaK (15.Kerner M.J.

In this case, overexpression of GroEL/GroES likely favors interaction with nonobligate GroEL substrates, thus restore cell viability. Interestingly, protein substrates of GroEL and DnaK overlap significantly (15.Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P. Georgopoulos C. Frishman D. Hayer-Hartl M. Mann M.

This observation is in agreement with a proposed model in which DnaK is working upstream of GroEL to stabilize obligate GroEL substrates in a nonaggregated state for subsequent productive interaction with GroEL. In addition, significantly more GroEL substrates interact with DnaK in vivo upon GroEL depletion and about ∼70% of GroEL substrates aggregate in the double tig dnaK mutant, thus arguing again for a key role of TF and DnaK in targeting substrates to GroEL (11.Calloni G.

DnaK functions as a central hub in the E. coli chaperone network.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of the export chaperone SecB is also capable of replacing DnaK and TF, suggesting that this chaperone can also play an important role in the cellular chaperone network in response to cytoplasmic protein misfolding or aggregation (19.Ullers R.S. Luirink J. Harms N. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. SecB is a bona fide generalized chaperone in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7583-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this respect it is interesting to note that both GroEL and SecB were recently isolated as highly enriched DnaK interacting proteins (“interactors”), further emphasizing the functional cooperation among these chaperones (11.Calloni G. Chen T. Schermann S.M. Chang H.C. Genevaux P. Agostini F. Tartaglia G.G. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. DnaK functions as a central hub in the E. coli chaperone network.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the redox regulated and heat shock-induced chaperone Hsp33 can efficiently suppress the bacterial growth and protein folding defects observed in the absence of both TF and DnaK, thus revealing a role for Hsp33 as a major participant of the E. coli chaperone network. However, in contrast with our previous results concerning GroEL and SecB, we now show that Hsp33 acts indirectly, by specifically interacting with the essential elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and targeting it for degradation by the protease Lon. Genetic experiments were carried out in the E. coli MC4100 (20.Casadaban M.J. Transposition and fusion of the lac genes to selected promoters in Escherichia coli using bacteriophage λ and μ.J. Mol.

The ΔhslO::KanR allele was obtained from strain JWK5692 (Keio collection). All mutations described in this study were moved to the appropriate genetic background by bacteriophage P1-mediated transduction. Bacteria were routinely grown in LB medium supplemented when necessary with chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), or tetracycline (15 μg/ml). The construction of the dnaK-protease and dnaK hslO double mutants was performed as follows. The KanR cassettes from MC4100 ΔhslO::KanR and Δlon::KanR were first removed using plasmid pCP20 as described (25.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11136) Google Scholar). The ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR mutant allele was then introduced into the hslO and the various protease mutants, thus leading to the construction of strains MC4100 ΔhslO ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR, Δlon ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR, ΔclpP::CmR ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR, and ΔclpQ::TetR ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR. To construct strain MC4100 ΔhslO Δtig::CmR dnaJ::Tn10-42, the Δtig::CmR mutant allele was first introduced into MC4100 ΔhslO, followed by introduction of dnaJ::Tn10-42(TetR). In this case, selection for transductants was carried out at 30 °C. The mutant strains used for the Lon-dependent suppression experiments were constructed as follows. The ΔhslO::KanR mutant allele was first introduced into MC4100 Δlon. Next, the ΔdnaK52::CmR mutant allele (12.Bukau B. Walker G.C. Delta dnaK52 mutants of Escherichia coli have defects in chromosome segregation and plasmid maintenance at normal growth temperatures.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6030-6038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into both MC4100 ΔhslO::KanR and MC4100 Δlon ΔhslO::KanR. MC4100 Δtig::CmR Δlon::KanR dnaJ::Tn10-42 was constructed by first moving the Δtig::CmR mutant allele into MC4100 Δlon::KanR. Note that the lon and tig genes are 90% linked by P1 transduction on the E. coli chromosome. The dnaJ::Tn10-42 allele was then introduced into MC4100 Δtig::CmR Δlon::KanR and selection was done at 30 °C. All DNA cloning and transformation experiments were carried out in strain DH5α (Invitrogen). Plasmids pSE380ΔNcoI, p29SEN (17.Genevaux P. Keppel F. Schwager F. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Hartl F.U. Georgopoulos C. In vivo analysis of the overlapping functions of DnaK and trigger factor.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and pBAD22 (26.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. Tight regulation, modulation, and high-level expression by vectors containing the arabinose PBAD promoter.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3941) Google Scholar) have been previously described. To construct the high-copy number plasmid pSE-Hsp33 (pSE380 ΔNcoI-Hsp33) and the low-copy number plasmid p29-Hsp33 (p29SEN-Hsp33), the 879-bp hslO gene was PCR-amplified using primers Hsp33-for (5′-CGGAATTCTCATGATTATGCCGCAACATGACC-3′) and Hsp33-rev (5′-CGAAGCTTGGATCCTTAATGAACTTGCGGATCTGC-3′) using MG1655 genomic DNA as template. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into either pSE380ΔNcoI or p29SEN previously digested with the same enzymes. A similar cloning procedure was used to construct the pSE-Hsp33(Y12E), pSE-Hsp33(M172S) mutant derivatives, except that in this case, plasmids pET11a-hslO(Y12E) or pET11a-hslO(M172S) DNA were used as a template (27.Cremers C.M. Reichmann D. Hausmann J. Ilbert M. Jakob U. Unfolding of metastable linker region is at the core of Hsp33 activation as a redox-regulated chaperone.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11243-11251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSE-Hsp33-FLAG (pSE380ΔNcoI-Hsp33-flag tagged) containing Hsp33 with the C-terminal FLAG tag “GSDYKDDDDKSA” was constructed using primers Hsp33-for and 33FT-rev (5′-GCAAGCTTGGATCCTTAGGCGCTTTTATCGTCGTCATCTTTGTAGTCGCTGCCATGAACTTGCGGATCTGC-3′) and pSE-Hsp33 as DNA template. The PCR fragment was cloned as an EcoRI-HindIII-digested PCR fragment in pSE380ΔNcoI digested with the same enzymes. Plasmid pSE-Hsp33(Q151E) was constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis using the appropriate primers. Plasmid pSE-Hsp33(1–235) was constructed using primers Hsp33-for and Hsp33(1–235)-rev (5′-CAAGCTTGGATCCttaCGAGCAGGTGCATTTGAACTC-3′) and pSE-Hsp33 as DNA template. The PCR fragment was cloned as an EcoRI-HindIII-digested fragment into pSE380ΔNcoI digested with the same enzymes. The p29SEN-derivatives containing either the yrfG hslR hslO or the hslR hslO operon were constructed using yrfG-For (5′-GAGAATTCCATATGCATATCAACATTGCCTG-3′) or hslR-For (5′-GAGAATTCCATATGAAAGAGAAACCTGCTGTTG-3′) forward primers, respectively. In this case, the primer Hsp33-rev was used as a reverse primer. To construct plasmid p29-EF-Tu, the 1185-bp long tufA gene, encoding EF-Tu, was PCR-amplified using primers tufA-for (5′-GAGAATTCATGTCTAAAGAAAAATTTGAAC-3′) and tufA-rev (5′-GAAAGCTTTTAGCCCAGAACTTTAGCAAC-3′) and MG1655 genomic DNA as template. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into p29SEN digested with the same enzymes. The toxin gene hipA (1323 bp) was PCR amplified using primers HipA-For (5′-GCGAATCCATGCCTAAACTTGTCACTTG-3′) and HipA-Rev (5′-GCGCATGCTCACTTACTACCGTATTCTC-3′) and MG1655 genomic DNA as template. The hipA gene was then cloned under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter as an EcoRI-SphI fragment into plasmid pBAD22 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pBAD-HipA. Note that hipA was cloned under the tightly regulated araBADp promoter to minimize the background expression level of HipA in the absence of inducer, thus avoiding killing by the toxin. All constructs generated by PCR were sequence verified. In vivo complementation of the temperature-sensitive phenotypes of MC4100 Δtig::CmR ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR, MC4100 Δtig dnaJ::Tn10–42, MC4100 Δtig Δlon dnaJ::Tn10–42, and MC4100 Δtig ΔhslO dnaJ::Tn10–42, was performed as follows. Cultures of fresh transformants were first grown overnight in LB ampicillin/glucose (0.4%) at the permissive temperature (see figure legends), diluted 1/50 into the same medium, further grown to mid-log phase, serially diluted 10-fold, and spotted on LB ampicillin agar plates with or without IPTG (at 5, 50, or 500 μm) and incubated at the indicated temperatures. Complementation of the W3110 ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR Δtig::CmR temperature-sensitive phenotype by HipA was carried out as described above, except that the l-arabinose inducer (0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2%) was used in this case. To monitor Hsp33 toxicity of the MC4100 and its mutant derivatives, mid-log phase cultures of fresh transformants were grown at the permissive growth temperature (22 or 30 °C; see figure legends) in LB ampicillin/glucose (0.4%), were serially diluted 10-fold and spotted on LB ampicillin agar plates with or without IPTG (100 or 500 μm), and incubated at the indicated temperatures. The co-transduction frequencies between ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR and the linked thr::TetR alleles were analyzed using bacteriophage P1-mediated transduction as described previously (9.Teter S.A. Houry W.A.

Cultures of fresh transformants of MC4100 ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR Δtig::CmR containing plasmids pSE380ΔNcoI, or pSE-Hsp33 wild type or its mutant derivatives were grown at 22 °C, diluted 1/50 and grown to an A600 of 0.3 in LB ampicillin (100 μg/ml), glucose (0.4%). IPTG inducer (0.5 mm) was added and cultures were further incubated for 2 h at 22 °C. Next, the cultures were transferred to a 37 °C water bath, and shaken (180 rpm) for 1 h, and protein aggregates were isolated as described by Tomoyasu and colleagues (28.Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Protein aggregates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–15% Mini-Protean TGX gels (Bio-Rad). For HipA-mediated suppression of protein aggregates, cultures of fresh transformants of W3110 ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR Δtig::CmS carrying plasmid pBAD22, or pBAD-HipA at 22 °C were diluted 1/50 and grown to an A600 of 0.3 in LB ampicillin (100 μg/ml). l-Arabinose inducer (0.5%) was then added and cell cultures were further incubated for 4 h at 22 °C. Cultures were then transferred to 37 °C in a water bath, shaken (180 rpm) for 1 h, and protein aggregates were prepared as described (28.Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B.

Propylthiouracil (PTU) is favored over methimazole (MMI) due to potential teratogenic concerns with MMI. This study was to determine the teratogenic potential of MMI and PTU using a validated Xenopus tropicalis embryo model. Embryos were exposed to 1 mM PTU (EC(50)=0.88 mM), 1 mM MMI, or vehicle control (water) from stages 2 to 45. Treated embryos were examined for gross morphological defects, ciliary function, and gene expression by in situ hybridization. Exposure to PTU, but not MMI, led to cardiac and gut looping defects and shortening along the anterior-posterior axis. PTU exposure during gastrulation (stage 8-12.5) was identified as the critical period of exposure leading to left-right (LR) patterning defects. Abnormal cilia polarization, abnormal cilia-driven leftward flow at the gastrocoel roof plate (GRP), and aberrant expression of both Coco and Pitx2c were associated with abnormal LR symmetry observed following PTU exposure. PTU is teratogenic during late blastula, gastrulation, and neurulation; whereas MMI is not. PTU alters ciliary-driven flow and disrupts the normal genetic program involved in LR axis determination. These studies have important implications for women taking PTU during early pregnancy."

Echocardiographic analysis and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area measurements show that α-Tm S283A TG mice exhibit a hypertrophic phenotype at basal levels. Interestingly, there are no alterations in cardiac function, myofilament calcium (Ca2+) sensitivity, cooperativity, or response to β-adrenergic stimulus.

In recent years in vivo studies performed on animal models indicate that changes in the phosphorylation status of sarcomeric proteins such as troponin I (TnI), myosin binding protein C (MyBPC), and the regulatory myosin light chain result in alterations in Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilament and changes in cardiac function and may play a role in the development of cardiac disease (11.Sadayappan S.

Investigation of a dilated cardiomyopathy transgenic (TG) mouse model bearing a human α-Tm mutation (E54K) shows that phosphorylation levels of Tm decrease relative to non-transgenic (NTG) littermates (16.Rajan S.

Additionally, phosphorylation is increased in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy α-Tm N175D mice generated by this laboratory indicating a link between striated muscle Tm phosphorylation, sarcomeric function, and cardiac disease (18.Muthuchamy M.

Sheikh and D. F. Wieczorek, unpublished information. To investigate the in vivo effect of decreased or ablated Tm phosphorylation, we substituted serine 283 with an alanine (S283A), removing the phosphorylation site and effectively inhibiting the ability of α-Tm to be phosphorylated. Several TG mouse lines expressing this α-Tm S283A mutation were generated and analyzed. These TG hearts show no changes in functional parameters when investigated by echocardiography, myofilament Ca2+-tension relations, or in studies of work-performing heart during β-adrenergic stimulus. However, these animals do have sex-specific differences in heart morphology likely due to the cardioprotective effects of estrogen that have been described previously (19.Haines C.D. Harvey P.A. Leinwand L.A. Estrogens mediate cardiac hypertrophy in a stimulus-dependent manner.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 4480-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20.Donaldson C. Eder S. Baker C.

Res. 2009; 104 (11 p. following 275): 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Male TG mice show a hypertrophic phenotype as measured by echocardiography and supported by cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area measurements, whereas female mice do not. Male TG mice also show significant modifications in proteins controlling Ca2+ fluxes such as increases in the expression of the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) and phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN). Thus, phosphorylation of α-Tm may be part of a signaling cascade that results in changes in Ca2+ handling protein levels and may explain the tight regulation of α-Tm phosphorylation levels. Additionally, when male TG animals are subject to pressure overload via transaortic constriction (TAC), they exhibit a significant increase in hypertrophy as well as functional defects including a striking decrease in fractional shortening compared with NTG litter mates. This is the first investigation to show that alterations in the phosphorylation status of a thin filament protein, namely α-Tm, can cause a moderate hypertrophic response and increase SERCA2a expression and PLN phosphorylation. Taken with our previous findings in cardiomyopathy models, these results firmly establish that α-Tm phosphorylation is necessary for an appropriate response during cardiac disease. Mouse striated muscle α-Tm cDNA was subjected to QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) utilizing the primer 5′-CAC GCT CTC AAC GAT ATG ACT GCC ATA TAA GTT TCT TTG CTT CAC-3′ mutating the penultimate serine to an alanine. The mutation was verified through sequencing of the construct by Genewiz. The α-Tm S283A construct was then cloned into a vector containing the α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter and a human growth hormone 3′-UTR and poly-A tail sequence (21.Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. Tissue-specific regulation of the α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated using the FVB/N strain as previously described (22.Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. Molecular and physiological effects of overexpressing striated muscle β-tropomyosin in the adult murine heart.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Founder mice were identified using PCR. Copy number was determined using genomic Southern blot analysis. Nucleotide sequencing of TG mouse DNA verified the sequence of the α-Tm S283A transgene. DNA samples were obtained from 14-day-old mice, and PCR was utilized to determine which animals carried the transgene. Primers specific for the transgene are α-MHC forward 5′-GCC CAC ACC AGA AAT GAC AGA-3′ and α-Tm reverse 5′-TCC AGT TCA TCT TCA GTG CCC-3′. GAPDH is used as an internal control, and primers are as follows: GAPDH forward 5′-AGC GAG CTC AGG ACA TTC TGG-3′ and GAPDH reverse 5′ - CTC CTA ACC ACG CTC CTA GCA-3′. Myofibrillar proteins were extracted from NTG and TG male mouse ventricles as previously described (22.Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. Molecular and physiological effects of overexpressing striated muscle β-tropomyosin in the adult murine heart.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 30 μg of the myofibrillar protein preparations were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The Tm band was excised from the gel, reduced, alkylated, and subject to a tryptic digest. Recovered peptides were desalted with a μ-C18 ZipTip and spotted onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) target plate. All spectra were acquired in reflector positive ion mode on an ABSciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument. The percentage TG protein was calculated after normalization and subtraction of background contributions. Western blot analyses on myofibrillar protein preparations (4 μg) from 3-month male NTG and TG hearts were conducted using the Tm-specific antibody CH1 (Sigma), Tm Ser-283 phosphorylation-specific antibody generated for this laboratory (YenZyme), and sarcomeric α-actin antibody 5c5 (Sigma) as a loading control. To confirm the mutant Tm was properly assembled into the sarcomere, cytoplasmic protein fractions (4 μg) isolated from 3-month male NTG and TG male mice, were examined by Western blot analyses. Whole ventricular homogenates from 3-month-old male NTG and TG mice were utilized to visualize Ca2+ handling protein expression levels. Western blots were used to visualize sarcoplasmic ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) (AbCam), TnI (Cell Signaling), pTnI23/24 (Cell Signaling), PLN (Thermo Scientific), phosphorylated serine 16 PLN (PLN Ser-16) (Badrilla), phosphorylated PLN threonine 17 (PLN Thr-17) (Badrilla), and calcineurin (CnA) (Sigma). Sarcomeric actin (Sigma) was used as a loading control. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-PAGE was performed on mouse hearts as previously described with modifications (17.Warren C.M. Arteaga G.M. Rajan S. Ahmed R.P. Wieczorek D.F. Solaro R.J. Use of two-dimensional DIGE analysis reveals altered phosphorylation in a tropomyosin mutant (E54K) linked to dilated cardiomyopathy.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3 μg of myofibrillar preparations were resolved on a 24-cm 4.0–5.0 immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing strip. After isoelectric focusing, the samples were resolved in the second dimension on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Tm muscle-specific antibody CH1 was used to visualize both the unphosphorylated Tm and phosphorylated Tm species. Percentage of Tm phosphorylation was calculated as: (phosphorylated Tm)/(phosphorylated Tm + nonphosphorylated Tm) × 100, where the values for the two protein species have been determined using Image Quant v5.1. Male mouse hearts at 3, 6, and 9 months were analyzed. Heart weight to body weight ratios were calculated to evaluate for the presence of cardiac hypertrophy. For histological analyses, the hearts were stained with hematoxylin/eosin or Masson's Trichrome and evaluated for the presence of necrosis, fibrosis, myocyte disarray, and calcification. Images were taken on a Nikon SM2–2T dissecting microscope and an Olympus BX4C compound microscope. To quantify changes in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, tissue sections were stained with wheat germ agglutinin from Triticum vulgaris conjugated with Texas Red (Sigma) to visualize cardiomyocyte membranes. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei of cardiomyocytes. Randomized images of the left ventricular free wall were taken using a fluorescent camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop, and the cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was measured using ImageJ (NIH). RNA isolated from 3-month-old NTG and TG male mouse ventricular tissue was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was performed using an Opticon 2 real time RT-PCR machine (MJ Research). Each sample was measured in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated twice. Target mRNA was normalized to GAPDH expression as described by Pfaffl (23.Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25413) Google Scholar). Echocardiographic measurements were performed utilizing a 30-MHz high resolution transducer (Vevo 770 high resolution imaging system) after anesthetization of 3-month-old mice as previously described (24.Rajan S. Jagatheesan G. Karam C.N. Alves M.L. Bodi I. Schwartz A. Bulcao C.F. D'Souza K.M. Akhter S.A. Boivin G.P. Dube D.K. Petrashevskaya N. Herr A.B. Hullin R. Liggett S.B. Wolska B.M. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Molecular and functional characterization of a novel cardiac-specific human tropomyosin isoform.Circulation. 2010; 121: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Echocardiographic dimensions and thicknesses were taken from two-dimensional guided M-Mode from the parasternal long axis view in triplicate on NTG and TG 12–16-week-old mice. Fractional shortening (in %) was obtained by the formula 100 × (LVIDd − LVIDs)/LVIDd, where LVIDd and LVIDs are left ventricular (LV) internal dimensions in diastole and systole, respectively. The relative wall thickness indices were calculated by the formula (LVAW + LVPW)/LVIDd, where LVAW and LVPW indicate anterior and posterior wall thicknesses, respectively, and LVIDd is the LV diastolic internal dimension. The LV outflow tract (LVOT) diameter (D) was measured to calculate the LVOT cross-sectional area (LVOT CSA = π(D/2)2). The velocity-time integral (VTI, in cm) was calculated by integrating the Doppler velocities in the LVOT. The product LVOT CSA × VTI is the LV stroke volume, which multiplied by heart rate gives us the cardiac output (ml/min). 12–16-Week-old male mice of both genotypes were subject to TAC or sham operation as previously described (25.Nakayama H. Bodi I. Correll R.N. Chen X. Lorenz J. Houser S.R. Robbins J. Schwartz A. Molkentin J.D. α1G-dependent T-type Ca2+ current antagonizes cardiac hypertrophy through a NOS3-dependent mechanism in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Echocardiographic measurements were taken in M-Mode. Because only male TG mice exhibit changes in echocardiographic measurements, only male animals are used in this study. Pressure gradients across the constriction were measured using Doppler echocardiography as previously described (25.Nakayama H. Bodi I. Correll R.N. Chen X. Lorenz J. Houser S.R. Robbins J. Schwartz A. Molkentin J.D. α1G-dependent T-type Ca2+ current antagonizes cardiac hypertrophy through a NOS3-dependent mechanism in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two weeks post-surgery, mice were again subject to echocardiography and sacrificed. Calcineurin activity (CnA), also known as protein phosphatase 2B, was measured using a calcineurin/protein phosphatase 2B activity kit (Calbiochem). Cardiac homogenates from 3-month-old male NTG and TG hearts were used. CnA activity is measured as the rate of dephosphorylation of a synthetic peptide in the presence and absence of EGTA, okadaic acid, and EGTA with okadaic acid. Phosphate release was measured by the colorimetric Green Reagent (Calbiochem). Fiber bundles from papillary muscles of 5-month-old male NTG and TG hearts were detergent-extracted in high relaxing buffer as described previously (26.Wolska B.M. Keller R.S. Evans C.C. Palmiter K.A. Phillips R.M. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Correlation between myofilament response to Ca2+ and altered dynamics of contraction and relaxation in transgenic cardiac cells that express β-tropomyosin.Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and mounted between a force transducer and a micromanipulator. The sarcomeric length was adjusted to 2.0 and 2.2 μm using laser diffraction patterns, and isometric tension was measured. Fiber bundles were then subjected to sequential Ca2+ solutions (pCa), and isometric tension was again measured. All experiments were carried out at 22 °C. Three-month-old male NTG and TG were anesthetized and treated with heparin to prevent microthrombi as previously described (27.Liao S. Porter D. Scott A. Newman G. Doetschman T. Schultz Jel J. The cardioprotective effect of the low molecular weight isoform of fibroblast growth factor-2. The role of JNK signaling.J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 42: 106-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The aorta was cannulated, preserving the aortic valve and the coronary artery. To measure intraventricular systolic and diastolic pressures, an intraventricular catheter was inserted into the left ventricle. A cannula was also inserted into the left pulmonary vein, allowing the direction of the perfusate to be switched from retrograde (Langendorff) to anteriograde (working). COBE pressure transducers were utilized to measure aortic pressure, atrial pressure, and left ventricular pressure and were recorded using a Grass polygraph and digital acquisition system. All statistics are presented as the mean ± S.E. Where appropriate, paired and unpaired t tests, analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction, and analysis of variance with repeated measures were used to detect significance. Significance was set at p < 0.05. To determine the functional significance of Tm phosphorylation, we generated TG mice in which the Tm phosphorylation site (serine residue 283) was replaced with a non-phosphorylatable alanine residue (S283A). The transgene construct used to generate α-Tm S283A TG mice is shown in Fig. 1A. Multiple TG lines were generated and studied. Line 2 has the highest TG mRNA expression and the second highest copy number of all transgenic animals generated (17 copies) determined by genomic Southern blot analysis. Forward and reverse sequencing of the construct indicates no mutations or deletions in the transgene. Often, mutations in Tm isoforms lead to differential migration on SDS-PAGE gels (16.Rajan S.

However, because serine is only 16 daltons larger than alanine and has nearly an identical isoelectric point, expression levels of TG and endogenous protein cannot be separated using traditional methods. Instead, myofibrillar protein preparations of age-matched NTG and TG mouse hearts as well as recombinantly expressed NTG or TG protein are resolved by a combination of SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analyses (Fig. 1B). The ratio of serine containing peptides (endogenous Tm) and alanine containing peptides (TG Tm) is calculated after normalization and background subtraction. As an additional control, the peptides corresponding to both the serine and alanine profiles are further fractionated to ensure that the proper tryptic peptide is being analyzed. Line 2 has ∼93.7% TG protein expression, Line 25 has ∼86% TG protein expression, and Line 97 has ∼88% TG protein expression (Fig. 1C), with a concomitant decrease in NTG protein, maintaining total Tm levels at 100%. Investigation of the cytosolic fraction shows no significant accumulation of either endogenous or TG Tm, indicating that the TG protein is properly incorporated into the myofibril (data not shown). Additionally, myofibrillar protein preparations run on an SDS-PAGE gel show that all myofibrillar proteins are present in the proper ratio in all three TG lines, indicating that the myofibrils are being properly assembled and there is no change in total Tm levels (data not shown). To study Tm phosphorylation in TG mice, it was necessary to establish the basal level of Tm phosphorylation in NTG hearts using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing-PAGE. Results show that an unphosphorylated and a single-phosphorylated species of Tm appears in NTG heart samples (Fig. 2A). Upon calf intestinal phosphatase treatment, the phosphorylated Tm protein species is lost. These results are in agreement with previously published studies that identify Ser-283 as the phosphorylation site in striated muscle Tm (1.Mak A. Smillie L.B. Bárány M.

Further analysis shows a trend of decreasing Tm phosphorylation from 6 weeks to 5 months of age with an average of ∼30%. At 15 months of age, animals show a significant increase in Tm phosphorylation, indicating a possible return to fetal gene programs due to senescence (Fig. 2B) (29.Ball K.L. Solaro R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2059917315,"Neuregulin (NRG; heregulin) is overexpressed in ∼30% of breast cancers and mediates various processes involved in tumor progression, including tumor cell migration and invasion. Here, we show that NRG mediates its effects on tumor cell migration via PKD1. Downstream of RhoA, PKD1 can prevent directed cell migration through phosphorylation of its substrate SSH1L. NRG exerts its inhibitory effects on PKD1 through Rac1/NADPH oxidase, leading to decreased PKD1 activation loop phosphorylation and decreased activity toward SSH1L. The consequence of PKD1 inhibition by NRG is decreased binding of 14-3-3 to SSH1L, localization of SSH1L to F-actin at the leading edge, and increased cofilin activity, resulting in increased reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. Our data provide a mechanism through which the Rho GTPase Rac1 cross-talks with PKD1 signaling pathways to facilitate directed cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2067877749,"In response to ionizing radiation, the MRE11/RAD50/NBN complex re-distributes to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) where each of its individual components is phosphorylated by the serine–threonine kinase, ATM. ATM phosphorylation of NBN is required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint, but the mechanism whereby these phosphorylation events signal the checkpoint machinery remains unexplained. Here, we describe the use of direct protein transduction of the homing endonuclease, I-PpoI, into human cells to generate site-specific DSBs. Direct transduction of I-PpoI protein results in rapid accumulation and turnover of the endonuclease in live cells, facilitating comparisons across multiple cell lines. We demonstrate the utility of this system by introducing I-PpoI into isogenic cell lines carrying mutations at the ATM phosphorylation sites in NBN and assaying the effects of these mutations on the spatial distribution and temporal accumulation of NBN and ATM at DSBs by chromatin immunoprecipitation, as well as timing and extent of DSB repair. Although the spatial distribution of NBN and ATM recruited to the sites of DSBs was comparable between control cells and those expressing phosphorylation mutants of NBN, the timing of accumulation of NBN and ATM was altered. Serine-to-alanine mutations that blocked phosphorylation resulted in delayed recruitment of both NBN and ATM to DSBs. Serine-to-glutamic acid substitutions that mimicked the phosphorylation event resulted in both increased and prolonged accumulation of both NBN and ATM at DSBs. The repair of DSBs in cells lacking full-length NBN was significantly delayed compared with control cells, whereas blocking phosphorylation of NBN resulted in a more modest delay in repair. These data indicate that following the induction of DSBs, phosphorylation of NBN regulates its accumulation, and that of ATM, at sites of DNA DSB as well as the timing of the repair of these sites."
https://openalex.org/W2088786304,"We have recently identified apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), tumor-susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) as novel coactivators of the androgen receptor (AR). The mechanisms of coactivation remained obscure, however. Here we investigated the interplay and interdependence between these coactivators and the AR using the endogenous prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene as model for AR-target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with siRNA-mediated knockdown revealed that recruitment of AATF and ZIPK to the PSA enhancer was dependent on AR, whereas recruitment of TSG101 was dependent on AATF. Association of AR and its coactivators with the PSA enhancer or promoter occurred in cycles. Dissociation of AR-transcription complexes was due to degradation because inhibition of the proteasome system by MG132 caused accumulation of AR at enhancer/promoter elements. Moreover, inhibition of degradation strongly reduced transcription, indicating that continued and efficient transcription is based on initiation, degradation and reinitiation cycles. Interestingly, knockdown of ZIPK by siRNA had a similar effect as MG132, leading to reduced transcription but enhanced accumulation of AR at androgen-response elements. In addition, knockdown of ZIPK, as well as overexpression of a dominant-negative ZIPK mutant, diminished polyubiquitination of AR. Furthermore, ZIPK cooperated with the E3 ligase Mdm2 in AR-dependent transactivation, assembled into a single complex on chromatin and phosphorylated Mdm2 in vitro. These results suggest that ZIPK has a crucial role in regulation of ubiquitination and degradation of the AR, and hence promoter clearance and efficient transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2111303385,"Most chemotherapeutic agents are blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeants. HIV-1-derived TAT protein variants contain a transmembrane domain, which may enable them to cross the BBB and reach the brain. Here we synthesized CAYGRKKRRQRRR, a peptide containing a cysteine moiety attached to the N terminus of the transmembrane domain (C-TAT peptide), and studied its effects in an in vitro BBB model, which we found to reflect penetration by a receptor-independent pathway. Incubation of the brain capillary endothelial cell monolayer with 0.3-0.6 μmol/ml of this C-TAT peptide, for a period of 1-2 h, destabilizes brain capillary endothelial cell monolayer and introduces the ability of impermeant therapeutic agents including high molecular weight proteins to penetrate it substantially. The cysteinyl moiety at position 1 of the C-TAT peptide contributes largely to the destabilizing potency and the penetration efficacy of impermeant substances. The destabilizing effect was reversed using heparin. In summary, experimental conditions allowing a significant increase in entry of impermeant low and high molecular weight substances from the luminal (blood) to the abluminal side (brain) were found in an in vitro BBB model reflecting in vivo protein penetrability by a receptor-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2159445349,"This paper presents the structure of MsAcg (MSMEG_5246), a Mycobacterium smegmatis homologue of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Acg (Rv2032) in its reduced form at 1.6 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Rv2032 is one of the most induced genes under the hypoxic model of tuberculosis dormancy. The Acg family turns out to be unusual flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding proteins that have probably arisen by gene duplication and fusion from a classical homodimeric nitroreductase such that the monomeric protein resembles a classical nitroreductase dimer but with one active site deleted and the other active site covered by a unique lid. The FMN cofactor is not reduced by either NADH or NADPH, but the chemically reduced enzyme is capable of reduction of nitro substrates, albeit at no kinetic advantage over free FMN. The reduced enzyme is rapidly oxidized by oxygen but without any evidence for a radical state commonly seen in oxygen-sensitive nitroreductases. The presence of the unique lid domain, the lack of reduction by NAD(P)H, and the slow rate of reaction of the chemically reduced protein raises a possible alternative function of Acg proteins in FMN storage or sequestration from other biochemical pathways as part of the bacteria's adaptation to a dormancy state.

The Acg family turns out to be unusual flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding proteins that have probably arisen by gene duplication and fusion from a classical homodimeric nitroreductase such that the monomeric protein resembles a classical nitroreductase dimer but with one active site deleted and the other active site covered by a unique lid. The FMN cofactor is not reduced by either NADH or NADPH, but the chemically reduced enzyme is capable of reduction of nitro substrates, albeit at no kinetic advantage over free FMN. The reduced enzyme is rapidly oxidized by oxygen but without any evidence for a radical state commonly seen in oxygen-sensitive nitroreductases. The presence of the unique lid domain, the lack of reduction by NAD(P)H, and the slow rate of reaction of the chemically reduced protein raises a possible alternative function of Acg proteins in FMN storage or sequestration from other biochemical pathways as part of the bacteria's adaptation to a dormancy state. In the 21st century, tuberculosis remains a major burden to the world, causing around 1.4 million deaths and about 8.8 million new cases worldwide in 2010. The disease is deeply associated with poverty, and thus the developing world bears the bulk (95%) of the victims (1World Health Organization (2011) 2011/2012 Tuberculosis Global Facts,Google Scholar). It is estimated that a third of the world population is infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Among the carriers of M. tuberculosis, 5–10% will develop active tuberculosis during their life time (2.Parrish N.M. Dick J.D. Bishai W.R. Mechanisms of latency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), whereas the rest will remain in the latent phase of the disease. Thus, understanding the physiological state of the bacteria during this latency is of critical interest for the fight against tuberculosis. A particular problem is that bacteria in the dormant phase are far less sensitive to antibiotics, which means a long course of antibiotic treatment is required (3.Hu Y. Coates A.R.M. Coates A.R.M. Dormancy and Low Growth States in Microbial Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2003: 181-207Google Scholar). The exact nature of the dormant state within the lungs is hard to probe. A generally accepted laboratory model of dormancy, the Wayne model, is induced by hypoxia (4.Wayne L.G. Sohaskey C.D. Nonreplicating persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Expression studies show that the cells adapt to hypoxia due to a two-component regulatory system (2CR) 3The abbreviations used are:2CRtwo component regulatoracgα-crystalline co-regulated gene (Rv2032)MSmass spectrometryMsAcg MSMEG_5246a M. smegmatis homologue of acg, RvXXXX, gene number XXXX in the M. tuberculosis genomer.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. called dosRS (5.Sherman D.R.

The dosRS 2CR controls the transcription of a regulon formed of around 50 genes induced under hypoxia (5.Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K.

Schoolnik G.K. Inhibition of respiration by nitric oxide induces a Mycobacterium tuberculosis dormancy program.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Other conditions that trigger the dosRS regulon in vitro include S-nitrosoglutathione (8.Kendall S.L. Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C. Wernisch L. Parish T. Duncan K. Betts J.C. Stoker N.G. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis dosRS two-component system is induced by multiple stresses.Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and carbon monoxide (9.Kumar A.

Among the 50 genes under the control of dosRS 2CR, few are of known function, making it difficult to understand the physiological outcome of the induction of the regulon. The most highly induced protein by the dosRS 2CR is Acr1 (Rv2031), which was previously shown to be the most abundant protein in dormant cells and to be essential for growth of the bacteria in macrophages (11.Yuan Y. Crane D.D. Barry 3rd., C.E. Stationary phase-associated protein expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Function of the mycobacterial α-crystallin homolog.J.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9578-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) while being induced by hypoxia or nitric oxide exposure. Acr1 (α-crystallin 1) is a small heat shock protein that forms a tetrahedral dodecamer (13.Kennaway C.K. Benesch J.L. Gohlke U. Wang L. Robinson C.V. Orlova E.V. Saibil H.R. Saibi H.R. Keep N.H.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), one of two small heat shock proteins in M. tuberculosis. Small heat shock proteins bind to partially unfolded proteins in vitro and prevent aggregation (14.Basha E. O'Neill H. Vierling E. Small heat shock proteins and α-crystallins. Dynamic proteins with flexible functions.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 106-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The best studied example of a small heat shock protein is α-crystallin, which is proposed to prevent formation of cataract in the eye lens, where the cells do not undergo further protein synthesis or division after birth (15.Horwitz J. α-Crystallin.Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Deletion of Acr1 led to an attenuated phenotype in macrophage infection model (12.Yuan Y. Crane D.D. Simpson R.M. Zhu Y.Q. Hickey M.J. Sherman D.R. Barry 3rd., C.E. The 16-kDa α-crystallin (Acr) protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required for growth in macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9578-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), whereas another study reported that the deletion of Acr1 induces a faster growth of the M. tuberculosis in macrophages and in mice (16.Hu Y. Movahedzadeh F. Stoker N.G. Coates A.R. Deletion of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis α-crystallin-like hspX gene causes increased bacterial growth in vivo.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The discrepancy is due to differences in the knock-out strategy. A study of the promoter region of acr1 by Purkayastha et al. (17.Purkayastha A. McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Identification of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis putative classical nitroreductase gene whose expression is coregulated with that of the acr gene within macrophages, in standing versus shaking cultures, and under low oxygen conditions.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1518-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that the divergently transcribed genes acr1 and Rv2032 are co-regulated under hypoxic conditions but also inside macrophages and led to the renaming of Rv2032 as acg (acr co-regulated gene). The authors tentatively annotated Acg (the product of acg) as an unusual member of the classical nitroreductase family (Pfam ID PF00881). Acg, which is 331 amino acids long, is somewhat larger than the classical nitroreductases, which are around 220 amino acids long. There are two additional paralogues of Acg in the M. tuberculosis genome Rv3127 and Rv3131, all of which are controlled by the dosRS 2CR (8.Kendall S.L. Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C. Wernisch L. Parish T. Duncan K. Betts J.C. Stoker N.G. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis dosRS two-component system is induced by multiple stresses.Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18.Chauhan S. Sharma D. Singh A.

Nitroreductases are broad substrate range enzymes that utilize FMN as co-factor, are homodimers, and use NAD(P)H as the source of reducing power. They catalyze the reduction of nitro compounds to hydroxylamino or amino forms. They are found in all kingdoms and are present in higher eukaryotes. The physiological role of nitroreductases is unclear (19.Roldán M.D. Pérez-Reinado E. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Reduction of polynitroaromatic compounds. The bacterial nitroreductases.FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008; 32: 474-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar); in some cases they are involved in catabolism of xenobiotics such as trinitrotoluene or in activation or deactivation of drugs, but these compounds are of recent origin, and therefore, this is unlikely to be the role for which these proteins originally evolved. Two classes of enzyme can be identified depending on the reduction mechanism: type I, oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases, and type II, oxygen-sensitive nitroreductases. The oxygen-insensitive enzyme catalyze the reduction of the nitro group by a direct two electron transfer, whereas the oxygen-sensitive enzyme catalyze the reduction through a one-electron transfer and the formation of a nitro anion radical before a second one-electron transfer to yield the product. However, in the presence of oxygen the nitro anion radical can be reoxidized to the nitro compound in a futile cycle that utilizes reducing power, generates superoxide anions and does not yield reduced substrate. The most studied class, the type I is further divided in two groups, A and B, depending on their usage of only NADPH or either NADPH or NADH, respectively, but all follow a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism (19.Roldán M.D. Pérez-Reinado E. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Reduction of polynitroaromatic compounds. The bacterial nitroreductases.FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008; 32: 474-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Homologues of Acg are largely restricted to Actinomyces but are also found in some Burkholderia species. Three of the six putative nitroreductases in M. tuberculosis belong to the Acg family. The other three are a classical nitroreductase (Rv3368), Rv0306, a bluB gene involved in dimethybenzimidazole biosynthesis, and Rv3262, a γ-glutamyl ligase involved in F420 biosynthesis. In this paper we present the structure of the first member of the Acg family of proteins in its reduced state, which gives insight into the role of these proteins in dormant tuberculosis. The genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis were kindly provided by Prof. Neil Stoker at the Royal Veterinary College, London, UK and by Dr. Sanjib Bhakta at Birkbeck, University of London, London, UK, respectively. The genes were cloned in pNIC28-Bsa4 using the ligation-independent cloning strategy developed at the Structural Genomic Consortium, Oxford, UK by Dr. Opher Gileadi (20.Savitsky P. Bray J. Cooper C.D. Marsden B.D. Mahajan P. Burgess-Brown N.A. Gileadi O. High-throughput production of human proteins for crystallization. The SGC experience.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 172: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The MSMEG_5246 gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers designed using the gene sequence from the M. smegmatis MC2-155 genome (GenBankTM accessions number ABK74735.1) flanked with the ligation-independent cloning forward and reverse sequences, respectively, 5′-tacttccaatccATGTCCGACACCAGGCTCGACG-3′ and 5′-tatccacctttactgTCAACTCCTCGGGCGAACTTCG-3′. The Rv2032 (Acg) gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers designed using the gene sequence from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome (GenBankTM CAA17246.1) flanked with the ligation-independent cloning forward and reverse sequences respectively, 5′-tacttccaatccATGCCGGACACCATGGTG-3′ and 5′-tatccacctttactgCTACCGGTGATCCTTAGCCCGA-3′. The cloned sequences were verified by sequencing. The pNIC28-Bsa4-MSMEG_5246 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta2(DE3) strain (Novagen), and the cells were grown in ZYM5052 auto-inducing medium (21.Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 3 h followed by 24 h at 25 °C. The selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced in glucose-free selenomethionine medium (AthenaES) supplemented with 5 g/liter glycerol, 0.5 g/liter glucose, and 2 g/liter lactose to obtain an auto-inducing medium and 80 mg/liter selenomethionine for labeling. 6.4 mg/liter methionine and 100 nm of vitamin B12 were also added to the medium to help repress the biosynthesis of methionine (21.Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide before 0.5 mg of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and 1.5 mg of lysozyme (Sigma) per 50 ml of cell suspension were added along with 1 mm PMSF and 1 tablet of cOmplete EDTA free protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). The cells were broken by sonication on ice. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 48,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The cleared lysate was then applied to a XK 16/20 column (GE Healthcare) filled with 25 ml of nickel immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm sodium chloride, 25 mm imidazole, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. After extensive washing the bound protein was eluted in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm sodium chloride, 300 mm imidazole, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mg of tobacco etch virus protease per 5 ml of eluted fraction were added and the sample dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The untagged protein was then applied to an anion exchange HiLoad 26/10 Q Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator with a cutoff of 10 kDa (Sartorius) and loaded on a gel filtration HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Finally, the purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml based on the extinction coefficient at 450 nm of 12,700 liter/cm/mol before being aliquoted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and store at −80 °C. The quality and oligomeric state of the purified protein was assessed by a combination of analytical gel filtration, SDS-PAGE stained by Coomassie blue based stain, and analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments as well as 1H NMR to assess the proper folding of the sample. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out on a ProteomeLabTM XLI analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with an An-60 Ti rotor using 2-channel centerpieces and sapphire windows at 60,000 r.p.m. Scans were recorded at 20 °C in absorbance mode at 280 and 450 nm as well as in interference mode. The protein samples were in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl at 45, 23, and 4.3 μm. Protein partial specific volume and buffer density and viscosity were calculated using SEDNTERP. The experimental data were analyzed using Sedfit by fitting to the c(s) with one discrete component model with MsAcg. MsAcg was subjected to limited proteolysis by chymotrypsin for 4 h at 22 °C at 1.2 mg/ml protein and a protease ration of 1:2000 (w/w). The reaction was stopped by the addition of PMSF, and the sample was applied on an analytical gel filtration column for purification and analysis. Mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a Synapt HDMS (Waters Ltd, Manchester, UK) mass spectrometer (22.Pringle S.D. Giles K. Wildgoose J.L. Williams J.P. Slade S.E. Thalassinos K. Bateman R.H. Bowers M.T. Scrivens J.H. An investigation of the mobility separation of some peptide and protein ions using a new hybrid quadrupole/travelling wave IMS/oa-ToF instrument.Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 261: 1-12Crossref Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The instrument was mass-calibrated using a 33 μm solution of caesium iodide in 250 mm ammonium acetate. 20 μm MsAcg sample was buffer-exchanged into 250 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, using Biospin-6 columns (Bio-Rad) before being delivered to the mass spectrometer by means of nanoelectrospray ionization using gold-coated capillaries prepared in house. Typical instrumental parameters for native MS were as follows: source pressure 5 mbar, capillary voltage 1.0 kV, cone voltage 50 V, trap energy 8 V, transfer energy 6 V, bias voltage 5 V, and trap pressure 3.6 × 10−2 mbar. For tandem MS, trap energy was increased to 80 V, with all other parameters unchanged. Data acquisition and processing were carried out using MassLynx (Version 4.1) software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Mass assignment was achieved by the method described in Tito et al. (23.Tito M.A. Tars K. Valegard K. Hajdu J. Robinson C.V. Electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the intact MS2 virus capsid.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3550-3551Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The crystallization trials were carried out with an Oryx Nano crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments) contained within in an anaerobic chamber (Coy) with a 95% nitrogen, 5% hydrogen atmosphere in the laboratory of Prof. Holger Dobbek at Humbolt-Universität zu Berlin. Sitting drop vapor diffusion trials were set up with 200 nl of protein + 200 nl of reservoir solution drops in MRC 2 sub-well plates using 80 μl of reservoir solution. The protein was kept reduced by the addition of 5 mm dithionite to the protein and the reservoir solution before setting up the crystallization trays. The first crystals were obtained with the Morpheus screen (Molecular Dimension) (24.Gorrec F. The MORPHEUS protein crystallization screen.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) after 3–4 weeks in 0.1 m MES/imidazole, pH 6.5, 10% (w/v) PEG 20,000, 20% (v/v) PEG MME 550 with the halide, alcohol, ethylene glycol, amino acid, and carboxylic acid mixes. Final selenomethionine-labeled protein crystals were obtained after optimization in 0.1 m MES/imidazole, pH 6.5, 30% (v/v) PEG MME 550, 0.02 m sodium formate, 0.02 m ammonium acetate, 0.02 m trisodium citrate, 0.02 m sodium potassium dl-tartrate, and 0.02 m sodium oxamate reduced by 50 mm dithionite. No oxamate was present in the higher resolution dataset. The crystals were cryopreserved for data collection in the same buffer as the crystallization conditions with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. A native protein data set at 2.2 Å and selenomethionine-labeled protein data sets at 2.4 and 1.6 Å resolution were collected on BL 14.1 or 14.2 at the BESSY II synchrotron operated by Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin für Materialen und Energie (25.Mueller U.

We previously found that overexpression of PDI in rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells suppresses 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3)-stimulated growth hormone (GH) expression, suggesting the contribution of PDI to the T3-mediated gene expression via thyroid hormone receptor (TR). In the present study, we have clarified the mechanism of regulation by which TR function is regulated by PDI.

PDI interacts with nascent and misfolded proteins and catalyzes the formation, reduction, or isomerization of disulfide bonds in proteins. PDI acts not only as a folding catalyst but also as a regulator of protein functions by changing the redox state of proteins.

The catalytic active site of PDI contains two CGHC sequences, and cysteine residues are required to catalyze the thiol-disulfide exchange. PDI consists of a, b, b′, and a′ domains and a C-terminal tail, c (14Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Defining the domain boundaries of the human protein disulfide isomerases.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The a and a′ domains contain the catalytic active site, and the b and b′ domains are catalytically inactive. The b′ domain has the principal peptide-binding site that is important for substrate recognition (15Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. The b′ domain provides the principal peptide-binding site of protein disulfide isomerase but all domains contribute to binding of misfolded proteins.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PDI is also known to bind protein to thyroid hormone (3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3)) or estrogen (16Obata T. Kitagawa S. Gong Q.H. Pastan I. Cheng S.Y. Thyroid hormone down-regulates p55, a thyroid hormone-binding protein that is homologous to protein disulfide isomerase and the β-subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase.J. Biol.

Hormone binding by protein disulfide isomerase, a high capacity hormone reservoir of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The affinity of PDI for T3 is reported to be 4.3 μm, which is considerably higher than that of thyroid hormone receptors (18Primm T.P. Gilbert H.F. Hormone binding by protein disulfide isomerase, a high capacity hormone reservoir of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, PDI is considered to act as a buffer of hormones via its high capacity and low affinity hormone-binding sites. Recently, PDIp, which is mainly localized in the pancreas, was also reported to bind estrogen (19Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Langenbuch M. Lan M.S. Robinson G.K. Ruddock L.W. The pancreas-specific protein disulphide-isomerase PDIp interacts with a hydroxyaryl group in ligands.Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Fu X.M. Zhu B.T.

Biol. 2009; 115: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PDIp is considered to serve as an effective modulator of the cellular levels and biological actions of endogenous estrogens (20Fu X.M. Zhu B.T. Human pancreas-specific protein disulfide isomerase homolog (PDIp) is an intracellular estrogen-binding protein that modulates estrogen levels and actions in target cells.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2009; 115: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that bisphenol A (BPA), which is known as an endocrine disrupting chemical, also binds to PDI. T3 and BPA competitively bind to PDI, and both bind to PDI via the hydroxyl group(s) of the benzene ring(s) (21Okada K. Hiroi T. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Inhibitory effects of environmental chemicals on protein disulfide isomerase in vitro.Osaka City Med. J. 2005; 51: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hashimoto S. Okada K. Imaoka S.

Biochem. 2008; 144: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We also identified the T3/BPA-binding site of PDI. T3 binds to the a and b′ domains, and to inhibit the isomerase activity of PDI, the target of T3 is the b′ domain (23Hashimoto S. Shiomoto K. Okada K. Imaoka S. The binding site of bisphenol A to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).J. Biochem. 2012; 151: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also investigated the contribution of PDI to the T3 response in rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells. GH3 cells are widely used to study the molecular basis of the activities of thyroid hormone (24Hohenwarter O. Waltenberger A. Katinger H. An in vitro test system for thyroid hormone action.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Burrows H.L. Nakajima M. Lesh J.S. Goosens K.A. Samuelson L.C. Inui A. Camper S.A. Seasholtz A.F. Excess corticotropin releasing hormone-binding protein in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in transgenic mice.J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In GH3 cells, transcription of the growth hormone (GH) gene is activated via thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in the presence of T3. TR is a nuclear receptor and acts as a transcription factor. In GH3 cells, TR binds to T3-resoponse element, which exists in the upstream region of the GH gene. We demonstrated that overexpression of PDI in GH3 cells suppresses the mRNA levels of GH. This result suggested that PDI contributes to the regulation of T3-mediated gene expression in GH3 cells (26Okada K. Imaoka S. Hashimoto S. Hiroi T. Funae Y. Over-expression of protein disulfide isomerase reduces the release of growth hormone induced by bisphenol A and/or T3.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 278: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As described above, PDI is considered to serve as a reserve of T3. Thus, it is considered that overexpressed PDI traps T3 and inhibits the activation of TR-mediated gene expression by T3. However, the mechanism by which GH expression is regulated by PDI is not clear. In the present study, we clarified the mechanism of suppression of T3-stimulated GH expression by PDI-overexpression, and found that PDI regulates the T3-stimulated gene expression in GH3 cells via its catalytic activity but not its T3-binding capacity. We also found that redox factor1 (Ref-1), which changes the redox state of some transcription factors and regulates transcriptional activity, contributes to the regulation of GH expression by PDI. The regulation of the redox state of Ref-1 is a new aspect of PDI's functions. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Diamide, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG) maleimide 5000, and T3 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals used were purchased from Wako. T3 was dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH at 10 mm to make stock solutions and stored at −20 °C. 10 nm T3 in NaOH solution (0.1 μm) was added to the assay system or cell culture medium. In control samples, the same amount of NaOH was also added as a vehicle. Fragments of rat PDI and mutants (C/A Mt, Δa, and Δb′) were obtained as described previously (22Hashimoto S. Okada K.

C/A Mt was a mutant in which cysteine residues at two catalytic active sites (Cys-55, Cys-58, Cys-399, and Cys-402) were substituted with alanine residues. The Δa and Δb′ lack the a and b′ domains, respectively. Mutant cDNAs were cut with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). TRα (GenBankTM accession number NM_001017960), TRβ1 (GenBank accession number J03819), TRβ2 (GenBank accession number NM_012672), Ref-1 (GenBank accession number NM_024148.1), and thioredoxin 1 (TRX1) (GenBank accession number NM_053800) were constructed as follows. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for each fragment cDNA with primer 1 and primer 2 (TRα), primer 3 and primer 5 (TRβ1), primer 4 and primer 5 (TRβ1), or primer 6 and primer 9 (Ref-1), which are shown in Table 1. The cDNA obtained from total RNA of GH3 cells was used as a template. PCR was done with KOD polymerase with denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 90 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The cDNA of C64S Ref-1 was obtained by PCR with two steps. In the first PCR, nucleotide fragment 1 of C64S Ref-1 was amplified with primer 6 and primer 7. Nucleotide fragment 2 was amplified with primer 8 and primer 9 (for pcDNA) or 10 (for pQE80L). The two fragments were purified by electrophoresis with agarose gels. The second round of PCR was performed with fragments 1 and 2 and primer 6 and primer 9. The cDNAs of TRα, TRβ1, and TRβ2 were cut with EcoRI and XhoI (for pCMV-HA) or BamHI and XhoI (for pcDNA-3×FLAG) and ligated into pCMV-HA (Clontech) or pcDNA-3×FLAG. The cDNA of the wild-type and C64S Ref-1 were cut with BamHI and XhoI (for pcDNA) or BamHI and SalI (for pQE-80L) and ligated into pcDNA and pQE-80L (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cDNA of TRX1 was amplified with primer 11 and primer 12, and the obtained fragment was cut with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA vector.TABLE 1Primers for cloning of Ref-1 and TRsFactorPrimer no.SequenceTRα1AAGAATTCGTGAATGGAACAGAAG2TTCTCGAGTTAGACTTCCTGATCTRβ13AAGAATTCAACCTATGACTCCTAATRβ24AAGAATTCTGTTCATGTGTATGGATTRβ1/25TTCTCGAGTCAGTCCTCAAAGACTTRef-16AAGGATCCTTCGTTACAGCGATGCCG7ATCCACATTCCAGGAGGCTATCTTGAGTGT8TCCTGGAATGTGGATGGGCTTCGA9TTCTCGAGTGAGGGGAGTGTCACAGT10TTGTCGACGCTGAGGGGAGTGTCACAGTTRX111AAGGATCCATGGTGAAGCTGATCGAGAG12TTCTCGAGGCATGATTAGGCAAACTCCGTAATAGTG Open table in a new tab Expression and purification of rat histidine-tagged PDI was performed as described previously (27Hiroi T.

BL21 (Novagen, Madison, WI) E. coli cells transformed with pQE-80L encoding a rat histidine-tagged wild-type and C64S Ref-1 were grown at 37 °C in 2× yeast extract-tryptone-rich medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, and protein expression was induced by addition of 1.0 mm isopropyl thio-β-O-galactoside. After additional cultivation for 4 h, E. coli cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5 containing 300 mm NaCl, 1.0 mg/ml lysozyme, and 20 mm imidazole) for 60 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was sonicated for 2 min. The lysate sample was solubilized by 0.5% n-dodecyl maltoside and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After the column was washed with lysis buffer, the protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The rat pituitary tumor cell line GH3 was provided by the Health Science Research Resources Bank (cell number JCRB9047; Osaka, Japan). Cells were maintained in Ham's F-10 medium containing 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Overexpression of wild-type PDI was performed as described previously (26Okada K. Imaoka S. Hashimoto S. Hiroi T. Funae Y. Over-expression of protein disulfide isomerase reduces the release of growth hormone induced by bisphenol A and/or T3.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 278: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Forced expression of C/A Mt, Δa, and Δb′ was also performed using the same method as for overexpression of the wild type. Transient expression of the wild-type and C64S Ref-1 was performed as follows. The pCMV-HA containing Ref-1 cDNA was transfected into GH3 cells. The vector (2 μg) was introduced into GH3 cells using HilyMax transfection reagent (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) at 2 × 105 cells/well in 3.5-cm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, the culture medium was replaced with Td medium containing test chemicals. After another 24 h, cells were harvested for use in each experiment. For hypoxic treatment, the cells were incubated in 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 (balanced with a modulator incubator chamber) for 6 h. GH3 cells were cultured in Td medium for 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh Td medium containing 10 nm T3, and incubation was continued for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from GH3 cells with Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). A reaction mixture containing 1 μg of RNA and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Takara) was incubated according to the manufacturer's directions as follows: 10 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, and then 10 min at 70 °C to stop the reaction. The quantified real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System Single TP850 (Takara, Shiga, Japan). SYBR Primer Ex TaqII, 10 pmol of forward and reverse primers, and 1 μg of cDNA were mixed, and RT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was conducted at 95 °C for 10 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 20 s. Primers for rat GH (GenBank accession number GQ890681) were 5′-CTGCTGACACCTACAAAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGTGTGTGCCTAGAAAGCA-3′ (antisense). Primers for rat β-actin (GenBank accession number CAA24528) were 5′-CTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTCC-3′ (antisense). Quantification was done by using the second derivative maximum method according to the manufacturer's directions. The luciferase reporter gene assay was performed using the vector pGL3, which includes the rat growth hormone 5′-flanking region (from −1803 to +5) (GenBank accession number X12967) containing T3-response elements as reported (26Okada K. Imaoka S. Hashimoto S. Hiroi T. Funae Y. Over-expression of protein disulfide isomerase reduces the release of growth hormone induced by bisphenol A and/or T3.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 278: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GH3 cells were transfected using GenePORTER2 reagent. In the case of HEK293T cells, pGL3 and pCMV-HA that included rat TRα, TRβ1, or TRβ2 were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the culture medium was replaced with Td medium containing test chemicals. After another 24 h, cells were harvested to measure luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies were corrected with the internal control. GH3 cells were cultured in 3.5-cm dishes at 2 × 105 cells/dish in Td medium for 24 h to eliminate endogenous T3. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh Td medium containing test chemicals, and 24 h later, the culture medium and cells were collected. Proteins in the culture medium were precipitated by acetone. The GH protein in the cells and medium was detected by Western blotting using an anti-GH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Immunoprecipitation of Ref-1 using GH3 cells was performed as follows. GH3 cells were treated with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mm NEM for 20 min and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to 2 mg/ml by adding lysis buffer. Next, 500 μl of supernatant was incubated with 2 μl of anti Ref-1 antibody or unimmunized rabbit serum for 1 h, and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% (w/v); GE Healthcare) in lysis buffer was added to this solution and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 8,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. Precipitates were washed with wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and wash buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl). Resulting pellets were heat-denatured with 30 μl of buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 containing 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptethanol) for 5 min at 95 °C. Immunoprecipitation of TRβ1 using HEK293 cells was performed as follows. TRβ1 containing 3×FLAG tags was expressed in HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mm NEM for 20 min and lysed using IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to 4 mg of protein/ml with lysis buffer. Then 500 μl of supernatant was incubated with 2 μl of anti-DYKDDDDY (FLAG) tag antibody (Wako) or unimmunized mouse serum for 1 h, and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% (w/v); GE Healthcare) in lysis buffer was added to this solution and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 5,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. Precipitates were washed using wash buffer 1 and wash buffer 2. Immunoprecipitation of wild-type or C64S mutant Ref-1 and PDI using HEK293 cells was performed as follows. Wild-type or C64S Ref-1 containing the HA tag was expressed in HEK293 cells, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-HA tag antibody (Clontech) or unimmunized mouse serum. Cells were washed with PBS containing 20 mm NEM, which blocks free SH, and incubated with PBS containing 20 mm NEM on ice for 20 min, and then cells were harvested and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 1% SDS. Proteins were precipitated with ice-cold acetone. Precipitates were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and disulfide bonds in proteins were reduced by 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). The proteins were incubated with 2 mm PEG-maleimide for 1 h at room temperature, and reactions were stopped by acetone precipitation. Then SDS-PAGE was performed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected using a polyclonal anti-PDI or -Ref-1 antibody. Detection of the redox state of recombinant wild-type Ref-1 and C64S Ref-1 was performed as follows. 5 μm Ref-1 protein and 5 μm PDI protein were co-incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 for 30 min at room temperature. Then proteins were incubated with 20 mm NEM for 1 h at room temperature and precipitated with acetone to remove NEM. Precipitates were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and disulfide bonds in proteins were reduced by 10 mm TCEP. The proteins were incubated with 2 mm PEG-maleimide for 1 h at room temperature, and reactions were stopped by acetone precipitation. Previously we demonstrated that overexpression of PDI suppressed the GH mRNA expression in GH3 cells (28Hashimoto S. Yoshimura H. Okada K. Uramaru N. Sugihara K. Kitamura S. Imaoka S. Effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their derivatives on protein disulfide isomerase activity and growth hormone release of GH3 cells.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2012; 25: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We also clarified that the suppression of GH mRNA was mediated by the GH promoter in a luciferase reporter gene assay using the upstream region of GH (28Hashimoto S. Yoshimura H. Okada K. Uramaru N. Sugihara K. Kitamura S. Imaoka S. Effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their derivatives on protein disulfide isomerase activity and growth hormone release of GH3 cells.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2012; 25: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In PDI-overexpressing cells, promoter activity was significantly suppressed. PDI is a T3-binding protein and considered to act as a modulator of free T3 levels. This raises the possibility that increases in PDI protein levels in GH3 cells suppress the TR-mediated GH expression by trapping the T3. To test whether PDI acts as a modulator of T3, we prepared several mutants of PDI such as C/A Mt, Δa, and Δb′, and GH mRNA levels in cells overexpressing PDI mutants were investigated. We previously found that T3 bound to the a and b′ domains of PDI (23Hashimoto S. Shiomoto K. Okada K. Imaoka S. The binding site of bisphenol A to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).J. Biochem. 2012; 151: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, cDNAs of Δa and Δb′, which lack the a and b′ domains, respectively, were prepared as deletion mutants of the T3-binding domain and expressed in GH3 cells. In addition, the cDNA of C/A Mt in which the cysteines of catalytic active sites were substituted by alanines was prepared and expressed in GH3 cells. These cells were treated with 10 nm T3, and GH mRNA levels were determined by real time quantitative PCR. Consistent with previous findings, the expression of GH mRNA was suppressed by the overexpression of wild-type PDI (Fig. 1A). It was also suppressed by forced expression of Δb′. Conversely, GH was not suppressed"
https://openalex.org/W2003993777,"How amphetamine affects the neuroglia in living brains is not well understood. In an effort to elucidate this effect, we investigated neuroglia in response to amphetamine exposure using antisense (AS) or sense (S) phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide (sODN) sequences that correspond to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA (AS-gfap or S-gfap, respectively) expression. The control is a random-sequence sODN (Ran). Using cyanine 5.5-superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (Cy5.5-SPION) labeling and fluorescent microscopy, we demonstrated that living neural progenitor cells (PC-12.1), as well as the cells in fresh brain slices and intact brains of male C57BL6 mice, exhibited universal uptake of all of the sODNs but rapidly excluded all sODN-Ran and most S-gfap. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed electron-dense nanoparticles only in the neuroglia of normal or transgenic mice [B6;DBA-Tg(Fos-tTA, Fos-EGFP*)1MmayTg(tetO-lacZ,tTA*)1Mmay/J] that had been administered AS-gfap or Cy5.5-SPION-gfap. Subtraction R2* maps from mice with acute and chronic amphetamine exposure demonstrated, validated by postmortem immunohistochemistry, a reduction in striatal neuroglia, with gliogenesis in the subventricular zone and the somatosensory cortex in vivo. The sensitivity of our unique gene transcript targeted MRI was illustrated by a positive linear correlation (r(2)=1.0) between in vivo MRI signal changes and GFAP mRNA copy numbers determined by ex vivo quantitative RT-PCR. The study provides direct evidence for targeting neuroglia by antisense DNA-based SPION-gfap that enables in vivo MRI of inaccessible tissue with PCR sensitivity. The results enable us to conclude that amphetamine induces toxicity to neuroglia in vivo, which may cause remodeling or reconnectivity of neuroglia."

The mammalian prion protein, PrP, was originally identified as the causative agent of a group of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1Prusiner S. Novel proteinaceous infectious particles cause scrapie.Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4101) Google Scholar). When the prion-determining domain (PrD) of PrP misfolds, PrP can switch from a non-infectious conformation (PrPC) to a conformation prone to forming self-propagating, β-sheet-rich, amyloid polymers (PrPSc) (1Prusiner S. Novel proteinaceous infectious particles cause scrapie.Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4101) Google Scholar, 2Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). These amyloids spread by catalyzing the transformation of PrPC into PrPSc, eventually forming large aggregates (for review, see Ref. 3Colby D.W. Prusiner S.B. Prions.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a006833Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although genetic polymorphisms of the PrP gene do affect its disease pathology (4Brown K. Mastrianni J.A. The prion diseases.J.

Scrapie strain variation and mutation.Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 822-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Protease treatment of different strains of PrPSc aggregates revealed that they differed by the size and composition of their amyloid core region, suggesting that it is specific conformations of the amyloid that give rise to PrPSc strains (8Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. Distinct PrP properties suggest the molecular basis of strain variation in transmissible mink encephalopathy.J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prions have also been characterized in non-mammalian model organisms, including bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where they have been demonstrated to occur frequently in the wild (9Wickner R.B.

Studies have shown that different prion conformations distinguish each prion variant (17Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S.

The prion protein Rnq1p can adopt different variants, each with a distinct phenotype. Although the function of its non-prion conformation remains unknown, the prion conformation of Rnq1p, [PIN+], acts to help another yeast prion, Sup35p/[PSI+], adopt its own prion state (20Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetic and environmental factors affecting the de novo appearance of the [PSI+] prion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Derkatch I.L.

Rnq1p has a prion-determining domain between amino acids 153 and 405, with a non-prion domain N terminus (11Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Rnq1. An epigenetic modifier of protein function in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some [PIN+] variants include [PIN+]low, [PIN+]medium, and [PIN+]high, each named for its respective [PSI+] induction efficiency (16Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Interactions among prions and prion “strains” in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Another [PIN+] variant-linked phenotype is observed when GFP-tagged Rnq1p is overproduced in vivo (22Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Destabilizing interactions among [PSI+] and [PIN+] yeast prion variants.Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685PubMed Google Scholar). [PIN+]high strains form multiple Rnq1-GFP foci per cell, whereas [PIN+]medium and [PIN+]low strains generally form only a single Rnq1-GFP focus. Another phenotypic difference between [PIN+] variants is the size and stability of their amyloid aggregates. [PIN+]high contains less stable aggregates that break down into smaller subparticles when heated, as opposed to [PIN+]low or [PIN+]medium aggregates, which remain stable when heated (16Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Interactions among prions and prion “strains” in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemical and genetic methods for characterization of [PIN+] prions in yeast.Methods. 2006; 39: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When two [PIN+] variants are introduced into the same cell, either through mating or cytoduction, the diploid and all haploid progeny adopt the phenotype of the dominant variant. [PIN+]high is dominant over [PIN+]medium, which is in turn dominant over [PIN+]low (16Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Interactions among prions and prion “strains” in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These multiple, distinct phenotypes make [PIN+] an ideal model system with which to study the etiology of prion variants. Mutations in a prion protein can affect its amyloid structure and, through that, the type of variant it adopts (25Chien P. Weissman J.S. Conformational diversity in a yeast prion dictates its seeding specificity.Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Kushnirov V.V. Kryndushkin D.S. Boguta M.

The role of Sis1 in the maintenance of the [RNQ+] prion.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting that other cellular factors may influence the variant conformation that a given prion will adopt. Chaperone proteins are strong candidates for such variant regulating factors. Chaperones are known to affect the conformation of a wide array of client proteins (for review, see Ref. 28Morano K.A. Grant C.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. The response to heat shock and oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 190: 1157-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in other aspects of prion biology, including the de novo formation, propagation, and curing of prions (for review, see Ref. 29Masison D.C.

Prion propagation by Hsp40 molecular chaperones.Prion. 2009; 3: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Additionally, changes to chaperone activity and levels have been shown to affect prion variants. Yeast strains expressing N- and C-terminal truncations of the primary stress response transcriptional regulator, Hsf1p, which were shown to increase Hsp104p and decrease Hsp90 levels, respectively, preferentially formed specific [PSI+] variants upon de novo induction (32Park K.-W. Hahn J.-S. Fan Q. Thiele D.J. Li L. De novo appearance and “strain” formation of yeast prion [PSI+] are regulated by the heat-shock transcription factor.Genetics. 2006; 173: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Likewise, strains over- or underexpressing SSE1, which is important to Hsp70 activity, gave rise to specific [PSI+] variants when induced (33Fan Q. Park K.-W. Du Z. Morano K.A. Li L. The role of Sse1 in the de novo formation and variant determination of the [PSI+] prion.Genetics. 2007; 177: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To date, only one genetic mutation has been reported to lead to a change in a pre-existing variant. Sondheimer et al. (27Sondheimer N. Lopez N. Craig E.A. Lindquist S. The role of Sis1 in the maintenance of the [RNQ+] prion.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) demonstrated that deletion of the Sis1p G/F domain altered Rnq1-GFP aggregation pattern in a manner stably propagated even after reintroduction of wild-type Sis1p. Here, we report the findings of our investigations into the actions of chaperone proteins upon already established [PIN+] variants. We found that disruption of several chaperone genes gives rise to shifts in [PIN+] variant-linked phenotypes. Genetic analysis showed that the phenotypic shifts are inherited in a non-Mendelian manner, confirming that a bona fide change in [PIN+] variant was achieved. Our findings provide evidence that chaperones can affect established prion variants and highlight a potential role for chaperones in regulating prion-linked phenotypes through their modulation of prion variants. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. All yeast strains were cultured at 30 °C with the exception of diploids undergoing sporulation, which were cultured at 25 °C. Media were as follows: YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose); CSM (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 1 × Complete supplement mixture (Bio 101, Vista, CA)); CSM auxotrophic marker growth medium (same as CSM but containing 1 × CSM minus the appropriate auxotrophic selection (−ADE, −HIS, −LEU, −URA, −LYS-URA, −TRP-URA)); CSM auxotrophic marker induction medium (same as CSM but with 2% galactose in place of 2% glucose). For solid media, the same recipes were used with 2% agar added. Deletions were made using a HIS3 cassette as described (34Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Transformation of yeast by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) and confirmed by PCR. Isogenic MATα strains were made using YCpGAL::HO and mating-type switching (35Herskowitz I. Jensen R.E. Putting the HO gene to work. Practical uses for mating-type switching.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 132-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mating, diploid sporulation, and dissection of haploids were performed as previously described with modified sporulation medium (0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose) (36Rose M.D. Winston F.M. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Haploid progeny of dissections were tested for the presence of a gene deletion by culture on CSM-HIS plates. Plasmids used in this study were constructed as follows; pYES2.0-SUP35NM-GFP was constructed by ligating the sequence encoding enhanced GFP (37Scholz O. Thiel A. Hillen W. Niederweis M. Quantitative analysis of gene expression with an improved green fluorescent protein.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1565-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) in-frame with the 3′-end of base pairs 1–762 of the SUP35 gene into pYES2.0 (Invitrogen). pYES2.0-GFP was similarly constructed with only the GFP-encoding sequence. pYES2.0-Rnq1-GFP was constructed by amplifying sequence coding for Rnq1p C-terminally tagged with GFP from genomic DNA of a commercially available GFP-tagged library strain (Invitrogen) and ligating it into pYES2.0. pGREG535-Rnq1 was constructed by amplifying RNQ1 and inserting it into pGREG535 according to the Drag & Drop protocol (38Jansen G. Wu C. Schade B. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Drag&Drop cloning in yeast.Gene. 2005; 344: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Plasmids were verified by sequencing. Escherichia coli and yeast were transformed with plasmid using standard chemical transformation protocols (34Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Transformation of yeast by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 39Hanahan D. Studies on transformation of Escherichia coli with plasmids.J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8182) Google Scholar). To quantify [PSI+] induction efficiency based upon nonsense suppression, Sup35NM-GFP or GFP alone was overproduced by culturing strains harboring pYES2.0-SUP35NM-GFP or pYES2.0-GFP, respectively, in liquid CSM medium for 24 h followed by subculturing in liquid CSM induction medium for 48 h. When testing primary deletions and diploids, cell cultures were normalized to an A600 of 1.0, and when testing tetrads, cultures were normalized to an A600 of 0.25. After normalization, 10-fold serial dilutions were made. 5 μl of each dilution were spotted onto both CSM and CSM−ADE plates, and colony-forming units (cfu) were counted after 2 and 4 days, respectively. Percent [PSI+] induction efficiency was calculated as cfu (CSM−ADE)/cfu (CSM) × 100. Four to six independent experiments were performed for each strain. To determine if a given strain retained pYES2.0-SUP35NM-GFP, induced strains were plated for single colonies on both CSM and CSM−ADE, and colonies from both platings were then replica-plated onto CSM and CSM-URA media. Percent plasmid retention was calculated as cfu (CSM-URA)/cfu (CSM) × 100. Between 100 and 200 colonies were compared for each strain. To test induced [PSI+] strains for curability, colonies growing on CSM−ADE medium plates were streaked onto curing plates (YEPD + 3 mm guanidine HCl) and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 3 days. Putatively “cured” colonies were then selected based on their pigmentation, restreaked onto CSM and CSM−ADE plates, and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 2 and 4 days, respectively. At least four colonies were tested for each strain. Strains carrying pYES2.0-Rnq1-GFP were cultured for 24 h in liquid CSM growth medium then subcultured in liquid CSM induction medium for 24 h. The number of Rnq1-GFP foci per cell was then quantified by acquiring random wide-field micrographs of cells using an Olympus IX-80 fluorescence microscope. The frequency of multiple foci was expressed as a percentage of all cells containing multiple Rnq1-GFP foci. 800–1000 cells were counted and categorized over the course of 4 independent experiments. Strains carrying pGREG535-Rnq1 were cultured for 24 h in liquid CSM growth medium, then subcultured in liquid CSM induction medium for 8 h. Protein samples were prepared and pelleted as described (24Liebman S.W. Bagriantsev S.N. Derkatch I.L.

The pellet fraction, enriched for insoluble HA-Rnq1p, was heated briefly at 55 °C and analyzed by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) 3The abbreviation used is: SDD-AGEsemi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis.

Blots were probed with anti-HA antibody (F-7 Sc7392, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare). semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the yeast strain HF7c and the plasmids pGAD424 (prey) and pGBT9 (bait) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) following standard protocols (41Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Construction of an improved host strain for two hybrid screening.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Genes encoding Rnq1p or chaperone proteins were ligated in-frame into pGAD424 and pGBT9 for expression. Interactions were scored by growth of cells on CSM-HIS medium after 4 days of incubation relative to growth on YEPD. At least three independent experiments were done for each tested pair of proteins. To investigate the role of chaperones in [PIN+] variant determination, we made deletions of several chaperone-encoding genes in strains carrying characterized [PIN+] variants and measured changes in [PSI+] induction efficiency. Each strain was [psi−] and carried a nonsense-suppression reporter gene (ADE1–14 UGA) that allowed growth on CSM−ADE medium only when [PSI+] was induced (Fig. 1A). We measured the relative [PSI+] induction efficiencies of deletion strains using a nonsense suppression assay (Fig. 1B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In brief, we overproduced Sup35NM-GFP using the galactose-driven expression vector pYES2.0-SUP35NM-GFP and quantified cfu on CSM−ADE medium plates relative to cfu on CSM medium plates. The strength of the induced [PSI+] variants was not factored into our calculations of [PSI+] induction efficiency; only the number of colonies and not their size or pigmentation was considered. Deletion of HSC82, CPR6, CPR7, or TAH1 in the [PIN+]low strain as well as HSC82, AHA1, CPR6, CPR7, or SSE1 in the [PIN+]medium strain increased strain growth on CSM−ADE medium to levels significantly higher than those of wild-type [PIN+]low and wild-type [PIN+]medium strains and similar to those of the wild-type [PIN+]high strain. Deletion of these same genes in the [PIN+]high strain did not affect [PSI+] induction efficiency. Conversely, deletion of SBA1 in the [PIN+]medium and [PIN+]high backgrounds decreased the efficiency of [PSI+] induction to levels matching those of the wild-type [PIN+]low strain but did not significantly decrease the efficiency of [PSI+] induction when deleted in the [PIN+]low strain. Nearly all strains gave rise to colonies with variable levels of pigment ranging from pink to almost white (Fig. 1A). The only exception was the [PIN+]low strain deleted for TAH1 in which colonies were almost entirely white after induction, suggesting that the induced [PSI+] colonies all carry a strong [PSI+] variant. ADE-competent colonies were confirmed to be prion-linked because they lost ADE competence after treatment with guanidine HCl (supplemental Fig. S1). Also, the extent of [PSI+] induction in a strain being dependent on the levels of plasmid retention by that strain was excluded as a possibility, as both wild-type and deletion strains retained plasmid at levels between 90 and 95% whether or not the cells were ADE-competent (data not shown). Our results showing that the effects of gene deletion were [PIN+] variant-specific and resulted in shifts in [PSI+] induction efficiency from levels found in one wild-type variant strain, e.g. [PIN+]low, to a different wild-type variant strain, e.g. [PIN+]high, suggested that the chaperone gene deletions may have given rise to a change in the [PIN+] variant carried by the cell. If the [PIN+] variant of a strain had been altered by deletion of a chaperone gene, then other variant-specific phenotypes should also have been affected. Accordingly, we characterized the effects of chaperone gene deletion upon the phenotype of Rnq1p aggregates. We first quantified the localization of Rnq1-GFP in all the deletion strains affected in [PSI+] induction efficiency (Fig. 2A). When GFP-tagged Rnq1p was overproduced from the galactose-driven plasmid pYES2.0-Rnq1-GFP, ∼75% of focus-containing wild-type [PIN+]low and wild-type [PIN+]medium cells contained a single Rnq1-GFP focus, whereas ∼25% contained more than one focus. ∼50% of wild-type [PIN+]high focus-containing cells contained multiple foci, in agreement with previous findings (22Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Destabilizing interactions among [PSI+] and [PIN+] yeast prion variants.Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685PubMed Google Scholar). [PIN+]low and [PIN+]medium strains deleted for the genes HSC82, CPR6, CPR7, TAH1, or SSE1 that gave rise to increased [PSI+] induction also displayed multiple Rnq1-GFP foci at the frequency displayed by the wild-type [PIN+]high strain. Deletion of AHA1 in the [PIN+]medium strain but not in the [PIN+]low strain led to increased [PSI+] induction (Fig. 1B). Likewise, deletion of AHA1 in the [PIN+]medium strain but not in the [PIN+]low strain led to an increase in multiple Rnq1-GFP foci to the frequency exhibited by the wild-type [PIN+]high strain. In contrast, deletion of the SBA1 gene from the [PIN+]high strain led to fewer cells with multiple Rnq1-GFP foci, consistent with the frequencies exhibited by wild-type [PIN+]low and wild-type [PIN+]medium strains. Interestingly, increases in the number of multiple Rnq1-GFP foci were also observed when TAH1 and SSE1 were deleted in [PIN+]medium and [PIN+]low strains, respectively, even though there was no observed increase in [PSI+] induction efficiency in these deletion strains. We next characterized the sizes of Rnq1p amyloid subparticles in the deletion strains. The sizes of Rnq1p amyloid subparticles have been shown to vary depending on whether the [PIN+] variant displays a single Rnq1-GFP focus per cell, as with the wild-type [PIN+]low and wild-type [PIN+]medium strains, or multiple foci per cell as observed in the wild-type [PIN+]high strain (23Bagriantsev S. Liebman S.W. Specificity of prion assembly in vivo. [PSI+] and [PIN+] form separate structures in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51042-51048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Strains with a single focus display a relatively narrow range of large subparticles, whereas strains with multiple foci display subparticles ranging in size from monomer to as large as, or larger than, those found in strains with a single focus. Accordingly, we produced HA-tagged Rnq1p from the plasmid pGREG535-Rnq1 in the wild-type [PIN+]low, [PIN+]medium, and [PIN+]high strains and in these strains harboring a gene deletion. We then prepared samples enriched for proteins in an insoluble prion state and incubated them at room temperature and 55 °C, as Rnq1p aggregates purified from strains with multiple Rnq1p foci, specifically [PIN+]high, have been shown to be more sensitive to changes in temperature and to degrade partially at moderately elevated temperatures, whereas other Rnq1p variant aggregates do not (24Liebman S.W. Bagriantsev S.N. Derkatch I.L. Biochemical and genetic methods for characterization of [PIN+] prions in yeast.Methods. 2006; 39: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, we compared the sizes of the purified HA-Rnq1p amyloid aggregates using SDD-AGE (Fig. 2B). We found that deleting SBA1 in the wild-type [PIN+]high strain eliminated small HA-Rnq1p amyloid aggregates, leaving a narrower range of larger aggregates, consistent with the patterns observed in the wild-type [PIN+]low and wild-type [PIN+]medium strains. Conversely, we observed that hsc82Δ, aha1Δ, cpr6Δ, cpr7Δ, and sse1Δ strains, which increased the efficiency of [PSI+] induction in [PIN+]low and/or [PIN+]medium backgrounds to levels observed in the wild-type [PIN+]high strain, exhibited amyloid aggregates with a broader range of sizes, consistent with aggregates from the wild-type [PIN+]high strain. These aggregates, like wild-type [PIN+]high aggregates, also proved to"
https://openalex.org/W2090763269,"The pocket proteins pRB, p107 and p130 have established roles in regulating the cell cycle through the control of E2F activity. The pocket proteins regulate differentiation of a number of tissues in both cell cycle-dependent and -independent manners. Prior studies showed that mutation of p107 and p130 in the mouse leads to defects in cartilage development during endochondral ossification, the process by which long bones form. Despite evidence of a role for pRB in osteoblast differentiation, it is unknown whether it functions during cartilage development. Here, we show that mutation of Rb in the early mesenchyme of p107-mutant mice results in severe cartilage defects in the growth plates of long bones. This is attributable to inappropriate chondrocyte proliferation that persists after birth and leads to the formation of enchondromas in the growth plates as early as 8 weeks of age. Genetic crosses show that development of these tumorigenic lesions is E2f3 dependent. These results reveal an overlapping role for pRB and p107 in cartilage development, endochondral ossification and enchondroma formation that reflects their coordination of cell-cycle exit at appropriate developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2015142876,"Equilibrative nucleoside transporters are a unique family of proteins that enable uptake of nucleosides/nucleobases into a wide range of eukaryotes and internalize a myriad of drugs used in the treatment of cancer, heart disease, AIDs, and parasitic infections. In previous work we generated a structural model for such a transporter, the LdNT1.1 nucleoside permease from the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani, using ab initio computation. The model suggested that aromatic residues present in transmembrane helices 1, 2, and 7 interact to form an extracellular gate that closes the permeation pathway in the inward-open conformation. Mutation of residues Phe-48(TM1) and Trp-75(TM2) abrogated transport activity, consistent with such prediction. In this study cysteine mutagenesis and oxidative cross-linking were combined to analyze proximity relationships of helices 1, 2, and 7 in LdNT1.1. Disulfide bond formation between introduced paired cysteines at the interface of such helices (A61C(TM1)/F74C(TM2), A61C(TM1)/G350C(TM7), and F74C(TM2)/G350C(TM7)) was analyzed by transport measurement and gel mobility shifts upon oxidation with Cu (II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)(3). In all cases cross-linking inhibited transport. However, if LdNT1.1 ligands were included during cross-linking, inhibition of transport was reduced, suggesting that ligands moved the three gating helices apart. Moreover, all paired cysteine mutants exhibited a mobility shift upon oxidation, corroborating the formation of a disulfide bond. These data support the notion that helices 1, 2, and 7 constitute the extracellular gate of LdNT1.1, thus further validating the computational model and the previously demonstrated importance of F48(TM1) and Trp-75(TM2) in tethering together helices that are part of the gate."
https://openalex.org/W2064420311,"The self-incompatibility (SI) system is genetically controlled by a single polymorphic locus known as the S-locus in the Brassicaceae. Pollen rejection occurs when the stigma and pollen share the same S-haplotype. Recognition of S-haplotype specificity has recently been shown to involve at least two S-locus genes, S-receptor kinase (SRK) and S-locus protein 11 or S locus Cysteine-rich (SP11/SCR) protein. Here, we examined the function of S60, one SP11/SCR allele of B. rapa cv. Osome, using a RNAi-mediated gene silencing approach. The transgenic RNAi lines were highly self-compatible, and this trait was stable in subsequent generations, even after crossing with other commercial lines. These findings also suggested that the resultant self-compatibility could be transferred to commercial cultivars with the desired performances in B. rapa."
