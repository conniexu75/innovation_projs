https://openalex.org/W1993733237,"DIMETHYL sulphoxide (DMSO) has long been known for its solvent properties and its ability to prevent freezing damage to living cells1. More recently, it has been found to cross intact cellular membranes and the skin very readily and to effect rapid penetration through these tissues of some substances dissolved in it2,3. Despite these remarkable abilities, very few undesirable effects in either experimental animals4 or in man have been reported. As a result, DMSO is coming into rather widespread use as therapy for a number of human diseases5."

https://openalex.org/W2013883207,"AGENTS that inhibit DNA synthesis in cells of higher animals are comparatively rare. Following on our earlier work1, we have tested mouse lymphoma cells in order to determine the rate of division and change in volume brought about by the presence of various concentrations of 2-phenyl-ethanol (PEA) and some of its derivatives."

When the cells are allowed to grow in a medium containing acriflavine or related dyes, large numbers of mutant cells with deficient respiration are produced, which tend to dominate the entire cell population after several generations1."

https://openalex.org/W1985932140,"HAEMAGGLUTINATING activity has been observed occasionally in stock laboratory cultures of some strains of classical Vibrio cholerae1,2. It is therefore necessary to use recently isolated organisms in haemagglutination tests for the differentiation of vibrios."

https://openalex.org/W2031487705,"THE mesangial region of the normal renal glomerulus has been the subject of controversy for many years and is the site of collagen production in some diseases1,2. Although there have been many investigations in a variety of animals, we are aware of only one published account which has described collagen fibrils in the normal glomerulus. These were described in the rat2. During investigations of experimental renal amyloidosis in the mouse we had cause to examine the glomeruli of normal animals. Careful search of the mesangial regions revealed the presence of typically striated collagen fibrils with periodicity 500–600 Å and showing intraperiod striations. Fig. 1 shows parts of two mesangial cells (the arrows point to collagen fibrils). Fig. 2 is a higher power electron micrograph of the area indicated between the arrows in Fig. 1. The tissue was fixed in buffered osmium tetroxide solution, embedded in ‘Araldite’, and after sectioning stained for 1 h with 2 per cent phosphotungstic acid dissolved in absolute alcohol."
