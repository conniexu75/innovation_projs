https://openalex.org/W2993409481,"Additive manufacturing, often known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a process in which a part is built layer-by-layer and is a promising approach for creating components close to their final (net) shape. This process is challenging the dominance of conventional manufacturing processes for products with high complexity and low material waste1. Titanium alloys made by additive manufacturing have been used in applications in various industries. However, the intrinsic high cooling rates and high thermal gradient of the fusion-based metal additive manufacturing process often leads to a very fine microstructure and a tendency towards almost exclusively columnar grains, particularly in titanium-based alloys1. (Columnar grains in additively manufactured titanium components can result in anisotropic mechanical properties and are therefore undesirable2.) Attempts to optimize the processing parameters of additive manufacturing have shown that it is difficult to alter the conditions to promote equiaxed growth of titanium grains3. In contrast with other common engineering alloys such as aluminium, there is no commercial grain refiner for titanium that is able to effectively refine the microstructure. To address this challenge, here we report on the development of titanium–copper alloys that have a high constitutional supercooling capacity as a result of partitioning of the alloying element during solidification, which can override the negative effect of a high thermal gradient in the laser-melted region during additive manufacturing. Without any special process control or additional treatment, our as-printed titanium–copper alloy specimens have a fully equiaxed fine-grained microstructure. They also display promising mechanical properties, such as high yield strength and uniform elongation, compared to conventional alloys under similar processing conditions, owing to the formation of an ultrafine eutectoid microstructure that appears as a result of exploiting the high cooling rates and multiple thermal cycles of the manufacturing process. We anticipate that this approach will be applicable to other eutectoid-forming alloy systems, and that it will have applications in the aerospace and biomedical industries. Titanium–copper alloys with fully equiaxed grains and a fine microstructure are realized via an additive manufacturing process that exploits high cooling rates and multiple thermal cycles."

To investigate the biology of exhaustion in human T cells expressing CAR receptors, we used a model system with a tonically signaling CAR, which induces hallmark features of exhaustion6. Exhaustion was associated with a profound defect in the production of IL-2, along with increased chromatin accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor motifs and overexpression of the bZIP and IRF transcription factors that have been implicated in mediating dysfunction in exhausted T cells7-10. Here we show that CAR T cells engineered to overexpress the canonical AP-1 factor c-Jun have enhanced expansion potential, increased functional capacity, diminished terminal differentiation and improved anti-tumour potency in five different mouse tumour models in vivo. We conclude that a functional deficiency in c-Jun mediates dysfunction in exhausted human T cells, and that engineering CAR T cells to overexpress c-Jun renders them resistant to exhaustion, thereby addressing a major barrier to progress for this emerging class of therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2992057636,"During the solar minimum, when the Sun is at its least active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than 500 kilometres per second), highly Alfvénic rarefied stream of plasma originating from deep within coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the solar wind is interspersed with a more variable slow wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The precise origins of the slow wind streams are less certain4; theories and observations suggest that they may originate at the tips of helmet streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within coronal holes with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The heating mechanism required to drive the solar wind is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfvén-wave turbulence11,12, heating by reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave heating14 and acceleration by thermal gradients1. At a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is mixed and evolved, and therefore much of the diagnostic structure of these sources and processes has been lost. Here we present observations from the Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that show evidence of slow Alfvénic solar wind emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large, intermittent reversals that are associated with jets of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are interspersed in a smoother and less turbulent flow with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore, plasma-wave measurements suggest the existence of electron and ion velocity-space micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our measurements suggest that there is an impulsive mechanism associated with solar-wind energization and that micro-instabilities play a part in heating, and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal holes are a key source of the slow solar wind."
https://openalex.org/W2994035181,"The prediction of a supersonic solar wind1 was first confirmed by spacecraft near Earth2,3 and later by spacecraft at heliocentric distances as small as 62 solar radii4. These missions showed that plasma accelerates as it emerges from the corona, aided by unidentified processes that transport energy outwards from the Sun before depositing it in the wind. Alfvénic fluctuations are a promising candidate for such a process because they are seen in the corona and solar wind and contain considerable energy5-7. Magnetic tension forces the corona to co-rotate with the Sun, but any residual rotation far from the Sun reported until now has been much smaller than the amplitude of waves and deflections from interacting wind streams8. Here we report observations of solar-wind plasma at heliocentric distances of about 35 solar radii9-11, well within the distance at which stream interactions become important. We find that Alfvén waves organize into structured velocity spikes with duration of up to minutes, which are associated with propagating S-like bends in the magnetic-field lines. We detect an increasing rotational component to the flow velocity of the solar wind around the Sun, peaking at 35 to 50 kilometres per second-considerably above the amplitude of the waves. These flows exceed classical velocity predictions of a few kilometres per second, challenging models of circulation in the corona and calling into question our understanding of how stars lose angular momentum and spin down as they age12-14."
https://openalex.org/W3008726958,"The underrepresentation of non-Europeans in human genetic studies so far has limited the diversity of individuals in genomic datasets and led to reduced medical relevance for a large proportion of the world's population. Population-specific reference genome datasets as well as genome-wide association studies in diverse populations are needed to address this issue. Here we describe the pilot phase of the GenomeAsia 100K Project. This includes a whole-genome sequencing reference dataset from 1,739 individuals of 219 population groups and 64 countries across Asia. We catalogue genetic variation, population structure, disease associations and founder effects. We also explore the use of this dataset in imputation, to facilitate genetic studies in populations across Asia and worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2994214974,"Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that govern the dynamics of open systems. At an EP, two or more eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenstates, coalesce1–3. Recently, it was predicted that operation of an optical gyroscope near an EP results in improved response to rotations4,5. However, the performance of such a system has not been examined experimentally. Here we introduce a precisely controllable physical system for the study of non-Hermitian physics and nonlinear optics in high-quality-factor microresonators. Because this system dissipatively couples counter-propagating lightwaves within the resonator, it also functions as a sensitive gyroscope for the measurement of rotations. We use our system to investigate the predicted EP-enhanced Sagnac effect4,5 and observe a four-fold increase in the Sagnac scale factor by directly measuring rotations applied to the resonator. The level of enhancement can be controlled by adjusting the system bias relative to the EP, and modelling results confirm the observed enhancement. Moreover, we characterize the sensitivity of the gyroscope near the EP. Besides verifying EP physics, this work is important for the understanding of optical gyroscopes. precisely controllable integrated optical gyroscope based on stimulated Brillouin scattering is used to study non-Hermitian physics, revealing a four-fold enhancement of the Sagnac scale factor near exceptional points."
https://openalex.org/W2992154881,"Neurodegeneration in patients with Parkinson’s disease is correlated with the occurrence of Lewy bodies—intracellular inclusions that contain aggregates of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein1. The aggregation propensity of α-synuclein in cells is modulated by specific factors that include post-translational modifications2,3, Abelson-kinase-mediated phosphorylation4,5 and interactions with intracellular machineries such as molecular chaperones, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear6–8. Here we systematically characterize the interaction of molecular chaperones with α-synuclein in vitro as well as in cells at the atomic level. We find that six highly divergent molecular chaperones commonly recognize a canonical motif in α-synuclein, consisting of the N terminus and a segment around Tyr39, and hinder the aggregation of α-synuclein. NMR experiments9 in cells show that the same transient interaction pattern is preserved inside living mammalian cells. Specific inhibition of the interactions between α-synuclein and the chaperone HSC70 and members of the HSP90 family, including HSP90β, results in transient membrane binding and triggers a remarkable re-localization of α-synuclein to the mitochondria and concomitant formation of aggregates. Phosphorylation of α-synuclein at Tyr39 directly impairs the interaction of α-synuclein with chaperones, thus providing a functional explanation for the role of Abelson kinase in Parkinson’s disease. Our results establish a master regulatory mechanism of α-synuclein function and aggregation in mammalian cells, extending the functional repertoire of molecular chaperones and highlighting new perspectives for therapeutic interventions for Parkinson’s disease. Chaperones interact with a canonical motif in α-synuclein, which can be prevented by phosphorylation of α-synuclein at Tyr39, whereas inhibition of this interaction leads to the localization of α-synuclein to the mitochondria and aggregate formation."
https://openalex.org/W3103999694,"Hydrodynamics, which generally describes the flow of a fluid, is expected to hold even for fundamental particles such as electrons when inter-particle interactions dominate1. Although various aspects of electron hydrodynamics have been revealed in recent experiments2–11, the fundamental spatial structure of hydrodynamic electrons—the Poiseuille flow profile—has remained elusive. Here we provide direct imaging of the Poiseuille flow of an electronic fluid, as well as a visualization of its evolution from ballistic flow. Using a scanning carbon nanotube single-electron transistor12, we image the Hall voltage of electronic flow through channels of high-mobility graphene. We find that the profile of the Hall field across the channel is a key physical quantity for distinguishing ballistic from hydrodynamic flow. We image the transition from flat, ballistic field profiles at low temperatures into parabolic field profiles at elevated temperatures, which is the hallmark of Poiseuille flow. The curvature of the imaged profiles is qualitatively reproduced by Boltzmann calculations, which allow us to create a ‘phase diagram’ that characterizes the electron flow regimes. Our results provide direct confirmation of Poiseuille flow in the solid state, and enable exploration of the rich physics of interacting electrons in real space. The emergence of a liquid-like electronic flow from ballistic flow in graphene is imaged, and an almost-ideal viscous hydrodynamic fluid of electrons exhibiting a parabolic Poiseuille flow profile is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2993746577,"A central aspect of aging research concerns the question of when individuality in lifespan arises1. Here we show that a transient increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which occurs naturally during early development in a subpopulation of synchronized Caenorhabditis elegans, sets processes in motion that increase stress resistance, improve redox homeostasis and ultimately prolong lifespan in those animals. We find that these effects are linked to the global ROS-mediated decrease in developmental histone H3K4me3 levels. Studies in HeLa cells confirmed that global H3K4me3 levels are ROS-sensitive and that depletion of H3K4me3 levels increases stress resistance in mammalian cell cultures. In vitro studies identified SET1/MLL histone methyltransferases as redox sensitive units of the H3K4-trimethylating complex of proteins (COMPASS). Our findings implicate a link between early-life events, ROS-sensitive epigenetic marks, stress resistance and lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2992685560,"Individual neurons in many cortical regions have been found to encode specific, identifiable features of the environment or body that pertain to the function of the region1-3. However, in frontal cortex, which is involved in cognition, neural responses display baffling complexity, carrying seemingly disordered mixtures of sensory, motor and other task-related variables4-13. This complexity has led to the suggestion that representations in individual frontal neurons are randomly mixed and can only be understood at the neural population level14,15. Here we show that neural activity in rat orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is instead highly structured: single neuron activity co-varies with individual variables in computational models that explain choice behaviour. To characterize neural responses across a large behavioural space, we trained rats on a behavioural task that combines perceptual and value-guided decisions. An unbiased, model-free clustering analysis identified distinct groups of OFC neurons, each with a particular response profile in task-variable space. Applying a simple model of choice behaviour to these categorical response profiles revealed that each profile quantitatively corresponds to a specific decision variable, such as decision confidence. Additionally, we demonstrate that a connectivity-defined cell type, orbitofrontal neurons projecting to the striatum, carries a selective and temporally sustained representation of a single decision variable: integrated value. We propose that neurons in frontal cortex, as in other cortical regions, form a sparse and overcomplete representation of features relevant to the region's function, and that they distribute this information selectively to downstream regions to support behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2992844750,"The stem cell niche and the size of the root meristem in plants are maintained by intercellular interactions and signalling networks involving a peptide hormone, root meristem growth factor 1 (RGF1)1. Understanding how RGF1 regulates the development of the root meristem is essential for understanding stem cell function. Although five receptors for RGF1 have been identified2–4, the downstream signalling mechanism remains unknown. Here we report a series of signalling events that follow RGF1 activity. We find that the RGF1-receptor pathway controls the distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) along the developmental zones of the Arabidopsis root. We identify a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, RGF1-INDUCIBLE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (RITF1), that has a central role in mediating RGF1 signalling. Manipulating RITF1 expression leads to the redistribution of ROS along the root developmental zones. Changes in ROS distribution in turn enhance the stability of the PLETHORA2 protein, a master regulator of root stem cells. Our results thus clearly depict a signalling cascade that is initiated by RGF1, linking this peptide to mechanisms that regulate ROS. RITF1, a newly identified plant transcription factor, links signalling through the peptide hormone RGF1 to the balance of reactive oxygen species and thereby enhances the stability of another transcription factor, PLETHORA2, a master regulator of root stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2994598232,"NASA’s Parker Solar Probe mission1 recently plunged through the inner heliosphere of the Sun to its perihelia, about 24 million kilometres from the Sun. Previous studies farther from the Sun (performed mostly at a distance of 1 astronomical unit) indicate that solar energetic particles are accelerated from a few kiloelectronvolts up to near-relativistic energies via at least two processes: ‘impulsive’ events, which are usually associated with magnetic reconnection in solar flares and are typically enriched in electrons, helium-3 and heavier ions2, and ‘gradual’ events3,4, which are typically associated with large coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks and compressions moving through the corona and inner solar wind and are the dominant source of protons with energies between 1 and 10 megaelectronvolts. However, some events show aspects of both processes and the electron–proton ratio is not bimodally distributed, as would be expected if there were only two possible processes5. These processes have been very difficult to resolve from prior observations, owing to the various transport effects that affect the energetic particle population en route to more distant spacecraft6. Here we report observations of the near-Sun energetic particle radiation environment over the first two orbits of the probe. We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely including by corotating interaction regions, impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun, and an event related to a coronal mass ejection. We provide direct observations of the energetic particle radiation environment in the region just above the corona of the Sun and directly explore the physics of particle acceleration and transport. The Parker Solar Probe mission has reached the inner heliosphere of the Sun and made measurements of energetic particle events in the near-Sun radiation environment."
https://openalex.org/W2993568883,"High concentrations of antioxidants in cancer cells are huge obstacle in cancer radiotherapy. Erastin was first discovered as an inducer of iron-dependent cell death called ferroptosis accompanied by antioxidant depletion caused by cystine glutamate antiporter inhibition. Therefore, treatment with erastin is expected to potentially enhance cellular radiosensitivity. In this study, we investigated the influence of treatment with erastin on the radiation efficiency against cancers. The clonogenic ability, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression, and glutathione concentration were evaluated using HeLa and NCI-H1975 adenocarcinoma cell lines treated with erastin and/or X-ray irradiation. For in vivo studies, NCI-H1975 cells were transplanted in the left shoulder of nude mice, and then radiosensitizing effect of erastin and glutathione concentration in the cancer were evaluated. Treatment with erastin induced ferroptosis and decreased the concentration of glutathione and GPX4 protein expression levels in the two tumor cell lines. Moreover, erastin enhanced X-ray irradiation-induced cell death in both human tumor cell lines. Furthermore, erastin treatment of a tumor-transplanted mouse model similarly demonstrated the radiosensitizing effect and decrease in intratumoral glutathione concentration in the in vitro study. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the radiosensitizing effect of erastin on two adenocarcinoma cell lines and the tumor xenograft model accompanied by glutathione depletion, indicating that ferroptosis inducers that reduce glutathione concentration could be applied as a novel cancer therapy in combination with radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2993768087,"Remote observations of the solar photospheric light scattered by electrons (the K-corona) and dust (the F-corona or zodiacal light) have been made from the ground during eclipses1 and from space at distances as small as 0.3 astronomical units2–5 to the Sun. Previous observations6–8 of dust scattering have not confirmed the existence of the theoretically predicted dust-free zone near the Sun9–11. The transient nature of the corona has been well characterized for large events, but questions still remain (for example, about the initiation of the corona12 and the production of solar energetic particles13) and for small events even its structure is uncertain14. Here we report imaging of the solar corona15 during the first two perihelion passes (0.16–0.25 astronomical units) of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft13, each lasting ten days. The view from these distances is qualitatively similar to the historical views from ground and space, but there are some notable differences. At short elongations, we observe a decrease in the intensity of the F-coronal intensity, which is suggestive of the long-sought dust free zone9–11. We also resolve the fine-scale plasma structure of very small eruptions, which are frequently ejected from the Sun. These take two forms: the frequently observed magnetic flux ropes12,16 and the predicted, but not yet observed, magnetic islands17,18 arising from the tearing-mode instability in the current sheet. Our observations of the coronal streamer evolution confirm the large-scale topology of the solar corona, but also reveal that, as recently predicted19, streamers are composed of yet smaller substreamers channelling continual density fluctuations at all visible scales. Observations of the solar corona by the Parker Solar Probe reveal evidence for the predicted dust-free zone and confirm that streamers comprise smaller substreamers that channel continuous multiscale density fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2993515799,"Embryonal tumours with multilayered rosettes (ETMRs) are aggressive paediatric embryonal brain tumours with a universally poor prognosis1. Here we collected 193 primary ETMRs and 23 matched relapse samples to investigate the genomic landscape of this distinct tumour type. We found that patients with tumours in which the proposed driver C19MC2–4 was not amplified frequently had germline mutations in DICER1 or other microRNA-related aberrations such as somatic amplification of miR-17-92 (also known as MIR17HG). Whole-genome sequencing revealed that tumours had an overall low recurrence of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), but showed prevalent genomic instability caused by widespread occurrence of R-loop structures. We show that R-loop-associated chromosomal instability can be induced by the loss of DICER1 function. Comparison of primary tumours and matched relapse samples showed a strong conservation of structural variants, but low conservation of SNVs. Moreover, many newly acquired SNVs are associated with a mutational signature related to cisplatin treatment. Finally, we show that targeting R-loops with topoisomerase and PARP inhibitors might be an effective treatment strategy for this deadly disease. Analyses of primary and relapse samples of embryonal tumours with multilayered rosettes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development and opportunities for the treatment of this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W2993348306,"Oxygenic photosynthesis supplies organic carbon to the modern biosphere, but it is uncertain when this metabolism originated. It has previously been proposed1,2 that photosynthetic reaction centres capable of splitting water arose by about 3 billion years ago on the basis of the inferred presence of manganese oxides in Archaean sedimentary rocks. However, this assumes that manganese oxides can be produced only in the presence of molecular oxygen3, reactive oxygen species4,5 or by high-potential photosynthetic reaction centres6,7. Here we show that communities of anoxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms biomineralize manganese oxides in the absence of molecular oxygen and high-potential photosynthetic reaction centres. Microbial oxidation of Mn(II) under strictly anaerobic conditions during the Archaean eon would have produced geochemical signals identical to those used to date the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis before the Great Oxidation Event1,2. This light-dependent process may also produce manganese oxides in the photic zones of modern anoxic water bodies and sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2991704716,"Chronic pain patients often suffer from insomnia or impaired sleep which has been associated with increased pain sensitivity, but a limited amount of studies have investigated the effects of total sleep deprivation on central pain mechanisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of total sleep deprivation on temporal summation, conditioned pain modulation, thermal and pressure pain sensitivity in healthy participants. Twenty-four healthy participants took part in this two-session trial. The measurements were conducted after a night of habitual sleep (baseline) and following 24 hours of total sleep deprivation. Detection thresholds for cold and warmth and pain thresholds for cold and heat were assessed. Cuff induced pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds, temporal summation and conditioned pain modulation were assessed with user-independent, computer-controlled cuff algometry. Conditioned pain modulation was significantly impaired, temporal summation was significantly facilitated and pain sensitivity to pressure and cold pain were significantly increased at follow-up compared with baseline. In conclusion, this study found that one night of total sleep deprivation impaired descending pain pathways, facilitated spinal excitability and sensitized peripheral pathways to cold and pressure pain. Future studies are encouraged to investigate if sleep therapy might normalize pain sensitivity in sleep-deprived chronic pain patients."
https://openalex.org/W2992015012,"Host-mediated microbiome engineering (HMME) is a strategy that utilizes the host phenotype to indirectly select microbiomes though cyclic differentiation and propagation. In this experiment, the host phenotype of delayed onset of seedling water deficit stress symptoms was used to infer beneficial microbiome-host interactions over multiple generations. By utilizing a host-centric selection approach, microbiota are selected at a community level, therein using artificial selection to alter microbiomes through both ecological and evolutionary processes. After six rounds of artificial selection using host-mediated microbiome engineering (HMME), a microbial community was selected that mediated a 5-day delay in the onset of drought symptoms in wheat seedlings. Seedlings grown in potting medium inoculated with the engineered rhizosphere from the 6th round of HMME produced significantly more biomass and root system length, dry weight, and surface area than plants grown in medium similarly mixed with autoclaved inoculum (negative control). The effect on plant water stress tolerance conferred by the inoculum was transferable at subsequent 10-fold and 100-fold dilutions in fresh non-autoclaved medium but was lost at 1000-fold dilution and was completely abolished by autoclaving, indicating the plant phenotype is mediated by microbial population dynamics. The results from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the rhizosphere microbiomes at rounds 0, 3, and 6 revealed taxonomic increases in proteobacteria at the phylum level and betaproteobacteria at the class level. There were significant decreases in alpha diversity in round 6, divergence in speciation with beta diversity between round 0 and 6, and changes in overall community composition. This study demonstrates the potential of using the host as a selective marker to engineer microbiomes that mediate changes in the rhizosphere environment that improve plant adaptation to drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W2984367704,"This study aimed to identify variations in weekly training load, training monotony, and training strain across a 10-week period (during both, pre- and in-season phases); and to analyze the dose-response relationships between training markers and maximal aerobic speed (MAS), maximal oxygen uptake, and isokinetic strength. Twenty-seven professional soccer players (24.9±3.5 years old) were monitored across the 10-week period using global positioning system units. Players were also tested for maximal aerobic speed, maximal oxygen uptake, and isokinetic strength before and after 10 weeks of training. Large positive correlations were found between sum of training load and extension peak torque in the right lower limb (r = 0.57, 90%CI[0.15;0.82]) and the ratio agonist/antagonist in the right lower limb (r = 0.51, [0.06;0.78]). It was observed that loading measures fluctuated across the period of the study and that the load was meaningfully associated with changes in the fitness status of players. However, those magnitudes of correlations were small-to-large, suggesting that variations in fitness level cannot be exclusively explained by the accumulated load and loading profile."
https://openalex.org/W2994300477,"What was once a science fiction fantasy, virtual reality (VR) technology has evolved and come a long way. Together with augmented reality (AR) technology, these simulations of an alternative environment have been incorporated into rehabilitation treatments. The introduction of head-mounted displays has made VR/AR devices more intuitive and compact, and no longer limited to upper-limb rehabilitation. However, there is still limited evidence supporting the use of VR and AR technology during locomotion, especially regarding the safety and efficacy relating to walking biomechanics. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the limitations of such technology through gait analysis. In this study, thirteen participants walked on a treadmill in normal, virtual and augmented versions of the laboratory environment. A series of spatiotemporal parameters and lower-limb joint angles were compared between conditions. The center of pressure (CoP) ellipse area (95% confidence ellipse) was significantly different between conditions (p = 0.002). Pairwise comparisons indicated a significantly greater CoP ellipse area for both the AR (p = 0.002) and VR (p = 0.005) conditions when compared to the normal laboratory condition. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in stride length (p<0.001) and cadence (p<0.001) between conditions. No statistically significant difference was found in the hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics between the three conditions (p>0.082), except for maximum ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.001). These differences in CoP ellipse area indicate that users of head-mounted VR/AR devices had difficulty maintaining a stable position on the treadmill. Also, differences in the gait parameters suggest that users walked with an unusual gait pattern which could potentially affect the effectiveness of gait rehabilitation treatments. Based on these results, position guidance in the form of feedback and the use of specialized treadmills should be considered when using head-mounted VR/AR devices."
https://openalex.org/W2993776955,"Our main interest is to identify how humans maintain upright while walking. Balance during standing and walking is different, primarily due to a gait cycle which the nervous system must contend with a variety of body configurations and frequent perturbations (i.e., heel-strike). We have identified three mechanisms that healthy young adults use to respond to a visually perceived fall to the side. The lateral ankle mechanism and the foot placement mechanism are used to shift the center of pressure in the direction of the perceived fall, and the center of mass away from the perceived fall. The push-off mechanism, a systematic change in ankle plantarflexion angle in the trailing leg, results in fine adjustments to medial-lateral balance near the end of double stance. The focus here is to understand how the three basic balance mechanisms are coordinated to produce an overall balance response. The results indicate that lateral ankle and foot placement mechanisms are inversely related. Larger lateral ankle responses lead to smaller foot placement changes. Correlations involving the push-off mechanism, while significant, were weak. However, the consistency of the correlations across stimulus conditions suggest the push-off mechanism has the role of small adjustments to medial-lateral movement near the end of the balance response. This verifies that a fundamental feature of human bipedal gait is a highly flexible balance system that recruits and coordinates multiple mechanisms to maintain upright balance during walking to accommodate extreme changes in body configuration and frequent perturbations."

https://openalex.org/W2992618300,"To help address a long-standing gap in research and knowledge, this paper explores the issue of what service providers need to be aware of to best meet the needs of ethnic minority children and families who have come to the attention of child protection authorities and have substantiated reports of domestic violence.The results are written in narrative form, combining informed insider perspectives with a small subset of data drawn from a larger rigorous mixed methods study in Australia, that involved an exhaustive literature review, review of 120 randomly selected case files, and in-depth qualitative interviews with 29 ethnic minority families involved in the child protection system and 17 child protection caseworkers.Three issues for ethnic minorities relating to the nexus of child protection and domestic violence are identified: (i) being in the child protection system tarnishes family name, which is greatly valued, leading to a preference for child maltreatment and family violence to remain private, and for compliance with Apprehended Violence Orders (AVOs) and service uptake/engagement to be low, (ii) family cohesion is also highly valued, so family violence victims may sacrifice their own personal safety to protect the family unity and cultural safety of their children, and (iii) family violence interacts with cultural factors for ethnic minorities but does occur in all families; attributing it to race or culture would be racism. Several implications for practice are identified, falling under a broad umbrella approach that asks for child protection authorities and family violence agencies to work collaboratively. A call for empirically rigorous future research is also made to ensure practice is evidence-based."
https://openalex.org/W2994167042,"A unique emotion, elevation, is thought to underlie prosocial contagion, a process whereby witnessing a prosocial act leads to acting prosocially. Individuals differ in their propensity to experience elevation, and thus their proneness to prosocial contagion, but little is known about the causes of such variation. We introduce an adaptationist model wherein elevation marks immediate circumstances in which generalized prosociality is advantageous, with this evaluation of circumstances hinging in part on prior expectations of others’ prosociality. In 15 studies, we add to evidence that elevation can reliably be elicited and mediates prosocial contagion. Importantly, we confirm a novel prediction–generated by our adaptationist account–that an idealistic attitude, which indexes others’ expected degree of prosociality, moderates the relationship between exposure to prosocial cues and experiencing elevation. We discuss how our findings inform both basic theorizing in the affective sciences and translational efforts to engineer a more harmonious world, and we offer future research directions to further test and extend our model."
https://openalex.org/W2992620197,"Sensing of red and far-red light by bacteriophytochromes involves intricate interactions between their bilin chromophore and the protein environment. The light-triggered rearrangements of the cofactor configuration and eventually the protein conformation enable bacteriophytochromes to interact with various protein effector domains for biological modulation of diverse physiological functions. Excitation of the holoproteins by red or far-red light promotes the photoconversion to their far-red light–absorbing Pfr state or the red light-absorbing Pr state, respectively. Because prototypical bacteriophytochromes have a parallel dimer architecture, it is generally assumed that symmetric activation with two Pfr state protomers constitutes the signaling-active species. However, the bacteriophytochrome from Idiomarina species A28L (IsPadC) has recently been reported to enable long-range signal transduction also in asymmetric dimers containing only one Pfr protomer. By combining crystallography, hydrogen–deuterium exchange coupled to MS, and vibrational spectroscopy, we show here that Pfr of IsPadC is in equilibrium with an intermediate “Pfr-like” state that combines features of Pfr and Meta-R states observed in other bacteriophytochromes. We also show that structural rearrangements in the N-terminal segment (NTS) can stabilize this Pfr-like state and that the PHY-tongue conformation of IsPadC is partially uncoupled from the initial changes in the NTS. This uncoupling enables structural asymmetry of the overall homodimeric assembly and allows signal transduction to the covalently linked physiological diguanylate cyclase output module in which asymmetry might play a role in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The functional differences to other phytochrome systems identified here highlight opportunities for using additional red-light sensors in artificial sensor–effector systems. Sensing of red and far-red light by bacteriophytochromes involves intricate interactions between their bilin chromophore and the protein environment. The light-triggered rearrangements of the cofactor configuration and eventually the protein conformation enable bacteriophytochromes to interact with various protein effector domains for biological modulation of diverse physiological functions. Excitation of the holoproteins by red or far-red light promotes the photoconversion to their far-red light–absorbing Pfr state or the red light-absorbing Pr state, respectively. Because prototypical bacteriophytochromes have a parallel dimer architecture, it is generally assumed that symmetric activation with two Pfr state protomers constitutes the signaling-active species. However, the bacteriophytochrome from Idiomarina species A28L (IsPadC) has recently been reported to enable long-range signal transduction also in asymmetric dimers containing only one Pfr protomer. By combining crystallography, hydrogen–deuterium exchange coupled to MS, and vibrational spectroscopy, we show here that Pfr of IsPadC is in equilibrium with an intermediate “Pfr-like” state that combines features of Pfr and Meta-R states observed in other bacteriophytochromes. We also show that structural rearrangements in the N-terminal segment (NTS) can stabilize this Pfr-like state and that the PHY-tongue conformation of IsPadC is partially uncoupled from the initial changes in the NTS. This uncoupling enables structural asymmetry of the overall homodimeric assembly and allows signal transduction to the covalently linked physiological diguanylate cyclase output module in which asymmetry might play a role in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The functional differences to other phytochrome systems identified here highlight opportunities for using additional red-light sensors in artificial sensor–effector systems."
https://openalex.org/W2992773260,"Vedolizumab is the first gut-selective integrin blocker indicated for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to examine the adverse events (AEs) profile of vedolizumab compared to anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) indicated for CD and UC using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. AE reports with vedolizumab (5/20/2014-6/30/2015) and CD/UC-indicated anti-TNF drugs (adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab, during 8/1/1998-6/30/2015) as primary suspects were extracted from the FAERS database. AEs associated with vedolizumab were compared for signals of disproportionate reporting against anti-TNF drugs and all other drugs (1969-6/30/2015), using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and the empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EBGM) algorithms. The search retrieved 499 reports for vedolizumab and 119,620 reports for anti-TNFs, with 35.9% and 32.1% of these, respectively, being serious AEs. With the PRR approach, vedolizumab-associated reports had signals for 22 groups of AEs (9 were associated with serious outcomes) relative to anti-TNFs and had 34 signals relative to all other drugs. Signals detected included those reported as warnings in prescribing information and new AEs related to cardiovascular disease. Due to the voluntary nature of FAERS, this finding should be considered hypothesis generating (rather than hypothesis testing). Longer-term observational studies are required to evaluate the safety of vedolizumab."
https://openalex.org/W2992969094,"Ovarian tissue contains large pools of immature oocytes enclosed in primordial follicles, making it an attractive target for fertility preservation in female cancer patients, livestock and wild species. Compared to cryopreservation, desiccation and long-term storage of samples at supra-zero temperatures (using strategies inspired from small organisms to resist extreme environments) would be more cost-effective and convenient. The objective of the study was to characterize the influence of microwave-assisted dehydration on structural and functional properties of living ovarian tissues. While this method allows preservation of single cells (cat oocytes and sperm cells so far) using trehalose as the xeroprotectant, it has not been developed for multicellular tissues yet. Ovarian cortex biopsies were reversibly permeabilized, exposed to various concentrations of trehalose, and dried for different times using a commercial microwave under thermal control. Effective dehydration of samples along with proper trehalose retention were reached within 30 min of microwave drying. Importantly, the process did not affect morphology and DNA integrity of follicles or stromal cells. Moreover, transcriptional activity and survival of follicles were partially maintained following 10 min of drying, which already was compatible with storage at non-cryogenic temperatures. Present data provide critical foundation to develop dry-preservation techniques for long-term storage of living multicellular tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2337121348,"Human communication is invariably executed in the form of a narrative, an account of connected events comprising characters, actions, and settings. A coherent and well-structured narrative is therefore essential for effective communication, confusion caused by a haphazard attempt at storytelling being a common experience. This also suggests that a scientific understanding of how a narrative is formed and delivered is key to understanding human communication and dialog. Here we show that the definition of a narrative lends itself naturally to network-based modeling and analysis, and they can be further enriched by incorporating various text analysis methods from computational linguistics. We model the temporally unfolding nature of narrative as a dynamical growing network of nodes and edges representing characters and interactions, which allows us to characterize the story progression using the network growth pattern. We also introduce the concept of an interaction map between characters based on associated sentiments and topics identified from the text that characterize their relationships explicitly. We demonstrate the methods via application to Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables. Going beyond simple, aggregate occurrence-based methods for narrative representation and analysis, our proposed methods show promise in uncovering its essential nature of a highly complex, dynamic system that reflects the rich structure of human interaction and communication."

To assess the level of agreement between the participants' approval of FGC and their perceptions about approval among other Swedish Somalis, Bangdiwala's B-statistic and Welch's t-test were used.We found a substantial agreement between an individual's own approval of FGC and their perceived approval of FGC among most other Swedish Somali men (B-statistic = 0.85) and women (B-statistic = 0.76). However, we also found a tendency for participants to report that other Swedish Somalis-and especially other Swedish Somali women-approved of FGC, while they themselves did not. Perceived percentage of Somali girls being circumcised in Sweden was significantly higher among Swedish Somalis who said they wanted tissue to be removed on their own daughter (mean 23%, 95% CI: 18.3-27.9) compared to those who said they opposed removal of tissue on their own daughter (mean 8%, 95% CI: 6.4-9.1). The majority of Swedish Somali men (92%) stated a preference to marry someone without FGC or with pricking, which was also the view of most of the Swedish Somali women (90%).Swedish Somalis motivation to continue or discontinue with the practice of FGC may be influenced by perceptions of what other Swedish Somalis prefer. How FGC is being portrayed, in for example media reports, could therefore have an impact on attitudes towards FGC."
https://openalex.org/W2993533121,"The development of new improved varieties is one of the major goals of plant breeding. Concomitantly, the demand for stable, eco-friendly, and high-quality rice production is constantly increasing. However, most farmers prefer to cultivate familiar rice varieties developed more than 10 years ago to minimize economic risk. A strategy is needed to develop rice varieties without the limitations of the preferred old varieties. Here, we tested the rapid development of near isogenic lines (NILs) using a rapid generation advance system together with marker-assisted backcrossing to overcome the shortcomings of parental materials. For this purpose, we chose rice stripe virus (RSV) susceptible variety Unkwang and RSV resistant variety Haedamssal as experimental materials. First, we backcrossed and screened BC1F1 and BC2F1 plants having similar agronomic traits as Unkwang and the heterozygous genotype for RSV resistant specific marker InDel7 from Haedamssal. Secondly, the genetic background of 11 BC2F1 plants was identified with 73 KASP markers; plants of line YR32548-8 showed 84.5% of recovery of the recurrent parent genome. Among 28 BC2F2 plants, YR32548-8-16 was the line that showed maximum recovery of the recurrent parent genome (96.2%) while effectively introgressed with RSV-resistance loci on chromosome 11. Finally, we selected line YR32548-8-16 as an NIL showing an RSV resistant phenotype and similar agronomic traits to Unkwang. This fast breeding approach will be useful in rice breeding programs for the improvement of varieties preferred by farmers for their stress tolerance, yield, or quality."
https://openalex.org/W2992206191,"BACKGROUND Melanoma survivors often do not engage in adequate sun protection, leading to sunburn and increasing their risk of future melanomas. Melanoma survivors do not accurately recall the extent of sun exposure they have received, thus, they may be unaware of their personal UV exposure, and this lack of awareness may contribute towards failure to change behavior. As a means of determining behavioral accuracy of recall of sun exposure, this study compared subjective self-reports of time outdoors to an objective wearable sensor. Analysis of the meaningful discrepancies between the self-report and sensor measures of time outdoors was made possible by using a network flow algorithm to align sun exposure events recorded by both measures. Aligning the two measures provides the opportunity to more accurately evaluate false positive and false negative self-reports of behavior and understand participant tendencies to over- and under-report behavior. METHODS 39 melanoma survivors wore an ultraviolet light (UV) sensor on their chest while outdoors for 10 consecutive summer days and provided an end-of-day subjective self-report of their behavior while outdoors. A Network Flow Alignment framework was used to align self-report and objective UV sensor data to correct misalignment. The frequency and time of day of under- and over-reporting were identified. FINDINGS For the 269 days assessed, the proposed framework showed a significant increase in the Jaccard coefficient (i.e. a measure of similarity between self-report and UV sensor data) by 63.64% (p < .001), and significant reduction in false negative minutes by 34.43% (p < .001). Following alignment of the measures, under-reporting of sun exposure time occurred on 51% of the days analyzed and more participants tended to under-report than to over-report sun exposure time. Rates of under-reporting of sun exposure were highest for events that began from 12-1pm, and second-highest from 5-6pm. CONCLUSION These discrepancies may reflect lack of accurate recall of sun exposure during times of peak sun intensity (10am-2pm) that could ultimately increase the risk of developing melanoma. This research provides technical contributions to the field of wearable computing, activity recognition, and identifies actionable times to improve participants' perception of their sun exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2993646040,"Although different gender associations between self-rated health (SRH) and mortality have been reported, the results of the respective studies have been inconsistent and little is known about the cause-specific relation of mortality with SRH by gender. Therefore, to evaluate the gender differences in all-cause or specific causes of mortality by SRH, this retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data of 19,770 Korean adults aged 50 years and over who underwent health screening at Seoul National University Hospital between March 1995 and December 2008. SRH was surveyed using a simple questionnaire, and the all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality were followed up from baseline screening until December 31, 2016. Results showed that the relationship between SRH and all-cause mortality differed by gender, and the differences also varied depending on the cause of death. In men, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause mortality was higher in the poor SRH group than the very good SRH groups even after adjustment for socio-demographic, clinical, and behavioral risk factors (aHR:1.97, 95% CI 1.51-2.56), and these results were similar to those for cancer, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease mortalities (aHR:1.52, 95% CI 0.93-2.50; aHR: 2.11, 95% CI 1.19-3.74; aHR:10.30, 95% CI 2.39-44.44, respectively). However, in women, the association between SRH and all-cause mortality was insignificant, and inverse relationships were found for cardiovascular and respiratory disease mortalities in the poor and very good SRH groups. Cancer mortality had a positive relation with SRH (aHR: 1.14, 95% CI 0.75-1.72; aHR: 2.58, 95% CI 1.03-6.48; aHR: 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.98; aHR: 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.57: all-cause, cancer, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease mortalities, respectively). Clinicians need to take these gender differences by SRH into account when evaluating the health status of over-middle aged adults."
https://openalex.org/W2991751691,"Two decades of research have uncovered the mechanism by which the complex of tissue factor (TF) and the plasma serine protease factor VIIa (FVIIa) mediates the initiation of blood coagulation.

At least two interdependent allosteric activation pathways originate at the FVIIa:sTF interface are proposed to enhance FVIIa activity upon sTF binding. Here, we sought to engineer an sTF-independent FVIIa variant by stabilizing both proposed pathways, with one pathway terminating at segment 215–217 in the activation domain and the other pathway terminating at the N terminus insertion site. To stabilize segment 215–217, we replaced the flexible 170 loop of FVIIa with the more rigid 170 loop from trypsin and combined it with an L163V substitution (FVIIa-VYT). The FVIIa-VYT variant exhibited 60-fold higher amidolytic activity than FVIIa, and displayed similar FX activation and antithrombin inhibition kinetics to the FVIIa.sTF complex. The sTF-independent activity of FVIIa-VYT was partly mediated by an increase in the N terminus insertion and, as shown by X-ray crystallography, partly by Tyr-172 inserting into a cavity in the activation domain stabilizing the S1 substrate-binding pocket. The combination with L163V likely drove additional changes in a delicate hydrogen-bonding network that further stabilized S1–S3 sites.

https://openalex.org/W2993352126,"Despite being widely studied, the underlying mechanisms of transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (TMS) induced motor evoked potential (MEP), early cortical silent period (CSP) and rebound activity are not fully understood. Our aim is to better characterize these phenomena by combining various analysis tools on firing motor units. Responses of 29 tibialis anterior (TA) and 8 abductor pollicis brevis (APB) motor units to TMS pulses were studied using discharge rate and probability-based tools to illustrate the profile of the synaptic potentials as they develop on motoneurons in 24 healthy volunteers. According to probability-based methods, TMS pulse produces a short-latency MEP which is immediately followed by CSP that terminates at rebound activity. Discharge rate analysis, however, revealed not three, but just two events with distinct time courses; a long-lasting excitatory period (71.2 ± 9.0 ms for TA and 42.1 ± 11.2 ms for APB) and a long-latency inhibitory period with duration of 57.9 ± 9.5 ms for TA and 67.3 ± 13.8 ms for APB. We propose that part of the CSP may relate to the falling phase of net excitatory postsynaptic potential induced by TMS. Rebound activity, on the other hand, may represent tendon organ inhibition induced by MEP activated soleus contraction and/or long-latency intracortical inhibition. Due to generation of field potentials when high intensity TMS is used, this study is limited to investigate the events evoked by low intensity TMS only and does not provide information about later parts of much longer CSPs induced by high intensity TMS. Adding discharge rate analysis contributes to obtain a more accurate picture about the characteristics of TMS-induced events. These results have implications for interpreting motor responses following TMS for diagnosis and overseeing recovery from various neurological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2992743837,"Background It is unclear how adverse childhood family environments differentially impact adult health outcomes among men and women. This brief communication reports on the independent and joint effects of adverse childhood family environments and sex on indicators of health in adulthood. Methods & Results 213 18-55-year olds reported on their childhood family environment (Risky Families Questionnaire (RFQ); Family Environment Scale (FEStotal)) and their current perceived stress and depressive and anxious affect. Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were taken during a laboratory visit, and total cortisol output was measured in saliva samples collected at home. Exposure to childhood adversity did not vary by sex. Women had lower SBP, DBP, and total cortisol output, but higher HR, than men (ps < .05). Sex moderated the association between childhood family environment and SBP (RFQ: B = -.316; SE = .120; p = .009; FEStotal: B = -.274; SE = .117; p = .021) and DBP (FEStotal: B = -.193; SE = .094; p = .041), such that exposure to greater childhood adversity was linked to lower BP in women only. Results were largely unchanged after adjusting for concurrent perceived stress and depressive and anxious affect. Separate effects of individual FES subscales are also discussed. Conclusions Contrary to expectations, exposure to adverse childhood family environments was associated with lower resting BP among women, perhaps indicative of basal cardiovascular hypoactivation, whereas early adversity was not linked to BP among men."
https://openalex.org/W2992652568,"Objectives Estimating associations between somatic and socioeconomic risk factors and post-discharge under-five mortality. Design Register-based national cohort study using multiple Cox regression. Participants The population of 1,263,795 Danish children live-born 1997–2016 who survived until date of first discharge to the home after birth was followed from that date until death, emigration, 5 years of age or 31 December 2016. Main outcome measures (A) Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) among all children, (B) mortality HRs among children without severe chronic disease, and (C) mortality HRs among children without severe chronic disease or asthma. Main results In the total population (1,947 deaths) severe chronic disease was associated with mortality HR = 15.28 (95% CI: 13.77–16.95). In children without severe chronic-disease (719 deaths) other somatic risk factors were immature birth HR = 3.40 (1.92–6.02), maternal smoking HR = 1.84 (1.55–2.18) and low birth weight HR = 1.74 (1.21–2.51). Socioeconomic risk factors for mortality included: maternal age < 25 years HR = 1.91 (1.38–2.64) compared to > 35 years (similar for 30–35 years and 25–29 years), lowest vs. highest family income tertile HR = 1.76 (1.23–2.51), not living with both parents HR = 1.63 (1.25–2.13), maternal unemployment HR = 1.54 (1.12–2.12), presence of siblings HR = 1.44 (1.20–1.71) and secondary vs. tertiary parental education HR = 1.33 (1.07–1.65) for fathers and HR = 1.23 (1.01–1.52) for mothers. Factors not found to be associated with child mortality in this population included presence of asthma HR = 1.29 (0.83–1.98) and non-Danish ethnicity HR = 0.98 (0.70–1.37). Conclusions Childhood death after discharge to the home after birth and before 5 years of age is a very rare event in Denmark. This ‘post-discharge’ mortality was heavily associated with severe chronic disease. In children without severe chronic disease, immature birth, maternal smoking and certain socioeconomic characteristics were noticeable risk factors. Mortality may possibly be decreased by focusing on vulnerable groups."

Studies have suggested links between non-normal weight status or weight perception and youths having fewer confidants, but these relationships are unclear and remain to be studied. This preliminary cross-sectional study examined the effects of weight status and weight perception on the number of confidants in adolescents. Self-report data from 15,279 grade 7–12 students (54.2% boys) were analyzed. The number of confidants (0–3 or ≥ 4) was examined, according to five weight status categories (underweight, low-normal weight, mid-normal weight (reference), high-normal weight, overweight, with Body Mass Index corresponding to ≤ 18.5, ≤ 20.0, ≤ 22.5, ≤ 25.0 and > 25.0 in adults, respectively), and five weight perception categories (too thin, a bit thin, good (reference), a bit fat, too fat). Boys and girls who were overweight and those who perceived themselves to be too fat were significantly more likely to have few confidants. High-normal weight in girls and self-perception of being a bit fat in boys were also associated with having few confidants. In boys, underweight and self-perception of being too thin were additionally associated with having few confidants. Adolescents with non-normal weight status or weight perception may have fewer confidants and require more social support."

We further evaluated whether the first-4-week ESR variability can predict the trajectory pattern, treatment duration and recurrence of PVO.The longitudinal ESR patterns of adults with PVO within the first 6 months were characterized through group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM). The ESR variability within the first 4 weeks was defined using the absolute difference (AD), coefficient of variation, percent change, and slope change. The first-4-week ESR variabilities were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression to predict the 6-month ESR trajectory and using logistic regression to predict treatment duration and recurrence likelihood. The discrimination and calibration of the prediction models were evaluated.Three ESR trajectory patterns were identified though GBTM among patients with PVO: Group 1, initial moderate high ESR with fast response; Group 2, initial high ESR with fast response; Group 3, initial high ESR with slow response. Group 3 patients (initial high ESR with slow response) were older, received longer antibiotic treatment, and had more comorbidities and higher recurrence rates than patients in the other two groups. The initial ESR value and ESR - AD could predict the 6-month ESR trajectory. By incorporating the first-4-week ESR variabilities and the clinical features of patients, our models exhibited moderate discrimination performance to predict prolonged treatment (≥12 weeks; C statistic, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.81) and recurrence (C statistic, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.78).The initial ESR value and first-4-week ESR variability are useful markers to predict the treatment duration and recurrence of PVO.

We aimed to develop a predictive model for gastric microbiome based on serologic testing.This study was designed to analyze sequencing data obtained from the Hanyang University Gastric Microbiome Cohort, which was established initially to investigate gastric microbial composition according to the intragastric environment. We evaluated the relationship between the relative abundance of potential gastric cancer-associated bacteria (nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria or type IV secretion system [T4SS] protein gene-contributing bacteria) and serologic markers (IgG anti-Helicobacter pylori [HP] antibody or pepsinogen [PG] levels).We included 57 and 26 participants without and with HP infection, respectively. The relative abundance of nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria was 4.9% and 3.6% in the HP-negative and HP-positive groups, respectively, while that of T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria was 20.5% and 6.5% in the HP-negative and HP-positive groups, respectively. The relative abundance of both nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria increased exponentially as PG levels decreased. Advanced age (only for nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria), a negative result of IgG anti-HP antibody, low PG levels, and high Charlson comorbidity index were associated with a high relative abundance of nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) was 53.7% and 70.0% in the model for nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria, respectively.Not only the negative results of IgG anti-HP antibody but also low PG levels were associated with a high abundance of nitrosating/nitrate-reducing bacteria and T4SS protein gene-contributing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2994071702,"Introduction While several studies have focussed on the experiences of women living with infertility, there is a paucity of information related to understandings, representations and actions of key stakeholders (i.e. organisations and individual actors involved in activities or professional care surrounding infertility) when it comes to infertility in Sub-Saharan Africa. This ethnographic study conducted in The Gambia, West Africa, focuses on how key stakeholders in the country understand infertility, and on their activities to improve the lives of people with infertility. Methodology This ethnographic study draws on primary and secondary data for thematic analysis. Primary qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews, observations, informal conversations and group discussion with various stakeholders (i.e. health care providers and representatives of non-governmental, governmental and international organisations). Sources of secondary data included government and non-governmental reports and media outputs. Results Results illustrated that most key stakeholders had a good understanding of the cultural frameworks and social realities of women living with infertility, with less focus on, or awareness of, men’s experiences of infertility. We distinguished three different positions of these actors and organisations, first, the infertility supporters, i.e. those who despite political challenges and a lack of funding, initiated activities to raise awareness about the problems people with infertility are facing and aim to increase access to infertility services. The second are moderate supporters, i.e. those who recognise the problems infertility poses and whose organisations target some of the perceived causes of infertility (i.e. lack of health education and harmful cultural practices). A third group of neutral or moderate opponents consist mainly of formal health care providers who do not consider infertility a current priority, given many competing demands in the resource-constrained healthcare system. Conclusion While international donors still largely neglect the emotional and social implications of infertility in Sub-Saharan African countries, some local stakeholders are working to bring services closer to people with infertility. The efforts of these local stakeholders require support and integration, and should include engaging with different groups for widespread sensitisation to reduce stigma and promote attendance to health centres for reproductive health challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2991877662,"We present a method for identifying features (time periods of interest) in data sets consisting of time-indexed model output. The method is used as a diagnostic to quickly focus the attention on a subset of the data before further analysis methods are applied. Mathematically, the infinity norm errors of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) reconstructions are calculated for each time output. The result is an EOF reconstruction error map which clearly identifies features as changes in the error structure over time. The ubiquity of EOF-type methods in a wide range of disciplines reduces barriers to comprehension and implementation of the method. We apply the error map method to three different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data sets as examples: the development of a spontaneous instability in a large amplitude internal solitary wave, an internal wave interacting with a density profile change, and the collision of two waves of different vertical mode. In all cases the EOF error map method identifies relevant features which are worthy of further study."
https://openalex.org/W2992214302,"Animals change their behaviors in response to external stimuli, and numerous neurotransmitters are involved in these behavioral changes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, serotonin (5-HT) affects various behaviors such as inhibition of locomotion, stimulation of egg laying, and pharyngeal pumping. Previous research has shown that the neural activity of the RID interneuron increases when the worm moves forward, and the RID is necessary for sustaining forward locomotion. However, the relationship between 5-HT and neural activity of RID, and how it modulates the behavior of the worm has not been investigated. In this article, we reveal the relationship among 5-HT, RID activity, and the behavior of worms using a custom-made tracking and imaging system. We simultaneously measured the neural activity of the RID and behavior in worms with three conditions: mock animals, animals pre-exposed to 5-HT, and 5-HT receptor mod-1 mutants. As shown in previous research, the neural activity of the RID increased during the transition from backward to forward, whereas it decreased during the transition from forward to backward in mock animals. These changes in neural activity were not observed in animals pre-exposed to 5-HT and mod-1 mutants. Moreover, RID activity was correlated with the velocity of the worm in mock animals. However, this correlation was not observed in animals pre-exposed to 5-HT and mod-1 mutants. Our results demonstrate that 5-HT modulates the activity of the RID interneuron, and we infer that the RID plays a role in modulating forward locomotion by changing its activity through 5-HT."
https://openalex.org/W2993143082,"DNA polymerase β has two DNA-binding domains that interact with the opposite sides of short DNA gaps. These domains contribute two activities that modify the 5' and 3' margins of gapped DNA during base excision repair. DNA gaps greater than 1 nucleotide (nt) pose an architectural and logistical problem for the two domains to interact with their respective DNA termini. Here, crystallographic and kinetic analyses of 2-nt gap-filling DNA synthesis revealed that the fidelity of DNA synthesis depends on local sequence context. This was due to template dynamics that altered which of the two template nucleotides in the gap served as the coding nucleotide. We observed that, when a purine nucleotide was in the first coding position, DNA synthesis fidelity was similar to that observed with a 1-nt gap. However, when the initial templating nucleotide was a pyrimidine, fidelity was decreased. If the first templating nucleotide was a cytidine, there was a significantly higher probability that the downstream template nucleotide coded for the incoming nucleotide. This dNTP-stabilized misalignment reduced base substitution and frameshift deletion fidelities. A crystal structure of a binary DNA product complex revealed that the cytidine in the first templating site was in an extrahelical position, permitting the downstream template nucleotide to occupy the coding position. These results indicate that DNA polymerase β can induce a strain in the DNA that modulates the position of the coding nucleotide and thereby impacts the identity of the incoming nucleotide. Our findings demonstrate that ""correct"" DNA synthesis can result in errors when template dynamics induce coding ambiguity."

Methods Early state of left ventricular dysfunction (ELVD) and symptomatic systolic heart failure (HF) were both induced in rabbits by tachypacing. Tissue of limb muscle (LM) was subjected to histologic assessment. For unbiased characterisation of early and late myopathy, a proteomic approach followed by computational pathway-analyses was performed and combined with pathway-focused gene expression analyses. Specimen of thoracic diaphragm (TD) served as control for inactivity-induced skeletal muscle alterations. In a subsequent study, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-system and neprilysin (RAS-/NEP) was compared to placebo. Results HF was accompanied by loss of protein content (8.7±0.4% vs. 7.0±0.5%, mean±SEM, control vs. HF, p<0.01) and a slow-to-fast fibre type switch, establishing hallmarks of cachexia. In ELVD, the enzymatic set-up of LM and TD shifted to a catabolic state. A disturbed malate-aspartate shuttle went well with increased enzymes of glycolysis, forming the enzymatic basis for enforced anoxic energy regeneration. The histological findings and the pathway analysis of metabolic results drew the picture of suppressed PGC-1α signalling, linked to the natriuretic peptide system. In HF, natriuretic peptide signalling was desensitised, as confirmed by an increase in the ratio of serum BNP to tissue cGMP (57.0±18.6pg/ml/nM/ml vs. 165.8±16.76pg/ml/nM/ml, p<0.05) and a reduced expression of natriuretic peptide receptor-A. In HF, combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition prevented from loss in protein content (8.7±0.3% vs. 6.0±0.6% vs. 8.3±0.9%, Baseline vs. HF-Placebo vs. HF-RAS/NEP, p<0.05 Baseline vs. HF-Placebo, p = 0.7 Baseline vs. HF-RAS/NEP). Conclusions Tachypacing-induced heart failure entails a generalised myopathy, preceding systolic dysfunction. The characterisation of “pre-cachectic” state and its progression is feasible. Early enzymatic alterations of LM depict a catabolic state, rendering LM prone to futile substrate metabolism. A combined RAS-/NEP-inhibition ameliorates cardiac-induced myopathy independent of systolic function, which could be linked to stabilised natriuretic peptide/cGMP/PGC-1α signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2993249600,"Pulmonary surfactant preparations extracted from natural sources have been used to treat millions of newborn babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and can possibly also be used to treat other lung diseases. Due to costly production and limited supply of animal-derived surfactants, synthetic alternatives are attractive. The water insolubility and aggregation-prone nature of the proteins present in animal-derived surfactant preparations have complicated development of artificial surfactant. A non-aggregating analog of lung surfactant protein C, SP-C33Leu is used in synthetic surfactant and we recently described an efficient method to produce rSP-C33Leu in bacteria. Here rSP-C33Leu obtained by salt precipitation of bacterial extracts was purified by two-step liquid gel chromatography and analyzed using mass spectrometry and RP-HPLC, showing that it is void of modifications and adducts. Premature New Zealand White rabbit fetuses instilled with 200mg/kg of 2% of rSP-C33Leu in phospholipids and ventilated with a positive end expiratory pressure showed increased tidal volumes and lung gas volumes compared to animals treated with phospholipids only. This shows that rSP-C33Leu can be purified from bacterial lipids and that rSP-C33Leu surfactant is active against experimental RDS."

The recently developed algorithm using a reduced Google matrix (REGOMAX) allows us to take account both of direct Markov transitions between these articles and also of indirect transitions generated by the pathways between them via the global Wikipedia network. This approach therefore provides a compact description of interactions between these articles that allows us to determine the friendship networks between them, as well as the PageRank sensitivity of countries to pharmaceutical companies and rare renal diseases. We also show that the top pharmaceutical companies in terms of their Wikipedia PageRank are not those with the highest market capitalization."
