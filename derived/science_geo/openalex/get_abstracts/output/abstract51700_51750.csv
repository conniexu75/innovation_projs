https://openalex.org/W1507096872,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) has been isolated and purified from the cytosol fraction of rat liver to give a specific activity of 14 to 16 µmoles of bicarbonate fixed per min per mg of protein. The enzyme is homogeneous on disc electrophoresis and Sephadex G-100 chromatography and has a molecular weight of 74,500 with an isoelectric point of 5.04. Antibodies prepared in rabbits against the pure enzyme show identical titration curves against the cytosol P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase of liver and adipose tissue. A single continuous precipitation line is obtained on Ouchterlony double diffusion precipitation analysis when pure enzyme and the cytosol P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase of liver and adipose tissue are compared. On the other hand, the solubilized mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase of rat liver is not precipitated by the antibody to the cytosol enzyme. We conclude that the mitochrondrial and cytosol P-enolpyruvate carboxykinases are distinct enzymes, notwithstanding their uniform kinetic and physical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1589853271,"The synthesis and turnover of the total proteins of endoplasmic reticulum membranes and of two enzymes, i.e. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome b5, isolated and purified from these membranes, have been studied during treatment with phenobarbital, one of the drugs known to induce an increase in the activity of hydroxylating enzymes and in the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes in rat hepatocytes. A single phenobarbital dose induces a prompt increase in the rate of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase synthesis without affecting the production of cytochrome b5. The induced reductase is chromatographically and immunochemically identical with the enzyme normally produced by the liver. Repeated phenobarbital doses cause a large increase in NADPH-cytochrome c reductase amount concomitantly with a moderate rise in cytochrome b5 content. Both effects appear to result from a drastic reduction in rates of enzyme degradation. Cessation of phenobarbital treatment is promptly followed by a progressive reduction in NADPH-cytochrome c reductase amount caused by a large increase in the rate of degradation of the enzyme in the face of continued synthesis. The findings indicate that the rates of synthesis and degradation of the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase vary conversely in the induction process. The relevance of these findings to the control of the turnover of membrane enzymes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1581784973,"Abstract Livers isolated from normal, male, fed rats were perfused for 12 hours with bovine or rabbit red blood cells suspended in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution containing bovine serum albumin (3.0 g/100 ml) with l-lysine-1-14C and 500 mg of glucose continuously infused. Net synthesis of five specific plasma proteins was estimated by serological measurements of changes in their concentration in perfusate. The influence of insulin, cortisol, and growth hormone, and of a nutritionally complete mixture of amino acids on net synthesis of plasma proteins was evaluated. Control perfusions (no hormones or amino acids added) resulted in relatively linear net synthesis of the specific plasma proteins throughout the experiments. In experiments with full supplementation (insulin, cortisol, growth hormone, and the amino acid mixture) fibrinogen and haptoglobin synthesis increased 3-fold between 2 and 6 hours, α1-acid glycoprotein synthesis increased 3.5-fold between 4 and 8 hours, and α2 (acute phase)-globulin synthesis increased 11-fold between 8 and 10 hours. Increases in the latter four proteins were critically dependent upon the presence of cortisol and represented the first demonstration in vitro of hormone effects on net plasma protein synthesis. These effects may be important for understanding the increased blood levels of certain plasma α and β globulins that occur in vivo in mammals after many forms of injury and may serve as a useful model for furthering our understanding of the influence of hormones and amino acids on protein synthesis. Maximum net plasma protein synthesis occurred in perfusions with positive nitrogen balance (more net amino acid nitrogen loss from perfusate than urea nitrogen gain). Under the conditions employed the combination of amino acids and insulin was the minimal partial supplementation required for positive nitrogen balance. Additional data are presented on effects of amino acids and hormones on incorporation of l-lysine-1-14C into total plasma proteins and hepatic proteins, oxidation of l-lysine-1-14C to 14CO2, production of bile, utilization of glucose, net urea synthesis, net changes in amino acid nitrogen, and on nitrogen balance as defined for the liver perfusion system."

Little immunoglobulin appears immediately before, during, and immediately after mitosis. The results indicate that transcription of immunoglobulin genes takes place during a limited part of the mitotic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1506714076,"The primary structure of Bence-Jones proteins is characterized by a variable amino acid sequence in the amino-terminal half and a constant amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal half. Proteins corresponding either to the variant half or to the constant half of whole Bence-Jones proteins have been detected in urine of patients with multiple myeloma. Both halves of a Bence-Jones protein were detected in the urine of one patient, and in another patient the constant half of a Bence-Jones protein was found in serum as well as urine. Metabolic studies indicated that the variant half and the constant half can result from catabolism of the whole molecule, and biosynthetic studies suggested that the variant and constant halves may also have synthetic origin. Bence-Jones proteins and light chains isolated from G- or A-myeloma proteins were cleaved in vitro into the variant half and the constant half. Cleavage was initiated by a proteolytic factor in urine as well as by several types of endopeptidases, and definitive immunochemical identification of the cleaved products as variant half and constant half required development of specific antisera. Particular susceptibility to proteolysis of the peptide bond between the variant half and constant half of Bence-Jones proteins and between the variant half and constant half of light chains provides the first direct evidence for the presence of an exposed area in the switch region of these molecules. The ability to cleave specifically Bence-Jones proteins and light chains makes possible the preparation and isolation of variant halves and constant halves in quantities sufficient for studies of the individual properties of each half. Studies on the isolated variant halves and constant halves of Bence-Jones proteins indicated that the variant half was more resistant to proteolysis than the constant half, was crystallizable, and had thermal solubility behavior identical with that of the intact Bence-Jones protein."

https://openalex.org/W1538535811,"Abstract Phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) is oxidized to CO2 in rat liver whole cell homogenates or washed mitochondria supplemented with ATP, NAD+, and NADPH. In the course of this degradation, α-hydroxyphytanic, pristanic, Δ2-pristenic, and 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoic acids are formed as intermediates; they have been identified by gas-liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. The proposed mechanism of mammalian catabolism of phytanic acid involves initial α oxidation leading through α-hydroxyphytanic acid to pristanic acid, and subsequent β oxidations. The α-oxidative process requires NADPH and O2, and the addition of Fe+++ ions greatly stimulates this reaction. Fe++ and a number of other heavy metal ions, as well as dipyridyl, lipoic acid, CoA—SH, and H2O2 generated in situ strongly inhibit it, whereas ascorbic acid, imidazole, aminopterin, and folic acid have little or no effect. The properties of the mammalian phytanic acid-α-oxidizing enzyme are discussed and compared with those of straight chain fatty acid-α-oxidizing systems in plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W1566698477,"Abstract A 14C-diterpene alcohol (copalol) was isolated as its 4-(4'-nitrophenylazo)benzoyl ester from a soluble enzyme system which had been prepared from a cell-free extract of mycelia of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi and incubated with 2-14C-mevalonate, ATP, and MgCl2. Copalol was identified as trans-(-)-labda-8(16),13-dien-15-ol from its properties in comparison with those of the enantiomeric alcohol synthesized from manool. 14C-Geranylgeraniol and 14C-(-)-kaurene were also identified as diterpenes formed in these incubation mixtures. All three diterpenes were also found as products when trans-14C-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was used as the substrate in place of 2-14C-mevalonate and ATP. A substance with the properties expected for 14C-copalyl pyrophosphate was also extracted with collidine from these incubation mixtures with either 2-14C-mevalonate or trans-14C-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as the substrate. The structure of the purified product was established as copalyl pyrophosphate by showing (a) that it yielded copalol on treatment with alkaline phosphatase and (b) that the doubly labeled product was formed from trans-14C-geranylgeranyl 32P-pyrophosphate with the same 14C:32P ratio as the substrate. Copalyl pyrophosphate was converted to kaurene by a soluble enzyme preparation from G. fujikuroi. The plant growth retardant tributyl-2,4-dichlorobenzylphosphonium chloride (Phosfon) at 1 mm concentration inhibited this conversion, whereas two other retardants, β-chloroethyltrimethylammonium chloride (CCC) and 2'-isopropyl-4'-(trimethylammonium chloride)-5'-methylphenyl piperidine carboxylate (Amo 1618), at the same concentration were not significantly inhibitory. All three retardants inhibit the over-all conversion of trans-14C-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to kaurene in this system. Copalyl pyrophosphate was also converted to (-)-kaurene in a soluble enzyme fraction from the endosperm of wild cucumber (Echinocystis macrocarpa) seed and to a mixture of (-)-kaurene, (+)-stachene, (+)-sandaracopimaradiene, and trachylobane in a soluble enzyme fraction prepared from seedlings of castor bean (Ricinus communis)."
https://openalex.org/W1609609875,"Abstract The binding properties of a human Waldenstrom macroglobulin (γMwag), which was fortuitously found to bind nitrophenyl derivatives, have been studied. The valences of the pentamer γM, the cysteine-produced subunit γMs, and the tryptic fragments F(ab')2µ and Fabµ were 10, 2, 2, and 1, respectively. The association constant was homogeneous and equalled 3.8 x 104 m-1 for the fragments, the subunits, and the pentamer. Binding was manifested by a shift in the absorption spectrum of the bound ligand and by the ability of the latter to partially quench the fluorescence of the protein. The relative affinity of γMwag for over 60 ligands was studied by equilibrium dialysis, inhibition of 125I-γMwag precipitation with a dinitrophenyl-bovine γ-globulin conjugate, or both. Considerable evidence for stereospecific binding was found. By virtue of the specificity of the binding activity, the location of the binding sites in the Fab portion of the molecule, and the valence of one combining site for each heavy-light chain pair, this protein has the fundamental characteristics associated with conventionally induced antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W1997083109,"Herpes simplex virus which had been sensitized with IgM antibody was not neutralized by the addition of the purified activated first component of complement. In the presence of an optimum concentration of the first component of complement, however, the sensitized virus was neutralized by the addition of a high concentration of the purified fourth component of complement. Under these conditions, the addition of the purified second and third components of complement failed to enhance virus neutralization. With low concentrations of the fourth component of complement, the addition of the second and third components enhanced virus neutralization."

https://openalex.org/W1519327943,"Abstract Pyrenebutyric acid when conjugated with proteins has a long fluorescence lifetime in the range of 100 nsec as measured both directly and indirectly. The fluorescence life-times as measured indirectly by the fluorescence depolarization of pyrenebutyric-bovine serum albumin conjugates appears to be a linear function of quantum yield. This dependence was used to predict the lifetimes of the other protein conjugates. The rotational relaxation time of the conjugate of rabbit immunoglobulin G agrees with other determinations with a different chromophore. Conjugates were prepared with human immunoglobulin M, and the measured rotational relaxation times of the conjugate before and after reduction and alkylation correlated with the molecular weights of the 2 molecules. In addition, the reduction of the conjugate is followed, and evidence is presented supporting the concept that a greatly disordered conformation is an intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1675129882,"Abstract The frequencies of the amino acid residues in λ-lysozyme have been determined. A molecular weight of 17.9 x 103 was computed from these frequencies, in agreement with the value determined previously from the sedimentation behavior of this enzyme. Analyses of the amino-terminal residues by the cyanate method and of the carboxyl-terminal residues by hydrazinolysis and by exposure to carboxypeptidase A indicate that λ-lysozyme consists of a single polypeptide chain containing 159 residues bounded by methionine at the amino terminus and valine at the carboxyl terminus. It contains no disulfide bonds. The λ-lysozyme exhibits similarities with the lysozymes of coliphages T2 and T4 in regard to total number of residues, their distribution among different groups of amino acids, the lack of disulfide bonds, and the nature of the amino terminus. In addition, a weak immunochemical cross-reaction between the λ- and T4-lysozymes was shown."

https://openalex.org/W1508197688,"Abstract Conjugates of thyroglobulin with dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonate and pyrenebutyrate have been prepared, and their fluorescence has been utilized to study the rotational diffusion of this large glycoprotein. A method of activating the pyrenebutyrate moiety by conversion to the mixed sulfuric anhydride is described. Labeling with this reagent may be carried out in aqueous solution containing less than 1% organic solvent and in periods of under 1 hour. Isothermal polarization measurements on both human and bovine thyroglobulins indicate a rotational relaxation time near 1.5 µsec at 25° in water and suggest a rigid structure which deviates significantly from an anhydrous sphere. Measurements of the polarization of fluorescence of dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonate conjugates at various temperatures indicate the existence of thermally activated rotations of the fluorescent dye moiety which can result in the significantly shorter apparent rotational relaxation times previously reported. An Arrhenius plot of limiting polarization data indicates an activation energy barrier of 0.59 kcal per mole for such rotations."
https://openalex.org/W1536622430,"Abstract 1. In osmotically shocked submitochondrial particles, Ca++ caused a marked stimulation of DPNH oxidation and a minor stimulation of succinate oxidation. The accumulation of Ca++ in the presence of succinate resulted in a partial uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The Ca++:ATP ratio was 1.7, similar to that found in intact mitochondria. 2. Two independent methods have been used to establish that the submitochondrial particles which are capable of Ca++ translocation are indeed inside-out. Electron micrographs at relatively low magnification of dense suspensions of these particles revealed that virtually all of them have inner membrane spheres on the outside. Immunological tests showed that phosphorylation associated with succinate oxidation is virtually completely abolished by a type-specific antibody against the inner membrane spheres (coupling factor 1). Isolation of the Ca++-loaded submitochondrial particles in sucrose density gradients yielded a band of heavy particles which were again shown to have inner membrane spheres on the outside. No contaminating mitochondria could be detected. 3. γ-Globulin from normal mice inhibited markedly the uptake of Ca++ by submitochondrial particles, but not by intact mitochondria. 4. In sections, electron-dense deposits appeared inside particles that had been allowed to accumulate Ca++ in the presence of succinate and ATP. Control particles incubated with Ca++ but without succinate and ATP did not show these deposits. 5. All these findings strengthen the conclusion that Ca++ translocation takes place in submitochondrial particles, which are inverted, i.e. where inner membrane spheres face the medium rather than the matrix."

The number of cells containing gammaA or gammaM was much less than the number of cells containing gammaG, but the average cell content of gammaA or gammaM was much greater than the average cell content of gammaG. Similarly, in one child where relatively few cells containing gammaG were found, the average cell content of gammaG in those cells was higher than that in the other children. The limit of sensitivity of the method for each of the three immunoglobulins with the antiserums used was less than 10(-14) gram of the specific protein."

https://openalex.org/W1576668296,"Rabbit antiserum against staphylococcal nuclease is capable of neutralizing both the DNase and RNase activities of the enzyme. The substrate analogue, deoxythymidine 3′, 5′-diphosphate, together with Ca++, protects the enzyme against inactivation by its antibody. The precipitin reaction of nuclease-antinuclease in the presence of deoxythymidine 3′,5′-diphosphate and Ca++ shows two separable peaks. The first, minor peak corresponds to antibodies which react with nuclease identically in the presence or absence of Ca++ or substrate analogues. The second, major peak is due to antibody whose reaction with nuclease is inhibited by Ca++ and certain nucleotides, particularly deoxythymidine 3′,5′-diphosphate. When joined in complex with its antibodies, nuclease is protected from irreversible inactivation by nitration with tetranitromethane. Antinuclease cross-reacts with both the mononitrotyrosyl-85 and −115 derivatives of nuclease. Calcium and deoxythymidine 3′,5′-diphosphate inhibit the reaction of antinuclease with the enzymatically active mononitrotyrosyl-115 derivative, but not with the enzymatically inactive mononitrotyrosyl-85 derivative."

https://openalex.org/W1591334490,"Abstract The absolute steric course, stereoselectivity, and kinetics of hydrolysis of cyclized and noncyclized ester substrates by α-chymotrypsin are compared. The cyclized substrates are of the form [see PDF for sequence] The noncyclized substrates are analogous α-substituted β-phenylpropionates, C6H5CH2CH(X)CO2R, II-A, X = —NHCOCH3; II-B, X = OCOCH3; II-C, X =—CH2CO2R; V-A, X = Cl; V-B, X = OH; V-C, X = CH3. The absolute configurations of I-C, I-F, and I-G are established in this work; absolute configurations of the other compounds were previously known or recently established. The active site of α-chymotrypsin is described in terms of loci complementary to a conformation of l(+)-II-A, in which the aryl and ester groups are transoid, the β-aryl and α-hydrogen are directed into the enzyme, and the α-acetamido and hydrolyzing ester groups are directed along the exterior of the enzyme. Conditions for hydrolysis of l and d enantiomers by α-chymotrypsin are described. Association is generally dominated by the β-aryl group at its locus, ar. Hydrolysis requires the ester group to be at the hydrolytic site n. Compounds II-A, II-B, and II-C hydrolyze in the l sense as the large α-substituents occupy the α-acetamido site, am, and may not fit into the α-hydrogen locus, h. Both enantiomers of V-A and V-B are hydrolyzed as the small polar substituents, Cl and HO, may be directed in the l sense toward am and in the d sense toward h. Only the l enantiomer of V-C is hydrolyzed, and the small hydrocarbon group, CH3, may not fit at h. All of the cyclized substrates, IA-IG, with five- and six-membered second rings, are hydrolyzed preferentially in the d sense, but with widely varying reactivity and stereoselectivity. In every case the more effective d sense orientation directs the -X-Y- grouping toward h-ar, leaving the remainder of the carbon chain in the same conformation and orientation as that of l-II-A during its enzymic hydrolysis. In d(-)-I-A, d(-)- I-B, S(-)-I-C, and d(-)-I-D, the groupings -X-Y- fit well into ar-h and very high reactivity and high stereoselectivity result. The α-heteroatoms of I-A and I-B and I-D, and the planar π-electron structure of I-C permit fit in ar-h, as do the α-heteroatom substituents in V-A and V-B. In I-F and I-G, the α-CH2, like the α-CH3 in V-C, does not permit the -X-Y- grouping to fit easily into h-ar, and low reactivity and low stereoselectivity result, still with d preference. During hydrolysis of these cyclized substrates in the d sense, the am site is unoccupied. When the second ring in a cyclized substrate is eight-membered, hydrolysis in the l sense may be preferred."
