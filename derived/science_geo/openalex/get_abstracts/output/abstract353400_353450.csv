https://openalex.org/W1994801733,"Background Many technological, biological, social, and information networks fall into the broad class of ‘small-world’ networks: they have tightly interconnected clusters of nodes, and a shortest mean path length that is similar to a matched random graph (same number of nodes and edges). This semi-quantitative definition leads to a categorical distinction (‘small/not-small’) rather than a quantitative, continuous grading of networks, and can lead to uncertainty about a network's small-world status. Moreover, systems described by small-world networks are often studied using an equivalent canonical network model – the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model. However, the process of establishing an equivalent WS model is imprecise and there is a pressing need to discover ways in which this equivalence may be quantified. Methodology/Principal Findings We defined a precise measure of ‘small-world-ness’ S based on the trade off between high local clustering and short path length. A network is now deemed a ‘small-world’ if S>1 - an assertion which may be tested statistically. We then examined the behavior of S on a large data-set of real-world systems. We found that all these systems were linked by a linear relationship between their S values and the network size n. Moreover, we show a method for assigning a unique Watts-Strogatz (WS) model to any real-world network, and show analytically that the WS models associated with our sample of networks also show linearity between S and n. Linearity between S and n is not, however, inevitable, and neither is S maximal for an arbitrary network of given size. Linearity may, however, be explained by a common limiting growth process. Conclusions/Significance We have shown how the notion of a small-world network may be quantified. Several key properties of the metric are described and the use of WS canonical models is placed on a more secure footing."

Methodology/Principal Findings Using micro-array comprising approximately 14,000 genes, the gene expression pattern of human first trimester decidual CD14+ monocytes/macrophages was characterized and compared with the expression profile of the corresponding cells in blood. Some of the key findings were confirmed by real time PCR or by secreted protein. A unique gene expression pattern intrinsic of first trimester decidual CD14+ cells was demonstrated. A large number of regulated genes were functionally related to immunomodulation and tissue remodelling, corroborating polarization patterns of differentiated macrophages mainly of the alternatively activated M2 phenotype. These include known M2 markers such as CCL-18, CD209, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, mannose receptor c type (MRC)-1 and fibronectin-1. Further, the selective up-regulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-2, alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGDS) provides new insights into the regulatory function of decidual macrophages in pregnancy that may have implications in pregnancy complications. Conclusions/Significance The molecular characterization of decidual macrophages presents a unique transcriptional profile replete with important components for fetal immunoprotection and provides several clues for further studies of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051636160,"Innate immunity is critically dependent on the rapid production of interferon in response to intruding viruses. The intracellular pathogen recognition receptors RIG-I and MDA5 are essential for interferon induction by viral RNAs containing 5' triphosphates or double-stranded structures, respectively. Viruses with a negative-stranded RNA genome are an important group of pathogens causing emerging and re-emerging diseases. We investigated the ability of genomic RNAs from substantial representatives of this virus group to induce interferon via RIG-I or MDA5. RNAs isolated from particles of Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Lassa virus, and Rift Valley fever virus strongly activated the interferon-beta promoter. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that interferon induction depended on RIG-I, but not MDA5, and phosphatase treatment revealed a requirement for the RNA 5' triphosphate group. In contrast, genomic RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus did not trigger interferon induction. Sensitivity of these RNAs to a 5' monophosphate-specific exonuclease indicates that the RIG-I-activating 5' triphosphate group was removed post-transcriptionally by a viral function. Consequently, RIG-I is unable to bind the RNAs of Hantaan virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Borna disease virus. These results establish RIG-I as a major intracellular recognition receptor for the genome of most negative-strand RNA viruses and define the cleavage of triphosphates at the RNA 5' end as a strategy of viruses to evade the innate immune response."

Cancer cells are characterized by prominent epigenetic dysregulation, including histone modifications. However, the functional roles of the histone methyltransferases (HMT) in cancer remain unclear.We studied RNAi-based inhibition (knockdown, KD) of 2 different H3K9 HMTs, SUV39H1 and G9a. Knockdown of the 2 HMTs in PC3 cancer cell line markedly inhibited cell growth and caused profound morphological changes with loss of telomerase activity and shortened telomeres. SUV39H1 KD cells showed substantial increase in G2/M fraction. G9a KD cells showed increased DNA content (1.7-fold in 2 independent clones) compared with FACS analyses to control. Karyotype analyses showed that this was due to an increased number of chromosomes (from 61 to 102) in G9a KD cells compared to parental PC3. Intriguingly, we found abnormal centrosome morphology and number in about 25% of the G9a KD cells, while centrosomes were morphologically normal in control cells. Microarray analyses after KD of SUV39H1 or G9a showed very few genes up-regulated among the 39,000 genes. The silenced tumor-suppressor genes p16 and RASSF1A were not activated in KD cells.These data suggest that the 2 HMTs, SUV39H1 and G9a are required to perpetuate the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, G9a plays a critical role in regulating centrosome duplication presumably through chromatin structure rather than through affecting gene expression in cancer cells. Targeting these histone methyltransferases may be of therapeutic benefit in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2114538173,"Escherichia coli strains adhere to the normally sterile human uroepithelium using type 1 pili, that are long, hairy surface organelles exposing a mannose-binding FimH adhesin at the tip. A small percentage of adhered bacteria can successfully invade bladder cells, presumably via pathways mediated by the high-mannosylated uroplakin-Ia and alpha3beta1 integrins found throughout the uroepithelium. Invaded bacteria replicate and mature into dense, biofilm-like inclusions in preparation of fluxing and of infection of neighbouring cells, being the major cause of the troublesome recurrent urinary tract infections.We demonstrate that alpha-D-mannose based inhibitors of FimH not only block bacterial adhesion on uroepithelial cells but also antagonize invasion and biofilm formation. Heptyl alpha-D-mannose prevents binding of type 1-piliated E. coli to the human bladder cell line 5637 and reduces both adhesion and invasion of the UTI89 cystitis isolate instilled in mouse bladder via catheterization. Heptyl alpha-D-mannose also specifically inhibited biofilm formation at micromolar concentrations. The structural basis of the great inhibitory potential of alkyl and aryl alpha-D-mannosides was elucidated in the crystal structure of the FimH receptor-binding domain in complex with oligomannose-3. FimH interacts with Man alpha1,3Man beta1,4GlcNAc beta1,4GlcNAc in an extended binding site. The interactions along the alpha1,3 glycosidic bond and the first beta1,4 linkage to the chitobiose unit are conserved with those of FimH with butyl alpha-D-mannose. The strong stacking of the central mannose with the aromatic ring of Tyr48 is congruent with the high affinity found for synthetic inhibitors in which this mannose is substituted for by an aromatic group.The potential of ligand-based design of antagonists of urinary tract infections is ruled by the structural mimicry of natural epitopes and extends into blocking of bacterial invasion, intracellular growth and capacity to fluxing and of recurrence of the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2002287860,"The laboratory rat is one of the most extensively studied model organisms. Inbred laboratory rat strains originated from limited Rattus norvegicus founder populations, and the inherited genetic variation provides an excellent resource for the correlation of genotype to phenotype. Here, we report a survey of genetic variation based on almost 3 million newly identified SNPs. We obtained accurate and complete genotypes for a subset of 20,238 SNPs across 167 distinct inbred rat strains, two rat recombinant inbred panels and an F2 intercross. Using 81% of these SNPs, we constructed high-density genetic maps, creating a large dataset of fully characterized SNPs for disease gene mapping. Our data characterize the population structure and illustrate the degree of linkage disequilibrium. We provide a detailed SNP map and demonstrate its utility for mapping of quantitative trait loci. This community resource is openly available and augments the genetic tools for this workhorse of physiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2059069942,"Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) catalyzes the first step in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TG) generating diacylglycerol and free fatty acids. The enzyme requires the activator protein CGI-58 (or ABHD5) for full enzymatic activity. Defective ATGL function causes a recessively inherited disorder named neutral lipid storage disease that is characterized by systemic TG accumulation and myopathy. In this study, we investigated the functional defects associated with mutations in the ATGL gene that cause neutral lipid storage disease. We show that these mutations lead to the expression of either inactive enzymes localizing to lipid droplets (LDs) or enzymatically active lipases with defective LD binding. Additionally, our studies assign important regulatory functions to the C-terminal part of ATGL. Truncated mutant ATGL variants lacking approximately 220 amino acids of the C-terminal protein region do not localize to LDs. Interestingly, however, these mutants exhibit substantially increased TG hydrolase activity in vitro (up to 20-fold) compared with the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the C-terminal region suppresses enzyme activity. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed an increased binding of truncated ATGL to CGI-58, suggesting that the C-terminal part interferes with CGI-58 interaction and enzyme activation. Compared with the human enzyme, the C-terminal region of mouse ATGL is much less effective in suppressing enzyme activity, implicating species-dependent differences in enzyme regulation. Together, our results demonstrate that the C-terminal region of ATGL is essential for proper localization of the enzyme and suppresses enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1992122388,"Genomics has produced hundreds of new hemoglobin sequences with examples in nearly every living organism. Structural and biochemical characterizations of many recombinant proteins reveal reactions, like oxygen binding and NO dioxygenation, that appear general to the hemoglobin superfamily regardless of whether they are related to physiological function. Despite considerable attention to “hexacoordinate” hemoglobins, which are found in nearly every plant and animal, no clear physiological role(s) has been assigned to them in any species. One popular and relevant hypothesis for their function is protection against NO. Here we have tested a comprehensive representation of hexacoordinate hemoglobins from plants (rice hemoglobin), animals (neuroglobin and cytoglobin), and bacteria (Synechocystis hemoglobin) for their abilities to scavenge NO compared to myoglobin. Our experiments include in vitro comparisons of NO dioxygenation, ferric NO binding, NO-induced reduction, NO scavenging with an artificial reduction system, and the ability to substitute for a known NO scavenger (flavohemoglobin) in E. coli. We conclude that none of these tests reveal any distinguishing predisposition toward a role in NO scavenging for the hxHbs, but that any hemoglobin could likely serve this role in the presence of a mechanism for heme iron re-reduction. Hence, future research to test the role of Hbs in NO scavenging would benefit more from the identification of cognate reductases than from in vitro analysis of NO and O2 binding."
https://openalex.org/W1966019156,"Background In eukaryotes the photosynthetic antenna system is composed of subunits encoded by the light harvesting complex (Lhc) multigene family. These proteins play a key role in photosynthesis and are involved in both light harvesting and photoprotection. The moss Physcomitrella patens is a member of a lineage that diverged from seed plants early after land colonization and therefore by studying this organism, we may gain insight into adaptations to the aerial environment. Principal Findings In this study, we characterized the antenna protein multigene family in Physcomitrella patens, by sequence analysis as well as biochemical and functional investigations. Sequence identification and analysis showed that some antenna polypeptides, such as Lhcb3 and Lhcb6, are present only in land organisms, suggesting they play a role in adaptation to the sub-aerial environment. Our functional analysis which showed that photo-protective mechanisms in Physcomitrella patens are very similar to those in seed plants fits with this hypothesis. In particular, Physcomitrella patens also activates Non Photochemical Quenching upon illumination, consistent with the detection of an ortholog of the PsbS protein. As a further adaptation to terrestrial conditions, the content of Photosystem I low energy absorbing chlorophylls also increased, as demonstrated by differences in Lhca3 and Lhca4 polypeptide sequences, in vitro reconstitution experiments and low temperature fluorescence spectra. Conclusions This study highlights the role of Lhc family members in environmental adaptation and allowed proteins associated with mechanisms of stress resistance to be identified within this large family."
https://openalex.org/W1986050475,"The optokinetic reflex (OKR), which serves to stabilize a moving image on the retina, is a behavioral response that has many favorable attributes as a test of CNS function. The OKR requires no training, assesses the function of diverse CNS circuits, can be induced repeatedly with minimal fatigue or adaptation, and produces an electronic record that is readily and objectively quantifiable. We describe a new type of OKR test apparatus in which computer-controlled visual stimuli and streamlined data analysis facilitate a relatively high throughput behavioral assay. We used this apparatus, in conjunction with infrared imaging, to quantify basic OKR stimulus-response characteristics for C57BL/6J and 129/SvEv mouse strains and for genetically engineered lines lacking one or more photoreceptor systems or with an alteration in cone spectral sensitivity. A second generation (F2) cross shows that the characteristic difference in OKR frequency between C57BL/6J and 129/SvEv is inherited as a polygenic trait. Finally, we demonstrate the sensitivity and high temporal resolution of the OKR for quantitative analysis of CNS drug action. These experiments show that the mouse OKR is well suited for neurologic testing in the context of drug discovery and large-scale phenotyping programs."
https://openalex.org/W1980976210,"The history of the Jewish Diaspora dates back to the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests in the Levant, followed by complex demographic and migratory trajectories over the ensuing millennia which pose a serious challenge to unraveling population genetic patterns. Here we ask whether phylogenetic analysis, based on highly resolved mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogenies can discern among maternal ancestries of the Diaspora. Accordingly, 1,142 samples from 14 different non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities were analyzed. A list of complete mtDNA sequences was established for all variants present at high frequency in the communities studied, along with high-resolution genotyping of all samples. Unlike the previously reported pattern observed among Ashkenazi Jews, the numerically major portion of the non-Ashkenazi Jews, currently estimated at 5 million people and comprised of the Moroccan, Iraqi, Iranian and Iberian Exile Jewish communities showed no evidence for a narrow founder effect, which did however characterize the smaller and more remote Belmonte, Indian and the two Caucasus communities. The Indian and Ethiopian Jewish sample sets suggested local female introgression, while mtDNAs in all other communities studied belong to a well-characterized West Eurasian pool of maternal lineages. Absence of sub-Saharan African mtDNA lineages among the North African Jewish communities suggests negligible or low level of admixture with females of the host populations among whom the African haplogroup (Hg) L0-L3 sub-clades variants are common. In contrast, the North African and Iberian Exile Jewish communities show influence of putative Iberian admixture as documented by mtDNA Hg HV0 variants. These findings highlight striking differences in the demographic history of the widespread Jewish Diaspora."
https://openalex.org/W1991224321,"Two highly abundant lipocalins, monomine and monotonin, have been isolated from the salivary gland of the soft tick Argas monolakensis and shown to bind histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), respectively. The crystal structures of monomine and a paralog of monotonin were determined in the presence of ligands to compare the determinants of ligand binding. Both the structures and binding measurements indicate that the proteins have a single binding site rather than the two sites previously described for the female-specific histamine-binding protein (FS-HBP), the histamine-binding lipocalin of the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. The binding sites of monomine and monotonin are similar to the lower, low affinity site of FS-HBP. The interaction of the protein with the aliphatic amine group of the ligand is very similar for the all of the proteins, whereas specificity is determined by interactions with the aromatic portion of the ligand. Interestingly, protein interaction with the imidazole ring of histamine differs significantly between the low affinity binding site of FS-HBP and monomine, suggesting that histamine binding has evolved independently in the two lineages. From the conserved features of these proteins, a tick lipocalin biogenic amine-binding motif could be derived that was used to predict biogenic amine-binding function in other tick lipocalins. Heterologous expression of genes from salivary gland libraries led to the discovery of biogenic amine-binding proteins in soft (Ornithodoros) and hard (Ixodes) tick genera. The data generated were used to reconstruct the most probable evolutionary pathway for the evolution of biogenic amine-binding in tick lipocalins.

The data generated were used to reconstruct the most probable evolutionary pathway for the evolution of biogenic amine-binding in tick lipocalins. Hemostasis (blood clotting, platelet aggregation, and vasoconstriction) and immunity (inflammation, pain, and adaptive immunity) are the primary ways that the vertebrate host can respond against parasitic invasion and subsequent blood loss caused by blood-feeding arthropods. Hematophagous arthropods modulate these defenses by secreting a pharmacological mixture of bioactive components in their saliva during feeding. Most blood-feeders will have at least an anti-clotting, anti-platelet, and vasodilatory component in their salivary arsenal (1Ribeiro J.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This classic paradigm of blood-feeding strategy can be extended to include anti-inflammatory proteins that scavenge biogenic amines, as their presence in all blood-feeding arthropods is becoming apparent. Thus far, scavengers of biogenic amines have evolved independently in assassin bugs, mosquitoes, and ticks, and this will probably hold for other blood-feeders as well (2Ribeiro J.M. Walker F.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Harlos K. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.I. Mol.

This is in part due to the myriad effects that biogenic amines have during host defenses against blood loss and parasite invasion. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; BAB motif, biogenic amine-binding motif; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; BAB motif, biogenic amine-binding motif; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (or serotonin) is secreted by platelets and thrombocytes, as well as mast cells of many mammals, and functions to increase vascular permeability as well as inducing platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction (6Van Nueten J.M. Janssens W.J. Vanhoutte P.M. Pharmacol. Res. Commun. 1985; 17: 585-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Histamine is released by activated mast cells and basophils and leads to vascular permeability and infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils into the feeding site (7Jutel M. Blaser K. Akdis C.A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2005; 137: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 5-HT and histamine also induce sensation of pain and itching in the host, thereby increasing the risk of tick rejection by host grooming (8Millan M.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 1-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). As such, evolution of the biogenic amine scavenging function might not only be a matter of chance in the evolution of blood-feeding behavior, but a prerequisite for successful feeding. In some ticks, histamine and 5-HT are known to be scavenged by members of the lipocalin protein family (3Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Harlos K. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Sangamnatdej S. Paesen G.C. Slovak M. Nuttall P.A. Insect. Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Lipocalins are highly abundant proteins in both hard and soft tick salivary glands with large numbers of paralogous genes in each lineage (10Mans B.J. Louw A.I. Neitz A.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Ribeiro J.M. Alarcon-Chaidez F. Francischetti I.M. Mans B.J. Mather T.N. Valenzuela J.G. Wikel S.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 36: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Additional functions of lipocalins include inhibition of platelet aggregation and the complement cascade (12Waxman L. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5445-5449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Keller P.M. Waxman L. Arnold B.A. Schultz L.D. Condra C. Connolly T.M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although the case for orthology of histamine-binding proteins from metastriate ticks is clear, the detection of orthologs in prostriates (Ixodes sp.) and soft ticks has been problematic due to the low sequence similarities observed between tick lipocalins (15Mans B.J. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 6: 1131-1135PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas lipocalins are known to generally have low levels of sequence similarity (16Flower D.R. North A.C. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), immune pressure from the host might play a major role as source of variability in tick lipocalins. The scavenging of biogenic amines is thus of particular interest, as binding occurs within the lipocalin barrel and should be unaffected by immune pressures. It could thus be expected that the molecular mechanisms of biogenic amine binding should be conserved even if orthologs are highly divergent. It has been argued that because hard ticks remain attached to their hosts over a long period of feeding, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, such as histamine antagonism are necessary to prevent host rejection (3Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Harlos K. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, blood-feeders with shorter feeding times also contain biogenic amine scavenging proteins, suggesting that this mechanism is generally essential for successful feeding (2Ribeiro J.M. Walker F.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Schuck P. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol.

In the case of mosquitoes, the identity of the scavenging protein, known as D7, was predicted based on its abundance in saliva (17Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Gonzalez E.C. de Miranda-Santos I.K. Marinotti O. Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Given the high abundance of lipocalins in the salivary glands of soft ticks (10Mans B.J. Louw A.I. Neitz A.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we considered it likely that some of these forms would act as biogenic amine scavengers. We have isolated the two most abundant lipocalins, monomine (AM-10) and monotonin (AM-38), from the salivary glands of the soft tick Argas monolakensis and found them to bind histamine and 5-HT, respectively. The crystal structures of monomine and a paralog of monotonin, AM-182, have been determined, and the ligand binding modes observed. The conserved features of the ligand-binding pockets have been probed with site-directed mutagenesis, and used to derive a general predictive motif for the identification of potential biogenic amine-binding proteins among known tick salivary lipocalins. Characterization of lipocalins from representative genera allows us for the first time to derive a model for the evolution of biogenic amine binding in ticks. Purification of Wild-type AM-10 and AM-38—AM-10 and AM-38 were previously identified from proteome and transcriptome analysis of salivary glands of the soft tick A. monolakensis (18Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 38: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This included purification, identification, and quantification of AM-10 and AM-38 from crude salivary gland extract and the identification of their corresponding cDNA sequences from a cDNA library (18Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Bacterial Expression of Recombinant Proteins—AM-10 (GI number 114152936) and AM-38 (GI number 114152976) cDNA sequences were amplified using primers that allowed cloning into the pET17b expression vector (Novagen). For AM-10, the construct used (rAM-10) included a start codon at the 5′ end followed by the coding sequence for the mature protein. This yielded a protein with an extra methionine at the N-terminal end that was not processed (supplementary materials). The construct for AM-38 (rAM-38) lacked the 2 first N-terminal residues to obtain recombinant protein that was resistant to proteolytic degradation (supplementary materials). In addition, AM-182 (GI number 114153056), a protein that shows high sequence similarity to AM-38 was produced using the same system. The cDNAs encoding IS-3 (GI 22164318), IS-4 (GI: 67083669), IS-14 (GI 67083266), and IS-15 (GI: 67083329) were obtained from a cDNA library of Ixodes scapularis previously constructed (11Ribeiro J.M.

The cDNA encoding for Arg r1 (GI number 58371884) and TSGP1 (GI 25991387) were chemically synthesized and cloned into the same expression system. All recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen), inclusion bodies prepared, protein refolded, and purified as previously described (5Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Based on electrospray mass spectrometry, Edman sequencing, and SDS-PAGE analysis, the recombinant proteins were pure and correctly expressed (supplementary materials). Smooth Muscle Bioassay—Smooth muscle bioassays were performed as previously described (5Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, the guinea pig ileum contractions to histamine and the rat uterus contractions to 5-HT were measured isotonically. A modified Tyrode solution (with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) was used for the ileum (19Webster M. Prado E.S.

Physiol. 1949; 108: 240-248Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All solutions were kept oxygenated by bubbling air. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Northhampton, MA) as previously described (5Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were equilibrated in ITC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl), which was also used to prepare all ligands tested. All solutions were degassed under vacuum for 4 min before use. Aliquots (5 μl) were injected every 120 s, and the syringe was stirred at 290 rpm while measuring heat of binding at 30 °C. After subtraction of the heats of dilution, the net enthalphy data were analyzed with a single or two-site binding model using the Microcal Origin software package. In most circumstances, the protein concentrations were 2–3 μm. In the case of some mutants that showed reduced binding affinity, the protein concentration was increased to 10 or 100 μm. Structure Determination of Monomine—Monomine was expressed from 4 liters of culture to give a concentration of 32 mg/ml (final volume 400 μl). Screening of crystallization conditions showed that monomine crystallized in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 2 m NH4SO4 as precipitant using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method. Co-crystallization with histamine (4 mm) also occurred under the same conditions. Crystals grew overnight into rod-like clusters, from which single crystals could be obtained by cluster break-up. At the time of crystallization of monomine, the closest related sequence for which a structure existed in the data base was that for female-specific histamine-binding protein (FS-HBP2) from the hard tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (3Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Harlos K. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Due to the low sequence similarity to FS-HBP2 (16% sequence identity) it was considered improbable that molecular replacement would work. However, AM-10 does not have any intrinsic methionine residues that could be used for the generation of selenomethionine derivatives. Four leucines were thus mutated to methionine (L57M, L63M, L87M, and L146M) using standard PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. This construct (AM-10SeMet) was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and grown in SelenoMet™ (Molecular Dimensions Ltd., Apopka, FL) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Similar yields to rAM-10 were obtained and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis indicated 100% incorporation of selenomethionine into the recombinant protein. The selenomethionine derivative crystallized under the same conditions as rAM-10. Prior to data collection, crystals were flash frozen after soaking the crystallization solution containing 15% glycerol. Data were collected at the Structural Biology Center, beamline 19-BM, and the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT), beamline 22-BM at the APS, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data for the selenomethionine derivative was collected at one wavelength near the selenium edge and scaled using HKL 3000. Initial phases were also obtained using the HKL 3000 package that combines SHELXD-E, MLPHARE, and DM for the location of selenium sites, solvent flattening, phasing, and density modification (21Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). A nearly complete model was built using ARP-WARP in conjunction with REF-MAC refinement (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 23Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the model was built manually using Coot and refined with REFMAC (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). This model was used to determine the structure of wild-type liganded and unliganded monomine using difference Fourier methods. The resolution of all three structures (1.1–1.4 Å) allowed the refinement of anisotropic temperature factors in REFMAC. Various manipulations of reflection and coordinate data during the course of structure determination were made using the CCP4 package (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Model quality was checked using PRO-CHECK and MOLPROBITY web servers (25Lovell S.C. Davis I.W.

Refined models for unliganded monomine (PDB code 3BS2) and the histamine complex (PDB code 3BU1) and their structure factors were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data bank.

Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Mutants of binding pocket residues were generated using standard PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. These included for monomine: Y21L, Y51L, Y51F, S83L, D94L, E103L, and W105L. For monotonin mutants constructed included F55Y and D101L. In the case of TSGP1 a series of mutants were constructed that included Y37L, E40L, Y61L, D76L, D88L, D90L, E92L, T98L, D110L, Q120L, Q124L, and E129L. Mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed as described previously and molecular masses confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (supplementary materials). Structure Determination of AM-182—AM-182 was expressed from 1 liter of culture to give a final concentration of 62 mg/ml (final volume 600 μl). Screening of crystallization conditions indicated that protein crystallized in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, with 25% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME as precipitant using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method. Co-crystallization with 5-HT (4 mm) also occurred under the same conditions. Prior to data collection, crystals was flash frozen using the crystallization mother liquor with added 15% MPD. Data were collected at beamline 22-BM of SER-CAT. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser with a polyalanine variant of the monomine structure as a search model (27McCoyActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). The AM-182 model was built in Coot and refined using CNS and in REFMAC using a translation-libration-screw model (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The protein atoms of the two chains were treated as a single translation-libration-screw group. The quality of the model was evaluated with PROCHECK and the MOLPROBITY web server. The coordinates are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 3BRN). Statistics for data collection and refinement are presented in Table 1. Bioinformatical Analysis—The non-redundant databases were queried using either BLASTP or PSI-BLAST analysis (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar, 30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments were obtained using ClustalX and manually checked and adjusted (31Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). Neighbor-joining analysis was performed using the Mega package (32Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar). The Poisson model for amino acid substitution was used and 10,000 bootstraps were performed with complete deletion of gapped positions. Isolation of A. monolakensis Lipocalins—Previous results have shown that AM-10 is encoded by ∼5% (150/3087) and AM-38 is encoded by ∼1.1% (34/3087) of randomly sequenced transcripts from a cDNA library (18Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 38: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Chromatographic analysis of crude salivary gland extract indicated that AM-10 and AM-38 comprise ∼23 and 8.8%, respectively, of the total salivary protein. Analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis corroborated these results and indicated that they were major salivary gland extract proteins (18Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 38: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Edman degradation of purified AM-10 failed to yield a sequence, indicating possible modification of the N terminus. The sequence could, however, be obtained by peptide mass fingerprinting (18Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 38: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry of AM-10 showed a single peptide with a molecular mass of 15,707 Da. The observed deviation from the predicted mass of 15,725 Da suggests the presence of pyroglutamate (-18 Da difference) at the N terminus and that the protein is not post-translationally modified by glycosylation. Unlike AM-10, AM-38 yielded a high quality N-terminal amino acid sequence after Edman degradation of protein separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (18Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 38: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry of chromatographically purified AM-38 gave a molecular mass of 16,558.6 Da, which corresponds well with its calculated mass of 16,559.1 Da, indicating that no post-translational modifications are present. Biological Activity of AM-10 and AM-38—Purified wild-type AM-10 inhibited tonic contraction of guinea pig ileum induced by histamine at equimolar concentrations of histamine and protein. The effect was abrogated by addition of excess histamine to the preparation (Fig. 1A). AM-10 did not inhibit rhythmic contraction of rat uterus induced by 5-HT (Fig. 1C). When tested in an identical manner, AM-38 gave results opposite to those obtained with AM-10. It did not inhibit tonic contractions of guinea pig ileum induced by histamine (Fig. 1B), but did inhibit rhythmic contractions of rat uterus induced by 5-HT that could be abolished by addition of excess 5-HT (Fig. 1D). Biogenic-amine Binding by Recombinant AM-10 and AM-38—To further investigate the modes of action of these proteins, AM-10 and AM-38 were expressed in recombinant form, and binding of biogenic amines was measured using isothermal microcalorimetry. AM-10 and AM-38 each possess a single binding site for their respective ligands as indicated by calculated binding stoichiometries (Fig. 2). We propose the name monomine for AM-10 to indicate binding of a single histamine molecule as well as being derived from A. monolakensis. For AM-38 we propose the name monotonin to indicate binding of a single 5-HT molecule as well as being derived from A. monolakensis. Fitting of the experimentally determined binding enthalpies to a single-binding site model showed monomine to bind histamine ∼295-fold more tightly than 5-HT (Fig. 2A, Table 2). Conversely, monotonin bound 5-HT at least 960-fold more tightly than histamine (Fig. 2B, Table 2).TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for binding of histamine, 5-HT, or tryptamine by various Argas and Ixodes lipocalins and binding pocket mutantsProteinnaValues indicate the stoichiometry of ligand bindingΔHbValues are given as kcal/mol.

https://openalex.org/W2156717548,"Crescentic glomerulonephritis is an important cause of human kidney failure for which the underlying molecular basis is largely unknown. In previous studies, we mapped several susceptibility loci, Crgn1-Crgn7, for crescentic glomerulonephritis in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat. Here we show by combined congenic, linkage and microarray studies that the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor JunD is a major determinant of macrophage activity and is associated with glomerulonephritis susceptibility. Introgression of Crgn2 from the nonsusceptible Lewis strain onto the WKY background leads to significant reductions in crescent formation, macrophage infiltration, Fc receptor-mediated macrophage activation and cytokine production. Haplotype analysis restricted the Crgn2 linkage interval to a 430-kb interval containing Jund, which is markedly overexpressed in WKY macrophages and glomeruli. Jund knockdown in rat and human primary macrophages led to significantly reduced macrophage activity and cytokine secretion, indicating conservation of JunD function in macrophage activation in rats and humans and suggesting in vivo inhibition of Jund as a possible new therapeutic strategy for diseases characterized by inflammation and macrophage activation."
https://openalex.org/W2139815948,"The entry of calcium into dendritic spines can trigger a sequence of biochemical reactions that begins with the activation of calmodulin (CaM) and ends with long-term changes to synaptic strengths. The degree of activation of CaM can depend on highly local elevations in the concentration of calcium and the duration of transient increases in calcium concentration. Accurate measurement of these local changes in calcium is difficult because the spaces are so small and the numbers of molecules are so low. We have therefore developed a Monte Carlo model of intracellular calcium dynamics within the spine that included calcium binding proteins, calcium transporters and ion channels activated by voltage and glutamate binding. The model reproduced optical recordings using calcium indicator dyes and showed that without the dye the free intracellular calcium concentration transient was much higher than predicted from the fluorescent signal. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials induced large, long-lasting calcium gradients across the postsynaptic density, which activated CaM. When glutamate was released at the synapse 10 ms before an action potential occurred, simulating activity patterns that strengthen hippocampal synapses, the calcium gradient and activation of CaM in the postsynaptic density were much greater than when the order was reversed, a condition that decreases synaptic strengths, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the induction of long-term changes in synaptic strength. The spatial and temporal mechanisms for selectivity in CaM activation demonstrated here could be used in other signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2012973954,"Background Immunity to malaria develops naturally in endemic regions, but the protective immune mechanisms are poorly understood. Many vaccination strategies aim to induce T cells against diverse pre-erythrocytic antigens, but correlates of protection in the field have been limited. The objective of this study was to investigate cell-mediated immune correlates of protection in natural malaria. Memory T cells reactive against thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) and circumsporozoite (CS) protein, major vaccine candidate antigens, were measured, as were frequencies of CD4+ CD25high T cells, which may suppress immunity, and CD56+ NK cells and γδ T cells, which may be effectors or may modulate immunity. Methodology and Principal Findings 112 healthy volunteers living in rural Kenya were entered in the study. Memory T cells reactive against TRAP and CS were measured using a cultured IFNγ ELISPOT approach, whilst CD4+ CD25high T cells, CD56+ NK cells, and γδ T cells were measured by flow cytometry. We found that T cell responses against TRAP were established early in life (<5 years) in contrast to CS, and cultured ELISPOT memory T cell responses did not correlate with ex-vivo IFNγ ELISPOT effector responses. Data was examined for associations with risk of clinical malaria for a period of 300 days. Multivariate logistic analysis incorporating age and CS response showed that cultured memory T cell responses against TRAP were associated with a significantly reduced incidence of malaria (p = 0.028). This was not seen for CS responses. Higher numbers of CD4+ CD25high T cells, potentially regulatory T cells, were associated with a significantly increased risk of clinical malaria (p = 0.039). Conclusions These data demonstrate a role for central memory T cells in natural malarial immunity and support current vaccination strategies aimed at inducing durable protective T cell responses against the TRAP antigen. They also suggest that CD4+ CD25high T cells may negatively affect naturally acquired malarial immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2005380045,"Mental or cognitive brain functions, and the effect on them of abnormal psychiatric diseases, are difficult to approach through molecular biological techniques due to the lack of appropriate assay systems with objective measures. We therefore study laws of behavioral organization, specifically how resting and active periods are interwoven throughout daily life, using objective criteria, and first discover that identical laws hold both for healthy humans subject to the full complexity of daily life, and wild-type mice subject to maximum environmental constraints. We find that active period durations with physical activity counts successively above a predefined threshold, when rescaled with individual means, follow a universal stretched exponential (gamma-type) cumulative distribution, while resting period durations below the threshold obey a universal power-law cumulative distribution with identical parameter values for both of the mammalian species. Further, by analyzing the behavioral organization of mice with a circadian clock gene (Period2) eliminated, and humans suffering from major depressive disorders, we find significantly lower parameter values (power-law scaling exponents) for the resting period durations in both these cases. Such a universality and breakdown of the behavioral organization of mice and humans, revealed through objective measures, is expected to facilitate the understanding of the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of neurobehavioral diseases, including depression, and lay the foundations for formulating a range of neuropsychiatric behavioral disorder models."
https://openalex.org/W2042834254,"Both adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy are determinant factors for adipocyte differentiation during the development of obesity. p21(WAF1/CIP1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is induced during adipocyte differentiation; however, its precise contribution to this process is unknown. Using both in vitro and in vivo systems, we show that p21 is crucial for maintaining adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity-induced insulin resistance. The absence of p21 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts by RNA-mediated interference knockdown or in embryonic fibroblasts from p21(-/-) mice impaired adipocyte differentiation, resulting in smaller adipocytes. Despite normal adipose tissue mass on a normal diet, p21(-/-) mice fed high energy diets had reduced adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size accompanied by a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity. Knockdown of p21 in enlarged epididymal fat of diet-induced obese mice and also in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused vigorous apoptosis by activating p53. Thus, p21 is involved in both adipocyte differentiation and in protecting hypertrophied adipocytes against apoptosis. Via both of these mechanisms, p21 promotes adipose tissue expansion during high fat diet feeding, leading to increased downstream pathophysiological consequences such as insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1998408013,"The plant cell wall degrading apparatus of anaerobic bacteria includes a large multienzyme complex termed the “cellulosome.” The complex assembles through the interaction of enzyme-derived dockerin modules with the multiple cohesin modules of the noncatalytic scaffolding protein. Here we report the crystal structure of the Clostridium cellulolyticum cohesin-dockerin complex in two distinct orientations. The data show that the dockerin displays structural symmetry reflected by the presence of two essentially identical cohesin binding surfaces. In one binding mode, visualized through the A16S/L17T dockerin mutant, the C-terminal helix makes extensive interactions with its cohesin partner. In the other binding mode observed through the A47S/F48T dockerin variant, the dockerin is reoriented by 180° and interacts with the cohesin primarily through the N-terminal helix. Apolar interactions dominate cohesin-dockerin recognition that is centered around a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the cohesin, formed by Leu-87 and Leu-89, which is occupied, in the two binding modes, by the dockerin residues Phe-19 and Leu-50, respectively. Despite the structural similarity between the C. cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum cohesins and dockerins, there is no cross-specificity between the protein partners from the two organisms. The crystal structure of the C. cellulolyticum complex shows that organism-specific recognition between the protomers is dictated by apolar interactions primarily between only two residues, Leu-17 in the dockerin and the cohesin amino acid Ala-129.

The microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is an important biological process that is central to the cycling of carbon between microorganisms, plants, and herbivores. Furthermore, the enzymes that catalyze the hydrolyses of plant structural polysaccharides are deployed in several biotechnological processes (for review see Ref. 1Bhat M.K. Biotechnol. Adv. 2000; 18: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), although there is currently considerable interest in the application of these biocatalysts in the conversion of lignocellulose, an abundant renewable source of organic carbon, into biofuels such as ethanol and butanol (2Boudet A.M.

Saprophytic microorganisms that utilize the plant cell wall as a major nutrient synthesize enzyme consortia in which the biocatalysts act in synergy to degrade the composite substrate. A common feature of the plant cell wall apparatus synthesized by both eukaryotic and prokaryotic anaerobic microorganisms is that the component enzymes assemble into large complexes, which are referred to as cellulosomes (for review see Ref. 4Bayer E.A. Belaich J.P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The cellulosome is assembled by the binding of the catalytic subunits, comprising glycoside hydrolases, esterases, and lyases, to a non-catalytic protein scaffold (hereafter referred to as Cip) (5Gerngross U.T.

The Cip molecules of Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum (designated CipC and CipA, respectively) can bind eight and nine enzymes, respectively (8Handelsman T. Barak Y. Nakar D. Mechaly A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although the cellulosomes of other anaerobic bacteria deploy multiple Cip and adapter molecules in assembling as many as 96 catalytic subunits into a single complex (9Xu Q. Gao W. Ding S.Y. Kenig R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4548-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Clostridia the Cip contains multiple type I cohesin modules that bind tightly to the type I dockerins present on the catalytic subunits and thus assemble these enzymes into the cellulosome (10Salamitou S. Raynaud O. Lemaire M. Coughlan M. Beguin P. Aubert J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2822-2827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, within a single organism, cohesin modules of the Cip display a very high level of sequence identity, and the type I dockerins appear to display little if any discrimination between their receptors in the cellulosome scaffold (11Ciruela A. Gilbert H.J. Ali B.R. Hazlewood G.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, the type I dockerin modules also display extensive sequence identity consistent with the lack of specificity for the type I cohesins (4Bayer E.A. Belaich J.P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 13Pages S. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of type I C. thermocellum cohesin-dockerin complexes have provided insight into the mechanism of cellulosome assembly (14Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Carvalho A.L. Pires V.M.

Within the dockerin there is a tandem duplication of a 22-residue sequence that contributes an α-helix and an EF-hand calcium-binding motif and displays remarkable structural conservation. Indeed the structure of the first duplicated segment, which contains the N-terminal helix, can be superimposed precisely over the structure containing the second segment containing the C-terminal helix (helix-3). This symmetry, coupled with several mutagenesis studies (16Mechaly A. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9883-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Schaeffer F. Matuschek M. Guglielmi G. Miras I. Alzari P.M. Beguin P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicates that the C. thermocellum type I dockerin contains two equivalent ligand-binding sites, which have been maintained during evolution. This view is entirely consistent with the crystal structure of the complexes. Thus in one complex helix-3 dominates cohesin recognition with Ser-45 and Thr-46 playing a central role in the polar interactions between the two protein partners (14Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the second crystal structure the dockerin is rotated 180° relative to the cohesin, and helix-1, rather than helix-3, plays a central role in complex formation (15Carvalho A.L. Pires V.M. Gloster T.M. Turkenburg J.P. Prates J.A. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the equivalent residues to Ser-45 and Thr-46 in the N-terminal helix, Ser-11 and Thr-12, dominate the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the dockerin and its cohesin partner in this second binding mode. Although the sequences of C. cellulolyticum type I cohesins and dockerins are very similar to the corresponding C. thermocellum modules, there is no cross-specificity between the proteins derived from the two organisms (8Handelsman T. Barak Y. Nakar D. Mechaly A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Pages S. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9883-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Significantly the Ser-Thr dyad in the C. thermocellum dockerins is replaced with hydrophobic residues in the corresponding C. cellulolyticum protein modules. Mutagenesis studies have shown that replacing the Ser-Thr dyad with hydrophobic residues in the C. thermocellum dockerin, and similarly substituting the Ala-Leu and Ala-Phe motifs with hydroxyl amino acids in the C. cellulolyticum dockerin, extends ligand specificity (16Mechaly A. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9883-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus the mutant C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum dockerins gain the capacity to recognize the C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum cohesins, respectively, while retaining a diminished affinity for their original protein target (16Mechaly A. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9883-9888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Currently it is unclear whether the dual binding mode displayed by the C. thermocellum type I dockerins is a generic feature of cellulosome assembly, whereas the mechanistic basis for the organism-based specificity displayed by cohesin-dockerin partners remains essentially unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin-cohesin complex. The data show that the dockerin displays dyad symmetry and is able to interact with its cognate cohesin through a dual binding mode. Cohesin-dockerin recognition is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, which are centered around a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the cohesin, formed by Leu-87 and Leu-89, which is occupied in the two binding modes by the dockerin residues Phe-19 and Leu-50, respectively. Intriguingly, organism specificity is dictated primarily by apolar interactions between only two residues, Leu-17 in the dockerin and the cohesin amino acid Ala-129. Cloning and Expression—DNA encoding the dockerin module of the GH5 C. cellulolyticum cellulase CcCel5A (residues 410-473; note that the proline at position 473 in the published sequence is a glutamate) from C. cellulolyticum was amplified by PCR from pJFAc (18Fierobe H.P. Gaudin C. Belaich A. Loutfi M. Faure E. Bagnara C. Baty D. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7956-7962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting product was ligated into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET22b (Novagen), to generate pHF1. The dockerin gene under the control of the pET22b T7 promoter and terminator was amplified by PCR from pHF1 using the forward primer T7f (5′-CACGATGCGTCCGGCGTAGAGGAT-3′) and the reverse primer T7br (5′-GGGGGGAGATCTATCCGGATATAGTTCCTCCTTTCA-3′) that incorporated 5′ and 3′ BglII sites. To express C. cellulolyticum dockerin and cohesin genes in the same plasmid, the resulting PCR product was digested with BglII and subcloned into the BglII site of plasmid pET-coh1B, which encodes the first cohesin module (residues 277-439) of C. cellulolyticum scaffoldin CipC (19Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmid, termed pHF2, contained both genes organized in tandem and was sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during PCR. In the wild type cohesin-dockerin complex, derived from the co-expression of the cohesin and dockerin genes from pHF2, only the cohesin contained a C-terminal His6 tag. The construction of the plasmid encoding the mutated dockerins of Cel5A and the first cohesin from CipC was performed by the overlap-extension PCR method. The regions encoding the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the dockerin were amplified by PCR from pHF2 using mutagenic primer pairs. The resulting overlapping fragments were mixed, and a combined fragment was synthesized using the external primers. The fragment was subsequently cloned into BglII linearized pHF2, thereby generating pHF3. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. To study cohesin-dockerin binding, the dockerin was also expressed independent of its cohesin partner but fused to thioredoxin, encoded by pET32a, to ensure higher levels of protein expression. DNA encoding the dockerin of the cellulase Cel5A (residues 410-475) was amplified by PCR from pHF2 and cloned into EcoRI- and XhoI-restricted pET32a to generate pHF5. Protein Expression and Purification—The pET22b derivatives encoding the cohesin-dockerin complexes and discrete cohesins and the pET32a plasmids encoding C. cellulolyticum dockerins were transformed into Escherichia coli strains BL21 (DE3) and Origami, respectively. To express the clostridial proteins, recombinant E. coli strains harboring the appropriate recombinant plasmids were cultured in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A550 0.6). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for a further 16 h at 19 °C. The cohesin-dockerin A16S-L17T and cohesin-dockerin A47S-F48T complexes were purified by metal-ion affinity chromatography, buffer exchanged into 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm CaCl2, and then further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Source 30Q column and a gradient elution of 0-1 m NaCl (Amersham Biosciences) to separate the complexes from unbound cohesin. Fractions containing the protein complexes were buffer exchanged and then concentrated in 2 mm CaCl2 to a final concentration of 20 and 10 g/liter for the A16S-L17T and A47S-F48T complexes, respectively. Discrete His-tagged cohesins and dockerins were purified by metal-ion affinity chromatography as described previously (14Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 5The abbreviations used are: ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. was deployed to measure the affinity of native and mutant forms of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin for its dockerin partner essentially as described previously (14Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly the wild type and mutant forms of the dockerin (7-119 μm), fused to thioredoxin, were stirred at 300 rpm in the reaction cell, which was injected with 25 × 10 or 48 × 5-μl aliquots of a 70-1715 μm solution of cohesin at 300-s intervals. The buffer consists of 50 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm CaCl2, and titrations were carried out at 308 K unless otherwise stated. Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regressing using a single site model (Microcal ORIGIN version 7.0, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). The fitted data yield the association constant (KA) and the change in enthalpy associated with binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard equation -RTlnKA =ΔG =ΔH - TΔS. The c values (product of the molar concentration of binding sites × KA) were >2.6. Crystallization of the C. cellulolyticum Cohesin-Dockerin Complexes and Structure Resolution—Crystals of the cohesin-dockerin A16S-L17T complex grew over a period of 10-12 days, in 0.2 m potassium sulfate and 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, and were cryoprotected with 20% (v/v) of glycerol. Crystals of the cohesin-dockerin A47S-F48T complex grew over a period of 4-5 days, in 0.2 m lithium sulfate and 25% w/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, and were cryoprotected with 20% (v/v) of glycerol. The crystals were harvested in rayon fiber loops and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected, for both constructs, using single crystals at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on station ID14-2 at 100 K using an ADSC Q4 charged-coupled device detector and at a wavelength of 0.9330 Å. All diffraction data were indexed and integrated in MOSFLM (CCP4) or DENZO/SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). All other computing was carried out using the CCP4 suite unless otherwise stated. Crystals of the A16S-L17T complex belong to the space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 39.3 Å, b = 60.5 Å, and c = 100.7 Å and one complex in the asymmetric unit. In contrast, crystals of the cohesin-dockerin A47S-F48T complex belong to the space group P3221 with approximate cell dimensions of a = b = 76.42 Å and c = 111.09 Å and two independent complexes in the asymmetric unit. Both cohesin-dockerin complex structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (21McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl.

Initial building of the dockerin subunits into the electron density was performed using ARP/wARP (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Thermodynamics and Stoichiometry of Cohesin-Dockerin Recognition—The binding of a CipC-derived C. cellulolyticum type I cohesin to its dockerin partner was assessed by ITC. The data show that at 308 K the KA is 6.50 × 108 m-1 with a ΔH of -19.3 kcal mol-1 and a TΔS of -6.84 kcal mol-1 (Table 2). There was a negative direct relationship between temperature and both ΔH and ΔS, although ΔG was not sensitive to changes in the experimental temperature (Fig. 1). At 284 and 299 K, respectively, ΔH and ΔS were 0. The heat capacity (ΔCp) of cohesin-dockerin binding was -822 cal-1 mol-1 K-1. The ITC data also showed that the stoichiometry of ligand binding was ∼1, the significance of which is discussed below.TABLE 2Thermodynamics of the binding between C. cellulolyticum dockerin and cobesin variantsCohesin variantsaThe cohesin wild type and mutants were titrated against wild type C. cellulolyticum dockerin.KAΔHTΔSnM−1 (× 106)kcal mol−1kcal mol−1Wild type650 ± 76.2−19.3 ± 0.06−6.840.915 ± 0.001T45A598 ± 57.6−19.8 ± 0.05−7.420.859 ± 0.001N47A135 ± 7.24−18.2 ± 0.04−6.710.816 ± 0.001Y49A120 ± 5.48−18.2 ± 0.04−6.750.851 ± 0.001S76A1160 ± 92.2−21.5 ± 0.05−8.690.852 ± 0.001S85A1020 ± 104−22.4 ± 0.06−9.640.852 ± 0.001L87A4.9 ± 0.12−14.0 ± 0.04−3.970.915 ± 0.002L89A8.2 ± 0.34−23.2 ± 0.07−12.10.792 ± 0.001N91A367 ± 22.8−22.3 ± 0.06−10.20.833 ± 0.001193A212 ± 11.5−26.7 ± 0.05−15.00.828 ± 0.001M135G73.6 ± 3.45−20.2 ± 0.07−9.120.803 ± 0.001K137G425 ± 28.0−22.1 ± 0.05−9.950.844 ± 0.001T45A/N47A63.6 ± 6.82−19.5 ± 0.09−8.500.882 ± 0.002T45A/N47A/Y49A2.12 ± 0.12−14.6 ± 0.19−5.700.918 ± 0.008T45A/N47A/N91A5.70 ± 0.06−15.4 ± 0.02−5.850.857 ± 0.001T45A/N47A/Y49A/N91A0.20 ± 0.01−15.4 ± 0.33−7.921.03 ± 0.02S76A/S78A/S85A795 ± 229−24.2 ± 0.02−11.60.683 ± 0.002L87A/L89A0.062 ± 0.00−11.2 ± 0.01−5.021.14 ± 0.007M135G/K137A19.2 ± 0.60−19.8 ± 0.55−9.550.836 ± 0.001Dockerin variantsbThe dockerin mutants were titrated against wild type C. cellulolyticum cohesin.A16S/L17T557 ± 0.48−18.0 ± 0.53−5.700.865 ± 0.001A16Q/L17Q776 ± 92.9−17.5 ± 0.52−4.960.988 ± 0.001A16S/L17T/A47S/F48T116 ± 6.34−18.6 ± 0.52−7.240.865 ± 0.001A47S/F48T1030 ± 131−20.8 ± 0.62−8.070.908 ± 0.001A47Q/F48Q205 ± 54.8−22.6 ± 0.03−10.81.01 ± 0.004F19A/L50A0.23 ± 0.002−18.1 ± 0.46−10.50.837 ± 0.001a The cohesin wild type and mutants were titrated against wild type C. cellulolyticum dockerin.b The dockerin mutants were titrated against wild type C. cellulolyticum cohesin. Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Crystallization Strategy—To determine the crystal structure of the C. cellulolyticum cohesin-dockerin complex, the two proteins were co-expressed in E. coli. Initial attempts to crystallize the purified C. cellulolyticum dockerin-cohesin complex were unsuccessful. As with past work on C. thermocellum, we postulated that the failure to crystallize the complex likely reflected the dynamic interaction of the two potential ligand-binding sites in the dockerin with the cohesin. It has been suggested that the C. cellulolyticum dockerin has two ligand-binding sites in which residues dAla-16 and dLeu-17 at site 1 and dAla-47 and dPhe-48 in site 2 (C. cellulolyticum dockerin residues henceforth are prefaced with d and cohesin residues with c) play a key role in cohesin recognition (8Handelsman T.

To encourage a single binding mode between the protein partners for the equivalent C. cellulolyticum complexes, two variants of the dockerin were constructed in which the functions of site 1 and site 2 were disrupted through the introduction of the mutations A16S/L17T and A47S/F48T, respectively. Diffracting crystals of the cohesin in complex with either mutant of the dockerin mutants were then obtained. Structure of the Type I Cohesin-Dockerin C. cellulolyticum Complex—The structure of the cohesin-dockerin A16S/L17T (Coh-DocA16S/L17T) and the cohesin-dockerin A47S/F48T (Coh-DocA47S/F48T) complexes were solved to 1.49- and 1.9-Å resolution, respectively, by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of the apo-form of the C. cellulolyticum type 1 cohesin (PDB code 1g1k (22Spinelli S.

The two complexes in the asymmetric unit overlay with an r.m.s.d. of 0.18 Å (C-α atoms) for the cohesin residues and 1.0 Å for the dockerin amino acids. The individual components of the two protein complexes are extremely similar to each other (Fig. 2) with an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å for the C-α atoms of the cohesins and 1.0 Å for the C-α atoms of the dockerins (treated independently). The structure of the cohesin either unliganded or in complex with either dockerin variant was essentially identical (r.m.s.d. ∼0.8 Å). Thus, similar to the type I C. thermocellum cohesin, the corresponding C. cellulolyticum protein does not undergo significant conformational changes upon binding to its dockerin ligands. Structure of the C. cellulolyticum Type I Cohesin in Complex with Its Cognate Dockerin—The type I C. cellulolyticum cohesin in complex with its cognate dockerin has an elliptical structure comprising a 4-residue α-helix and 10 β-strands, which forms 2 β-sheets aligned in an elongated β-sandwich and displays a classical jelly roll fold (Fig. 2). The two sheets include β-strands 10, 1, 2, and 7 on one face (sheet A) and β-strands 5, 6, 3, and 9 on the other face (sheet B). The two sheets are connected by β-strand 8 that makes hydrogen bonds with both β-strand 9 on sheet A and β-strand 3 on sheet B. The cohesin also displays striking similarity to type I C. thermocellum cohesins (r.m.s.d. 0.8 Å). Structure of the C. cellulolyticum Type I Dockerin—The dockerin, in both complexes, has an identical structure that consists of two parallel helixes, comprising residues dAla-16 to dMet-27 and dAla-46 to dLeu-58, respectively, whereas the extended loop connecting these structural elements contains a 3-residue 310 helix (Fig. 2). The overall structure of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin is very similar to the C. thermocellum Xyn10B type 1 dockerin (r.m.s.d. 0.76 Å). The C. cellulolyticum dockerin, in both complexes, contains two Ca2+ ions coordinated by several amino acid residues in canonical EF-hand loop motifs. The coordination of the two calciums is identical to the metal ion"
https://openalex.org/W1968857708,"According to World Health Organization reports, some three quarters of the world population does not have access to medical imaging. In addition, in developing countries over 50% of medical equipment that is available is not being used because it is too sophisticated or in disrepair or because the health personnel are not trained to use it. The goal of this study is to introduce and demonstrate the feasibility of a new concept in medical imaging that is centered on cellular phone technology and which may provide a solution to medical imaging in underserved areas. The new system replaces the conventional stand-alone medical imaging device with a new medical imaging system made of two independent components connected through cellular phone technology. The independent units are: a) a data acquisition device (DAD) at a remote patient site that is simple, with limited controls and no image display capability and b) an advanced image reconstruction and hardware control multiserver unit at a central site. The cellular phone technology transmits unprocessed raw data from the patient site DAD and receives and displays the processed image from the central site. (This is different from conventional telemedicine where the image reconstruction and control is at the patient site and telecommunication is used to transmit processed images from the patient site). The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate that the cellular phone technology can function in the proposed mode. The feasibility of the concept is demonstrated using a new frequency division multiplexing electrical impedance tomography system, which we have developed for dynamic medical imaging, as the medical imaging modality. The system is used to image through a cellular phone a simulation of breast cancer tumors in a medical imaging diagnostic mode and to image minimally invasive tissue ablation with irreversible electroporation in a medical imaging interventional mode."
https://openalex.org/W2101189546,"DYX1C1 was first identified as a candidate gene for dyslexia susceptibility, and its role in controlling neuronal migration during embryogenesis and effect on learning in rodents have been verified. In contrast, genetic association studies have been ambiguous in replicating its effects on dyslexia. To better understand the regulation of DYX1C1 and the possible functional role of genetic variation in the promoter of DYX1C1, we selected three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with predicted functional consequences or suggested associations to dyslexia for detailed study. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggested the allele-specific binding of the transcription factors TFII-I (to rs3743205) and Sp1 (to rs16787 and rs12899331) that could be verified by competition assays. In addition, we purified a complex of protein factors binding to the previously suggested dyslexia-related SNP, -3G/A (rs3743205). Three proteins, TFII-I, PARP1, and SFPQ, were unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry and protein sequencing. Two SNPs, rs16787 and rs3743205, showed significant allelic differences in luciferase assays. Our results show that TFII-I, PARP1, and SFPQ proteins, each previously implicated in gene regulation, form a complex controlling transcription of DYX1C1. Furthermore, allelic differences in the promoter or 5' untranslated region of DYX1C1 may affect factor binding and thus regulation of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2072029453,"In the rhizosphere, plant roots cope with both pathogenic and beneficial bacterial interactions. The exometabolite production in certain bacterial species may regulate root growth and other root-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere. Here, we elucidated the role of cyanide production in pseudomonad virulence affecting plant root growth and other rhizospheric processes. Exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seedlings to both direct (with KCN) and indirect forms of cyanide from different pseudomonad strains caused significant inhibition of primary root growth. Further, we report that this growth inhibition was caused by the suppression of an auxin responsive gene, specifically at the root tip region by pseudomonad cyanogenesis. Additionally, pseudomonad cyanogenesis also affected other beneficial rhizospheric processes such as Bacillus subtilis colonization by biofilm formation on A. thaliana Col-0 roots. The effect of cyanogenesis on B. subtilis biofilm formation was further established by the down regulation of important B. subtilis biofilm operons epsA and yqxM. Our results show, the functional significance of pseudomonad cyanogenesis in regulating multitrophic rhizospheric interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2136538413,"The annual regeneration of deer antlers is a unique developmental event in mammals, which as a rule possess only a very limited capacity to regenerate lost appendages. Studying antler regeneration can therefore provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms that prevent limb regeneration in humans and other mammals, and, with regard to medical treatments, may possibly even show ways how to overcome these limitations. Traditionally, antler regeneration has been characterized as a process involving the formation of a blastema from de-differentiated cells. More recently it has, however, been hypothesized that antler regeneration is a stem cell-based process. Thus far, direct evidence for the presence of stem cells in primary or regenerating antlers was lacking. Here we demonstrate the presence of cells positive for the mesenchymal stem cell marker STRO-1 in the chondrogenic growth zone and the perivascular tissue of the cartilaginous zone in primary and regenerating antlers as well as in the pedicle of fallow deer (Dama dama). In addition, cells positive for the stem cell/progenitor cell markers STRO-1, CD133 and CD271 (LNGFR) were isolated from the growth zones of regenerating fallow deer antlers as well as the pedicle periosteum and cultivated for extended periods of time. We found evidence that STRO-1+ cells isolated from the different locations are able to differentiate in vitro along the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Our results support the view that the annual process of antler regeneration might depend on the periodic activation of mesenchymal progenitor cells located in the pedicle periosteum. The findings of the present study indicate that not only limited tissue regeneration, but also extensive appendage regeneration in a postnatal mammal can occur as a stem cell-based process."
https://openalex.org/W2079225948,"The 140-nucleotide trp leader RNA, which is formed by transcription termination under conditions of high intracellular tryptophan, was used to study RNA turnover in Bacillus subtilis. We showed in vivo that the amount of endonuclease cleavage at ∼nucleotide 100 is decreased under conditions where RNase J1 concentration is reduced. In addition, under these conditions the level of 3′-terminal RNA fragments, which contain the strong transcription terminator structure, increases dramatically. These results implicated RNase J1 in the initiation of trp leader RNA decay as well as in the subsequent steps leading to complete turnover of the terminator fragment. To confirm a direct role for RNase J1, experiments were performed in vitro with various forms of trp leader RNA and 3′-terminal RNA fragments. Specific endonuclease cleavages, which were restricted to single-stranded regions not bound by protein, were observed. Degradation of the 3′-terminal fragment by the 5′ to 3′-exonuclease activity of RNase J1 was also demonstrated, although the presence of strong secondary structure impeded RNase J1 processivity to some extent. These results are consistent with a model for mRNA decay in Bacillus subtilis whereby the downstream products of RNase J1 endonucleolytic cleavage become substrates for the 5′ to 3′-exoribonuclease activity of the enzyme.

These results are consistent with a model for mRNA decay in Bacillus subtilis whereby the downstream products of RNase J1 endonucleolytic cleavage become substrates for the 5′ to 3′-exoribonuclease activity of the enzyme. The number of documented ribonuclease activities in Bacillus subtilis has grown rapidly in the last few years, with at least 15 enzymes known (1Condon C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Of those that have been identified recently, perhaps the most relevant ribonuclease for RNA turnover is RNase J1, encoded by the rnjA (formerly ykqC) gene. RNase J1 was originally identified as an endoribonuclease that shares characteristics with Escherichia coli RNase E (2Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Brechemmier-Baey D. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), suggesting that RNase J1 may be the primary nuclease activity responsible for regulating mRNA decay in B. subtilis as RNase E is thought to be in E. coli (3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 4Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4658-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Indeed, Putzer and co-workers (2Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Brechemmier-Baey D. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) reported that global mRNA half-life was increased slightly in an RNase J1 mutant that was grown under conditions where RNase J1 was depleted. More recently, the surprising finding was reported that RNase J1 also has 5′ to 3′-exoribonuclease activity (5Mathy N. Benard L. Pellegrini O. Daou R. Wen T. Condon C. Cell. 2007; 129: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), an activity not previously known to exist in bacteria. The presence of a 5′ to 3′-exoribonuclease activity in B. subtilis provides a rationale for the often observed 5′-end dependence of mRNA decay in B. subtilis (6Condon C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RNase J1 has also been shown to be important for processing of two stable RNAs, scRNA (7Yao S. Blaustein J.B. Bechhofer D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4464-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and 16S rRNA (8Britton R.A. Wen T. Schaefer L. Pellegrini O. Uicker W.C. Mathy N. Tobin C. Daou R. Szyk J. Condon C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Another endoribonuclease, RNase J2, encoded by the rnjB (formerly ymfA) gene, shares characteristics with RNase J1 (2Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Brechemmier-Baey D. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); however, whereas RNase J1 is essential, RNase J2 is not. RNase J1 activity is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5′-end, with severalfold greater activity observed with monophosphorylated or hydroxylated 5′-ends than with triphosphorylated 5′-ends (2Even S. Pellegrini O. Zig L. Labas V. Vinh J. Brechemmier-Baey D. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2141-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Mathy N. Benard L. Pellegrini O. Daou R. Wen T.

Biol. 2008; 15: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). E. coli RNase E also shows a strong preference for monophosphorylated versus triphosphorylated 5′-ends, but, unlike RNase J1, it is poorly active on a hydroxylated 5′-end (10Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 11Jiang X. Belasco J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9211-9216Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the 5′-end-dependent action of RNase E on E. coli RNAs is preceded by a pyrophosphatase activity that converts the 5′-triphosphate end of the transcription product to a 5′-monophosphate end (12Celesnik H. Deana A. Belasco J.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The activity in E. coli responsible for this conversion has been identified recently as the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH (formerly NudH) (13Deana A. Celesnik H. Belasco J.G. Nature. 2008; 451: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). No such enzyme has yet been identified in B. subtilis. To study RNA processing and turnover in B. subtilis, we have been using the 140-nucleotide (nt) 2The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; TRAP, trp RNA-binding attenuation protein; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′-bis(phosphate),[5′-32P]; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 2The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; TRAP, trp RNA-binding attenuation protein; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′-bis(phosphate),[5′-32P]; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. trp leader RNA as a model. The B. subtilis trp operon is regulated at the level of transcription termination/antitermination (14Babitzke P. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Henkin T.M. Yanofsky C. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which is controlled by binding of the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP, encoded by the mtrB gene) to trp leader RNA. In the absence of TRAP binding, when intracellular tryptophan concentration is low, an antiterminator structure forms (Fig. 1A) that precludes formation of the terminator structure and transcription proceeds into the trp structural genes, which encode tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes. When the intracellular supply of tryptophan is sufficient, the 11-mer TRAP protein complex is activated by binding of tryptophan, allowing the complex to bind to 11 trinucleotide repeats (GAG or UAG) located between nt 36–91 of the trp leader sequence (Fig. 1B). TRAP binding results in formation of a stem-loop structure (nt 108–133) that induces transcription termination, generating the 140-nt trp leader RNA. The small size of this RNA makes it a useful tool for studying in detail the activity of ribonucleases in vivo and in vitro. We have recently shown that initiation of trp leader RNA decay is by an endonuclease cleavage at ∼nt 100 of trp leader RNA (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Turnover of the 5′-cleavage fragment, which is essential for release and ongoing activity of TRAP, is mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a phosphorolytic 3′ to 5′-exoribonuclease (17Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we show that the endonuclease cleavage at nt 100 is RNase J1-dependent in vivo and that cleavage at this site, as well as 5′ to 3′-exonucleolytic degradation of the resulting 3′-terminal fragment, is catalyzed directly by RNase J1 in vitro. Bacterial Strains—The “wild-type” B. subtilis strain for in vivo experiments was BG581, which is trpC2 thr-5 and carries plasmid pGD5, a high copy number plasmid that contains the trp leader region and the mtrB gene (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For experiments with RNase J1 and J2 mutants, BG581 was transformed with pMAP65, which carries the lacI gene (18Petit M.A. Dervyn E. Rose M. Entian K.D. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Bruand C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), to give BG598. BG598 was transformed with chromosomal DNA isolated from the RNase J1 conditional mutant and the RNase J2 deletion mutant described previously (8Britton R.A. Wen T. Schaefer L. Pellegrini O. Uicker W.C. Mathy N. Tobin C. Daou R. Szyk J. Condon C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to give BG600 (RNase J1 mutant) and BG601 (RNase J2 mutant). Purification of RNase J1 and H76A Mutant Protein—Cloning and overexpression of the rnjA gene, as well as the H76A mutant derivative, were as described (8Britton R.A. Wen T. Schaefer L. Pellegrini O. Uicker W.C. Mathy N. Tobin C. Daou R. Szyk J. Condon C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Preparation of RNA Substrates—trp leader RNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase transcription (Ambion T7 MAXIscript kit) of a PCR fragment that contained the trp leader sequence with a T7 promoter included in the upstream primer. The transcription product was purified from a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described (19Alberta J.A. Rundell K. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4532-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a diffusion buffer that contained 1 m ammonium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS. Quantitation of unlabeled trp leader RNA was done spectrophotometrically. For 5′-triphosphate end labeling of trp leader RNA, transcription was done in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP. For 5′-monophosphate end labeling of trp leader RNA, cold trp leader RNA was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and labeled with polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. For 3′-end labeling, cytidine 3′,5′-bis(phosphate),[5′-32P] (referred to as “pCp”) (New England Nuclear) was ligated to the 3′-end of trp leader RNA using T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 6 h at 18 °C. Labeled RNA was purified from a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as above. RNA oligonucleotides, bearing a 5′-hydroxyl end, were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and were labeled at the 5′-end (monophosphate) with polynucleotide kinase and at the 3′-end by T4 RNA ligase, as above for full-length trp leader RNA, and were purified from 9% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. For the RNA oligonucleotide with the labeled triphosphate end, RNA was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase transcription in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP and purified from a 9% polyacrylamide gel. Assay of RNase J1 Activity—Reactions were done using 10 nm RNA substrate, of which 10% was labeled, and 1.4 μm RNase J1. The buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2. For analysis of full-length trp leader RNA, 2.5 mm tryptophan was present, with or without 37.5 nm TRAP. For experiments where TRAP was present, RNA was incubated with TRAP for 15 min at 22 °C before addition of RNase J1. Initially, incubation with RNase J1 was done at two temperatures, 22 and 37 °C. However, no difference was observed in the results, so subsequent experiments were performed at 22 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm and an equal volume of gel loading buffer (Ambion) and were put immediately on dry ice. Samples were loaded on either an 8 or a 22.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For thin layer chromatography, reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA and aliquots were applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheet (Merck) and developed in 1 m LiCl. Quantitation of decay products was done with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) or a Typhoon TRIO variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). PNPase Binding Assay—Binding of PNPase to the 3′-end of RNA oligonucleotides was performed as described (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—RNA isolation from B. subtilis strains grown in 2× YT (1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1% NaCl) and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (17Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To control for RNA loading in Northern blot analyses, membranes were stripped and probed for 5S rRNA as described (20Sharp J.S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5372-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). High resolution Northern blot analysis was performed using a 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electroblotting at 20 volts overnight, followed by an additional 60 min at 30 volts. 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides were used as probes, except for the ΔermC riboprobe (20Sharp J.S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5372-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) used for the Northern blot in Fig. 7. We had shown previously that endonuclease cleavage around nt 100 of trp leader RNA was responsible for initiation of decay (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To study whether RNase J1 was involved in trp leader RNA turnover, strains were constructed that carried the high copy number plasmid pGD5 (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) containing the trp leader region and a copy of the mtrB gene and that conditionally expressed RNase J1 under control of the IPTG-inducible pspac promoter or had a deletion of the gene encoding RNase J2. Expression of the chromosomal copy of the trp leader is low, and the presence of pGD5 results in a 30-fold increase in trp leader RNA levels, allowing easier detection of processing products. To ensure low level expression of RNase J1 in the absence of IPTG, the strains also contained pMAP65, a plasmid that carries the lacI gene, providing extra copies of the lac repressor (18Petit M.A. Dervyn E. Rose M. Entian K.D. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Bruand C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of trp leader RNA was performed using a probe that was complementary to sequences upstream of the endonuclease cleavage site (probe 1 in Fig. 1B). The results (Fig. 2A) showed that there was a 3-fold (average of five experiments) decrease in the ∼100-nt fragment when the RNase J1 conditional strain was grown in the absence of IPTG compared with the presence of IPTG. Additional faint bands were detected above the 100-nt band. These are likely minor alternative endonuclease cleavage products or the result of exonuclease decay of full-length RNA. Deletion of the RNase J2-encoding gene had no effect on trp leader RNA processing (Fig. 2A) (For unknown reasons, we consistently observed a lower quantity of trp leader RNA in the RNase J2 deletion strain. However, the amount of ∼100-nt fragment relative to full-length trp leader RNA was virtually the same in the RNase J2 deletion strain and the wild-type strain.) A high resolution Northern blot analysis using probe 2 showed that the major endonuclease cleavages occurred at about nt 100–102 (Fig. 2B). Northern blot analysis was also done using a probe that was complementary to the stem-loop terminator sequence (probe 3 in Fig. 1B). In this case, the results showed a large increase (∼20-fold) in the amount of small RNA fragments ranging in size from ∼30–40 nt (Fig. 2C; the stem-loop structure itself is 26 nt). Probing of a high resolution Northern blot with probe 3 showed two clusters of fragments from about 32–36 and 38–42 nt (Fig. 2D). The increased level of 3′-terminal fragments observed in Fig. 2C is consistent with these fragments being generated by endonuclease cleavages at ∼nt 100 and resisting further decay in conditions of reduced RNase J1. These results suggested that the endonuclease activity of RNase J1 played a role in the initiation of trp leader RNA decay and that the exonuclease and/or endonuclease activity of RNase J1 was important in the subsequent degradation of the 3′-terminal fragment. We therefore sought to characterize RNase J1 activity on trp leader RNA in vitro to determine whether the observed in vivo effects could be attributed directly to RNase J1. trp leader RNA transcripts were prepared to contain a labeled triphosphate 5′-end, which was incubated with RNase J1 in the presence or absence of purified TRAP protein. (Note that to ensure efficient transcription by T7 RNA polymerase the in vitro transcripts contained three extra Gs at the 5′-end. Thus, 5′-end-containing fragments observed in vitro are 3 nucleotides longer than the corresponding fragments in vivo. Numbering of the fragment sizes in Fig. 3 is according to the numbering of the natural trp leader RNA as shown in Fig. 1.) As a control, labeled RNAs were also incubated with the RNase J1 H76A mutant protein, which has severely reduced nuclease activity (8Britton R.A. Wen T. Schaefer L. Pellegrini O. Uicker W.C. Mathy N. Tobin C. Daou R. Szyk J. Condon C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3, A and B, showed that trp leader RNA was indeed cleaved endonucleolytically by RNase J1 and that this cleavage occurred differently depending on the presence or absence of TRAP. In the absence of TRAP, RNase J1 cleaved broadly in the single-stranded region between the 5′-stem-loop structure and the antiterminator structure (nt 33–59; see Fig. 1A). The sizes of the ladder of fragments seen in the high resolution (“sequencing”) gel in Fig. 3B, bottom lane 2, corresponded well with multiple endonuclease cleavages in this single-stranded region. In the presence of TRAP, however, cleavage was observed at ∼nt 100 as well as in a smaller number of sites in the region between the 5′-stem-loop and the beginning of the TRAP binding site (Fig. 3A and 3B, lane 4). Virtually no cleavage activity was observed with the H76A mutant protein. The rate of cleavage appeared to be slower in the presence of TRAP, and this is likely due to binding of TRAP to sites that cover 40% of the RNA sequence, thus reducing the available number of cleavage sites. Also, note that in addition to the products of RNase J1 activity that are visible on the gel in Fig. 3A, other small endonuclease fragments, as well as a low level of single nucleotide (as determined by thin layer chromatography), are produced (data not shown). When trp leader RNA was synthesized to contain a 5′-monophosphate end (Fig. 3C), the relative amount of endonuclease cleavage was reduced by about half (Fig. 3D). Also, in the absence of TRAP, cleavage at a distal site (at about 54 nt) was preferred, unlike the broad range of cleavages in this region seen with the triphosphorylated substrate (Fig. 3A and see “Discussion”). trp leader RNA transcripts (i.e. bearing a 5′-triphosphate) were also labeled at the 3′-end by addition of [32P]pCp (see “Experimental Procedures”) in order to observe the generation of 3′-end-containing fragments. In this case, the 5′-exonuclease activity of RNase J1 made it difficult to assess a rate or exact site of initial cleavage, because downstream products of endonuclease cleavage were subsequently degraded from their 5′-ends. Nevertheless, the approximate location of endonuclease cleavages could be determined by short incubation with RNase J1 and resolution of the products on a sequencing gel (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4). (Note that the numbering in Fig. 4A takes into account the extra nucleotide added by addition of pCp and is according to the numbering of the natural trp leader RNA shown in Fig. 1.) The strongest cleavages in the absence of TRAP were at nt 35, which is a few nucleotides after the 5′-stem-loop, and at nt 51, which is several nucleotides upstream of the antiterminator stem. A cleavage at nt 99 was also observed, which is in a bulged region on the downstream side of the antiterminator stem. Additional cleavages may have occurred closer to the 3′-end, but these were not detected on this gel. In the presence of TRAP, there was a cleavage at nt 35 and a weak cleavage at nt 51, but the stronger cleavages were in the single-stranded region immediately downstream of the TRAP binding site. The results with the 3′-labeled substrate were consistent with the cleavages observed with the 5′-labeled substrate (Fig. 3). The ladder seen between nt 35 and 54 with the 5′-labeled RNA in the absence of TRAP (Fig. 3B) is replaced in the case of the 3′-labeled RNA with more discrete species at the boundaries of this zone (nt 35 to 51). This suggests that the species generated by endonucleolytic cleavage are rapidly nibbled down to nt 51 by the 5′ to 3′-exonuclease activity of RNase J1. If the in vitro results obtained with TRAP-bound RNA reflected events occurring in vivo, we predicted that, in a strain grown in the presence of tryptophan, RNase J1 would cleave in the single-stranded regions of trp leader RNA on either side of the TRAP binding site (nt 36–91), generating an RNA fragment about the size of this region (56 nt). We probed for such a fragment using probe 2 (Fig. 1B). As can be seen in the high resolution Northern blot in Fig. 4B, a doublet of ∼56–57 nt was detected by this probe. This fragment was not detected by the upstream probe 1 (data not shown) and so is likely to consist of the TRAP binding region. Thus, the observed RNase J1 cleavages in vitro appear to take place in vivo, suggesting that this enzyme is directly responsible for decay-initiating RNA turnover. The observed effect of reduced RNase J1 levels on 3′-terminal fragment turnover (Fig. 2C) prompted an in vitro investigation of RNase J1 activity on this RNA. An RNA oligonucleotide, designated “3′-stem,” was used that contained the sequence of the 3′-end of trp leader RNA (nt 99–140; Fig. 1C). As controls, two other RNAs were used, “3′-no-stem,” which was similar to 3′-stem RNA except that six of the complementary nucleotides in the downstream side of the stem were changed such that the strong secondary structure could not form, and “3′-stem+5′-ext,” which had the same sequence as 3′-stem RNA plus a 24-nt extension added at the 5′-end (Fig. 1C). (For technical reasons, 3′-stem+5′-ext RNA had only two nucleotides downstream of the stem structure rather than the six nucleotides in 3′-stem RNA. We assumed this difference was irrelevant under in vitro conditions where no 3′ to 5′-exonuclease was present.) As a test of whether the predicted structure was forming at the 3′-end of these RNA oligonucleotides, PNPase binding experiments were done. We have shown previously that PNPase binds well to substrates with 3′-single-stranded tails but binds poorly to substrates with 3′-terminal secondary structure (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From the binding assay shown in Fig. 1D, it was clear that the level of PNPase binding to 3′-stem RNA and 3′-stem+5′-ext RNA was much lower than the level of binding to 3′-no-stem RNA. Quantitation of the results with 2.5 nm PNPase showed that 80% of 3′-no-stem RNA was bound as opposed to only 15% of 3′-stem and 3′-stem+5′-ext RNA. These percentages are consistent with our previous data on binding of PNPase to trp leader RNA without TRAP present (single-stranded RNA at 3′-end) and with TRAP present (secondary structure at 3′-end) (16Deikus G. Bechhofer D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20238-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, although it is likely that the RNA oligonucleotide substrates assume alternative conformations to some extent, the PNPase binding data suggest that the RNA oligonucleotides are mostly in the predicted conformations shown in Fig. 1C. These RNAs were labeled at their 5′-ends by addition of 32P-monophosphate and were incubated in the presence of RNase J1. Aliquots were removed at various times after addition of RNase J1 and were run on (a) an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, to measure loss of label at the 5′-end; (b) a polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheet (thin layer chromatography), to measure release of labeled GMP by the 5′ to 3′-exonuclease activity; and (c) a 22.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, to measure accumulation of small fragments arising from endonucleolytic cleavage. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. In Fig. 5, A–C, are shown graphs of the data from these assays on the three RNA substrates. Primary data for the assays of endonuclease activity on 22.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels are shown in Fig. 5, D–F. Disappearance of full-length RNA occurred at similar rates for the three substrates (Fig. 5A), and these were inversely proportional to accumulation of labeled GMP (Fig. 5B). Thus, all three substrates were equally susceptible to the 5′ to 3′-exonuclease activity of RNase J1. However, the accumulation of small 5′-end-containing fragments, representing endonuclease activity, differed significantly among the three substrates. Quantitatively, there was a lower level of endonuclease fragments from the 3′-stem RNA than from the 3′-no-stem and the 3′-stem+5′-ext RNAs (Fig. 5C). Qualitatively, the 5′-end-containing fragments were of different sizes for the three substrates: for 3′-stem RNA (Fig. 5D), small fragments about 3–7 nt accumulated, with little accumulation of larger fragments; for 3′-no-stem RNA (Fig. 5E), fragments in a range from 3 to 20 nt were observed; for 3′-stem+5′-ext RNA, the pattern was shifted to mostly larger fragments (Fig. 5F). These observations could be explained in light of the structures of the three substrates. 3′-stem RNA has a 9-nt single-stranded region that precedes the stem structure. The data suggested that RNase J1 makes endonucleolytic cleavages in this single-stranded sequence but does not attack the stem structure. The small single-stranded target size and/or the proximity of the stem structure to the 5′-end in this substrate RNA reduces the rate of RNase J1 endonucleolytic cleavage relative to the other substrates (Fig. 5C). In the case of 3′-nostem RNA, RNase J1 can cleave at a wider range of phosphodiester bonds, as there is no inhibitory secondary structure present. For 3′-stem+5′-ext RNA, the single-stranded region preceding the stem structure is 33 nt long, and cleavage distal to the 5′-end is preferred. To analyze the effect of secondary structure on 5′ to 3′-processivity, the RNA oligonucleotide substrates were labeled at their 3′-ends by addition of [32P]pCp and were incubated in the presence of RNase J1. Note that the 3′-end-labeled substrates in these experiments had a 5′-hydroxyl end rather than the 5′-monophosphate end in previous experiments. Based on the published results describing 5′ to 3′-exonuclease activity of RNase J1 (5Mathy N. Benard L. Pellegrini O. Daou R. Wen T. Condon C. Cell. 2007; 129: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), we expected that the activity of RNase J1 on 5′-hydroxylated RNA would be very similar to its activity on 5′-monophosphorylated RNA. The 3′-stem substrate showed an accumulation with time of a product that was several nucleotides shorter than the initial substrate (Fig. 6A). This product constituted 21.5% (average of four experiments) of the full-length RNA at time zero. From a sequencing gel, the size of the accumulated fragment was found to be 35–37 nt, with most of the product at 36 nt (Fig. 6B). Taking into account the added C residue at the 3′-end, this corresponded to a fragment whose 5′-end was 3 nt upstream of the base of the stem structure, thus suggesting that RNase J1 exonucleolytic processivity is hindered when it reaches within a few"

The Giardia life cycle alternates between an asexually replicating vegetative form and an infectious cyst form. Encystation and excystation are crucial processes for the survival and transmission of Giardia. Cysteine proteases in Giardia have been implicated in proteolytic processing events that enable the continuance of the life cycle throughout encystation and excystation. Using quantitative real-time PCR, the expression of twenty-seven clan CA cysteine protease genes in the Giardia genome was measured during both vegetative growth and encystation. Giardia cysteine protease 2 was the most highly expressed cysteine protease during both life cycle stages measured, with a dramatic expression increase during encystation. The mRNA transcript for Giardia cysteine protease 2 was 7-fold up-regulated during encystation and was greater than 3-fold higher than any other Giardia protease gene product. Recombinant Giardia cysteine protease 2 was expressed, purified, and biochemically characterized. The activity of the recombinant cysteine protease 2 protein was confirmed to be identical to the dominant cysteine protease activity found in G. lamblia lysates. Giardia cysteine protease 2 was co-localized with cyst wall protein in encystation-specific vesicles during encystation and processed cyst wall protein 2 to the size found in Giardia cyst walls. These data suggest that Giardia cysteine protease 2 is not only the major cysteine endoprotease expressed in Giardia, but is also central to the encystation process.

Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that inhabits the upper small intestine of many vertebrate hosts and is the most commonly isolated intestinal parasite world wide (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In addition to its medical importance, Giardia is of interest as a model cell system because it represents the most early branching clade of eukaryota (2Hedges S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 3Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Giardia has a simple two-stage life cycle consisting of a vegetative replicating trophozoite and an infectious cyst. Infection is initiated with cyst ingestion by a vertebrate host. After passage through the acidic host stomach, vegetative trophozoites emerge from the cyst by the process of excystation, asexually divide by binary fission, establish the duodenal infection, and give rise to the characteristic symptoms of giardiasis. Trophozoites can form infective cysts that are passed in the host feces and ingested by another host to propagate the life cycle (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The process of encystation is a coordinated secretion of cyst wall materials to the periphery of a cell to form the cyst wall (4Lujan H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In response to environmental cues, trophozoites produce abundant cyst wall proteins that are packaged into encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs). 3The abbreviations used are: ESVs, encystation-specific vesicles; CWP2, cyst wall protein 2; ESCP, encystation-specific cysteine protease; GAPDH, glutaraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; GlCP2, G. lamblia cysteine protease 2; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMC, amino-methylcoumarin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: ESVs, encystation-specific vesicles; CWP2, cyst wall protein 2; ESCP, encystation-specific cysteine protease; GAPDH, glutaraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; GlCP2, G. lamblia cysteine protease 2; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMC, amino-methylcoumarin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; GFP, green fluorescent protein. These vesicles grow, mature, and eventually traffic to the plasma membrane of the trophozoite, where cyst wall precursor material is secreted to form the environmentally stable cyst wall (4Lujan H.D.

Cysteine proteases have been found to be essential to the life cycles of several parasitic organisms, catalyzing diverse processes such as parasite immunevasion, tissue invasion, and encystment/excystment in addition to well established roles in protein processing and catabolism (8Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 9McKerrow J.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 1999; 29: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, in G. lamblia (10Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D. Engel J.C. Franklin C. McKerrow J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) indispensable roles for cysteine proteases have been documented in the processes of encystation and excystation. Ward et al. (10Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D. Engel J.C. Franklin C. McKerrow J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) validated a role for cysteine endoprotease activity in the excystation process by demonstrating that excystation was inhibited by the addition of small molecule cysteine protease inhibitors to the excystation media. Touz et al. (11Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Lujan H.D. J. Biol.

Processing of cyst wall protein 2 (CWP2), one of the main cyst wall proteins that form the structure of the cyst wall, was also blocked by cysteine protease inhibitors. Whereas the role of these chemical knock-out experiments focused attention on clan CA cysteine proteases in Giardia, the recent completion of the Giardia genome indicated that there are twenty-seven candidate clan CA cysteine protease genes in Giardia. To address the question of which gene product(s) was responsible for key events in the life cycle, such as cyst wall processing, we analyzed the transcription levels of all twenty-seven genes and found that G. lamblia cysteine protease 2 (GlCP2) was in fact the major expressed cysteine protease gene in Giardia. We therefore cloned, heterologously expressed, and biochemically characterized this protease, and specifically evaluated its role in encystation. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Differentiation—WB isolated G. lamblia trophozoites (ATCC number 30957) were maintained in a modified TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Inc.), penicillin-streptomycin (UCSF CCF), vitamins (Invitrogen), and Fungizone (UCSF CCF). The pGFP.pac vector (gift from Theodore Nash, National Institutes of Health; modified by Lei Li from the C. C. Wang laboratory, UCSF) was used to episomally express C-terminal GFP fusion proteins in Giardia. The transfection protocol used by Singer et al. (12Singer S.M. Yee J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was followed with modifications: 1–2 × 106 trophozoites were electroporated with 50 μg of plasmid DNA (GenePulser XCell, Bio-Rad) at 0.45 kV, 950 μF. Transfectants were selected with puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma) and increased in 5–20 μg/ml increments to a final concentration of 80–120 μg/ml. Trophozoites were induced to encyst as indicated by Abel et al. (13Abel E.S. Davids B.J. Robles L.D. Loflin C.E. Gillin F.D. Chakrabarti R. J. Biol.

Transformation and Expression of GlCP2 in Pichia pastoris—The GlCP2 gene was re-synthesized to optimize for yeast codon usage (DNA 2.0). The rGlCP2 gene was amplified by PCR from the pJ31:7972 vector into which the full-length cDNA had previously been cloned and modified to include a polyhistidine tag using the forward primer GlCP2pPicF: CTCGAGAAAAGACATCATCATCATCATCATGAGTTGAATCATATTACTC and the reverse primer GlCP2pPicR: TCTAGATTACTCATCGAAAAATCCAGCATAGGCC. The 920-bp amplicon was subcloned in the XhoI/XbaI site of the P. pastoris expression vector pPicZαB (Invitrogen). The plasmid was linearized by digestion with SalI and introduced into P. pastoris by electroporation (GenePulser XCell, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transformants were screened by growth on YPD+100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Purification of rGlCP2—P. pastoris was grown under expression induction conditions in a BioFlo 110 Fermentor/Bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific) for 3 days according to the manufacturer's specifications. Methanol was maintained at 0.5% (calculated by a methanol sensor) by addition of 100% methanol 2×/day. 0.2-μm filtered supernatant was lyophilized. 8 g of lyophilized material was resuspended in 40 ml of ddH2O + 1 mm Pefabloc (Sigma). Solution was filtered at 0.2 μm, dialyzed in 10,000 MWC dialysis tubing (Pierce) against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C, and fractionated by ion exchange chromatography with Fast Flow Q resin (GE Healthcare) followed by dialysis to desalt and a Mono Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare).

Subsequent protease activity was measured by monitoring the increase in relative fluorescence units (RFU) over time. rGlCP2 was incubated for 30 min with 50 μg of casein-resorufin (Molecular Probes) in 200 μl of citrate/dibasic sodium phosphate buffers. 960 μl of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added, samples were incubated 10 min, and centrifuged. 400 μl of supernatant were added to 600 μl of 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.8. Hydrolysis was quantified by measuring fluorescence (excitation/emission: 574 nm/584 nm). Purified rCWP2 was incubated with enzyme in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 4 mm DTT at 25 °C. The sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by phosphorimaging (Typhoon Trio, GE Healthcare). DCG04 (radio125I-iodinated or BODIPY-labeled), the clan CA cysteine protease inhibitor (14Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem.

Three of these genes encode cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases, the fourth a cathepsin C-like protease. Using these papain family enzymes as a query, the Giardia genome was mined for additional genes coding for cysteine proteases. In total, twenty-seven clan CA cysteine protease genes were located in the Giardia genome, and these could be classified by sequence homology into cathepsin B-like, cathepsin C-like, or cathepsin K/L-like categories (Fig. 1). Three of these (GenBank™ accession number EAA38990) are greater than 95% identical to each other and yet are found in three discrete regions of the genome. There is also a set of four genes greater than 95% identical and assigned to the same GenBank™ accession number (AAK92150). GlCP2 Is the Most Highly Expressed Cysteine Protease of the Twenty-seven in the Giardia Genome—RT-PCR was used to determine if each of these genes was expressed in the vegetative and encysting stages of the Giardia life cycle. It was found that twenty-five of these twenty-seven genes are expressed, while no expression could be seen for the genes with GenBank™ accession numbers EAA37191 and EAA39030 (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the relative levels of gene expression among the expressed Giardia cysteine proteases in the vegetative and encysting life stages. Expression was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene glutaraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which has been found to have stable expression during the Giardia life cycle (5Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Mowatt M.R. Lujan H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is notable that the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases are more highly expressed than the cathepsin C-like or K/L-like proteases (Fig. 1). Expression of all of the cysteine protease genes was increased marginally during encystation. GlCP2 was the most highly expressed transcript in both vegetative and encysting life stages by 1.6-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, over the next most highly expressed transcript (Giardia cysteine protease 3, with 89% homology to GlCP2). This is consistent with GlCP2 being the only cysteine protease Ward et al. (10Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D. Engel J.C. Franklin C. McKerrow J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) biochemically identified from the parasite by affinity purification and N-terminal sequencing. The expression of this gene was also increased by 7-fold during encystation (Fig. 1). GlCP2 Is Identified in Lysate Fractions Enriched for Cysteine Protease Activity—Biochemical characterization of total cysteine protease activity found in Giardia lysates was concurrently undertaken to complement the gene expression analysis. Giardia lysates were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography, and each fraction tested against an array of N-terminally blocked fluorescent peptide substrates (data not shown). Two main peaks of cysteine protease activity were resolved against the substrates Z-FR-AMC and Z-RR-AMC (Fig. 2A). The first peak eluted (Peak A) exhibited activity against both Z-RR-AMC and Z-FR-AMC, while the second peak (Peak B) had activity against Z-FR-AMC but far less against Z-RR-AMC. The activity-containing fractions from each peak were subsequently enriched with two additional rounds of ion exchange chromatography, concentrated, probed with a labeled irreversible cysteine protease active site inhibitor and resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The active site probe labeled two discrete protein bands in Peak A and only one protein band in Peak B (Fig. 2B). Protein bands from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE or spots from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were subjected to tryptic digest and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The only cysteine protease identified from these methods was GlCP2, of which peptides were identified in both Peak A and Peak B (Table 1). This was consistent with the observation that GlCP2 was the major cysteine protease transcript expressed by G. lamblia.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of peptide fragments of cysteine protease activity Peak A and Peak B Sequences were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry of cysteine protease activity Peak A and Peak B eluted from anion exchange chromatography of Giardia lysates.Peak APeak BCVAGLDKCVAGLDKTGTTTDECVPYKTGTTTDECVPYKVHLATATSYKDYGLDIPAMMKGINDCSIEEQAYAGFFDENSWGPDWGEDGYFRSGSTTLRGTCPTKCADGSSK Open table in a new tab Expression and Characterization of Recombinant GlCP2—To further analyze the activity and biological role of GlCP2, a resynthesized GlCP2 (rGlCP2) gene (resynthesized to optimize for yeast codon bias) of 34 kDa was expressed heterologously in P. pastoris (Fig. 3A). The polyhistidine-tagged rGlCP2 was purified by affinity and anion exchange chromatography and was found to autoactivate during the purification process to the mature form of 28 kDa (Fig. 3A). The full-length and mature forms of rGlCP2 had activity on a 10% gelatin zymogram native gel and migrated to an apparent mobility of 60-kDa marker (supplemental Fig. S1). To compare rGlCP2 activity to that predominantly seen in Giardia lysates, the activity profile of rGlCP2 by ion exchange chromatography was examined against Z-FR-AMC and Z-RR-AMC. The two activity peaks seen in Giardia lysates were reproduced with purified recombinant protein; the peaks of activity represent the pro and mature forms of the protease in Peak A and the mature protease alone in Peak B (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the two protein bands labeled with the cysteine protease active site probe in Peak A, and the single band labeled in Peak B (Fig. 4B). To determine if full-length rGlCP2 has activity against a peptide substrate, protein from Peak A and Peak B was fractionated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. In-gel activity was tested against the fluorogenic substrate Z-FR-MNA. Two bands of activity could be visualized in Peak A, while only one band of endoprotease activity was resolved in Peak B (Fig. 4B). A Western blot of these fractions using an antibody against GlCP2 also demonstrates that two bands in Peak A and one in Peak B are identified as GlCP2 (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with the biochemical and mass spectrometry evidence that GlCP2 is responsible for the activity found in both peaks A and B. Purified peak B was utilized for further biochemical studies. An array of protease inhibitors was tested for their ability to inhibit rGlCP2 activity against Z-FR-AMC and Z-RR-AMC. Leupeptin and E64 were the most effective inhibitors of rGlCP2 (Table 2). The pH profile of rGlCP2 was elucidated using the peptide substrates Z-FR-AMC and Z-RR-AMC and the macromolecular substrate casein-resorufin. The pH optimum for rGlCP2 was found to be in the neutral range for each of these substrates (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the localization of GlCP2 in non-acidified compartments and its absence in the acidified peripheral vacuoles (PVs) (data not shown). The Km and kcat/Km of Z-FR-AMC for GlCP2 were found to be 40 μm and 17.5 μm/s, respectively. The Km and kcat/Km of Z-RR-AMC for GlCP2 were found to be 9 μm and 72 μm/sec, respectively.TABLE 2Inhibition of rGlCP2 activity against the N-terminally blocked fluorogenic peptides substrate Z-FR-AMC and Z-RR-AMC Activity is expressed as percent activity relative to a control reaction.Inhibitor% ActivityZ-FR-AMCZ-RR-AMCPMSF 1 mm11393EDTA 10 mm4740Aprotinin 10 μg/ml9331Pepstatin A 1 μm100112Pepstatin A 10 μm118126Leupeptin 1 μm114Leupeptin 10 μm01TLCK 1 μm3826TLCK 10 μm179TPCK 1 μm5016TPCK 10 μm259E64 1 μm00E64 10 μm00CA074 1 μm7799CA074 10 μm3485Lactacystin 1 μm100101Lactacystin 10 μm119114α1antitrypsin 1 μm90130α1antitrypsin 10 μm74146ALLNaALLN: N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO 1 μm510ALLN 10 μm55ALLMbALLM: N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO 1 μm613ALLM 10 μm55a ALLN: N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHOb ALLM: N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO Open table in a new tab To characterize the substrate specificity of rGlCP2, a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library was used to determine the substrate preference of the substrate binding sites for P1-P4 (15Choe Y. Leonetti F. Greenbaum D.C. Lecaille F. Bogyo M. Bromme D. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). rGlCP2 displays an amino acid preference at subsites P1 and P2 (P1: K>>R, Q, P; P2: L, M, V, F) while subsites P3 and P4 have relaxed specificity. These libraries were tested both at the optimal pH for the enzyme (7.2) and at pH 5.5, the conventional pH for this class of enzymes. The substrate specificity did not change over this pH range, though the level of enzyme activity was decreased by approximately 50% at the lower pH (data not shown). Based on the substrate specificity, an ideal substrate (Z-VLK-AMC) was used to measure the Km and kcat/Km, which were found to be 19 μm and 1,473 μm/s, respectively. GlCP2 Is Found in Giardia ESVs and Can Proteolytically Process CWP2 to the Predicted Size Found in the Cyst Wall—The localization of GlCP2 during encystation was determined by episomal expression of a GlCP2-GFP fusion in Giardia. Encysting cells were probed with an antibody against cyst wall protein to highlight the ESVs, and GlCP2-GFP was found to localize to ESVs (Fig. 5). Ward et al. (10Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D.

However, whether this protease could also play a role in the encystation process was not addressed directly. Total Giardia lysates or purified rGlCP2 was incubated with recombinant CWP2 (rCWP2).

https://openalex.org/W1970025920,"Background Awad et al. [1] reported on the Ca2+-induced transitions of dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG)/monoolein (MO) vesicles to bicontinuous cubic phases at equilibrium conditions. In the present study, the combination of rapid mixing and time-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was applied for the in-situ investigations of fast structural transitions of diluted DOPG/MO vesicles into well-ordered nanostructures by the addition of low concentrated Ca2+ solutions. Methodology/Principal Findings Under static conditions and the in absence of the divalent cations, the DOPG/MO system forms large vesicles composed of weakly correlated bilayers with a d-spacing of ∼140 Å (Lα-phase). The utilization of a stopped-flow apparatus allowed mixing these DOPG/MO vesicles with a solution of Ca2+ ions within 10 milliseconds (ms). In such a way the dynamics of negatively charged PG to divalent cation interactions, and the kinetics of the induced structural transitions were studied. Ca2+ ions have a very strong impact on the lipidic nanostructures. Intriguingly, already at low salt concentrations (DOPG/Ca2+>2), Ca2+ ions trigger the transformation from bilayers to monolayer nanotubes (inverted hexagonal phase, H2). Our results reveal that a binding ratio of 1 Ca2+ per 8 DOPG is sufficient for the formation of the H2 phase. At 50°C a direct transition from the vesicles to the H2 phase was observed, whereas at ambient temperature (20°C) a short lived intermediate phase (possibly the cubic Pn3m phase) coexisting with the H2 phase was detected. Conclusions/Significance The strong binding of the divalent cations to the negatively charged DOPG molecules enhances the negative spontaneous curvature of the monolayers and causes a rapid collapsing of the vesicles. The rapid loss of the bilayer stability and the reorganization of the lipid molecules within ms support the argument that the transition mechanism is based on a leaky fusion of the vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2098678130,"The durations and trajectories of our saccadic eye movements are remarkably stereotyped. We have no voluntary control over these properties but they are determined by the movement amplitude and, to a smaller extent, also by the movement direction and initial eye orientation. Here we show that the stereotyped durations and trajectories are optimal for minimizing the variability in saccade endpoints that is caused by motor noise. The optimal duration can be understood from the nature of the motor noise, which is a combination of signal-dependent noise favoring long durations, and constant noise, which prefers short durations. The different durations of horizontal vs. vertical and of centripetal vs. centrifugal saccades, and the somewhat surprising properties of saccades in oblique directions are also accurately predicted by the principle of minimizing movement variability. The simple and sensible principle of minimizing the consequences of motor noise thus explains the full stereotypy of saccadic eye movements. This suggests that saccades are so stereotyped because that is the best strategy to minimize movement errors for an open-loop motor system."
https://openalex.org/W2070541423,"While mannosylation targets antigens to mannose receptors on dendritic cells (DC), the resultant immune response is suboptimal. We hypothesized that the addition of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands would enhance the DC response to mannosylated antigens. Cryptococcus neoformans mannoproteins (MP) synergized with CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides to stimulate enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from murine conventional and plasmacytoid DC. Synergistic stimulation required the interaction of mannose residues on MP with the macrophage mannose receptor (MR), CD206. Moreover, synergy with MP was observed with other TLR ligands, including tripalmitoylated lipopeptide (Pam3CSK4), polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (pI:C), and imiquimod. Finally, CpG enhanced MP-specific MHC II-restricted CD4+ T-cell responses by a mechanism dependent upon DC expression of CD206 and TLR9. These data suggest a rationale for vaccination strategies that combine mannosylated antigens with TLR ligands and imply that immune responses to naturally mannosylated antigens on pathogens may be greatly augmented if TLR and MR are cooperatively stimulated."
https://openalex.org/W2039705148,"The alpha(4) integrin antagonist natalizumab was shown to be effective in patients with immune-mediated disorders but was unexpectedly associated with JC polyomavirus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in two multiple sclerosis (MS) and one Crohn's disease patients. Impaired immune surveillance due to natalizumab treatment may have contributed to the JCV reactivation. As HHV-6 has been suggested to play a role in MS, we asked whether this virus could also have been reactivated during natalizumab therapy. Matched sera and CSF from a limited set of MS patients treated with and without natalizumab were examined for evidence of HHV-6. In addition, we also superinfected a persistent JC virus infected glial cell with HHV-6A to determine if JC virus can be increased. Elevated serum HHV6 IgG and HHV-6A DNA was detected in the CSF of a subset of patients but not controls. We confirmed that superinfection with HHV-6 of a JC virus infected glial cells increased expression of JCV. These results support the hypothesis that treatment with natalizumab may be associated with reduced immune surveillance resulting in reactivation of viruses associated with MS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067646934,"Maf1 is the global repressor of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription regulation by Maf1 is important under stress conditions and during the switch between fermentation and respiration. Under repressive conditions on nonfermentable carbon sources, Maf1 is dephosphorylated and located predominantly in the nucleus. When cells were shifted to glucose medium, Maf1 became phosphorylated and concomitantly relocated to the cytoplasm. This relocation was dependent on Msn5, a carrier responsible for export of several other phosphoproteins out of the nucleus. Using coimmunoprecipitation, Maf1 was found to interact with Msn5. When msn5-Δ cells were transferred to glucose, Maf1 remained in the nucleus. Remarkably, despite constitutive presence in the nucleus, Maf1 was dephosphorylated and phosphorylated normally in the msn5-Δ mutant, and Pol III was under proper regulation. That phosphorylation of Maf1 and Pol III derepression are tightly linked was shown by studying tRNA transcription in Maf1 mutants with an altered pattern of phosphorylation. In summary, we conclude that phosphorylation of Maf1 inside the nucleus acts both directly by decreasing of Maf1-mediated repression of Pol III and indirectly by stimulation of Msn5 binding and export of nuclear Maf1 to the cytoplasm.

Transcription in yeast is regulated by global nutrient-sensing signal transduction cascades. A central component of the eukaryotic growth regulatory network is the TOR (target of rapamycin) cascade, which controls all three polymerase systems involved in ribosome biogenesis (1Tsang C.K.

Cells depleted of Maf1 remain alive under stress conditions but, surprisingly, Maf1-mediated regulation is essential during the transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth. This observation underscored the critical function of Maf1 in the coupling of Pol III transcription to metabolic processes and/or energy production dependent on the carbon source (8Ciesla M.

The molecular mechanisms that trigger Maf1 activity in response to different signaling pathways are only partially understood.

The simplest hypothesis accommodating these observations would be that Maf1 activity is regulated via its phosphorylation state-dependent cellular localization (9Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A.

Alternatively, both states, phosphorylation and cellular localization, might contribute in synergy to the regulation of Maf1 activity. At this point, the factor(s) involved in Maf1 shuttling as well as the cellular site(s) of Maf1 phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions remain(s) to be identified. In addition, the link between the Maf1 phosphorylation state and its cellular location remains to be established to clarify the key determinant controlling Maf1 activity. Here we identify Msn5 as the nuclear export receptor for Maf1. In the presence of Msn5, phosphorylated Maf1 is relocated out of the nucleus. However, in msn5-Δ cells the cellular localization of Maf1 does not correlate with its phosphorylation state. We show that not Maf1 nuclear export but, rather, Maf1 phosphorylation is necessary for derepression of Pol III transcription.

The multicopy plasmid YEp24-MSN5 was kindly provided by Mark Johnston. Rich medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% glycerol (YPGly). The minimal medium (synthetic complete) contained 2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (11Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Solid medium contained 2% agar. All reagents were from Difco. Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—To ensure that kinases or phosphatases were not functional during cell harvesting and protein extraction, yeast cells were rapidly harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to the cell pellet as described earlier (8Ciesla M.

Cells were broken with acid-washed glass beads, the supernatant was retained, and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer (pH 8.8) and boiled for 5 min. Protein extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE using a modified acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 33.5:0.3. One lane corresponded to the amount of proteins from 1 absorbance unit of cell culture (10–20 μg). The membrane was blocked for 30 min in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% fat-free dry milk and then incubated for 1 h with Maf1-specific antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution (8Ciesla M.

The membrane was incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO), which was visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection kit (Millipore). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in culture by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7% for 1 h, spun down, washed and converted to spheroplasts, which were then applied on microscopic slides covered with polylysine, and subsequently treated as described previously (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Maf1 antibody was added followed by secondary CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were viewed with a Microphot-SA microscope (Nikon). Images were collected using a Photometrix CH350 camera. Coimmunoprecipitation—Yeast cells expressing wild-type or HA epitope-tagged versions of Msn5 were grown in YPD to exponential phase, transferred to prewarmed YPGly for 1 h, transferred into YPD, incubated for 30 min, and then pelleted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets, corresponding to 150 ml of culture, were thawed on ice and resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer H (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaN3, 0.25 mm orthovanadate, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm disodium β-phosphoglycerate, and 5 μg/ml Complete mixture (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 10% glycerol). Cells were broken with glass beads using a Mini Beadbeater (Biospec Products) disruptor three times in 30-s pulses. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were immediately aliquoted in 1-mg portions and frozen at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Dynal PanMouse immunoglobulin G magnetic beads (50 μl), washed twice with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, were incubated overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 antibody. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then in buffer H, the beads were incubated with 2 mg of protein extract for 4 h with gentle shaking at 4 °C. Following supplementation with 5 m NaCl, the immune complexes were pelleted and washed with buffer H. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 3 min in the SDS gel electrophoresis loading buffer and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Northern Blot Analysis—Cells (50 ml of liquid culture) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, and 10 mm EDTA. Total RNA was isolated by heating and freezing the cells in the presence of SDS and phenol as described previously (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg per sample) was resolved by electrophoresis in 8 m urea and 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA by electroblotting, and cross-linked by UV radiation (1200 mJ/cm2). The membrane was prehybridized in phosphate buffer (7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and 1% bovine serum albumin) and hybridized at 37 °C in the same solution with oligonucleotide probes labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The probes used were 5′-CGAGTCGAACGCCCGAT-3′ for tRNATyr(GUA), 5′-TATTCCCACAGTTAACTGCGG-3′ for tRNALeu(CAA), 5′-CCTCCAGATGACTTGACCG-3′ for tRNAPhe(GAA), and 5′-GGATTGCGGACCAAGCTAA-3′ for U3 small nucleolar RNA. After hybridization, blots were washed 2 × 10 min with 1× SSC, 1% SDS, and 3 × 10 min with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C, and exposed to film or to a phosphorimager screen (Molecular Dynamics). RNA was quantified using a Storm 820 phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant version 6.2 software. Generation of Maf1 Mutants—Mutations in plasmid-borne MAF1 were created using a rapid method for localized mutagenesis (12Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A fragment of the MAF1 gene was amplified with primers 5′-CGAGTTGCTTGTCAATCAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTACTGCTCCTTCTTCT-3′ under low-fidelity conditions using a Diversify PCR random mutagenesis kit (Clontech). The pRS315 (LEU2, CEN) plasmid carrying MAF1 was digested with BclI and BsgI. The gapped linear plasmid and product of the low-fidelity PCR were cotransformed into the YPH500 maf1-Δ strain. Transformants, selected on minimal medium lacking leucine, were subsequently tested for Maf1 activity by replica plating on YPGly and incubating at 37 °C for 3 days. Colonies unable to grow were expected to have compromised Maf1 function. Plasmids with mutated alleles encoding Maf1 were sequenced. Maf1 Is Exported Out of the Nucleus in Response to Glucose—Variations in glucose availability in its natural environment force yeast to undergo frequent physiological transitions between fermentation and respiratory growth by using nonfermentable carbon sources. The switch between fermentation and respiration causes widespread changes in gene transcription, including Maf1-mediated repression of Pol III transcription (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We induced these metabolic changes by transferring yeast from a glucose-rich medium to a nonfermentable glycerol medium and then back to the glucose-rich medium to monitor the kinetics of Maf1 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic relocation. Polyclonal antibodies were used to localize Maf1 in yeast cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1, top panel). As shown previously (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the Maf1-specific fluorescence signal was uniformly distributed throughout the cell in the glucose medium (YPD) and concentrated in the nuclear compartment in the glycerol medium (YPGly). Upon transferring the cells back to the glucose medium, Maf1 progressively relocated out of the nucleus (5 min to 1 h). At 30 min after their transfer to the glucose medium, the cells still had some Maf1 in the nucleus. After 1 h, the Maf1 signal became uniformly distributed throughout the cell. To investigate whether the cytoplasmic relocation of Maf1 was correlated with its altered phosphorylation, differentially phosphorylated forms of Maf1 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting as a function of time after culture transfer from YPGly back to YPD (Fig. 1, bottom panel). As reported previously, Maf1 was dephosphorylated upon transition from glucose to glycerol medium (compare YPD and YPGly lanes), and the opposite transition resulted in gradual Maf1 phosphorylation (compare YPGly and YPD lanes; 5 min to 1 h). Remarkably, relocation of Maf1 to the cytoplasm in response to glucose appeared to be concomitant with Maf1 hyperphosphorylation, suggesting a link between the Maf1 phosphorylation state and its cellular location. Msn5 Is Required for Export of Maf1 from the Nucleus—To identify the factors involved in Maf1 shuttling, we examined yeast strains carrying individual deletions of known importin or exportin genes (13Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Nuclear transport receptors such as Mtr10, Kap114, Pdr6, Yrb4, Nmd5, Pse1, Srp1, and Sxm1 appeared to play no role in Maf1 transport (results not shown). In contrast, the Msn5 carrier was found to be required for cytoplasmic localization of Maf1. As shown in Fig. 2, msn5-Δ mutant cells growing in a glucose-rich medium retained Maf1 in the nucleus, in contrast to the wild type. To test whether the expression of Mns5 was sufficient to relocate Maf1 to the cytoplasm, we transformed the msn5-Δ mutant with a multicopy plasmid carrying the MSN5 gene. Indeed, under these conditions Maf1 was relocalized to the cytoplasm. We therefore conclude that Msn5 is an exportin for Maf1. Because exportins have been shown to bind directly to their target proteins, we used coimmunoprecipitation experiments to test whether Msn5 and Maf1 were able to interact with each other. Crude extracts were prepared from Msn5-HA-tagged cells and control wild-type cells with untagged Msn5. Cells were grown in glycerol medium, transferred to prewarmed glucose medium, and harvested after 30 min. HA-tagged Msn5 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-HA 12CA5 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were examined for the presence of Maf1 by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, Maf1 was selectively coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Msn5 (compare lane 2 with control lane 4). This result indicates that Maf1 and Msn5 interact with each other. Maf1 Shuttling and Phosphorylation State—Subsequent studies of msn5-Δ cells showed that in these cells Maf1 was retained in the nucleus upon transition from respiratory conditions to glucose, and incubation was prolonged for up to 3 h (Fig. 4A), thus confirming the requirement of Msn5 for Maf1 export. Most remarkably, in the msn5-Δ mutant, the Maf1 localization and phosphorylation state were totally uncoupled as Maf1 was dephosphorylated and phosphorylated normally. During the transitions from glucose medium to a nonfermentable carbon source and back to glucose (compare Figs. 1 and 4A), both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions did occur while Maf1 was predominantly retained inside the nucleus. Msn5 overproduction did not perturb the nuclear accumulation of Maf1 under respiratory conditions (Fig. 4B, YPGly lane), although the Maf1 nuclear import rate was slightly decreased (data not shown). Conversely, Msn5 overproduction increased to some extent the Maf1 nuclear export rate. Thirty minutes after the shift from glycerol to glucose medium, the Maf1 signal became uniformly distributed throughout the cell overproducing Msn5, in contrast to the wild-type cell, which needed 1 h to achieve the similar state (compare Figs. 1 and 4B, top panels). The phosphorylated form of Maf1 appeared concomitantly with its relocation out of the nucleus, 30 min after the shift of cells overproducing Msn5 from glycerol to glucose medium (Fig. 4B, bottom panel), suggesting that export and phosphorylation are linked. Maf1 Nuclear Export Is Not Required for Derepression of Transcription—Knowing that nuclear export of Maf1 repressor was mediated by Msn5, we wondered whether the constitutive nuclear location of Maf1 in msn5-Δ cells might result in constitutive repression of Pol III transcription. We therefore compared the derepression of Pol III transcription in wild-type and msn5-Δ cells upon transition from respiratory conditions to glucose. The msn5-Δ mutant and isogenic wild-type control cells were grown at 30 °C to exponential phase in glucose medium (YPD), transferred to prewarmed glycerol medium (YPGly) for 1 h, and then transferred back to YPD. RNA was isolated from cells harvested from the glycerol medium or after 2 or 3 h of growth in glucose-rich medium and analyzed by Northern blotting. To estimate the amounts of newly synthesized tRNAs, we used intron probes complementary to pre-tRNATyr, pre-tRNALeu, and pre-tRNAPhe (Fig. 5A). Quantification of the intron-containing tRNA precursors revealed a similar repression of Pol III activity in both wild-type and msn5-Δ strains upon transition of glucose-grown cells to glycerol and a similar derepression level upon transition back to glucose medium (Fig. 5B). Clearly, Maf1 nuclear export was not essential for the derepression of Pol III transcription upon growth on a fermentable carbon source. Derepression of Pol III Is Correlated with Phosphorylated State of Maf1—To better understand the relationship between Pol III derepression and the presence of phosphorylated Maf1, we selected Maf1 mutants defective in Pol III regulation and examined their phosphorylation status. A fragment of the MAF1 gene was PCR-amplified under mutagenic conditions and transformed to maf1-Δ cells together with the gaped Maf1-encoding single copy plasmid pRS315-MAF1. Transformants selected as unable to grow at 37 °C on YPGly, likely to influence Maf1 phosphorylation, were checked by sequencing for MAF1 mutations and then examined by Western blotting. This revealed two mutant strains, pAG23 (Phe32 → Ser, Ile54 → Thr, Ans142 → Asp) and pAG49 (Asn17 → His and Leu43 → Ser), which had constant phosphorylation of Maf1, even when cultivated in glycerol medium (Fig. 6, top panel). An altered pattern of Maf1 phosphorylation observed in mutants may be related to the new serines generated by the amino acid substitutions. To inspect the effect of pAG23 and pAG49 on Pol III activity, RNA isolated from the respective cells grown in YPD and transferred to YPGly was analyzed by Northern blotting using a probe complementary to pre-tRNALeu. Clearly, both mutants were defective in their ability to repress tRNALeu transcription upon transfer from glucose to glycerol medium (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Thus, the constant phosphorylation of Maf1 precluded Pol III repression. RNA Pol III produces essential components of the protein biosynthesis machinery, and therefore its activity is tightly coupled to cell growth and metabolism. The mechanism for this coordination is provided by Maf1, a general negative regulator conserved from yeast to man (2Pluta K. Lefebvre O. Martin N.C. Smagowicz W.J. Stanford D.R. Ellis S.R.

Maf1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 15.7% of serines, which provide nearly 30 potential phosphorylation sites specific for several kinases (data according to Swiss-Prot PROSITE). Thus, phosphorylation of different sites may be used to regulate Maf1 function under various conditions. However, so far there has been no proof that Maf1 activity is controlled by phosphorylation, although indirect indications were obvious. First, protein phosphatase 2A was shown to be required for Maf1-generated repression of Pol III and for nuclear accumulation of Maf1 in response to rapamycin (3Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O.

Second, it was shown that under conditions of favorable growth, Maf1 was largely phosphorylated and located mostly in the cytoplasm, although a low level of phosphorylated and nuclearly localized Maf1 was also observed (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Moir R.D.

In this report we present evidence that both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Maf1 may occur inside the nucleus. Concomitantly with phosphorylation, Maf1 is exported to the cytoplasm by the Msn5 carrier. However, it is not the export but the phosphorylation of Maf1 that is essential for the derepression of Pol III transcription in response to favorable growth conditions. As shown previously, Maf1 is relocated out of the nucleus in response to a shift of respiratory growing culture to a medium with glucose (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We used this observation to examine yeast mutants defective in various exportins and found constitutive nuclear localization of Maf1 in msn5-Δ cells. Two lines of evidence show that Msn5 functions as an exportin for Maf1. When the msn5-Δ cells are transformed with an Msn5-encoding plasmid, relocation of Maf1 to the cytoplasm is observed again. Furthermore, using coimmunoprecipitation we were able to show that Maf1 interacts with Msn5. It is worth mentioning that the Msn5 carrier, nuclearly localized under standard conditions in glucose, becomes redistributed to the cytoplasm upon transfer to a medium with a nonfermentable carbon source (16Quan X. Tsoulos P. Kuritzky A. Zhang R. Stochaj U. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 592-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was shown that whenever Msn5 was detected in the cytoplasm, Saa4 protein, another Msn5 cargo, was concentrated in the nucleus (16Quan X. Tsoulos P. Kuritzky A. Zhang R. Stochaj U. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 592-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was suggested that when Msn5 was sequestered in the cytoplasm, it was unable to ferry its cargo from the nucleus. The location of Msn5 may affect distribution of Maf1 in a similar manner. It has been suggested previously that Msn5 specifically exports phosphoproteins because several Msn5 cargoes, such as Pho4, Mig1, Crz1, Aft1, Cdh1, and HO, have to be phosphorylated to be relocated out of the nucleus (17Kaffman A.

Biol. 1999; 9: R803-R806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, binding of Msn5 to other cargoes, such as Far1, does not depend on the cargo phosphorylation state (24Blondel M. Alepuz P.M. Huang L.S. Shaham S. Ammerer G. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2284-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The good synchronization of phosphorylation and export to the cytoplasm observed for Maf1 in wild-type cells suggests that both processes might be interdependent. This relation becomes more understandable when studied in strains with altered Msn5 levels. Examination of msn5-Δ cells shows that export to the cytoplasm is not necessary for Maf1 phosphorylation. This experiment clearly documents that Maf1 can be dephosphorylated and phosphorylated in the nucleus, suggesting that phosphorylation of Maf1 precedes its export. This is not questioned by examination of a strain overproducing Msn5. Although the rate of Maf1 export was enhanced with no change in the kinetics of its phosphorylation, a slight amount of the phosphorylated form appeared at the same time when relocation to the cytoplasm became visible. Most likely, the excess of Msn5 titrates phosphorylated Maf1 more quickly. In summary, we concluded that during the transfer of cells from a nonfermentable carbon source to glucose, nuclear Maf1 becomes phosphorylated and subsequently exported to the cytoplasm by Msn5. Thus, Maf1 belongs to the major category of Msn5 substrates, which are bound by Msn5 as phosphoproteins. Similar to the other Msn5 cargoes, Maf1 does not contain an obvious leucinerich nuclear export signal. A comparative bioinformatic analysis of all Msn5 cargoes showed no common motifs or domains, thus suggesting Msn5 binding to a specific secondary structure containing phosphate residues. The kinase that phosphorylates Maf1 upon transferring cells from a nonfermentable carbon source to glucose has not been identified yet. The nuclear localization of this kinase has been suggested by examination of Maf1 phosphorylation in msn5-Δ cells. However, it cannot be excluded that the unknown kinase is also Msn5 cargo. In this case, the kinase would likewise be retained in the nucleus of msn5-Δ cells but transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in cells that do express Msn5. Thus, it remains to be shown whether Maf1 can be phosphorylated within the nucleus of wild-type yeast. Maf1 was previously found as a substrate of protein kinase A kinase (9Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Budovskaya Y.V. Stephan J.S. Deminoff S.J. Herman P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13933-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, our previous data indicated that the protein kinase A-directed phosphorylation of Maf1 was not involved in the coupling of Pol III regulation to the carbon source (8Ciesla M. Towpik J. Graczyk D. Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Suleau A. Balicki K. Conesa C. Lefebvre O. Boguta M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7693-7702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein kinase A is considered, rather, a cytoplasmic kinase, although its nuclear localization is also possible (26Griffioen G. Thevelein J.M. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previously, Moir et al. (9Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that protein kinase A-directed phosphorylation of Maf1 prohibited its nuclear import under favorable growth conditions. It may be that phosphorylation of protein kinase A sites in Maf1 prevents its entry to the nucleus, whereas phosphorylation of other sites by an unknown nuclear kinase works against interaction of Maf1 with Pol III. Interestingly, despite the unusual, constitutively nuclear localization of Maf1 in msn5-Δ cells, Pol III-transcribed genes are under proper regulation. This indicates that phosphorylation of nuclear Maf1 causes Pol III derepression in glucose-grown cells. This hypothesis is further supported by our finding of a direct link between constant Maf1 phosphorylation and the defect in Pol III regulation observed in pAG23 and pAG49 mutants. Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of Maf1 by an unknown nuclear kinase is a key part of the mechanism controlling Pol III (3Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Smagowicz W.J. Gonzalez de Peredo A. Boguta M. Sentenac A. Lefebvre O. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism of this regulation remains to be elucidated. A study of the Msn5-dependent cytoplasmic accumulation of Maf1 allowed us to learn important aspects of Maf1 function; a proposed scheme is presented in Fig. 7. Following a transfer of cells to favorable growth conditions, nuclear Maf1 is phosphorylated by an unknown kinase, which prevents its interaction with Pol III and leads to derepression of transcription. The phosphorylated Maf1 is relocated out of the nucleus by the Msn5 exportin. In parallel, protein kinase A-directed phosphorylation at different sites prevents nuclear import of the newly synthesized cytoplasmic Maf1 by interference with its nuclear localization signal sequence (9Moir R.D. Lee J. Haeusler R.A. Desai N. Engelke D.R. Willis I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This means that Maf1 phosphorylation operates at several levels. Apart from decreasing direct Maf1 binding to Pol III (3Oficjalska-Pham D. Harismendy O. Smagowicz W.J. Gonzalez de Peredo A. Boguta M. Sentenac A. Lefebvre O. Mol.

Due to its preferentially hydrophobic solubility, NO molecules tend to partition from the aqueous milieu into biological membranes. We hypothesized that plasma membrane ordering provided by cholesterol further couples the physics of NO diffusion with cellular signaling. Fluorescence lifetime quenching studies with pyrene liposome preparations showed that the presence of cholesterol decreased apparent diffusion coefficients of NO ∼20–40%, depending on the phospholipid composition. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the diffusion rate of NO across artificial bilayer membranes were inversely related to cholesterol content. Sterol transport-defective Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) fibroblasts exhibited increased plasma membrane cholesterol content but decreased activation of both intracellular soluble guanylyl cyclase and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation at Ser239 induced by exogenous NO exposure relative to their normal human fibroblast (NHF) counterparts. Augmentation of plasma membrane cholesterol in NHF diminished production of both cGMP and VASP phosphorylation elicited by NO to NPC1-comparable levels. Conversely, decreasing membrane cholesterol in NPC1 resulted in the augmentation in both cGMP and VASP phosphorylation to a level similar to those observed in NHF. Increasing plasma membrane cholesterol contents in NHF, platelets, erythrocytes and tumor cells also resulted in an increased level of extracellular diaminofluorescein nitrosation following NO exposure.

Numerous levels of regulation at the level of nitric oxide synthase catalysis influence the rate of NO generation. Spatial localization of the biological signal is secondarily determined by a combination of the distinct physical and chemical properties of NO within the context of the microenvironment in which it was formed.

In addition to its very small size, the diffusional path of NO from the point of origin is affected by its preferentially hydrophobic solubility (7Wood J. Garthwaite J. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 8Philippides A. Husbands P. O'Shea M. J.

In the present work, the hypothesis that cells may utilize plasma membrane cholesterol to further orchestrate spatial heterogeneity in NO biological signaling activity was tested. Cholesterol, a major lipid component of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells, plays an essential role in maintaining membrane fluidity and architecture (9Pucadyil T.J. Chattopadhyay A. Chem. Phys.

Cells tightly control the ratio of cholesterol and phospholipids in membranes to best suit their biological functions. Within the plasma membrane, cholesterol segregated with sphingolipids and selective proteins form distinct lipid raft complexes that act as ordered platforms for communicating signals into and out of cells (12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8090) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of cholesterol synthesis and transport acts as a contributing factor to pathophysiological changes (13Preston Mason R. Tulenko T.N. Jacob R.F. Biochim. Biophys.

The influence of cholesterol on NO diffusion was directly quantified in liposomal and artificial bilayer preparations. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activation, VASP phosphorylation (Ser239), and extracellular diaminofluorescein (DAF) nitrosation were used to investigate the effect of cellular plasma membrane cholesterol content on NO signaling dynamics. Taken together, these data show that plasma membrane cholesterol content modulates the level and type of NO signaling; pathological alterations in levels and distribution of cellular cholesterol may constitute a mechanism of errant NO signaling. Tris base, EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, diaminofluorescein diacetate, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, diethylaminetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), hemoglobin, sodium dithionite, malachite green, ammonium molybdate, and performic acid were obtained from Sigma. Alexa 532 succinimidyl ester and the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit were obtained from Invitrogen. 1-Hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Mn(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (Mn(III)TMPyP) was from Cedarlane Laboratories (Hornby, Canada). The cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit was from Amersham Biosciences. NO (gas), 10% with argon balance (BOC Gases, Mississauga, Canada), was purified by bubbling though 1 m KOH solution and used directly for experiments or dissolved in deoxygenated PBS with 500 μm DTPA and quantified spectrophotometrically by a hemoglobin assay as previously described (18Gomes B. Savignac M. Cabral M.D. Paulet P. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Feil R. Hofmann F. Guery J.C. Dietrich G. Pelletier L. J. Biol.

Normal human fibroblasts (HFF-1) and MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells (HTB-22) were obtained from ATCC (Manasass, VA), and NPC1 fibroblasts (GM17923) were from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and cultivated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Erythrocytes and platelets were isolated from freshly drawn whole blood by differential centrifugation as indicated. NO Diffusion Measured by Quenching of Excited State Pyrene-labeled Membrane Lipids—The interaction of excited state pyrene moieties with paramagnetic species, such as NO and O2, are diffusion-controlled processes (19Birks J.B. The Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley Interscience, London1970Google Scholar) and have previously been used to monitor the diffusion of nitric oxide in hydrophobic environments, allowing determination of apparent diffusion coefficients (20Denicola A.

We thus prepared liposomes of either dimyristoyl- or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in the presence or absence of 33 mol % cholesterol doped with 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as previously described. Briefly, KOH-scrubbed nitric oxide from a 10% gas mixture (balance argon) was bubbled into oxygen-free liposome samples in sealed cuvettes equilibrated to 37 °C while monitoring fluorescence quenching (λex = 337 nm, λem = 376 nm) in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer (Cary Eclipse, Varian, Mississauga, Canada). 10-μl aliquots were removed with a gas-tight syringe, and NO was determined by an NO-specific electrode and comparison with a standard curve. Stern-Volmer plots were constructed by plotting the fractional quenching observed against the measured [NO] for not less than five replicate runs each with a coefficient of linearity >0.95. Quenching constants (kq) were then determined from the slope (kq = ksv/τ) using previously published fluorescence lifetimes (τo) of 178 and 194 ns for DMPC and DMPC-cholesterol and 163 ns in DPPC and 178 ns in DPPC-cholesterol (23Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Diffusion coefficients (D) were calculated from the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation (kq = 4π RDN) (20Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), (where R represents the sum of the molecular radii (6 × 108 cm–1) (19Birks J.B. The Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley Interscience, London1970Google Scholar) and N is Avogadro's number) and subsequently used to calculate membrane transit times using the equation 〈x〉2 = 2Dt (24Einstein A. Annalen der Physik. 1905; 17: 549-560Crossref Scopus (4480) Google Scholar). NO Diffusion in a BLM Chamber—The BLM chamber was purchased from Eastern Scientific (Rockville, MD). The desired ratios of cholesterol/phospholipid were prepared in decane in a vial sealed with a septum and purged with N2 (gas). A 5-μl aliquot of this solution was withdrawn and placed on the 1-mm hole in the Teflon divider in the BLM chamber. Both sides of the chamber were then filled with PBS at a rate of 500 μl/min. The entire BLM chamber was maintained at 37 °C, and both sides of the chamber were stirred with the aid of micro-stir bars. The formation of the lipid bilayer was monitored by the saturation of capacitance and by visual inspection. A constant amount of NO (gas) (ultrapure 1%, 99% argon), 200 μl/min, was metered out with a Matheson gas regulator (FM-1050) and introduced to one side of the chamber. The amount of NO (aq) diffusing through the BLM was measured with an NO electrode (WPI, Inc.) as a function of time and recorded digitally via Duo-18 software (WPI). Synthesis, Purification, and Alexa 532 Labeling of PFO-D4—Plasmid pRT10 containing the perfringolysin O gene (pfoA) was used to construct the pfoA derivative D4 encoding the C-terminal region of the toxin. The DNA fragment containing the D4 (Lys391–Asn500)-encoding region was PCR-amplified using pRT10 plasmid as the template and ligated into the pTrcHisB expression vector, inserting it between the BamHI and KpNI restriction sites on the 3′-end of the sequence encoding the His tag site. The polymerase chain reaction primers used were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCCGGATCCGTCTACAGAGTATTCTAAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCCGGTACCGGATTGTAAGTAATACTAGATCC-3′. His-tagged PFO-D4 was isolated on a Ni2+ affinity column after successive washes totaling 8 column volumes with 30 mm imidazole in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. PFO-D4 was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in pH 8.0 100 mm Tris buffer and concentrated, and purity was demonstrated to be >95% by image analysis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Isolated PFO-D4 extensively dialyzed and labeled overnight with a 5-fold molar excess of Alexa 532 succinimidyl ester (ϵ = 81000 liters mol–1 cm–1) at 4 °C, separated from unreacted dye on a Sephadex-G25 column, and the extent of labeling was calculated as the molar ratio of dye to protein. Preparation of Cholesterol-loaded Cyclodextrin—Cyclodextrin was charged with cholesterol as per previously described methods (25Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modulation of Cellular Plasma Membrane Cholesterol—Cellular cholesterol was augmented by treatment with cholesterol-loaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) adduct. In brief, suspensions of 106 trypsinized cells in PBS containing 500 μm DTPA were incubated with 100 μm adduct (determined on the basis of cholesterol by enzymatic assay) for 15 min with gentle nutation. Alternately, cellular cholesterol could be depleted using either apo-MβCD or cholesterol oxidase. Thus, 106 cells in suspension were incubated with either 5 mm MβCD for 1 h or 2 units/ml cholesterol oxidase for 15 min at 37 °C with gentle rotation. Following cellular treatment, cholesterol-modulating agents were removed, and cells were used for experimentation. Imaging of Cellular Plasma Membrane Cholesterol with Alexa 532-labeled PFO-D4—Cells on coverslips were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in HEPES buffer, washed three times, and stained with 400 nm Alexa 532-labeled PFO-D4 for 30 min with gentle shaking. Cells were washed again three times and imaged on an Axiovert epifluorescence microscope with 535 nm/550 nm excitation/emission under identical exposure conditions. Images were pseudocolored red using Northern Eclipse 6.0 imaging software, and the average intensity per unit of cell area was measured for 50–80 cells from not less than three independent slides of cells. Isolation and Characterization of NHF/NPC1 Plasma Membrane Lipids—The cells of 3 T75 flasks at ∼85% confluence were trypsinized and washed once with 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and then once with 10 mm hypotonic Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA and 1 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A 1-ml suspension was then homogenized by 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Mechanical disruption was verified by microscopic inspection, and the homogenate was spun at 190 × g for 10 min. Subsequent isolation of plasma membrane lipids was performed as previously described (16Vainio S. Bykov I. Hermansson M. Jokitalo E. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lipid suspension isolated in buffer was extracted twice with 200 μl of 1:1 MeOH/CHCl3 and back-extracted once with 1 m NaCl, and the solvent was evaporated in a glass tube under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Western Analysis of PM Proteins—10 μg of protein from each lipid suspension isolate was loaded into separate wells for resolution by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with primary antibodies to transferrin receptor, PDI, and LAMP1, followed by treatment with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The bands were visualized with a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Pierce). Phospholipid Analysis—Lipid film was dissolved in 200 μl of HClO3 and digested for 60 min at 180 °C. Aliquots of the acidified digest were mixed with malachite green and ammonium molybdate, and the absorbance was measured at 630 nm using previously published methods (26Linder A.E. McCluskey L.P. Cole III, K.R. Lanning K.M. Webb R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 314: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Phosphorous concentration was interpolated from a standard curve, and phospholipid content/106 cells was estimated by the following conversion factor: [phospholipid] (μmol) = [phosphorous] (μmol) × 25. Cholesterol Analysis—Lipid film was sonicated in 200 μl of CHAPS/Triton/sodium cholate buffer, and cholesterol was quantified using a cholesterol oxidase enzymatic assay (Invitrogen) and interpolation from a standard curve. In brief, solubilized cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to the cholest-4-en-3-one, producing hydrogen peroxide as a reaction by-product. Cholesterol oxidase-mediated production of H2O2 is coupled to the oxidation of 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine to the highly fluorescent resorufin product by horseradish peroxidase. Cholesterol determination was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to monitor resorufin formation in a 96-well plate at 37 °C with an excitation/emission couple of 545/595 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor 3 fluorescent plate reader. cGMP Production and VASP Phosphorylation as Measures of Intracellular NO Signaling—Cells were cultivated to ∼85% confluence and treated with 500 μm l-NMMA for 2 h to inhibit endogenous NO production. The cells were incubated a further 2 min with the SOD mimetic Mn(III)TMPyP (5 μm) and exposed to the NO donor DEA/NO (1 μm and 3 μm) and left undisturbed for 10 min in the incubator. Cells were trypsinized, collected, washed once with PBS containing 500 μm DTPA, and counted. After being adjusted for cell density (∼5 × 105 cells/ml), the cells were centrifuged and lysed with buffer containing phosphodiesterase and protease inhibitors. The lysates were then analyzed for either cGMP with an enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences) or VASP and phospho-VASP by Western immunoblotting with VASP and phospho-VASP (Ser239) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). Measurement of NOx-mediated Extracellular Nitrosation by Cell-impermeant DAF—NO uptake and metabolism to species capable of nitrosating DAF was also monitored by the reaction of extracellular DAF-2 with NO supplied by exogenous NO donor in the presence of intact cells. Cells are capable of acting as “NO sinks” and will take up a portion of NO from an extracellular donor, thus preventing its reaction with a NOx-sensitive fluorophore, such as DAF-2. This approach has the additional benefit of circumventing potential intracellular interferences, which can contribute to artifactual DAF-2T signals (27Garcia Arguinzonis M.I. Galler A.B. Walter U.

Adherent NHF and NPC1-deficient fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells were trypsinized, collected, and washed once with and suspended in PBS containing 500 μm DTPA. Human red blood cells and platelets were isolated from whole blood by differential centrifugation and suspended in PBS containing 500 μm DTPA. Cells were suspended to a final concentration of 10 μm DAF-2 in a fluorescent microplate, and counts were optimized to consume ∼50% of delivered NO upon the addition of 250 nm DEA/NO. Membrane cholesterol was then augmented or depleted as indicated above. Cell viability following treatment was measured by a trypan blue exclusion assay to be greater than 90% in all cases. Excess cholesterol adduct, cyclodextrin, or enzyme was removed, and cells were suspended in a 10 μm DAF solution in PBS containing 0.5 mm DTPA and then treated with the 250 nm DEA/NO for monitoring of evolved fluorescence over time in the wells of a 96-well microplate with shaking at 37 °C using an excitation/emission couple of 485/515 nm, unless otherwise indicated. Cholesterol Attenuates Rates of NO-induced Pyrene Quenching in Liposomes—The interaction between excited state pyrene moieties and paramagnetic species, such as NO and O2, are diffusion-controlled processes (19Birks J.B. The Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley Interscience, London1970Google Scholar) and have previously been used to determine apparent diffusion coefficients of NO in hydrophobic environments (20Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Denicola A. Batthyany C. Lissi E. Freeman B.A. Rubbo H. Radi R. J. Biol.

Preparations of pyrene fluorochrome encapsulated with either dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (DPPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline (DMPC) liposomes were exposed to NO gas while sealed in cuvettes under anaerobic conditions. NO diffusion into the liposome was represented by fluorescence quenching of excited state pyrene molecules. These data were expressed as a Stern-Volmer (SV) relationship where the fractional quenching (Io/I) obtained from fluorescence monitoring was plotted against the measured concentration of NO (Fig. 1, A and B). The addition of cholesterol (33 mol %) to either DPPC or DMPC liposomes resulted in a 28 and 29% decrease, respectively, in the slope (Ksv) of Stern-Volmer plot indicating a decrease in NO collisions with pyrene moieties within the lipid phase. The bimolecular quenching constant (kq) for each liposome preparation was determined by dividing the Ksv for each experiment by the previously published fluorescence lifetime (τo) for each liposome mixture: kq = Ksv/τo. Apparent diffusion coefficients for NO were then estimated from the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation (24Einstein A. Annalen der Physik. 1905; 17: 549-560Crossref Scopus (4480) Google Scholar). These calculations indicated that the presence of cholesterol in DPPC and DMPC liposomes decreases the diffusion constants by ∼24 and ∼38%, respectively, suggesting a substantial influence of cholesterol over the diffusion of NO in a liposome environment (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of cholesterol on the measured diffusion coefficients and resultant membrane transit timeskqD (quencher)Transit timem-1 s-1cm2 s-1μsDPPC3.07 × 1096.76 × 10-61.48DPPC + 30% cholesterol2.25 × 1094.95 × 10-62.02DMPC5.06 × 1091.11 × 10-50.89DMPC + 30% cholesterol3.61 × 1097.95 × 10-61.25 Open table in a new tab Diffusion of NO across Bilayer Lipid Membranes Decreases as a Function of Increasing Cholesterol—A NO-sensitive electrode was used to directly measure the relationship between cholesterol content and the rate of NO diffusion through an artificial bilayer membrane (BLM). A BLM composed of DPPC was prepared on a 1-mm hole in the gas-impermeable Teflon divider between two chambers containing phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7, 37 °C, stirring). The steady-state electrochemical signal recorded after the introduction of NO (1%, 200 μl/min) into the chamber opposing the electrode gave a trans-BLM membrane diffusion rate VNO of 0.0115 ± 0.00185 nmol of NO/min (Fig. 2). Under otherwise identical conditions, trans-BLM VNO decreased nonlinearly with increasing concentrations of cholesterol to 50% of the maximum VNO at ∼17 mol % bilayer cholesterol content. The absence of linearity may be attributed to inhomogeneities in membrane structure induced by cholesterol rather than the effects of bulk cholesterol in the membrane. Taken together, these experiments provided readily quantifiable data showing that NO transit through membranes decreased as a function of cholesterol content. Niemann-Pick C1, Normal Human Fibroblasts, and Methyl-β-cyclodextrin Depletion/Repletion as a Model System for Altering Cellular Cholesterol Plasma Membrane Content—NPC1 fibroblasts have been shown to exhibit a marked increase in plasma membrane cholesterol content (16Vainio S. Bykov I. Hermansson M. Jokitalo E. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and decreased membrane fluidity relative to normal human fibroblasts (16Vainio S. Bykov I. Hermansson M. Jokitalo E. Somerharju P.

Acta. 1998; 1406: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, plasma membranes isolated from NPC1 fibroblasts were found to contain ∼2-fold higher total cholesterol content relative to NHF, whereas a similar level of resident proteins (data not shown) and phospholipid content was present in both cell types (Fig. 3A). Microscopic visualization of cells labeled with perfringolysin domain 4 (PFO-D4)-specific probes that bind to cholesterol-enriched lipid raft microdomains (30Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Waheed A.A. Hayashi M. Inomata M. Nakamura M. Maruya M. Iwashita S. Anaerobe. 2004; 10: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) revealed two distinctive phenotypic patterns (Fig. 3, B–E). In contrast to the punctate staining of NHF, NPC1 fibroblasts exhibited a uniform distribution across the surface of the plasma membrane. In agreement with the isolated plasma membrane data, average intensity of PFO-D4 labeling per cell was 3.7-fold greater on NPC1 fibroblasts relative to NHF (Fig. 3F). MβCD is a water-soluble cyclic oligosaccharide that either accepts or transfers a cholesterol molecule through interaction with the plasma membrane (23Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W.

https://openalex.org/W1989869677,"The Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) comprises dystrophin, dystroglycan, sarcoglycan, dystrobrevin and syntrophin subunits. In muscle fibers, it is thought to provide an essential mechanical link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix and to protect the sarcolemma during muscle contraction. Mutations affecting the DGC cause muscular dystrophies. Most members of the DGC are also concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where their deficiency is often associated with NMJ structural defects. Hence, synaptic dysfunction may also intervene in the pathology of dystrophic muscles. Dystroglycan is a central component of the DGC because it establishes a link between the extracellular matrix and Dystrophin. In this study, we focused on the synaptic role of Dystroglycan (Dg) in Drosophila.We show that Dg was concentrated postsynaptically at the glutamatergic NMJ, where, like in vertebrates, it controls the concentration of synaptic Laminin and Dystrophin homologues. We also found that synaptic Dg controlled the amount of postsynaptic 4.1 protein Coracle and alpha-Spectrin, as well as the relative subunit composition of glutamate receptors. In addition, both Dystrophin and Coracle were required for normal Dg concentration at the synapse. In electrophysiological recordings, loss of postsynaptic Dg did not affect postsynaptic response, but, surprisingly, led to a decrease in glutamate release from the presynaptic site.Altogether, our study illustrates a conservation of DGC composition and interactions between Drosophila and vertebrates at the synapse, highlights new proteins associated with this complex and suggests an unsuspected trans-synaptic function of Dg."
https://openalex.org/W2021405930,"Revealing the spectrum of combinatorial regulation of transcription at individual promoters is essential for understanding the complex structure of biological networks. However, the computations represented by the integration of various molecular signals at complex promoters are difficult to decipher in the absence of simple cis regulatory codes. Here we synthetically shuffle the regulatory architecture — operator sequences binding activators and repressors — of a canonical bacterial promoter. The resulting library of complex promoters allows for rapid exploration of promoter encoded logic regulation. Among all possible logic functions, NOR and ANDN promoter encoded logics predominate. A simple transcriptional cis regulatory code determines both logics, establishing a straightforward map between promoter structure and logic phenotype. The regulatory code is determined solely by the type of transcriptional regulation combinations: two repressors generate a NOR: NOT (a OR b) whereas a repressor and an activator generate an ANDN: a AND NOT b. Three-input versions of both logics, having an additional repressor as an input, are also present in the library. The resulting complex promoters cover a wide dynamic range of transcriptional strengths. Synthetic promoter shuffling represents a fast and efficient method for exploring the spectrum of complex regulatory functions that can be encoded by complex promoters. From an engineering point of view, synthetic promoter shuffling enables the experimental testing of the functional properties of complex promoters that cannot necessarily be inferred ab initio from the known properties of the individual genetic components. Synthetic promoter shuffling may provide a useful experimental tool for studying naturally occurring promoter shuffling."

https://openalex.org/W2076911359,"HFE2 (hemochromatosis type 2 gene) is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and liver hepatocytes. Its encoded protein, hemojuvelin (HJV), is a co-receptor for the bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP2 and BMP4) and enhances the BMP-induced hepcidin expression. Hepcidin is a central iron regulatory hormone predominantly secreted from hepatocytes. HJV also binds neogenin, a membrane protein widely expressed in many tissues. Neogenin is required for the processing and release of HJV from cells. The role that neogenin plays in HJV trafficking was investigated, using HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. Knockdown of endogenous neogenin markedly suppresses HJV release but has no evident effect on HJV trafficking to the plasma membrane. The addition of a soluble neogenin ectodomain to cells markedly inhibits HJV release, indicating that the HJV shedding is not processed before trafficking to the cell surface. At the plasma membrane it undergoes endocytosis in a dynamin-independent but cholesterol-dependent manner. The additional findings that HJV release is coupled to lysosomal degradation of neogenin and that cholesterol depletion by filipin blocks both HJV endocytosis and HJV release suggest that neogenin-mediated HJV release occurs after the HJV-neogenin complex is internalized from the cell surface. HFE2 (hemochromatosis type 2 gene) is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and liver hepatocytes. Its encoded protein, hemojuvelin (HJV), is a co-receptor for the bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP2 and BMP4) and enhances the BMP-induced hepcidin expression.

Iron is an essential nutrient for a variety of biochemical processes. Iron uptake into the body via the intestines is controlled primarily by hepcidin (1Nemeth E. Ganz T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 323-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Hepcidin, a central iron-regulatory peptide hormone, is predominantly produced by hepatocytes, circulates in blood, and is excreted in urine (1Nemeth E. Ganz T. Annu. Rev.

Hepatic hepcidin expression is regulated by dietary or parenteral iron loading, iron stores, erythropoietic activity, tissue hypoxia, and inflammation (1Nemeth E. Ganz T. Annu. Rev.

Hepcidin deficiency resulting from the primary mutations in human HFE (hemochromatosis gene), TFR2 (transferrin receptor 2 gene), hemochromatosis type 2 gene (HFE2), or the hepcidin gene itself (HAMP) is the major cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (6Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). This heterogeneous group of inherited iron overload disorders has a wide range of clinical severity. HFE2 is a recently cloned gene in humans and encodes a protein termed hemojuvelin (HJV) 2The abbreviations used are: HJV, hemojuvelin; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CM, conditioned culture medium; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI-PLC, Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; RGM, repulsive guidance molecule; Tf, transferrin; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MEM, minimum essential medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MesNa, sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate; tTA, tetracycline transactivator.

RGMa and RGMb are expressed primarily in the developing and adult central nervous system, which do not overlap with HFE2 expression (8Schmidtmer J. Engelkamp D. Gene Expr.

The importance of HJV in iron homeostasis has been demonstrated by the observations that the homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of HFE2 gene cause the type 2A juvenile hemochromatosis, a particularly severe form of hereditary hemochromatosis (7Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C.

Disruption of both HFE2 alleles (Hjv-/-) in mice also causes a severe iron overload (5Niederkofler V. Salie R. Arber S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The marked suppression of hepatic hepcidin expression detected in juvenile hemochromatosis patients with the HFE2 mutation as well as in the Hjv-/- mice has implicated HJV as a key upstream regulator of hepatic hepcidin expression (5Niederkofler V. Salie R. Arber S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L.

Investig. 2005; 115: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the liver, a recent study using lacZ as a marker indirectly showed a selective expression of HJV in periportal hepatocytes (5Niederkofler V. Salie R. Arber S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The hepatocyte is, therefore, the principal site in which HJV exerts its regulatory role on hepcidin expression. Like the other two RGM family members (RGMa and RGMb), HJV is a co-receptor for the bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP2 and BMP4). HJV enhances hepatic hepcidin expression via the BMP signaling pathway (14Babitt J.L. Huang F.W. Wrighting D.M. Xia Y. Sidis Y. Samad T.A. Campagna J.A. Chung R.T. Schneyer A.L. Woolf C.J. Andrews N.C. Lin H.Y. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Neither RGMa nor RGMb appears to play a role in the regulation of hepcidin expression. BMPs are cytokines of the transforming growth factor β superfamily that exhibit multiple roles in a wide variety of processes through different signaling pathways (15ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 16Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). BMP signaling is initiated upon ligand binding to BMP receptors, which leads to a sequential phosphorylation of receptor-activated Smads (Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8). The phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 form heteromeric complexes with Smad4. Upon formation, the complex translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (17Samad T.A. Rebbapragada A. Bell E. Zhang Y. Sidis Y. Jeong S.J. Campagna J.A. Perusini S. Fabrizio D.A. Schneyer A.L. Lin H.Y. Brivanlou A.H. Attisano L. Woolf C.J. J. Biol.

Recent findings showing that liver-specific disruption of Smad4 markedly decreases hepcidin expression and causes iron accumulation in mice (18Wang R.H. Li C. Xu X. Zheng Y. Xiao C. Zerfas P. Cooperman S. Eckhaus M. Rouault T. Mishra L. Deng C.X. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) also support the importance of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. The regulation of HJV appears to be primarily at the post-transcriptional level. HFE2 is expressed highly in both skeletal and heart muscle and at lower levels in liver (7Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L. MacFarlane J. Sakellaropoulos N. Politou M. Nemeth E. Thompson J. Risler J.K. Zaborowska C. Babakaiff R. Radomski C.C. Pape T.D.

HFE2 mRNA levels do not vary with iron loading in the liver of mice or with iron depletion in the skeletal muscle of rats (19Krijt J. Vokurka M. Chang K.T. Necas E.

HJV is a GPI-anchored protein (21Zhang A.S. West Jr., A.P. Wyman A.E. Bjorkman P.J. Enns C.A. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3273-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In agreement with the finding in iron-deficient rats, HJV release from the cell lines is inhibited by iron-saturated Tf (holo-Tf) or non-Tf iron salts (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R.

The observations that no evident defect in muscle development is observed in juvenile hemochromatosis patients and Hjv-/- mice rule out the possibility that HJV has a primary role in muscle development (7Papanikolaou G.

However, skeletal muscle, accounting for ∼35-40% of body weight, has the highest expression of HFE2 mRNA (7Papanikolaou G. Samuels M.E. Ludwig E.H. MacDonald M.L. Franchini P.L. Dube M.P. Andres L.

The findings that soluble HJV plays a critical role in the negative regulation of hepatic hepcidin expression through BMP signaling in hepatocytes support the idea that skeletal muscle may serve as a body iron sensor as well as the major source of serum HJV to indirectly modulate hepatic hepcidin expression by regulating the HJV release into the circulation (20Zhang A.S.

Our previous study showed that the interaction with neogenin is required for HJV release from muscle cells (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The G320V mutation in HJV accounts for approximately two-thirds of cases of type 2A juvenile hemochromatosis. This mutation disrupts the interaction of HJV with neogenin, blocks HJV release, and results in the decreased HJV targeting to the cell surface and the retention of HJV in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Papanikolaou G.

How neogenin is involved in this process remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of neogenin in HJV trafficking in HepG2 cells. We found that knockdown of endogenous neogenin markedly suppresses HJV release but has no evident effect on HJV trafficking to the plasma membrane. Release of HJV requires not only neogenin but also endocytosis presumably by a cholesterol-sensitive and dynamin-independent pathway. Cell Culture and Transfection—HepG2 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in MEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids (complete medium). HepG2 cells stably expressing G320V (G320V-HepG2) were generated using Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa Bio-systems) as previously described (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The G320V mutant HFE2 cDNA was prepared as previously reported (21Zhang A.S. West Jr., A.P. Wyman A.E. Bjorkman P.J. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33885-33894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells stably transfected with wild type HFE2 (HJV-HepG2) or pcDNA3 empty vector (control-HepG2) were generated previously (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The stably transfected cells were maintained in complete medium with 800 μg/ml G418. Knockdown of Endogenous Neogenin—Neogenin siRNA (Dharmacon) was used to knock down the endogenous neogenin in control and HJV-HepG2 cells as previously described (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) was used for the transfection. The negative control siRNA was the same as previously described (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with the siRNA twice on days 1 and 3 to maximize the efficacy of the knockdown. HJV in cell lysates and the conditioned medium (CM) and neogenin in cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Flow cytometry analysis was used to quantify the cell surface HJV in HJV-HepG2 cells with or without neogenin knockdown. Briefly, the cells were first detached from flasks with the cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). The cells were then incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-HJV antibody (4 μg/ml) in Hanks' buffer supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution; Caltag, Burlingame, CA) in the same buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer at the Core Facility of Oregon Health & Science University. Rabbit IgG and control-HepG2 cells were used as negative controls. The levels of cell surface HJV are expressed as arbitrary units. We used the standard deviation and the paired and two-tailed Student's t test to evaluate the statistical significance of the cell surface HJV in HepG2 cells with or without neogenin knockdown. Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Cleavage of Cell Surface HJV—Approximately 106 HJV-HepG2 cells in 6-well plate were incubated in 0.5 ml of plain MEM in presence or absence of PI-PLC (Molecular Probes) at the concentration of 1 unit/ml at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator or at 4 °C for the time intervals indicated in the text. The supernatants were collected, and the cell lysates were prepared using NET-Triton buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Approximately one-third of the cell lysates or supernatants was subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunodetection of HJV and neogenin as described under “Immunodetection.” HJV Release—The effects of the ectodomain (extracellular domain) of neogenin, bafilomycin A (an inhibitor of the vacuolar H+-ATPase; Sigma), dynasore (a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin; Sigma), and filipin (a cholesterol-binding agent; Sigma) on HJV release from HJV-HepG2 cells were examined. The ectodomain of neogenin was generated by subcloning the neogenin cDNA encoding the hydrophobic signal sequence (residues 1-33) and the ectodomain (residues 34-1103) with a C-terminal His6 tag into the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (BD Biosciences). The recombinant protein was purified from the supernatant of baculovirus-infected High 5 cells using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and gel filtration chromatography. HJV-HepG2 cells were cultured in the 12-well plates. After 48 h of incubation with 60% confluence, fresh MEM, 5% fetal calf serum was changed with the addition of neogenin ectodomain at 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 nm and incubated for 24 h. HJV in ∼50% of cell lysate and 20% of the CM was analyzed by Western blot. For the inhibitors, the experiments were conducted when HJV-HepG2 cells were ∼80% confluence. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of bafilomycin A (100 nm), dynasore (80 and 160 μm), or filipin (1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) for the indicated time intervals where no evident cytotoxicity was detected. The whole cell lysate and 50% of CM were analyzed. Expression of Wild Type and Mutant Dynamin—To block dynamin-mediated endocytosis, adenoviruses were used to infect cells to introduce wild type or K44A mutant dynamin-1 (dynamin) into HJV-HepG2 cells. The viruses were kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Schmid at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA). The viral infections were conducted as described previously with some modifications (38Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, HJV-HepG2 cells were subcultured into 12-well plates ∼24 h before the infection. The cells were overlaid with 250 μl of binding medium (Hanks' salts containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) containing the mixture of tTA activator virus and wild type or K44A-dynamin-1 virus at equal ratios. To generate the cells with various levels of dynamin, different amounts of virus were added as indicated in the text. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C to enable viral attachment and infection, binding medium was changed to complete medium. After 18 h of incubation to allow the expression of introduced dynamin, the medium was replaced with 600 μl of fresh complete medium. The cultured conditioned medium was collected to assay HJV release after an additional 24 h of incubation. The levels of dynamin in cell lysate were analyzed as described under “Immunodetection.” In this study, cells infected with tTA activator virus alone were served as negative controls. HJV Internalization—The internalization of biotinylated cell surface HJV was conducted as previously described (39VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5247-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol.

Briefly, HJV or control HepG2 cells in 6-well plate at ∼80% confluence were biotinylated with 0.25 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for the time intervals indicated in the text. Biotin remaining on cell surface was stripped using MesNa (Sigma) at 4 °C. Alternatively, the cells were incubated in presence of PI-PLC (1 unit/ml) at 4 °C for 3 h to release the cell surface GPI-anchored proteins. The cells were then solubilized in NET-Triton/1× protease inhibitors mixture, followed by using streptavidinagarose beads (Pierce) to isolate the biotinylated HJV (internalized fraction). The total cell surface HJV was isolated with strepavidin-agarose from biotinylated cells labeled at 4 °C. 125I-Tf Uptake—125I-Tf uptake was used to detect the effect of dynasore and filipin on TfR1-mediated Tf uptake. The rate of 125I-Tf uptake was determined as described previously (42Roy C.N. Penny D.M. Feder J.N. Enns C.A. J. Bio. Chem. 1999; 274: 9022-59028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. HepG2 cells in 6-well plates were first preincubated in 1 ml of uptake medium (MEM, 2 mg/ml ovalbumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) with dynasore (80 and 160 μm) or filipin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. 125Tf uptake was then initiated by changing to the uptake medium containing 50 nm 125Tf as well as the same concentrations of dynasore or filipin. The inclusion of 1 mg/ml unlabeled Tf was used as the control for nonspecific uptake. After an 8-min incubation at 37 °C, externally bound Tf was stripped by acid wash. The radioactivity remaining within cells was counted. The amount of specific uptake in the presence of inhibitors was expressed as the percentage of corresponding controls. The standard deviation and the paired and two-tailed Student's t test were used to evaluate the statistical significance between the groups with and without inhibitors. Immunodetection—Cell lysate protein and CM were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-HJV antibody (0.22 μg/ml), rabbit anti-neogenin antibody (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-dynamin (1:4000; Upstate), or mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000; Chemicon International), followed by immunodetection using corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The bands were exposed to x-ray film by chemiluminescence (Super Signal; Pierce). Knockdown of Endogenous Neogenin Has No Effect on HJV Trafficking to the Plasma Membrane but Blocks HJV Release—Our previous studies demonstrate that HJV interacts with neogenin in HEK293 cells and that interaction with neogenin is required for HJV release in C2C12 cells, a mouse myoblast cell line (20Zhang A.S. Anderson S.A. Meyers K.R. Hernandez C. Eisenstein R.S. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12"
https://openalex.org/W1965052348,"Aldose reductase (AR) is implicated in the development of a number of diabetic complications, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. We performed this study to determine whether and how AR might influence hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activity and lipid metabolism. Our results in mouse hepatocyte AML12 cells show that AR overexpression caused strong suppression of PPARα/δ activity (74%, p < 0.001) together with significant down-regulation of mRNA expression for acetyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. These suppressive effects were attenuated by the selective AR inhibitor zopolrestat. Furthermore, AR overexpression greatly increased the levels of phosphorylated PPARα and ERK1/2. Moreover, AR-induced suppression of PPARα activity was attenuated by treatment with an inhibitor for ERK1/2 but not that for phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p38, or JNK. Importantly, similar effects were observed for cells exposed to 25 mm glucose. In streptozotocin-diabetic mice, AR inhibitor treatment or genetic deficiency of AR resulted in significant dephosphorylation of both PPARα and ERK1/2. With the dephosphorylation of PPARα, hepatic acetyl-CoA oxidase and apolipoprotein C-III mRNA expression was greatly affected and that was associated with substantial reductions in blood triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid levels. These data indicate that AR plays an important role in the regulation of hepatic PPARα phosphorylation and activity and lipid homeostasis. A significant portion of the AR-induced modulation is achieved through ERK1/2 signaling.

A significant portion of the AR-induced modulation is achieved through ERK1/2 signaling. The polyol pathway is a glucose metabolic shunt that is defined by two enzymatic reactions catalyzed by aldose reductase (AR, 4The abbreviations used are: AR, aldose reductase; ACO, acetyl CoA oxidase; APOA5, apolipoprotein A-V; APOC3, apolipoprotein C-III; ARI, aldose reductase inhibitor; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NEFA, nonesterified fatty acids; PPARα/γ/δ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ/δ; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response element; p38, p38 MAPK; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RT, reverse transcription; SDH, sorbitol dehydrogenase; STZ, streptozotocin; TG, triglyceride; zopol, zopolrestat; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PKC, protein kinase C; RLU, relative luciferase unit. AKR1B1, EC 1.1.1.21) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH, EC 1.1.1.14), respectively (1Hers J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). AR catalyzes the rate-limiting reduction of glucose to sorbitol with the aid of co-factor NADPH. SDH converts sorbitol to fructose using NAD+. The apparent Km value of AR for glucose is 30–80 mm (the Km value for the open chain conformation of glucose, the true substrate, is in the low micromolar range) (2Oates P.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2002; 50: 325-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At normal physiological glucose, about 5 mm glucose extracellularly, intracellular glucose is typically directed largely to glycolysis by hexokinase. However, at higher glucose concentrations, glycolysis becomes inhibited by citrate and ATP, and glucose can more readily enter other pathways, such as glycogenesis or the polyol pathway. Under normoglycemic conditions, about 1–3% of glucose is channeled through the polyol pathway in erythrocytes in vitro (3Morrison A.D. Clements Jr., R.S. Travis S.B. Oski F. Winegrad A.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, in 12–36 mm extracellular glucose, 30–50% of the lens glucose is metabolized by the polyol pathway to fructose (4Cheng H.M. Gonzalez R.G. Metabolism. 1986; 35: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The function of this glucose shunt remains unclear in many tissues because fructose and its metabolites re-enter the glycolytic pathway. Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor contributing to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and liver diseases. Symptoms of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients include elevated blood triglycerides (TG) and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and altered distribution of very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein. Interestingly, it has been shown that in these patients there are significant increases in plasma or serum and urinary sorbitol and fructose (5Kawasaki T. Akanuma H. Yamanouchi T. Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Poli T. Lapolla A. Valerio A. Fedele D. Acta Diabetol.

Pract. 2001; 51: 115-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating increased flux in the polyol pathway concomitant with hyperglycemia. In addition, significant positive correlations were recently reported in human subjects with diabetes between monocyte AR and serum TG (r = 0.41, p < 0.011 for AR) and SDH and TG (r = 0.48, p < 0.002) (8Julius U.A. Drel V.R. Graessler J. Obrosova I.G. Diabetes. 2008; 56: 233Google Scholar). Moreover, ponalrestat, an ARI, was previously shown in vivo in mouse adipose tissue to be able to prevent a reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity, a central enzyme in TG catabolism (9Kawamura I. Yamamoto N. Sakai F. Yamazaki H. Naoe Y. Inami M. Manda T. Shimomura K. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pharmacological administration of several other ARIs, including zopolrestat (zopol), were shown to reduce blood TG in rats (10Kallai-Sanfacon, M. (January 8, 1985) U. S. Patent 4,492,706Google Scholar), tumor bearing mice (9Kawamura I. Yamamoto N. Sakai F. Yamazaki H. Naoe Y. Inami M. Manda T. Shimomura K. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar), and diabetic human patients (11Peterson, M. J. (February 21, 1995) U. S. Patent 5,391,551Google Scholar), respectively. Together these data suggest a possible link between the activation/deactivation of AR/the polyol pathway and altered regulation in lipid metabolism. The liver is a major organ for glucose and lipid homeostasis. Depending on species and relative to a related enzyme, aldehyde reductase, the liver was found to have low-to-moderate levels of AR (12Markus H.B. Raducha M. Harris H. Biochem. Med. 1983; 29: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Clements Jr., R.S. Weaver J.P. Winegrad A.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Wirth H.P. Wermuth B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 174: 231-239PubMed Google Scholar) and a high level of SDH (15Jeffery J. Jornvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) under normal physiological conditions. Besides aldehyde reductase and AR, the liver contains several other AR-like proteins that possess AR-like activities (16Cao D. Fan S.T. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11429-11435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Scuric Z. Stain S.C. Anderson W.F. Hwang J.J.

Hepatology. 2004; 39: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In human, AR has been successfully purified from dissected liver tissues (19Steinerstauch P. Wermuth B. Leimbacher W. Curtius H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Of great interest is that hepatic AR has been shown to be greatly induced under certain conditions (20Brown K.E. Broadhurst K.A. Mathahs M.M. Kladney R.D. Fimmel C.J. Srivastava S.K. Brunt E.M. Histol. Histopathol. 2005; 20: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee K.W. Ko B.C. Jiang Z. Cao D. Chung S.S.

Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collectively, the above data raised the question of whether the changes in substrate flux through AR or activation/deactivation of AR/the polyol pathway in the liver might affect hepatic or whole body lipid metabolism. A recent study by Roglans et al. (23Roglans N. Vila L. Farre M. Alegret M. Sanchez R.M. Vazquez-Carrera M. Laguna J.C. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) demonstrated that fructose feeding in rats impairs the activation of hepatic transcriptional factor Stat3 and the activity of PPARα; the latter is a major lipid sensor and a transcriptional regulator for lipid metabolic enzymes in the liver (24Duval C. Muller M. Kersten S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prompted by this, we conducted this study to determine the effects of activation/deactivation of AR on the phosphorylation and activity of PPARα, in cultured mouse hepatocyte AML12 cells, and in diabetic mice. We also attempted to identify the possible kinase signaling pathways involved by using a number of protein kinase inhibitors in cell culture experiments. We further investigated the effects of up-regulation and inhibition of the activities of AR on several lipid metabolism end points in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Our data suggest that AR/the polyol pathway is indeed involved in the hepatic modulation of lipid metabolism, and it does so by influencing the activities of transcriptional factors and enzymes linked to lipid metabolism, in particular PPARα. This modulation is mainly achieved through the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of hepatic PPARα via an AR-linked ERK1/2 pathway. Antibodies, Inhibitors, and Plasmids—Antibodies were obtained from the following vendors, respectively: ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 (catalog number 9100) Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); PPARα (catalog number sc9000) and AR (catalog number sc17735), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-Ser-12 PPARα (catalog number ab3484) and phospho-Ser-21 PPARα (catalog number ab3485), Abcam (Cambridge, UK); β-actin (catalog number A1978) and anti-FLAG M2 (catalog number F1804), Sigma. PD98059, SB203580, SP600125, LY694002, and GW3335 were of analytical grade quality and from Sigma. Zopol was synthesized by the Department of Medicine Chemistry, Pfizer Global Research and Development (Groton, CT). Mouse AR cDNA was PCR-amplified from pBluescript-mAR, a plasmid containing a cDNA fragment for mouse AR, using the following primers: ATATGCGGCCGCGATGGCCAGCCATCTGGAA and TGCTCTAGATCAGACTTCGGCGTGGAA, carrying a NotI site and an XbaI site, respectively (underlined). The PCR products were cut with NotI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) to obtain plasmid pFLAG-mAR. PPRE-tk-luc with three PPAR-response elements, as described previously (25Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), was obtained from the Addgene. Plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase was purchased from Promega. Cell Culture—AML12 mouse hepatocytes cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured as instructed. PPAR Transcriptional Activities—AML12 cells were plated on 24-well plates at the cell density of ∼2.2 × 105/well. The next day, cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-mAR or pFLAG-CMV, the PPRE-tk-Luc plasmid, and pSV-β-galactosidase at a ratio of 1:3:1 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Six hours after transfection, cells were fed with fresh media with or without 10 μm PPARγ antagonist GW3335 (Sigma) and 100 μm zopol together with other treatments. Cells were further incubated for an additional 48 h prior to luciferase reporter assays. Luciferase reporter activities were determined using a luciferase reporter gene assay system (Promega) as instructed. PPAR activities were expressed as relative luciferase activity corrected for transfection efficiency (β-galactosidase activity) and normalized to the controls (normalized RLU). Semi-quantitative Analyses of mRNA Expression by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured AML12 cells and liver tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of acetyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1(CPT1), apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), and apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5) mRNAs. The primers used were as follows: 5′-CCGCCACCTTCAATCCAGAGTTA-3′ and 5′-TCACAGTTGGGCTGTTGAGAATG-3′ (ACO); 5′-GGACGAATCGGAACAGGGATA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGTAATGTGCGAGCTGCA-3′ (CPT1); 5′-CCTCTTGGCTCTCCTGGCATCT-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCAGTAGCCTTTCAGGG-3′ (APOC3); 5′-GTGGGAGAAGACACCAAGGCTC-3′ and 5′-GGTCAATGGCCTGAGTAAATGC-3′ (APOA5); and 5′-CGAGACCCCACTAACATCAAA-3′ and 5′-AGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT-3′ (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). DNA amplification was carried out using a High Fidelity primeScript™ RT-PCR Kit (Takara). The PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The integrated density values of the bands representing amplified products were acquired and analyzed by Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). Kinase Inhibitors and ERK1/2 and PPARα Activities and Phosphorylation—AML12 cells were prepared and transfected as described above. Six hours after transfection, cells were fed with fresh media containing 10 μm GW3335 together with either vehicle or one of the four kinase inhibitors, which included 25 μm PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Sigma), 100 μm ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (Sigma), 10 μm SB203580 (JNK), and 10 μm SP600125 (p38). Cells were further incubated for an additional 36 h prior to luciferase reporter assays. Time Course Effects of 25 mm Glucose on AR, PPARα, and ERK1/2 Expression and Phosphorylation—AML12 cells were prepared as stated previously and incubated with 5.5 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media for 24 h and then replaced with fresh 25 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively, starting from 25 mm glucose incubation. Cells lysates were prepared as stated below for Western blot analyses. Effects of High Glucose and Fructose on PPAR Activities—AML12 cells were prepared as stated previously but transfected with PPRE-tk-Luc and pSV-β-galactosidase at the ratio of 2:1. 18 h after transfection, cells were fed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing either 5.5 or 25 mm glucose or 5.5 mm glucose plus 22.5 mm fructose together with 10 μm GW3335 and with or without 100 μm zopol. The cells were further incubated for an additional 12 h prior to luciferase reporter assays. Effects of AR siRNA Knocking Down on PPARα and ERK1/2 Expression and Phosphorylation—AML12 cells were prepared as stated above and were transfected with chemically synthesized AR siRNA with the sense sequence being 5′-CGGUGUCUCCAACUUCAATT-3′ as described previously (26Ramana K.V. Tammali R. Reddy A.B. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4371-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and control siRNA being 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ (GenePharma, China). The transfections were performed with the siPORT™ NeoFX™ transfection reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After siRNA transfection, the cells were initially incubated in 5.5 mm glucose media for 24 h and then replaced with 25 mm glucose media and the incubation was continued for another 24 h before harvesting for Western blot analyses. Animals—Mice carrying AR–/– mutations were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for five consecutive generations before use as described previously (27Ho H.T. Chung S.K. Law J.W. Ko B.C. Tam S.C.

Mice carrying a mutation in SDH (C57BL/LiA) and their controls (C57BL/10N) were derived from stock strains as described (29Lee F.K. Lee A.Y. Lin C.X. Chung S.S. Chung S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mice were maintained as described previously unless otherwise stated (28Yang J.Y. Tam W.Y. Tam S. Guo H. Wu X. Li G.

Animal care and experimental procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Xiamen University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the University of Hong Kong Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Research and Teaching. AR null allele and the SDH mutant alleles as well as their wild type counterparts were determined as described previously by Yang et al. (28Yang J.Y. Tam W.Y. Tam S. Guo H. Wu X. Li G. Chau J.F.

PPARα and ERK1/2 Expression and Phosphorylation in Diabetic C57BL/6 Mice—7-Week-old male mice were injected with a single dose of 200 mg/kg STZ for diabetes induction. Two days after successful diabetes induction (blood glucose > = 16 mm), one group of mice were treated with 50 mg/kg zopol daily, and the other groups received vehicle (saline) for 7 days. After the ARI treatment, liver tissues were dissected from these mice and analyzed by Western blots as described below to determine the in vivo PPARα and ERK1/2 expression and phosphorylation under hyperglycemia. Western Blot Analyses—AML12 cells were prepared and transfected as described above. Whole cell extracts were prepared by dissolution of cell pellets in ice-cold buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerin, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate and proteinase inhibitor mixture) until the cells were completely lysed and stored at –80 °C before use. Mice liver tissues were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C before homogenization. Liver tissues were homogenized with Polytron in the same buffer as above. The protein concentrations of the extracts were measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). 40 μg protein of each sample was loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blotted membranes were then incubated by either anti-ERK or anti-phospho-ERK (1:1000) or anti-PPARα (1:200) or anti-phospho-PPARα (1:1000) or anti-AR (1:200) in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. After several washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-goat IgG (1:2000) in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat milk. The detection was achieved using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). Blood Sample Analyses—Tail blood TG levels were assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions with a Roche Applied Science Accutrend® GCT system. Blood glucose was measured with a Bayer Glucometer Elite (model 3049C) as instructed. Plasma NEFA levels were determined by NEFA C kits (Wako Chemicals, Japan). Lipid Metabolism in STZ-induced Diabetic Mice—Diabetes induction was achieved by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ at a dosage of 200 mg/kg body weight immediately after grouping of mice at the age of 4 weeks. Mice to be treated with ARI were injected intraperitoneally once daily with zopol at 50 mg/kg body weight. ARI treatment was initiated at the age of 30-day and continued for 2 weeks. Blood and plasma samples were collected by heart puncture of Hypnorm-Dormicumanesthetized mice at the age of 44-day, i.e. 2 weeks post-ARI treatment. Statistical Analysis—All data were processed and analyzed by GraphPad software (Prism 4.0) and expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for pairwise comparisons and one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for multiple group analyses. Probability values less than 0.05 (*) were considered to be statistically significant; those less than 0.01 (**) more so. AR Up-regulation Caused Suppression in PPARα/δ Transcriptional Activity and AR Inhibition Attenuated the Suppression—To investigate the effects of hepatic activation of AR/polyol pathway on lipid metabolism, we first examined the effects of AR overexpression on the transcriptional activity of PPARs, nuclear receptors that serve as important lipid and glucose sensors and transcription factors and that control a large group of lipid metabolic enzymes, in particular the β-oxidation enzymes (24Duval C. Muller M. Kersten S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To this end, we PCR-amplified a mouse AR cDNA fragment and cloned it into the expression vector pFLAG-CMV2. The resultant vector pFLAG-mAR was used to transfect mouse hepatocyte AML12 cells whose endogenous AR expression is relatively low under normal circumstances. Our transfection studies indicated that transfection with pFLAG-mAR in AML12 cells greatly increased AR protein levels as determined by Western blots using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A) and confirmed with an anti-AR antibody (data not shown). The PPAR-mediated transcriptional activity was assayed with the luciferase reporter assays. Because liver cells contain all three known isotypes of PPARs, i.e. PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ, PPARγ antagonist GW3335 was used in the reporter assay to diminish the activity of PPARγ. The relative luciferase activities (normalized RLU) therefore represented all PPAR activities for those without the GW3335 treatment but PPARα/δ activities for those that were GW3335-treated. As shown in Fig. 1B, increased AR expression reduced PPARα/PPARδ transcriptional activities by about 74% (p < 0.001). Of note is that there was virtually no difference in PPAR activities between AML12 cells transfected with both pFLAG-CMV or pFLAG-mAR and with or without PPARγ antagonist GW3335. This suggests that the endogenous hepatic PPARγ activity is negligible, and AR overexpression did not significantly affect its activity. Meanwhile, treatment of cells with 100 μm zopol significantly attenuated, i.e. tended to normalize, the AR-induced suppression (p < 0.05) of PPARα/PPARδ activity, although not completely to the control levels. One of the possible reasons for the incomplete restoration of PPARα/PPARδ activity might be the incomplete inhibition of AR. Together these results indicated that increased activity of AR caused suppression in PPARα/PPARδ activity, whereas the inhibition of AR tended to normalize PPARα/δ activity. AR-induced Reductions in PPARα/δ Activities Were Associated with Down-regulated ACO and CPT1 mRNA Expression in AML12 Cells—ACO and CPT1 are two major enzymes critical for peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, respectively. These enzymes are known to be tightly regulated by hepatic PPARα in liver cells. We analyzed the mRNA expression of ACO and CPT1 in AR overexpressing AML12 cells by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and found that, as a consequence of AR overexpression, ACO mRNA expression was down-regulated by 34.3% (p < 0.01) and CPT1 by 23.3% (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 1, C and D), in comparison with the controls. AR-induced PPARα/δ Suppression Is Associated with Increased Phosphorylation of PPARα and ERK1/2—PPARα is a phosphoprotein, and phosphorylation is one of the most rapid and efficient mechanisms whereby its activity can be modulated (30Burns K.A. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 31Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPARα phosphorylation contributes to the AR-induced activity suppression, we performed Western blots with lysates of AML12 cells transfected with pFLAG-mAR and control plasmids using antibodies that recognize phosphoserine PPARα at either Ser-12 or Ser-21 and antibodies that detect phospho-ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 2A, AR overexpression greatly increased phosphorylated PPARα levels, at both Ser-12 (2.2-fold, p < 0.001) and Ser-21 (2.1-fold, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, A–C), two major phosphorylation sites located at the A/B domain (AF-1) of PPARα. Paralleling the increase in PPARα phosphorylation, there was a greatly increased phosphorylation of both ERK1 (14-fold, p < 0.001) and ERK2 (4.1-fold, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, A, D and E), suggesting that the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway contributes to the increased PPARα phosphorylation. Both Ser-21 and Ser-12 were previously demonstrated to be the ERK-mediated phosphorylation sites on PPARα in cardiac myocytes, and inhibition of their phosphorylation by PD98059 caused increased transcription of CPT1 (32Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα phosphorylation at both Ser-21 and Ser-12 has recently been demonstrated to decrease the transcriptional activity of PPARα, whereas dephosphorylation at both positions significantly increased the activity in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (33Tamasi V. Miller K.K. Ripp S.L. Vila E. Geoghegan T.E. Prough R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The AR-induced hepatic phosphorylation of PPARα at both Ser-21 and Ser-12 thus appeared to explain the reductions of PPARα transcriptional activity in AR overexpressing mouse liver cells. Inhibition of ERK, but Not PI3K, JNK, or p38 Significantly Attenuated the AR-induced Suppression of PPARα/δ Activity—To further confirm the contribution of ERK1/2 to the AR-induced suppression of PPARα/δ, similar transfection studies were performed in the presence of one of the four inhibitors for kinase signaling pathways: LY294002 (PI3K), SP600125 (JNK), or SB203580 (p38). As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with inhibitor for PI3K, JNK, and p38 did not significantly change the activity of PPARα/δ, excluding their involvement in PPARα phosphorylation. In contrast, treatment with ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 in pFLAG-mAR transfected cells significantly restored the activity of PPARα (to 78% of the control level), confirming significant contribution of ERK1/2 to the AR-induced PPARα phosphorylation and reduction in transcriptional activity. The restoration, however, was not complete, suggesting either incomplete ERK1/2 inhibition or the involvement of other protein kinases or regulatory mechanisms. Despite this, these data indicated that the great majority of the AR-induced PPARα phosphorylation and activity reduction was reversibly mediated by ERK1/2. High Glucose Time-dependently Stimulated Hepatic AR Expression and Increased Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PPARα—As described previously, the hepatic basal expression for AR is low. We therefore wanted to determine whether hepatic AR is significantly up-regulated under high glucose conditions. As shown in Fig. 4A, AR was indeed significantly up-regulated by 25 mm glucose in a time-dependent manner. The AR band became clearly detectable 3 h after the glucose exposure and reached a very high level at 48 h. In association with this, there appeared to have been a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of PPARα at both Ser-21 and Ser-12, although there simultaneously appeared to have been a small decrease in total PPARα protein level. Meanwhile, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was also significantly increased as the exposure time increased, with no apparent change in total ERK1/2 protein level (Fi"

Typhimurium) DT104. SGI1 contains a complex integron, which confers various multidrug resistance phenotypes due to its genetic plasticity. Previous studies have shown that SGI1 integrates site-specifically into the S. enterica, Escherichia coli, or Proteus mirabilis chromosome at the 3' end of thdF gene (attB site).Here, we report the transfer of SGI1 to a Delta thdF mutant of S. Typhimurium LT2. In the absence of thdF, the frequency of transconjugant formation was reduced by around thirty times of magnitude. Through DNA sequencing SGI1 was shown to integrate specifically into a secondary attachment site (2(nd)attB), which is located in the intergenic region between the chromosomal sodB and purR genes. At this 2(nd)attB site, we found that a significant fraction of SGI1 transconjugants (43% of wild type and 100% of Delta thdF mutant) contained tandem SGI1 arrays. Moreover, in wild type S. Typhimurium LT2 transconjugants, SGI1 integrated into both attachment sites, i.e., thdF and sodB-purR. The formation of SGI1 tandem arrays occurred in both specific attB sites. There was heterogeneity in the size of the SGI1 tandem arrays detected in single transconjugant colonies. Some arrays consisted as far as six SGI1s arranged in tandem. These tandem arrays were shown to persist during serial passages with or without antibiotic selection pressure.The ability of integration into two distinct chromosomal sites and tandem array formation of SGI1 could contribute to its spread and persistence. The existence of a secondary attachment site in the Salmonella chromosome has potential implications for the mobility of SGI1, which may integrate in other attachment sites of other bacterial pathogens that do not possess the 1(st) or 2(nd) specific SGI1 attB sites of Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W2067845186,"Transcellular calcium transport in the kidney, pancreas, small intestine, and placenta is partly mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The highly selective TRPV6 calcium channel protein is most likely important for the calcium transfer in different specialized epithelial cells. In the human placenta the protein is expressed in trophoblast tissue, where it is implicated in the transepithelial calcium transfer from mother to the fetus. We enriched the TRPV6 channel protein endogenously expressed in placenta together with annexin A2 and cyclophilin B (CypB), which is a member of the huge immunophilin family. In the human placenta TRPV6 and CypB are mainly located intracellularly in the syncytiotrophoblast layer, but a small amount of the mature glycosylated TRPV6 channel protein and CypB is also expressed in microvilli apical membranes, the fetomaternal barrier. To understand the role of CypB on the TRPV6 channel function, we evaluated the effect of CypB co-expression on TRPV6-mediated calcium uptake into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TRPV6. A significant increase of TRPV6-mediated calcium uptake was observed after CypB/TRPV6 co-expression. This stimulatory effect of CypB was reversed by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of CypB. Cyclosporin A had no significant effect on TRPV6 and CypB protein expression levels in the oocytes. In summary, our results establish CypB as a new TRPV6 accessory protein with potential involvement in TRPV6 channel activation through its peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity.

In the human placenta the epithelial layer of the syncytiotrophoblast separates the fetal blood vessels from the maternal blood. Syncytiotrophoblasts build a multinuclear barrier layer between mother and child, which carries out the maternal metabolite and calcium transfer. This transepithelial calcium transport is a crucial process for the fetal development.

Transcripts of members of the canonical TRPC family such as TRPC3, -C4, and -C6 have been amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from term placenta. The presence of TRPC channel activity was demonstrated by blocking store-operated calcium entry with SKF96365 or gadolinium (6Clarson L.H. Roberts V.H. Hamark B. Elliott A.C. Powell T. J. Physiol.

Bernatchez R. Simoneau L. Masse A. Lafond J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Apparently TRPV5 and/or TRPV6 are involved in the calcium transport mechanism in these cells. In support of such a role of TRPV6 is a recent report that demonstrates that targeting of the TRPV6 gene in mice results in viable mice with impaired fertility (12Bianco S.D. Peng J.B. Takanaga H. Suzuki Y. Crescenzi A. Kos C.H. Zhuang L. Freeman M.R. Gouveia C.H. Wu J. Luo H. Mauro T. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which could be caused by impaired Ca2+ uptake through the placental trophoblast layer. Functional TRP channels require oligomerization of apparently four pore-forming units, which co-assemble with additional membrane-associated proteins. For example, the Drosophila TRP and TRPL channel proteins co-assemble in large macromolecular signalplexes in the membrane by interaction with scaffolding proteins, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, calmodulin, and rhodopsin (13Hardie R.C.

This complex is also connected to the immunophilin FKBP59 via the scaffolding protein INAD (inactivation no-after potential D) (19Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38762-38773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), which bind the immunosuppressive drug FK506, are not only restricted to the insect signal transduction machinery but also interact with mammalian membrane channel proteins. FKBP12 e.g. is associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in non-excitable cells and is thereby involved in the regulation of the Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (20Brillantes A.B.

Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34521-34529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that the immunophilin FKBP12 associates specifically with TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7, whereas TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 interact with FKBP52. The latter immunophilin (FKBP52) was also co-immunoprecipitated from TRPV5-overexpressing cells and showed inhibitory effects on TRPV5 channel activity (25Gkika D. Topala C.N. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F1253-F1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Like FKBPs cyclophilins (Cyp) are a subfamily of the mammalian immunophilins. Cyclophilins (Cyp) got their name because of their ability to bind to the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) (26Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 27Rahfeld J.U. Schierhorn A. Mann K. Fischer G.

Immunophilins are a heterogeneous protein family, and the FKBP and Cyp subgroups show no apparent amino acid sequence homology except that they exhibit some sequence specificity for X-proline residues in target-binding proteins. Immunophilins are involved in many intracellular processes, and as peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases, they accelerate the folding of some proline-containing proteins in vivo and in vitro by catalyzing steps in their initial folding and structural rearrangement. Nuclear functions or co-regulation of cellular receptors and ion channels have been reported and reviewed by Galat (28Galat A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1315-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cyclophilins are distributed in different compartments of the cell. Although cyclophilin A resides within the cytosol, cyclophilin B and Cm and the Drosophila homologue NINAA (neither inactivation nor after potential A) comprise cleavable endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal sequences within their primary structures and accumulate in the ER by an ER retention signal (29Price E.R.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas cyclophilin D is mainly found in mitochondria. CypB is not restricted to the ER; it is also localized within the nucleus, where it induces transcription (31Rycyzyn M.A. Clevenger C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and it is located in the plasma membrane, where it might act as chaperone for correct insertion of plasma membrane proteins (32Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the role of CypB is not only limited to intracellular functions; the protein is also secreted into human biological fluids such as blood and milk and serves as messenger for intercellular communication. Allain et al. (33Allain F. Vanpouille C. Carpentier M. Slomianny M.C. Durieux S. Spik G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2714-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CypB induces chemotaxis and adhesion to the extracellular matrix of memory CD4+ T cells (33Allain F. Vanpouille C.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 323-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whether CypB co-assembles with ion channels and modifies channel function, however, has not been demonstrated so far. Our intention was to identify TRPV6 protein expression in human placenta and to identify proteins that might be associated with endogenous TRPV6 and thereby participate in Ca2+ transfer from the maternal to fetal circulation. Most TRP-interacting proteins have been identified so far by yeast two-hybrid screens. We pursued a different approach, the affinity purification of TRPV6 and, in addition, of TRPV6-interacting proteins out of native tissue. We made use of TRPV6 being a Ca2+-calmodulin-binding protein, and we employed antibodies for TRPV6 to identify TRPV6 proteins in primary human placenta tissue and to enrich these proteins from this tissue. We show that the TRPV6 protein is expressed in human placenta, and we demonstrate for the first time that the immunophilin CypB co-purifies together with the TRPV6 proteins from human placenta microsomal membranes. Both proteins are co-localized in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta, and the TRPV6-evoked calcium influx in Xenopus laevis oocytes is markedly increased with CypB co-expression. cDNA Constructs/Plasmids—The human TRPV6b/pcDNA3 construct was described by Wissenbach et al.

For affinity column preparation, antibodies were enriched from hybridoma cell culture supernatants with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). 5–10 mg of affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies were covalently coupled to N-hydoxysuccinimide-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the user manual. The following antibodies/Sepharose were used: polyclonal rabbit anti-CypB antibody (Affinity BioReagents (ABR, PA1-027), polyclonal goat anti-CypB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-15)), horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Dianova), horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (GE Healthcare), calmodulin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies for TRPV5 were from Alomone Labs and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Preparation of Placental Microsomal Membranes and Affinity Chromatography—Placenta obtained from normal term pregnancies were collected immediately after caesarean section or normal delivery from the local hospital and transported on ice to the laboratory. Each step was performed at 4 °C. Microsomal membrane fractions from human placenta were made by homogenization of the fresh or alternatively frozen (-80 °C) tissue in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with an Ultraturrax and glass-Teflon potter. After dilution with sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) the homogenate was centrifuged at 5.000 × g (RC-5B, Sorvall) for 15 min. The pellet was rehomogenized again with a glass-Teflon potter, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (l-80 Ultracentrifuge, Beckmann) for 45 min. Microsomes were resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl-buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at -80 °C. For membrane protein solubilization, 500 mg of microsomal proteins were homogenized by 20 strokes with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in a final volume of 200 ml of solubilization buffer (0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 1 h of shaking, the solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was complemented with Triton buffer and Ca2+ (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2) to a final volume of 1500 ml and immediately transferred over a 20-ml calmodulin-Sepharose column. The solution circuited overnight with a flow rate of 3–4 ml/min. After washing with Triton/Ca2+ buffer, the calmodulin column was eluted with Triton buffer supplemented with EGTA (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA). This eluate was transferred to a monoclonal TRPV6-antibody (20C6)-column preequilibrated with Triton/EGTA buffer and circuited for 4 h (flow rate 1 ml/min). For negative control purification, the calmodulin column eluate was transferred over a column with covalently bound mouse IgG to N-hydoxysuccinimide (NHS)-coupled Sepharose or ethanolamine-blocked NHS-Sepharose. Proteins were eluted from antibody and negative control columns with the antigenic peptide (1.3 mg/ml) in Triton X-100 buffer plus EGTA. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration with Vivaspin molecular weight cutoff 10,000 (Vivascience) and stored at -20 °C. The isolated proteins were denatured with loading buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, separated in 4–12% Bis-Tris gel with a MOPS buffer system (NUPAGE®-Novex, Invitrogen) or 4–12% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, and visualized with colloidal Coomassie (34% (v/v) methanol, 2% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 17% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 0.066% (w/v) Coomassie G250) or silver-stained (37Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Protein bands were cut and prepared for nano-liquid chromatography-MS and MALDI mass spectrometry. MALDI and ESI Mass Spectrometry and Data Base Research— The excised bands were alternately washed twice with 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate (solution A) and 50% (v/v) ammonium hydrogen carbonate (50 mm), 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (solution B). Reducing of disulfide bridges was performed by incubation for 30 min at 56 °C in 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, 10 mm dithiothreitol followed by carbamidomethylation for 30 min at room temperature in darkness in 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate with 5 mm iodacetamide. Gel pieces were washed twice alternating with solution A and B and then dried. The in-gel digestion was proceeded by incubating the pieces with 4.5 μl of a 25 μg/ml solution of porcine trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. The resulting peptides were extracted by shaking the gel in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Extracted peptides were concentrated with PerfectPure C-18 tips (Eppendorf) and applied on a steel target (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) using α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics) as the matrix. MALDI-TOF measurements (Ultraflex MALDI-TOF-TOF, Bruker Daltonics) were performed by accumulating 1000 spectra per sample and processing with Flex-Analysis 2.2 (Bruker Daltonics). Peptide mass fingerprints were analyzed with Biotools 2.2 (Bruker Daltonics). MASCOT searches used settings of carbamidomethylation as the fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as the variable modification. Peptide mass tolerance was set to 0.15 Da. The NCBI data base was used. Data base searches were conducted using the Mascot™ search algorithm (free World Wide Web version, MatrixScience) against a human subset of the NCBI non-redundant data base (Jan 17, 2006, 3,203,752 sequences, thereof 140,178 human sequences). For nano-scale liquid chromatography coupled online to mass spectrometry, two different instrument setups were used. The first is described in detail in Schindler et al. (38Schindler J. Lewandrowski U. Sickmann A. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 390-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using nano-LC-MS/MS in combination with a Qtrap 4000 instrument. The second setup consisted of a Famos, Switchos, Ultimate high performance liquid chromatography combination coupled to a LCQ XP+ ion trap (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In contrast to Schindler et al. (38Schindler J. Lewandrowski U. Sickmann A. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 390-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a 300-μm inner diameter × 1-mm length precolumn (PepMap C18, 3-μm particle size, Dionex, Idstein, Germany) was used for trapping of peptides at a flow rate of 30 μl/min of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Separation was achieved on a 75-μm inner diameter × 150-mm length main column (Pep-Map C18, 3 μm particle size, Dionex, Idstein, Germany) by a binary gradient at 270 nl/min flow rate with a slope of 1% B/min until 50% B followed by a washing step at 95% B for 5 min and subsequent re-equilibration. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid, 84% acetonitrile. Mass spectrometric analysis consisted of a triple play scan cycle with a survey scan from 450 to 2000 m/z followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans from the most intense peaks of the survey spectrum. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s after 2 occurrences. ESI needle voltage was between 1.6 and 1.8 kV. Data base searches were conducted using the Mascot™ search algorithm (Version 2.1, MatrixScience) against a human subset of the NCBI non-redundant data base (May 31, 2006, 3,655,553 sequences, thereof 147,220 human sequences). Carbamidomethylation was chosen as fixed, and oxidation of methionine was used as the variable modification. Furthermore, trypsin with one allowed missed cleavage site was used as the protease setting, and mass tolerances were set to 1.5 Da for LCQ data and 0.4 Da for Qtrap data for MS as well as MS/MS information. Co-immunoprecipitation—Membrane proteins were isolated after homogenization of 10 mg of human placental microsomes 20 times with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 4 ml of solubilization buffer (0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 1 h of shaking, the solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g (L-80 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments) for 45 min. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose was coupled with 2 μg of 429 antibody or 5 μg of CypB antibody (Affinity BioReagents and Santa Cruz) and incubated with the solubilized proteins overnight at 4 °C. Beads with captured immunocomplexes were pelleted, washed 3 times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer, and eluted with 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer for 20 min at 61 °C, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. 75 μg of control protein lysates or 25 μl of immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded per lane and after electrophoresis transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, GE Healthcare) by tank-blotting in Tris-glycine buffer (1 h, 350 mA). The membrane was stained with 0.5% (w/v) Ponceau red in 1% acetic acid and blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 1 h. The immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 times in TBS, incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times, and finally, developed by chemiluminescence with the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Enrichment of Apical and Basolateral Syncytiotrophoblast Membranes of Human Placenta, and Glycosidase Treatment of the Apical Membrane Fraction—Placenta obtained from caesarean section at a local women's hospital was carried to the laboratory on ice. Maternal decidua was removed from the placenta, and the villous tissue was scraped from blood vessels and other connective tissue and ground with an Ultraturrax in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) 5 times with 2-s intervals. The following procedure was adapted from Jimenez et al. (39Jimenez V. Henriquez M. Llanos P. Riquelme G. Placenta. 2004; 25: 422-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were characterized by enzyme assays and Western blot analysis with marker proteins to evaluate the enrichment of apical plasma membranes and to identify contamination with ER and mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an epithelial apical membrane marker, was measured according to Tietz (40Tietz N.W. Fundamental of Clinical Chemistry. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1976: 52-53Google Scholar). The activity of the inner mitochondrial membrane marker succinate dehydrogenase was assayed as described by Munujos et al. (41Munujos P. Coll-Canti J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Gella F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Western blot experiments were performed with antibodies against the basolateral membrane marker protein adenylate cyclase (R-32, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the human ER marker protein calnexin (H-70, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For glycosidase digestion, 400 μg of protein from the apical membrane sample LA was treated with peptide N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H glycosidase (New England Biolabs). The digestion was carried out according to the protocol provided from the manufacturer. The sample was stored in 2× SDS loading buffer at -20 °C before SDS-gel electrophoresis. Immunohistochemistry—The method was accomplished as described by Bernucci et al. (11Bernucci L. Henriquez M. Diaz P. Riquelme G. Placenta. 2006; 27: 1082-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human placenta was obtained immediately after caesarean section and carried on ice to the laboratory. Small pieces (about 1 cm3) were cut, and the blood was washed away with ice-cold 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. The tissue was quickly frozen in Cryogel with liquid nitrogen. 10-μm cryosections were cut and collected on superfrost slides. After air drying, the sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were then rinsed 3 times in TBS buffer for 10 min, and the sections were blocked overnight in TCT buffer (0.7% carrageenan, 0.5% Triton X-100 buffered in TBS). Carrageenan is a sulfated linear polysaccharide that is usually used as a blocker in immunohistochemistry (42Trius A. Sebranek J.G. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1996; 36: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After blocking, excess TCT buffer was removed with a soft tissue. All primary antibodies for the staining were diluted with deionized water at the desired concentrations: anti-TRPV6 antibodies (429, 80 μg/ml; 24C3, 160 μg/ml; 26B3, 50 μg/ml), anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase polyclonal antibody (Sero Tech AHP 537Ht, ready to use), anti-cytokeratin 7 monoclonal antibody (Bioprime CK507, ready to use), and anti-CypB polyclonal antibody (ABR PA1–027, 1:100). The primary staining was carried out at room temperature for 2 h, and the slides were rinsed in TBS 3 times each for 10 min. The sections were then stained for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 or Alexa488 diluted 1:200 in deionized water. After rinsing in TBS, coverslips were embedded, and the slides were mounted on a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena) and viewed with LSM Image Browser (Zeiss). Oocytes Preparation, cRNA Synthesis, and Injection—X. laevis females were purchased from Horst Kähler, Hamburg, Germany.

It was hypothesized that these defects are the consequence of impaired integration of amino acid, glucose, and energy metabolism in beta cells. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methodology to study intermediary metabolism of SUR1 knock-out (SUR1-/-) and control mouse islets with d-[U-13C]glucose as substrate and related the results to insulin secretion. The levels and isotope labeling of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) served as indicators of intermediary metabolism. We found that the GABA shunt of SUR1-/- islets is blocked by about 75% and showed that this defect is due to decreased glutamate decarboxylase synthesis, probably caused by elevated free intracellular calcium. Glutaminolysis stimulated by the leucine analogue d,l-β-2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid was, however, enhanced in SUR1-/- and glyburide-treated SUR1+/+ islets. Glucose oxidation and pyruvate cycling was increased in SUR1-/- islets at low glucose but was the same as in controls at high glucose. Malic enzyme isoforms 1, 2, and 3, involved in pyruvate cycling, were all expressed in islets. High glucose lowered aspartate and stimulated glutamine synthesis similarly in controls and SUR1-/- islets. The data suggest that the interruption of the GABA shunt and the lack of glucose regulation of pyruvate cycling may cause the glucose insensitivity of the SUR1-/- islets but that enhanced basal pyruvate cycling, lowered GABA shunt flux, and enhanced glutaminolytic capacity may sensitize the beta cells to amino acid stimulation.

The pancreatic beta cells function as the predominant sensors and regulators of glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid levels of the mammalian organism, including man, by adjusting the minute to minute rate of insulin secretion such that these fuels are maintained at physiologically optimal blood concentrations under all nutritional conditions including feeding and fasting. This process of fuel-sensing and stimulation of insulin secretion requires that the various stimuli are transported into the beta cells and are metabolized to generate coupling factors that trigger and sustain the secretion of the hormone from large stores of insulin granules (1Matschinsky F.M.

SUR1-/- islets were chosen for comparison to control islets because they have profound changes of glucose and amino acid responsiveness, showing markedly reduced glucose but strikingly enhanced amino acid-induced insulin release (5Doliba N.M.

We used the conversion or incorporation of 13C carbon into CO2 and various amino acids, respectively, as readout for the integration of metabolic pathways. This approach allowed us to examine for the first time in isolated mouse islets and in one comprehensive study the concentration dependences of glucose oxidation and glutaminolysis, the operation of the so called “pyruvate cycling,” the nature of the glucose induced aspartate decrease (herein referred to as “aspartate switch”), the regulatory role of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in the operation of the beta cell GABA shunt, and glucose stimulation of glutamine synthesis. These studies provide new insights into the complex role of the metabolic network in fuel-stimulated authentic pancreatic islet cells as contrasted with studies using tumor-derived beta cell lines (8Simpson N.E.

Separate experiments were performed in control islets cultured with 0.3 μm glyburide for 3 days and then using the same concentration of glyburide throughout the experiment to mimic SUR1-/- conditions. The experimental procedures were described previously (12Li C. Allen A. Kwagh J. Doliba N.M. Qin W. Najafi H. Collins H.W. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol.

The purpose of the preincubation was to reduce the possibility of influences of the complex culture medium. The islets were then incubated 120 min with a 4.0 mm physiological mixture of amino acids plus 300 μm NH4Cl as control or with a further addition of 5 or 25 mm [U-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA). In the high glucose condition the medium was further modified by adding 1 mm MSO or 1.55 mm VGB in accordance with the pretreatment protocol. The physiological mixture of the 4.0 mm 19 amino acids had the following composition: 0.44 mm alanine, 0.19 mm arginine, 0.04 mm aspartate, 0.09 mm citrulline, 0.12 mm glutamate, 0.5 mm glutamine, 0.30 mm glycine, 0.08 mm histidine, 0.09 mm isoleucine, 0.16 mm leucine, 0.37 mm lysine, 0.05 mm methionine, 0.07 mm ornithine, 0.08 mm phenylalanine, 0.35 mm proline, 0.57 mm serine, 0.27 mm threonine, 0.07 mm tryptophan, and 0.20 mm valine.After 120 min of incubation, the medium was sampled and stored to be assayed for insulin and glucagon by radioimmunoassay. Incubations were performed in tightly sealed tubes that had been gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. After 120 min of incubation, the air was sampled by suction using a well sealed syringe, and 13CO2 enrichment was then measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The islets were then quickly washed twice with ice-cold glucose-free Hanks' buffer, and the cellular amino acids were extracted with ice-cold 6% perchloric acid.

Isotopic enrichment in alanine was monitored using ions at m/z 232, 233, 234, and 235 for M+1, M+2, and M+3 (containing 1–3 13C-enriched atoms), respectively, and 13C enrichment in GABA was monitored using ions at m/z 274, 275, 276, 277, and 278 for M+1, M+2, M+3, and M+ 4 (containing 1–4 13C-enriched atoms), respectively.The production of 13CO2 was monitored as follows. After 120 min of incubation, air samples were taken from the sealed incubation tube. The latter was transferred into autosampler tubes for analysis. Isotopic enrichment in 13CO2 was determined by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermoquest Finnigan Delta Plus) using the m/z 44/45 ratio (14Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Luhovyy B. Horyn O.

The production of 13C-labeled mass isotopomer was calculated by the product of (molar percent enrichment)/100 times concentration (nmol/1000 islets) and is expressed as nmol of 13C metabolite/1000 islets. All the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Student's t tests were done when two groups were compared. Analysis of variances (one way analysis of variance) was used followed by the Bonferroni test when multiple groups were compared. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.Western Blot Analysis—Monoclonal rabbit anti-mouse GS, rabbit, anti-GAD (against GAD 65 and 67), and mouse anti-GAPDH antibodies (all from Sigma) were used as the primary antibodies, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz) were used as the secondary antibodies. A total of 20 μg of islets protein was used for Western blotting. Islets protein was extracted from cultured SUR1-/-, control islets, or control islets incubated with 0.3 μm glyburide for 24 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin.mRNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from islets using the Trizol (Invitrogen) method, including SUR1-/- islets, control islets, SUR1-/- islets incubated with 20 μm nimodipine for 4 and 24 h, and control islets incubated with 0.3 μm glyburide for 24 h. For the reverse transcription reaction, 40 μl of PCR reagent efficiently converts 1.0 μg of total RNA to cDNA (Invitrogen).

PCR products were 128 bp for GAD and 132 bp for GAPDH. Quantitative real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems SYBR Green Master Mix kit) was carried out in low reaction volumes in 384-well plates using 7.5 μl of 2× Syber green master mix, 0.2 μl of primer (10 μm), 1 μl of cDNA, and water added to bring the final volume of 15 μl. Thermal cycle conditions were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Experiments were performed with the 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Islets mRNA levels were calculated using serial-diluted GAPDH as the standard and internal controls. mRNA expression of malic enzyme isoforms 1, 2, and 3 in islets, brain, and liver was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR.

This loss, amounting to as much as 10–15 mm intracellular amino acids, was not preventable by 5 or 25 mm glucose and was explained by a net efflux of amino acids due to the large downhill concentration gradient associated with nonphysiological incubation conditions. The present studies of intermediary metabolism of SUR1-/- islets using [U-13C]glucose were, therefore, performed in the presence of 3.5 mm concentrations of a physiological mixture of 18 amino acids plus 0.5 mm glutamine to approach physiological conditions. The medium also contained 300 μm ammonia to facilitate glutamine synthesis. Contents of the nine predominant amino acids that were reliably quantified in pancreatic islets of SUR1-/- and control mice after incubation for 2 h with 4 mm amino acids present but with varying glucose and drug additions as dictated by the aims of the study are shown in Table 1. The total amino acid contents under the various experimental conditions were not different statistically, ranging from 30 to 42 nmol/1000 islets. This extrapolates to an ∼15–21 mm pool size. Three amino acids (glycine, isoleucine, and leucine) were virtually unchanged by the SUR1 knock-out or the incubation conditions. The other six were, however, markedly influenced by the experimental manipulations. Three changes are particularly striking; 1) the substantial drop of aspartate levels to as low as ⅓ that of base line when glucose concentrations are increased, both in control and SUR1-/- islets, 2) the striking depletion of the GABA content by about 75% in SUR1-/- islets as compared with the controls whatever the conditions, and 3) the relatively high levels of alanine, glutamate, glutamine, and serine in SUR1-/- as compared with the controls in many conditions studied here such that the combined pool of these 4 amino acids was on average 52% higher in SUR1-/- islets than controls (i.e. 19 ± 1.7 versus 13 ± 1.1 nmol/1000 islets in glucose-free conditions). It is noteworthy that GABA was undetectable by HPLC in the incubation medium, which suggested the low intracellular GABA was not due to increased release. The careful comparison of the results of GABA and glutamate measurements in SUR1-/- islets with those in controls shows a classical “crossover” at the GABA decarboxylase step as illustrated in Fig. 1. The ratios of GABA/glutamate of SUR1-/- islets are at least 10-fold lower than those in the controls. The results strongly suggested that flux through the GABA shunt is greatly reduced in pancreatic islets of SUR1-/- mice. It is worth noting here that MSO, an inhibitor of glutamine synthesis, had relatively little impact on the amino acid profile of isolated islets incubated in the presence of glucose (realizing the fact, however, that glutamine was not measurable because MSO has the same chromatographic retention time as glutamine) and that VGB, an inhibitor of GABA transaminase, caused GABA to pile up as expected in the control and also in the SUR1-/- islets. Because of the marked inhibition of the GABA shunt, the possibility that glutamine and glutamate catabolism might also be impaired was tested by studying glutaminolysis. It was found that BCH-stimulated glutaminolysis was greatly enhanced in SUR1-/- islets, a phenomenon that was reproduced in model studies with glyburide-treated control islets (Fig. 2). The observation showed that the capacity of glutamine and glutamate oxidation is not reduced by the near complete block of the GABA shunt. In fact, both SUR1-/- and glyburide-treated control islets had increased BCH-stimulated glutaminolysis by 2- and 3-fold, respectively. The comprehensive analysis of the amino acid profiles of pancreatic islets as presented above is critical for the interpretation of tracer studies that use [U-13C]glucose because amino acids represent quantitatively a major sink for [13C]carbon.TABLE 1Concentrations of intracellular amino acid (nmol/1000 islets) G, glucose.

To meet the sensitivity requirements of the GC-MS analysis of these islet constituents, we needed 1000 islets for each condition incubated in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 2 h to achieve significant 13C labeling of amino acids. The results of limited ATP and ADP level determinations and of insulin and glucagon release rates demonstrated that the tissues were functionally well maintained (Figs. 3 and 4). The ATP levels (of 6–9 pmol/islet) and the ATP/ADP ratios (of 3–5) were within the expected ranges. To obtain more detailed quantitative information on the energy potential of islet cells during fuel stimulation would have required comprehensive measurements including ATP, ADP, AMP, inorganic phosphorus, phosphocreatine, and creatine to extrapolate to the effective free levels of these molecules, which was not possible in the present study. The insulin release data are consistent with published results which demonstrate functional preservation of islets under the present experimental conditions (for further details on the hormone release data, see below). The [13C]carbon dioxide enrichment data (APE) show that SUR1-/- islets incubated at basal 5 mm glucose oxidize glucose twice as effectively as controls (Fig. 3A) and that the relative enhancement of glucose oxidation by increasing the substrate level to 25 mm is far less pronounced than in controls (i.e. the rate barely doubles in SUR1-/- islets but increases 4-fold in con"

Whereas Gs/cAMP-dependent cellular responses upon TSHR stimulation are well established, other signaling pathways are less characterized. We evaluated TSH-elicited cellular responses in human follicular thyroid carcinoma cells stably expressing the TSHR and in primary, nonneoplastic human thyrocytes. In these cellular models, stimulation with TSH caused activation of p44/42 MAPK and subsequent induction of c-Fos. MAPK stimulation occurred independently of Gs, Gi/o, and Gq/11 signaling. Dominant negative constructs of G12 or G13 as well as shRNA-mediated suppression of Gα12 or Gα13 revealed that MAPK activation was dependent on G13 but not on G12 signaling. Furthermore, G13-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor was necessary for MAPK activation in follicular carcinoma cells, whereas EGFR was not involved in MAPK activation in nonneoplastic primary thyrocytes. The use of bacterial inhibitors of monomeric GTPases revealed that MAPK activation proceeded independently of Rho proteins but was clostridial toxin B-sensitive, suggesting involvement of Cdc42 or Rac.

Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The human TSHR exhibits a remarkable promiscuity in G protein coupling, being capable of activating members of all four G protein subfamilies (5Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, a multitude of potential signaling pathways is initiated following TSH stimulation. The past decades have seen substantial progress in the characterization of TSHR-promoted G protein activation and TSH-induced generation of second messengers. However, the molecular effectors connecting upstream signaling events (i.e. G protein activation) and the biological effects of TSH have yet to be further delineated. The best known signaling cascade initiated by the TSHR proceeds via activation of Gs proteins and a subsequent increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations (6Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5872-5881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In human and dog thyrocytes, the TSHR also couples to Gi/o (5Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Endocrinol. 1997; 127: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), partially opposing TSH-mediated cAMP formation. However, no TSHR-regulated physiological processes that exclusively depend on the activation of Gi/o proteins have been identified in thyroid cells so far. In contrast, several thyroid functions have been attributed to the activation of the Gs/cAMP cascade. A TSHR-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations is involved in such fundamental thyroid functions as iodide uptake and synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone (3Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, TSH-dependent activation of the Gs/cAMP pathway represents an important stimulus that induces growth of thyrocytes (9Dremier S. Pohl V. Poteet-Smith C. Roger P.P. Corbin J.

However, this cAMP-dependent, proliferative effect of TSH does not induce dedifferentiation and, thus, does not favor malignant transformation of thyrocytes. Consequently, activating mutations of the TSHR or the Gαs protein leading to constitutively elevated cAMP levels are frequently found in benign thyroid adenomas but rarely in malignant thyroid tumors (13Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Hermans J. Rocmans P. Van Vliet G. Costagliola S. Rodien P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Metab. 1997; 82: 493-496PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the role of TSH as a mitogenic signal in thyroid carcinoma is still not well defined. On the one hand, TSH has been considered as a potential proliferative stimulus of thyroid carcinomas in vivo (15Williams E.D. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); on the other hand, results obtained in vitro suggest that cAMP elevations may inhibit growth of thyroid tumor cells (16Derwahl M. Kuemmel M. Goretzki P. Schatz H. Broecker M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Ohta K. Pang X.P. Berg L. Hershman J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 2633-2638PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential mitogenic action of TSH in thyroid carcinoma cells may be cAMP-independent. A known TSH-dependent but cAMP-independent signaling pathway arises from coupling of the TSHR to Gq/11 proteins, activation of phospholipase C, and formation of inositol phosphates (5Laugwitz K.L.

Phospholipase C-dependent pathways have recently been shown to be required for iodine organification and thyroid hormone secretion and for the adaptive growth of the thyroid gland (20Kero J. Ahmed K.

Finally, G12/13 coupling of the TSHR has been shown in primary human thyrocytes and was suggested to be related to growth or differentiation of thyrocytes (5Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, no TSHR-dependent molecular effector of G12/13 proteins in thyrocytes has been established to date. TSHR signaling persistently regulates differentiation and proliferation of thyroid cells. Therefore, special attention has been paid to TSHR-mediated regulation of gene expression. With regard to Gs/cAMP-dependent downstream targets, a crucial role of the cAMP-response element-binding protein has been emphasized. In fact, expressing a dominant negative cAMP-response element-binding protein variant in murine thyroid glands resulted in a poorly developed thyroid gland and severe hypothyroidism (21Nguyen L.Q. Kopp P. Martinson F. Stanfield K. Roth S.I. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1448-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gi/o-dependent signaling was discussed in conjunction with TSH-induced activation of c-Jun-terminal kinase, which could be blocked by pretreatment of thyroid cells with pertussis toxin (22Hara T. Namba H. Takamura N. Yang T.T. Nagayama Y. Fukata S. Kuma K. Ishikawa N. Ito K. Yamashita S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, the potential engagement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), especially p44/42 MAPK, in TSH signaling has been evaluated in several studies. However, the results obtained are inconsistent, since three of six reports demonstrated TSH-mediated p44/42 MAPK activation (23Saunier B. Tournier C. Jacquemin C. Pierre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3693-3697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Iacovelli L. Capobianco L. Salvatore L. Sallese M. D'Ancona G.M. De Blasi A. Mol.

Prigent S. Kupperman E. Rioux L. Park S.H. Feramisco J.R. White M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8398-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this inconsistency, which might be due to different cellular model systems used in these studies, the importance of this pathway for TSH-dependent regulation of gene expression still remains under debate. In this study, we investigated the impact of TSH on MAPK activation in two cellular models of human thyroid cells: a follicular carcinoma cell line stably expressing TSHR and nonneoplastic primary human thyrocytes. In both cell systems, TSH promoted a substantial TSHR-dependent activation of the MAPK pathway, which proceeded independently of Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, or G12 proteins. Instead, TSH-promoted MAPK signaling required the activation of G13. In follicular carcinoma cells, EGF receptor (EGFR) transactivation by TSH was additionally involved in this signaling pathway. In primary thyrocytes, however, MAPK activation occurred independently of EGFR. In summary, we analyzed TSH-promoted signaling pathways that lead to the activation of p44/42 MAPK in two human cellular models and describe the first G13-dependent cellular response elicited by TSH. Materials—Cell culture materials were purchased from PAA (Coelbe, Germany). TSH used was a bovine TSH preparation from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Cell-permeable myristoylated PKI 14-22 amide (myr-PKI), AG1478, AG1295, and AG1024 were from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-EGFRY845 antibody was from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-EGFR, anti-p44/42 MAPK, and anti-c-Fos antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Neutralizing anti-HB-EGF antibodies were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The TSH receptor-specific mouse antibody (clone 2C11) was from Serotec (Oxford, UK). The enhanced chemiluminescence system and Hybond C Extra membranes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Rotiblock and milk powder were from Carl Roth AG (Karlsruhe, Germany). Transfection was performed using Metafectene (Biontex, Martinsried, Germany) unless indicated otherwise. pcDNA3.1 plasmids were from Invitrogen. Expression plasmids harboring the cDNA sequence of the wild-type (WT) TSHR and TSHR-Y601H were constructed as described previously (29Biebermann H. Schoneberg T. Schulz A. Krause G. Gruters A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Gruters A. Schoneberg T. Biebermann H. Krude H. Krohn H.P. Dralle H. Gudermann T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1431-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Cell Lines—FTC-133 cells were a generous gift of Dr. P. E. Goretzki (Neuss, Germany). Primary human thyroid (PHT) cells were established from a thyroidectomized patient with Grave disease. Thyroid tissue samples were dissected with scissors and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Applied Science) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with l-glutamine (IMDM) for 2 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were passed through a sieve and washed in IMDM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Isolated cells were seeded in 25-cm2 Falcon primary tissue culture flasks (BD Primaria) and passaged twice before being used for experiments. Both FTC-133 cells and PHT cells were grown in IMDM, additionally containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.36 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml liver cell growth factor (Gly-His-Lys), and 10 ng/ml somatostatin (5 H medium). To establish FTC-133 lines stably expressing WT TSHR or TSHR Y601H, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish and co-transfected with 2 μg of the respective plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. One day after transfection, the media were changed, and 3 days later selection with G418 (750 μg/ml) was initiated. Clones resistant to the antibiotic were isolated, grown, and functionally tested. For further investigations, FTC-133 WT TSHR and FTC-133 Y601H clones were chosen that express comparable receptor densities compared with FTC-133 cells stably expressing empty vector without TSHR. Transient Transfection with shRNA or Dominant Negative Gα12 and Gα13 Expression Vectors—To investigate the role of Gα12 and Gα13 in TSHR-mediated MAPK activation, the RNA interference technique was used (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar). For this purpose, shRNA was transiently expressed via a pSuper NeoGFP expression vector (32Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). shRNA targeting Gα12 and Gα13 were designed according to Reynolds et al. (33Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) with an additional testing of the three-dimensional structure of the mRNA target sequence to ensure optimal efficacy of RNA interference (34Yiu S.M. Wong P.W. Lam T.W. Mui Y.C. Kung H.F. Lin M. Cheung Y.T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a control, shRNA against luciferase (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was expressed. The DNA sequence was 5′-TTA AGA AGA TCC CCT TTA A-3′ for the Gα12-specific construct and 5′-ATA AGA TGA TGT CGT TTG A-3′ for the Gα13-specific construct. For transient transfection, metafectene was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded in 6-well dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated overnight. To ensure an extensive knockdown of the target genes, cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well on both day 2 and day 3. In each case, medium was replaced 6 h after transfection. After the second transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h. On day 4, cells were stimulated to test for MAPK activation. To inhibit G12 and G13 signaling, constructs carrying cDNA for dominant negative variants Gα12G228A and Gα13G225A in a pCIS expression vector were used (generously provided by Dr. S. Offermanns, Heidelberg, Germany). Transient transfection of Gα12 or Gα13 constructs was performed using metafectene and 1 μg of the respective plasmids. Quantification of TSH Receptor Expression by Cell Surface Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Thyroid cells were seeded in a density of 2 × 104 cells/250 μl in a 48-well multititer plate. The next day, cells were incubated (1 h at 4 °C) with a TSHR-specific antibody (IgG concentration 5 μg/ml) that recognizes an extracellular portion of the receptor. Thereafter, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat, anti-mouse; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. To determine peroxidase activity, 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine solution (1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA; Pierce) was added for 2 min. Then the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 1 m sulfuric acid. Absorption was detected at 450 nm. Quantification of cAMP Formation or Levels of Total Inositol Phosphates—For functional assays, cultured FTC-133 cells were seeded in 12-well dishes (2 × 105 cells/well). One day later, cells were washed and growth-arrested by incubation in serumfree IMDM for 18 h. Labeling and assessment of total inositol phosphates (IP) or cAMP accumulation were performed in a modification of the original methods (35Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 36Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar), as described previously (37Schoneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Biebermann H. Schoneberg T. Krude H. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Gruters A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Ligand Binding Assay—For radiolabeled ligand binding studies, cells were harvested, and binding assays with membrane homogenates were performed as described previously (38Biebermann H. Schoneberg T. Krude H. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Gruters A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 22 °C in 0.25 ml of a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, supplemented with 40,000 cpm of 125I-labeled bovine TSH (54 μCi/μg; Brahms Diagnostika). Membranes and bound ligand were separated from unbound ligand by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) through a silicon oil layer. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 100 nm bovine TSH. Binding data were analyzed by a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting procedure. Western Blot—For Western blot analysis, cells were grown in 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) for 24 h. Cells were growth-arrested for 18 h by incubation in serum-free medium, stimulated as indicated, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (9% gel) and electroblotted onto Hybond C Extra membranes. Blots were incubated in Rotiblock for 1 h to saturate nonspecific binding sites, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the respective primary antibody. Phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK was detected using a phosphospecific anti-p44/42 MAPK rabbit monoclonal antibody. Reblots as loading controls were performed using an anti-p44/42 MAPK mouse monoclonal antibody detecting total (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) MAPK. For incubation with antisera against the different Gα proteins, nitrocellulose sheets were cut into smaller strips. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA from cells was isolated using the TriFast reagent (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). First-strand synthesis was carried out with random hexamers (pdN6; Amersham Biosciences) as primers, using REVERTAID reverse transcriptase (MBI-Fermentas, Sankt Leon-Roth, Germany). Products were amplified using specific, intron-spanning primer pairs for regulatory PKA subunits RIα (Iα for and Iα rev), RIβ (Iβ for and Iβ rev), RIIα (IIα for and IIα rev), and RIIβ (IIβ for and IIβ rev), giving predicted product sizes of 86, 79, 107, and 79 bp, respectively, and β-actin primers (ACT for and ACT rev) as controls. Primer sequences were as follows: Iα for, 5′-GGC ATT CCT CAG GGA ATA CTT; Iα rev, 5′-CTG TAC GAG TGC CTG CTT TCT; Iβ for, 5′-GGT CCC CCA ATG AGG AGT A; Iβ rev, 5′-TTC AGC AGC AGT GCA ATC TC; IIα for, 5′-AGT CTG GCG AAG TGA GCA TC; IIα rev, 5′-TCC AAA GTA CTG CCC CTT ATG; IIβ for, 5′-CTG CTA CCT CTC CTG GTG CT; IIβ rev, 5′-TTT TTG GCA TTG TTT TTC ACA; ACT for, 5′-GGC TAC AGC TTC ACC ACC AC; ACT rev, 5′-GAG TAC TTG CGC TCA GGA GG. Real time PCR was done using the 2× master mix from the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) containing a HotStar Taq polymerase, buffer, nucleotides, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and SYBR Green. Subsequently, 10 pmol of each primer pair and 0.2 μl from the first-strand synthesis were added to the reaction mixture, and PCR was carried out in a light cycler apparatus (Roche Applied Science) using the following conditions: 15 min of initial activation and 45 cycles of 12 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and 10 s at 80 °C each. Fluorescence intensities were recorded after the extension step at 80 °C after each cycle. All primers were tested by using diluted cDNA from the first-strand synthesis (10–1,000-fold) to confirm linearity of the reaction. Samples containing primer dimers were excluded by melting curve analysis and identification of the products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Crossing points were determined by the software program. The relative gene expression was quantified using the formula, 2e(crossing point of β-actin - crossing point X) × 100 = percentage of reference gene expression. Reproducibility of Results—All assays were independently performed at least three times unless otherwise indicated. In the case of immunoblots, one representative experiment is shown. TSH Promotes p44/42 MAPK Activation in Follicular Carcinoma Cells Stably Expressing the TSHR and in Thyrocytes Endogenously Expressing TSHR—We first investigated whether TSH is able to activate the MAPK signaling pathway in a human thyroid carcinoma cell line. As a cellular model, we used FTC-133 cells, which are derived from human thyroid cancer cells but do not express a functional TSHR (39Demeure M.J. Doffek K.M. Wilson S.D. Surgery. 1997; 122: 1195-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated a FTC-133 cell line stably expressing the human TSHR (FTC-133 WT TSHR) and compared this new cell line with FTC-133 cells that only expressed the empty vector. In the latter cell line (FTC-133), TSH had no effect on the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 1, A and E), excluding the possibility that TSH used in this study contained unknown factors that activate MAPK in a TSHR-independent mechanism, as described previously (40Correze C. Blondeau J.P. Pomerance M. Thyroid. 2000; 10: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, testing FTC-133 WT TSHR cells, we found a concentration-dependent increase in MAPK phosphorylation following stimulation with TSH (Fig. 1, B and E). Regarding kinetics, MAPK activation was detectable within 1–5 min following stimulation with 100 mIU/ml of TSH and reached a peak after 5–10 min. After 30 min of hormone stimulation, the MAPK response decreased and faded completely after 120 min (Fig. 1C). In a second cellular model, PHT cells, analogous results were obtained (Fig. 1, D and E). These cells were derived from a patient with Grave disease and thus are nonneoplastic cells. In PHT cells, treatment with 100 mIU/ml of TSH for 5 min also caused stimulation of MAPK, which returned to basal levels within 30 min (Fig. 1D). Next, we analyzed the molecular mechanism underlying TSH-promoted activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. TSH Induces c-Fos in FTC-133 WT TSHR and PHT Cells—Induction of c-Fos expression represents a typical response following nuclear translocation of MAPK. Thus, we evaluated whether TSH led to the induction of this immediate early gene. Stimulation of FTC-133 WT TSHR cells with 100 mIU/ml of TSH led to a pronounced induction of c-Fos within 2 h (Fig. 2A), which could be blocked by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase with 10 μm PD98058, suggesting that MAPK was necessary for TSH-mediated c-Fos induction. Analogous results were found for PHT cells (Fig. 2B). Since PHT cells endogenously express TSHR, both MAPK activation and downstream effects (i.e. c-Fos induction) do not result from overexpression of signaling components but may represent physiologic responses induced by TSHR activation. TSH-mediated p44/42 MAPK Activation in FTC-133 WT TSHR and PHT Cells Is Independent of Gs and Gi/o Activation—Most known TSHR-mediated cellular responses are dependent on the activation of the classical Gs pathway, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Thus, we tested whether this was also the case for the TSH-promoted activation of the MAPK pathway in the investigated cellular models. In principle, elevated cAMP concentrations can either activate or inhibit MAPK activity (41Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), depending on the signaling context and the regulatory PKA subunits involved in this process. Furthermore, PKA-independent activation of MAPK can also occur via exchange proteins activated by cAMP, so-called EPACs (42Laroche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In FTC-133 WT TSHR cells, direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (100 μm forskolin, 1 h) or PKA (2.5–10 μm 8-bromo-cAMP; 30 min) decreased basal MAPK activity (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating an inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PKA in these cells. In line with these results, pretreatment of FTC-133 WT TSHR cells with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (10 μm IBMX; 30 min) prevented TSH-promoted MAPK activation (F"
https://openalex.org/W2049114564,"Background Simple biomarkers are required to identify TB in both HIV−TB+ and HIV+TB+ patients. Earlier studies have identified the M. tuberculosis Malate Synthase (MS) and MPT51 as immunodominant antigens in TB patients. One goal of these investigations was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of anti-MS and –MPT51 antibodies as biomarkers for TB in HIV−TB+ and HIV+TB+ patients from a TB-endemic setting. Earlier studies also demonstrated the presence of these biomarkers during incipient subclinical TB. If these biomarkers correlate with incipient TB, their prevalence should be higher in asymptomatic HIV+ subjects who are at a high-risk for TB. The second goal was to compare the prevalence of these biomarkers in asymptomatic, CD4+ T cell-matched HIV+TB− subjects from India who are at high-risk for TB with similar subjects from US who are at low-risk for TB. Methods and Results Anti-MS and -MPT51 antibodies were assessed in sera from 480 subjects including PPD+ or PPD− healthy subjects, healthy community members, and HIV−TB+ and HIV+TB+ patients from India. Results demonstrate high sensitivity (∼80%) of detection of smear-positive HIV−TB+ and HIV+TB+ patients, and high specificity (>97%) with PPD+ subjects and endemic controls. While ∼45% of the asymptomatic HIV+TB− patients at high-risk for TB tested biomarker-positive, >97% of the HIV+TB− subjects at low risk for TB tested negative. Although the current studies are hampered by lack of knowledge of the outcome, these results provide strong support for the potential of these biomarkers to detect incipient, subclinical TB in HIV+ subjects. Conclusions These biomarkers provide high sensitivity and specificity for TB diagnosis in a TB endemic setting. Their performance is not compromised by concurrent HIV infection, site of TB and absence of pulmonary manifestations in HIV+TB+ patients. Results also demonstrate the potential of these biomarkers for identifying incipient subclinical TB in HIV+TB− subjects at high-risk for TB."
https://openalex.org/W2059968977,"The induction of long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses is caused by an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptordependent accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+), followed by Src family kinase activation and a positive feedback enhancement of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Nevertheless, the amplitude of baseline transmission remains remarkably constant even though low frequency stimulation is also associated with an NMDAR-dependent influx of Ca(2+) into dendritic spines. We show here that an interaction between C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and NMDARs controls the Src-dependent regulation of NMDAR activity. Csk associates with the NMDAR signaling complex in the adult brain, inhibiting the Src-dependent potentiation of NMDARs in CA1 neurons and attenuating the Src-dependent induction of long-term potentiation. Csk associates directly with Src-phosphorylated NR2 subunits in vitro. An inhibitory antibody for Csk disrupts this physical association, potentiates NMDAR mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents, and induces long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses. Thus, Csk serves to maintain the constancy of baseline excitatory synaptic transmission by inhibiting Src kinase-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2055551281,"The cDNAs of lactate dehydrogenase b (LDH-b) from both deep-sea and shallow living fish species, Corphaenoides armatus and Gadus morhua respectively, have been isolated, sequenced and their encoded products overproduced as recombinant enzymes in E. coli. The proteins were characterised in terms of their kinetic and physical properties and their ability to withstand high pressures. Although the two proteins are very similar in terms of their primary structure, only 21 differences at the amino acid level exist between them, the enzyme from the deep-sea species has a significantly increased tolerance to pressure and a higher thermostability. It was possible to investigate whether the changes in the N-terminal or C-terminal regions played a greater role in barophilic adaptation by the construction of two chimeric enzymes by use of a common restriction site within the cDNAs. One of these hybrids was found to have even greater pressure stability than the recombinant enzyme from the deep-living fish species. It was possible to conclude that the major adaptive changes to pressure tolerance must be located in the N-terminal region of the protein. The types of changes that are found and their spatial location within the protein structure are discussed. An analysis of the kinetic parameters of the enzymes suggests that there is clearly a trade off between Km and kcat values, which likely reflects the necessity of the deep-sea enzyme to operate at low temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1992699772,"The structural and thermodynamic impact of phosphorylation on the interaction of the N-terminal domain of enzyme I (EIN) and the histidine phosphocarrier protein (HPr), the two common components of all branches of the bacterial phosphotransferase system, have been examined using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. His-189 is located at the interface of the α and αβ domains of EIN, resulting in rather widespread chemical shift perturbation upon phosphorylation, in contrast to the highly localized perturbations seen for HPr, where His-15 is fully exposed to solvent. Residual dipolar coupling measurements, however, demonstrate unambiguously that no significant changes in backbone conformation of either protein occur upon phosphorylation: for EIN, the relative orientation of the α and αβ domains remains unchanged; for HPr, the backbone ϕ/Ψ torsion angles of the active site residues are unperturbed within experimental error. His → Glu/Asp mutations of the active site histidines designed to mimic the phosphorylated states reveal binding equilibria that favor phosphoryl transfer from EIN to HPr. Although binding of phospho-EIN to phospho-HPr is reduced by a factor of ∼21 relative to the unphosphorylated complex, residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal that the structures of the unphosphorylated and biphosphorylated complexes are the same. Hence, the phosphorylation states of EIN and HPr shift the binding equilibria predominantly by modulating intermolecular electrostatic interactions without altering either the backbone scaffold or binding interface.

In addition, the phosphorylation state of individual components of the PTS act as switches in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including transcription, chemotaxis, and glycolysis (4Deutscher J. Francke C. Postma P.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 939-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The first two proteins in the PTS, enzyme I, and the histidine phosphocarrier protein (HPr) are common to all branches, whereas subsequent phosphorylation transfer steps involve sugar-specific permeases, also known as enzymes II. The initial step in the PTS involves auto-phosphorylation of enzyme I (EI) at the Nϵ2 atom of His-189 by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (5Weigel N. Kikizurinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation requires the presence of the C-terminal domain of EI (EIC), but reversible phosphoryl transfer from EI to the Nδ1 atom of His-15 of HPr (7Wiegel N. Powers D.A. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14499-14509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) only requires the N-terminal domain of EI, EIN (8Licalsi C. Crocenzi T.S. Freiere E. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred from HPr through a sequence of two cytoplasmic enzyme II components, A and B, to the incoming sugar bound to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane-bound sugar permease (1Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys.

Francke C. Postma P.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 939-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The phosphotransfer reactions within the PTS are reversible (4Deutscher J. Francke C. Postma P.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 939-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In the resting state (in the absence of external sugar), the high phosphotransfer potential of PEP maintains the cellular PTS proteins in a fully phosphorylated state (10Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Upon sugar translocation and concomitant phosphorylation of the incoming sugar, the sequential phosphoryl transfer cascade is resumed. Little is known of how protein-protein interactions within the PTS are affected by phosphorylation. In this paper, we examine the effect of phosphorylation on the structures of EIN, HPr, and the biphosphorylated EIN·HPr complex. We show using residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements (12Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 13Prestegard J.H. Bougault C.M. Kishore A.L. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3519-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) that no significant backbone perturbation is observed upon phosphorylation of either EIN or HPr and that the relative orientation of EIN and HPr in a fully biphosphorylated complex is the same as that in the unphosphorylated complex. However, the equilibrium constants for the interaction between EIN and HPr are significantly affected by phosphorylation state, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Finally, we determine the approximate overall rate constant for phosphoryl transfer between EIN and HPr by qualitative interpretation of cross-peak line widths in 1H-15N correlation spectra recorded during the course of active phosphoryl transfer. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of EIN and HPr—EIN (residues 1–249) and HPr (residues 1–85) were cloned into a pET15b vector (Novagen) without tags. The active site His-189 of EIN and His-15 of HPr were mutated to Glu or Asp using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and the new constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21star(DE3) (Invitrogen) cells for expression. Cells were grown in either Luria Bertini or minimal medium (with 15NH4Cl and/or 13C6-glucose as the sole nitrogen or carbon source, respectively) in H2O or D2O, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.8, and harvested by centrifugation after 4 h of induction. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml (per liter of culture) of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was lysed by three passages through a microfluidizer and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction was filtered and loaded onto a DEAE anion exchange column (20 ml; GE Healthcare), and the protein was eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing the protein were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex-75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide. Relevant fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and finally purified on a monoQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). NMR samples were prepared in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 10% D2O (v/v). For protein phosphorylation, 1% (c/c) EI (prepared as described previously (14Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) and HPr were added to the sample in conjunction with 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm PEP. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded at 37 °C on Bruker 600 MHz spectrometers (DMX or DRX) equipped with either a z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobe or, for 31P NMR, an x,y,z-shielded gradient quadruple resonance probe. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (15Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfiefer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program PIPP (16Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) or NMRView (17Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). Sequential assignments of phosphorylated EIN and phosphorylated HPr were performed using three-dimensional triple resonance through-bond scalar correlation experiments (HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH) (18Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Ann. Rev. Biophys Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Grzesiek S. Bax A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (791) Google Scholar). 1DNH RDCs were measured by taking the difference in 1JNH scalar couplings in aligned and isotropic media (12Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The alignment media employed were phage pf1 (11 mg/ml; ASLA Biotech) (20Clore G.M. Starich M.R. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1065-1074Crossref Scopus (689) Google Scholar) for phosphorylated EIN and the biphosphorylated EIN·HPr complex, and 5% C12E5 polyethylene glycol (PEG)/n-hexanol (Fluka) (22Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar) for phosphorylated HPr. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of RDCs (12Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 13Prestegard J.H. Bougault C.M. Kishore A.L. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3519-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was carried out using Xplor-NIH (23Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J. Clore G.M. Progr. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spect. 2006; 48: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (619) Google Scholar). For titration experiments, a 1 mm concentration of one protein was titrated with the other protein in either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated states. For titration experiments involving the phosphorylated states, 1% (c/c) EI, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm PEP were used to keep the proteins fully phosphorylated. Time course experiments were carried out using 1 mm 15N-labeled EIN and 1 mm unlabeled HPr in the presence of 10 μm EI, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm PEP, and 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were collected at 30-min intervals until both proteins were completely dephosphorylated. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC was performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc.). 0.1 mm EIN was placed in the cell and titrated with 1 mm HPr in the syringe at 37 °C for wild-type and mutant proteins. For titrations involving the phosphorylated states, 0.15 mm EIN and 2 mm HPr were used with 1% (c/c) of enzymes (EI and HPr), 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm PEP present in the cell and the syringe to maintain both EIN and HPr in a fully phosphorylated state during the course of the titration. Analysis of the data was performed using the Origin software provided with the instrument. When phosphorylated proteins were titrated, significant base-line drift was observed due to continuous dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation in the cell and corrected prior to analysis using the reference titration of phosphorylated HPr into the cell in the absence of EIN. Structures of Phosphorylated EIN and HPr—EIN and HPr were enzymatically phosphorylated using catalytic amounts of EI, HPr, and a large excess of PEP. EIN is phosphorylated at the Nϵ2 atom of His-189 (5Weigel N. Kikizurinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and HPr is phosphorylated at the Nδ1 atom of His-15 (7Wiegel N. Powers D.A. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Since the phosphoryl group on the active site histidines of both proteins is labile and continually lost to buffer by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis with a t½ of ∼20 min at pH 7.4, PEP is continually consumed, and inorganic phosphorus is generated. Therefore, full protein phosphorylation was confirmed after completion of NMR structure-based experiments (e.g. measurement of RDCs) by either 1H-15N HSQC spectroscopy or one-dimensional 31P NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1A). The 31P NMR signal of phospho-EIN resonates at -4.82 ppm (referenced to phosphoric acid at 0 ppm), consistent with the 31P shift of -4.73 ppm for Nϵ-phosphohistidine at pH 7.4 (24Gassner M. Stehlik D. Schrecker O. Hengstenberg W. Maurer W. Ruterjans H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The 31P signal of phospho-HPr resonates at -3.63 ppm, which is ∼2 ppm downfield relative to that of Nδ-phosphohistidine (-5.55 ppm at pH 7.4) (25Dooijewaard G. Roossien F.F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2996-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is due to hydrogen bonding between the phosphoryl group and the backbone amide groups of Thr-16 and Arg-17, as well as the hydroxyl group of Thr-16, in the active site (26van Nuland N.A.J. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Jones B.E. Rajagopal P. Klevit R.E.

Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); upon pH-induced unfolding of HPr, the difference in 31P chemical shift between phospho-HPr and Nδ-phosphohistidine disappears (24Gassner M. Stehlik D. Schrecker O. Hengstenberg W. Maurer W. Ruterjans H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Dooijewaard G. Roossien F.F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2996-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Chemical shift perturbation of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of EIN is quite extensive upon phosphorylation, involving both the α (residues 33–143) and αβ (residues 1–20 and 148–230) domains (Fig. 1C), consistent with previously preliminary results reported for partially phosphorylated EIN (6Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Given the location of His-189, the largest perturbations involve residues located at the interface between the α and α/β domains (Fig. 1D). The chemical shift perturbations, however, are not due to reorientation of the α and αβ domains upon phosphorylation (see below) but rather to electronic effects arising from the presence of the phosphoryl group as well as ring current effects due to a change in the χ2 angle of His-189 from the g+ to g- rotameric state that breaks the hydrogen bond between the Nϵ2 atom of His-189 and the hydroxyl group of Thr-69, thereby rendering the Nϵ2 atom accessible to the incoming phosphoryl group (28Garrett D.S.

Structure. 1996; 4: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recently, a 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure was published for intact phosphorylated EI obtained by mixing the protein with PEP followed by quenching of the autophosphorylation reaction by the EI inhibitor oxalate (31Teplyakov A. Lim K. Zhu P.P. Kapadia G. Chen C.C.H. Schwartz J. Howard A. Reddy P.T. Peterkofsky A. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16218-16223Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2HWG). In the crystal structure of phosphorylated EI, there is a large ∼65° reorientation of the α and αβ subdomains within the EIN domain (31Teplyakov A. Lim K. Zhu P.P. Kapadia G. Chen C.C.H. Schwartz J. Howard A. Reddy P.T. Peterkofsky A. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2517-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and in the crystal state (30Liao D.I. Silverton E. Seok Y.J. Lee B.R. Peterkofsky A. Davies D.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as well as complexed with HPr (28Garrett D.S. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As a consequence of domain reorientation, the phosphoryl group on His-189 (located in the αβ subdomain) is buried in the PEP binding site on the EIC domain (31Teplyakov A. Lim K. Zhu P.P. Kapadia G. Chen C.C.H. Schwartz J. Howard A. Reddy P.T. Peterkofsky A. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16218-16223Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and can no longer interact with His-15 of HPr. Further, although the HPr binding site on the α subdomain is still fully accessible to HPr, the distance between His-189 of phosphorylated EI and His-15 of HPr (with HPr docked to its binding site on the α subdomain) is 30 Å and therefore incompatible with downstream phosphoryl transfer from EI to HPr (31Teplyakov A. Lim K. Zhu P.P. Kapadia G. Chen C.C.H. Schwartz J. Howard A. Reddy P.T. Peterkofsky A. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16218-16223Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed (31Teplyakov A. Lim K. Zhu P.P. Kapadia G. Chen C.C.H. Schwartz J. Howard A. Reddy P.T. Peterkofsky A. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16218-16223Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that the crystal structure of phosphorylated EI corresponds to a trapped intermediate just after auto-phosphorylation by PEP but prior to the postulated conformational transitions involving swiveling and hinge rotation of both EIC and the α subdomain required to bring His-189 in close proximity to His-15 of HPr, as observed in the structure of the EIN·HPr complex (28Garrett D.S. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this paper, we refer to the orientation of the α and αβ subdomains observed in the free and complexed structures of EIN (28Garrett D.S. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 29Garrett Seok, D.S. Liao D.I. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

Structure. 1996; 4: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) as the A state (Fig. 2A, left), and we refer to that observed in the crystal structure of phosphorylated EI as the B state (Fig. 2A, right). To assess whether domain reorientation of the α and αβ domains of EIN occurs upon phosphorylation of EIN alone, we proceeded to measure backbone amide RDCs on phospho-EIN in a liquid crystalline medium of phage pf1. RDCs of fixed bond vectors, such as the backbone N–H bond vector, are dependent on the orientation of the bond vectors relative to the alignment tensor and provide a very sensitive indicator of changes in relative domain orientations (12Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 13Prestegard J.H. Bougault C.M. Kishore A.L. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3519-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The magnitude and orientation of the alignment tensors obtained by SVD to obtain a best fit between the observed RDCs and those calculated from the atomic coordinates of EIN (taken from the NMR structure of the EIN·HPr complex, Protein Data Bank code 3EZA) (28Garrett D.S. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) are the same within experimental error using the coordinates of the α and αβ domains individually or together (Table 1 and Fig. 2, B and C). In addition, the RDC R-factor (Rdip) (32Clore G.M. Garrett D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9008-9012Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar) obtained from the global fit (15%) is comparable with that obtained from the individual fits to the α (Rdip = 13%) and αβ (Rdip = 16%) domains. (Note that these Rdip values are consistent with those expected for 1.5–2 Å resolution crystal structures (33Cornilescu G. Lee B.R. Cornilescu C. Wang G. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29269-29276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).) In contrast, the measured RDC data are not consistent with the B state conformation seen in the crystal structure of phosphorylated EI (Fig. 2D and Table 1). The orientations of the alignment tensors are different for the α and αβ domains (Table 1), and the global fit is very poor (Rdip = 43%) (Fig. 2D). (Note that the coordinates of the α and αβ domains used in Fig. 2 are taken from the NMR structure of the EIN·HPr complex in either the A or B state orientations. The latter are simply obtained by best fitting the coordinates of the two domains individually to the coordinates of their respective domains in the x-ray structure of phosphorylated EI. If the x-ray coordinates of phosphorylated EI are used, the RDC R-factors for the fits to the individual α and αβ domains are significantly worse than those for the NMR coordinates, reflecting the relatively low 2.7 Å resolution of the crystal structure and hence the reduced accuracy and increased uncertainty of the N–H bond vector orientations; however, the orientation of the alignment tensors for the α and αβ domain remain different, and the RDC R-factor for the global fit is significantly worse than that for the individual fits (cf. Table 1). Thus, one can conclude unambiguously that the orientation of the α and αβ domains in phospho-EIN corresponds to that of the A state conformation seen in unphosphorylated EIN, both free (29Garrett Seok, D.S.

https://openalex.org/W2144366450,"Histone tails have a plethora of different post-translational modifications, which are located differently in ""open"" and ""closed"" parts of genomes. H3K4me3/H3K79me2 and H4K20me3 are among the histone marks associated with the early establishment of active and inactive chromatin, respectively. One of the most widespread promoter elements is the CCAAT box, bound by the NF-Y trimer. Two of NF-Y subunits have an H2A-H2B-like structure.We established the causal relationship between NF-Y binding and positioning of methyl marks, by ChIP analysis of mouse and human cells infected with a dominant negative NF-YA: a parallel decrease in NF-Y binding, H3K4me3, H3K79me2 and transcription was observed in promoters that are dependent upon NF-Y. On the contrary, changes in the levels of H3K9-14ac were more subtle. Components of the H3K4 methylating MLL complex are not recruited in the absence of NF-Y. As for repressed promoters, NF-Y removal leads to a decrease in the H4K20me3 mark and deposition of H3K4me3.Two relevant findings are reported: (i) NF-Y gains access to its genomic locations independently from the presence of methyl histone marks, either positive or negative; (ii) NF-Y binding has profound positive or negative consequences on the deposition of histone methyl marks. Therefore NF-Y is a fundamental switch at the heart of decision between gene activation and repression in CCAAT regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W1967619119,"An understanding of the health of potential volunteers in Africa is essential for the safe and efficient conduct of clinical trials, particularly for trials of preventive technologies such as vaccines that enroll healthy individuals. Clinical safety laboratory values used for screening, enrolment and follow-up of African clinical trial volunteers have largely been based on values derived from industrialized countries in Europe and North America. This report describes baseline morbidity during recruitment for a multi-center, African laboratory reference intervals study.Asymptomatic persons, aged 18-60 years, were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study at seven sites (Kigali, Rwanda; Masaka and Entebbe, Uganda; Kangemi, Kenyatta National Hospital and Kilifi, Kenya; and Lusaka, Zambia). Gender equivalency was by design. Individuals who were acutely ill, pregnant, menstruating, or had significant clinical findings were not enrolled. Each volunteer provided blood for hematology, immunology, and biochemistry parameters and urine for urinalysis. Enrolled volunteers were excluded if found to be positive for HIV, syphilis or Hepatitis B and C. Laboratory assays were conducted under Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP).Of the 2990 volunteers who were screened, 2387 (80%) were enrolled, and 2107 (71%) were included in the analysis (52% men, 48% women). Major reasons for screening out volunteers included abnormal findings on physical examination (228/603, 38%), significant medical history (76, 13%) and inability to complete the informed consent process (73, 13%). Once enrolled, principle reasons for exclusion from analysis included detection of Hepatitis B surface antigen (106/280, 38%) and antibodies against Hepatitis C (95, 34%). This is the first large scale, multi-site study conducted to the standards of GCLP to describe African laboratory reference intervals applicable to potential volunteers in clinical trials. Approximately one-third of all potential volunteers screened were not eligible for analysis; the majority were excluded for medical reasons."

There is no information on the function of other Myc genes in neural crest development, or about any developmental role of zebrafish Myc genes.We isolated the zebrafish mych (myc homologue) gene. Knockdown of mych leads to severe defects in craniofacial development and in certain other tissues including the eye. These phenotypes appear to be caused by cell death in the neural crest and in the eye field in the anterior brain.Mych is a novel factor required for neural crest cell survival in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2011672899,"FADD is the key adaptor transmitting the apoptotic signal mediated by death receptors. We have previously shown that FADD protein expression could be lost in vivo in cancerous cells, in mice and humans, and be used as prognostic factor. Furthermore, loss of FADD could contribute to tumor progression and aggressiveness. However, the mechanism accounting for the loss of FADD was unknown. Using in vitro-cultured mouse organ models, we demonstrated that loss of FADD occurred through a new regulatory pathway of FADD expression by secretion. The secretion of FADD is an active release following shedding of microvesicles derived from the plasma membrane. In our experimental settings, this phenomenon was restricted to 6 of 12 FADD-expressing organs. This process is calcium- and adenosine-dependent. Moreover, we identified the two receptors with low affinity to adenosine, namely A2B and A3 adenosine receptors, as regulators of the FADD secretion process. Furthermore, we showed that modulating A3 adenosine receptor can convert a nonsecreting organ into a FADD-secreting one. Finally, we reported that mouse FADD release occurred in vivo during tumor disease. These results demonstrate the existence of a new localization site (in microvesicles) and regulatory mechanism (by secretion) of the FADD protein, and the implication of adenosine receptors in this process. These data open a new field of investigation consisting of the possibility to regulate FADD expression via the modulation of adenosine receptors, which constitutes a therapeutic target in diseases in which FADD-mediated signaling is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2150800543,"Background Deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are the normal substrates for DNA synthesis catalyzed by polymerases such as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). However, substantial amounts of deoxynucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs) are also present in the cell. Use of dNDPs in HIV-1 DNA synthesis could have significant implications for the efficacy of nucleoside RT inhibitors such as AZT which are first line therapeutics for treatment of HIV infection. Our earlier work on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) suggested that the interaction between the γ-phosphate of the incoming dNTP and RT residue K65 in the active site is not essential for dNTP insertion, implying that this polymerase may be able to insert dNDPs in addition to dNTPs. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the ability of recombinant wild type (wt) and mutant RTs with substitutions at residue K65 to utilize a dNDP substrate in primer extension reactions. We found that wild type HIV-1 RT indeed catalyzes incorporation of dNDP substrates whereas RT with mutations of residue K65 were unable to catalyze this reaction. Wild type HIV-1 RT also catalyzed the reverse reaction, inorganic phosphate-dependent phosphorolysis. Nucleotide-mediated phosphorolytic removal of chain-terminating 3′-terminal nucleoside inhibitors such as AZT forms the basis for HIV-1 resistance to such drugs, and this removal is enhanced by thymidine analog mutations (TAMs). We found that both wt and TAM-containing RTs were able to catalyze Pi-mediated phosphorolysis of 3′-terminal AZT at physiological levels of Pi with an efficacy similar to that for ATP-dependent AZT-excision. Conclusions We have identified two new catalytic functions of HIV-1 RT, the use of dNDPs as substrates for DNA synthesis, and the use of Pi as substrate for phosphorolytic removal of primer 3′-terminal nucleotides. The ability to insert dNDPs has been documented for only one other DNA polymerase, the RB69 DNA polymerase and the reverse reaction employing inorganic phosphate has not been documented for any DNA polymerase. Importantly, our results show that Pi-mediated phosphorolysis can contribute to AZT resistance and indicates that factors that influence HIV resistance to AZT are more complex than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2103271867,"Background Burkholderia mallei is an understudied biothreat agent responsible for glanders which can be lethal in humans and animals. Research with this pathogen has been hampered in part by constraints of Select Agent regulations for safety reasons. Whole genomic sequencing (WGS) is an apt approach to characterize newly discovered or poorly understood microbial pathogens. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed WGS on a strain of B. mallei, SAVP1, previously pathogenic, that was experimentally infected in 6 equids (4 ponies, 1 mule, 1 donkey), natural hosts, for purposes of producing antibodies. Multiple high inocula were used in some cases. Unexpectedly SAVP1 appeared to be avirulent in the ponies and mule, and attenuated in the donkey, but induced antibodies. We determined the genome sequence of SAVP1 and compared it to a strain that was virulent in horses and a human. In comparison, this phenotypic avirulent SAVP1 strain was missing multiple genes including all the animal type III secretory system (T3SS) complex of genes demonstrated to be essential for virulence in mice and hamster models. The loss of these genes in the SAVP1 strain appears to be the consequence of a multiple gene deletion across insertion sequence (IS) elements in the B. mallei genome. Therefore, the strain by itself is unlikely to revert naturally to its virulent phenotype. There were other genes present in one strain and not the other and vice-versa. Conclusion/Significance The discovery that this strain of B. mallei was both avirulent in the natural host ponies, and did not possess T3SS associated genes may be fortuitous to advance biodefense research. The deleted virulence-essential T3SS is not likely to be re-acquired naturally. These findings may provide a basis for exclusion of SAVP1 from the Select Agent regulation or at least discussion of what else would be required for exclusion. This exclusion could accelerate research by investigators not possessing BSL-3 facilities and facilitate the production of reagents such as antibodies without the restraints of Select Agent regulation."
