https://openalex.org/W2003856260,"The fact that twice as many chondritic meteorites are observed falling in the afternoon as in the morning is not believed to be primarily of social origin, but to be a dynamic effect. Monte Carlo calculations show that the observed afternoon excess is not compatible with a lunar or Apollo asteroidal origin. Compatibility appears to require a source having an aphelion near Jupiter, such as could be provided conceivably by the Hilda or Trojan families of asteroids, or by short-period comets."
https://openalex.org/W1986767177,"An emanation from oak leaves is necessary for the mating of polyphemus moths under laboratory conditions. This requirement can be satisfied by placing the moths in the presence of oak leaves or aqueous or alcoholic extracts prepared from oak leaves. The active principle is a vola- tile, heat-stable, polar material which has been partially purified. The oak emanation acts on the female and not on the male, and the sensory receptors are located on the female antennae. The reception of the oak emanation is prerequisite for the female's release of her sex pheromone, which in turn, is necessary for the sexual activation of the male."
https://openalex.org/W2092061311,"The optical characteristics (intensity, polarization, spectrum, and albedo) of the moon surface are compared with those of rock and meteorite powders. The only materials whose optical properties match those of the lunar surface are basic rocks containing lattice iron but little or no free iron, and then only after irradiation of these rocks by a simulated solar wind. Optical properties of chondritic meteorite powders differ from those of the moon in significant respects. The lunar crust is probably not chondritic, but is similar in composition to terrestrial iron-rich basalts. These results are independent of those from the Surveyor V alpha-scattering experiment and, in addition, provide a basis for extrapolating the Surveyor V analysis to other areas of the moon. The Surveyor V experiment has thus confirmed the value of earth-based optical techniques for the study of the structure and composition of the surfaces of other planets."

https://openalex.org/W2088215690,"We examined the ultrastructure of hearts from dogs given reserpine intramuscularly for 4 days, and from untreated dogs. Sections of the myocardium from treated dogs invariably revealed mitochondrial abnormalities at the 5th and 14th days. These included fragmentation and loss of structure of the cristae, and cyst formation. The appearance at 25 days in the treated as well as in all the untreated dogs was normal. We concluded that reserpine in the dose used produces marked structural changes in the mitochondria of heart muscle, and that these changes are reversible. These changes may account for the myocardial depression sometimes seen after administration of reserpine."

https://openalex.org/W2057564946,"A method is proposed whereby potable water may be obtained by condensing moisture from the atmosphere in suitable seashore or island areas. Deep, cold, offshore seawater is used as a source of cold and is pumped to condensers set up on shore to intercept the flow of highly humid, tropical, maritime air masses. This air, when cooled, condenses moisture, which is conducted away and stored for use as a water supply. Windmill-driven generators would supply low-cost power for the operation. Side benefits are derived by using the nutritious deep water to support aquiculture in nearby lagoons or to enhance the productivity of the outfall area. Additional benefits are derived from the condenser as an air-conditioning device for nearby residents. The islands of the Caribbean are used as an example of a location in the trade-winds belt where nearly optimum conditions for the operation of this system can be found."
https://openalex.org/W2021267747,"Electric discharges between free-falling drops have been observed and studied quantitatively in the laboratory. These data and information from terrestrial thunderstorms suggest that augmentation of the UHF temperature of thunderstorms by discharges could amount to 117°K. If similar discharges occurred in the atmosphere or on the surface (or in both regions) of Venus, 1.4 × 106 discharges per second per square meter would be required to produce the microwave temperature observed (approximately 650°K). It is not probable that such radiation supplies the whole microwave temperature observed; some fraction must be true thermal radiation as described by Plummer and Strong, in which case the probable number of required discharges is reduced accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2086860925,"Individuals of Melanoplus differentialis raised in isolation or in a crowded environment show conspicuous morphological differences indicating phase polymorphism. Isolated nymphs are pale brown at low humidities and green at high; crowded ones show extensive black pigmentation. Isolated adults are larger than crowded, while crowded adults show maturational color changes that are not present in the isolated. No behavioral differences have been noted in the one generation."
https://openalex.org/W2070015621,Measurements of the spectrum of high-frequency radio waves scattered from the sea surface and propagated by the ionosphere show that the expected split-spectrum characteristic of scatter from the sea is preserved and suggests the possible use of high-frequency backscatter with a high-resolution receiving system to monitor varying sea state over wide areas.

https://openalex.org/W1986605734,Visibility in warm fog produced in a 600-cubic-meter chamber was increased by factors of 3 to 10 by seeding with carefully sized sodium chloride particles. As little as 1.7 milligrams of salt per cubic meter was effective. Extrapolation of these results indicates that clearing a suitable landing zone for aircraft would not involve prohibitive amounts of seeding material.

https://openalex.org/W1979029059,Magnetic susceptibilities are reported for seven American coals of different rank. The susceptibilities were measured in magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the bedding planes. The coals have diamagnetic susceptibilities approximating -0.5 x 10(-6) centimeter-gram-second unit. Only anthracite shows significant magnetic anisotropy.

https://openalex.org/W2064979892,"An Icelandic basalt lava flow has a systematic oxidation variation, formed during the initial cooling, with a resultant maximum oxidation just below the center of the lava. The ratio of thorium to uranium shows a clear dependence on this primary oxidation variation. Between-lava comparisons of thorium and uranium may be critically dependent on the position of the samples in each lava."
