https://openalex.org/W3119700714,"Background A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and affected most of the world in early 2020. To inform effective public health measures we conducted a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey among a Hausa Muslim society in Nigeria in March 2020. Methods The study is an analytic cross-sectional survey with questionnaires administered to the general population including Health Care Workers (HCW) in Kano, Nigeria. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling following informed consent. The percentage of KAP scores were categorized as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of COVID 19 were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model. Results The questionnaire was administered among urban 32.8%, peri-urban dwellers 32.4%, and to online participants 34.8%. The peri-urban and urban participants were given paper questionnaires. There were 886 study participants with mean age 28.58yrs [SD:10.25] (Interquartile range [IQR]:22yrs–32yrs), males 55.4% with 57.3% having had or were in tertiary education. Most participants were students 40% and civil servants 20%. The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] for knowledge, attitude and practice scores expressed in percentage was 65.38%[SD15.90], 71.45% [SD14.10], and 65.04% [SD17.02] respectively. Out of the respondents, 270(30.47%) had good knowledge (GK), 158(17.8%) had good attitude (GA), and 230(25.96%) had good practice (GP) using cut-off scores of 75%, 86.5%, and 75% respectively. Over 48% did not agree COVID-19 originated from animals while 60% perceived the pandemic to be due to God’s punishment. Also, 36% thought it was a man-made virus. When rating fear, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. ≥ 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. As regards attitude to religious norms, 77.77% agreed on cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 23.64% admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing. One in four people still harbored stigma towards a person who has recovered from the virus. 28% felt some races are more at risk of the disease though 66% mentioned always practicing social distancing from persons coughing or sneezing. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% saying they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In univariate analysis increasing age and having been ever married were associated with GK while tertiary education was associated with GA [Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval] 2.66(1.79–3.95). Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19, and had modified their habits in the last three months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor. Conclusion Knowledge of transmission and preventive measures should be improved in the general population cognizant of cultural norms and Islamic practices. The study highlights the importance of considering belief systems and perception in developing control measures against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3119654517,"Background Our goal was to investigate the role of physical exercise to protect brain health as we age, including the potential to mitigate Alzheimer’s-related pathology. We assessed the effect of 52 weeks of a supervised aerobic exercise program on amyloid accumulation, cognitive performance, and brain volume in cognitively normal older adults with elevated and sub-threshold levels of cerebral amyloid as measured by amyloid PET imaging. Methods and findings This 52-week randomized controlled trial compared the effects of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise vs. education control intervention. A total of 117 underactive older adults (mean age 72.9 [7.7]) without evidence of cognitive impairment, with elevated (n = 79) or subthreshold (n = 38) levels of cerebral amyloid were randomized, and 110 participants completed the study. Exercise was conducted with supervision and monitoring by trained exercise specialists. We conducted 18F-AV45 PET imaging of cerebral amyloid and anatomical MRI for whole brain and hippocampal volume at baseline and Week 52 follow-up to index brain health. Neuropsychological tests were conducted at baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 to assess executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial cognitive domains. Cardiorespiratory fitness testing was performed at baseline and Week 52 to assess response to exercise. The aerobic exercise group significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness (11% vs. 1% in the control group) but there were no differences in change measures of amyloid, brain volume, or cognitive performance compared to control. Conclusions Aerobic exercise was not associated with reduced amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal older adults with cerebral amyloid. In spite of strong systemic cardiorespiratory effects of the intervention, the observed lack of cognitive or brain structure benefits suggests brain benefits of exercise reported in other studies are likely to be related to non-amyloid effects.

https://openalex.org/W3119767380,"Metastasis represents a dynamic succession of events involving tumor cells which disseminate through the organism via the bloodstream. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can flow the bloodstream as single cells or as multicellular aggregates (clusters), which present a different potential to metastasize. The effects of the bloodstream-related physical constraints, such as hemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS), on CTC clusters are still unclear. Therefore, we developed, upon theoretical and CFD modeling, a new multichannel microfluidic device able to simultaneously reproduce different WSS characterizing the human circulatory system, where to analyze the correlation between SS and CTC clusters behavior. Three physiological WSS levels (i.e. 2, 5, 20 dyn/cm 2 ) were generated, reproducing values typical of capillaries, veins and arteries. As first validation, triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected as single CTCs showing that higher values of WSS are correlated with a decreased viability. Next, the SS-mediated disaggregation of CTC clusters was computationally investigated in a vessels-mimicking domain. Finally, CTC clusters were injected within the three different circuits and subjected to the three different WSS, revealing that increasing WSS levels are associated with a raising clusters disaggregation after 6 hours of circulation. These results suggest that our device may represent a valid in vitro tool to carry out systematic studies on the biological significance of blood flow mechanical forces and eventually to promote new strategies for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3120018905,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contamination of agricultural water might be an important factor to recent foodborne illness and outbreaks involving leafy greens. Closed bacterial genomes from whole genome sequencing play an important role in source tracking. We aimed to determine the limits of detection and classification of STECs by qPCR and nanopore sequencing using 24 hour enriched irrigation water artificially contaminated with E . coli O157:H7 (EDL933). We determined the limit of STEC detection by qPCR to be 30 CFU/reaction, which is equivalent to 10 5 CFU/ml in the enrichment. By using Oxford Nanopore’s EPI2ME WIMP workflow and de novo assembly with Flye followed by taxon classification with a k-mer analysis software (Kraken2), E . coli O157:H7 could be detected at 10 3 CFU/ml (68 reads) and a complete fragmented E . coli O157:H7 metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was obtained at 10 5 −10 8 CFU/ml. Using a custom script to extract the E . coli reads, a completely closed MAG was obtained at 10 7 −10 8 CFU/ml and a complete, fragmented MAG was obtained at 10 5 −10 6 CFU/ml. In silico virulence detection for E . coli MAGs for 10 5 −10 8 CFU/ml showed that the virulotype was indistinguishable from the spiked E . coli O157:H7 strain. We further identified the bacterial species in the un-spiked enrichment, including antimicrobial resistance genes, which could have important implications to food safety. We propose this workflow provides proof of concept for faster detection and complete genomic characterization of STECs from a complex microbial sample compared to current reporting protocols and could be applied to determine the limit of detection and assembly of other foodborne bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3119453114,"The objective of this study was to identify the health conditions considered potential risk factors for severe Covid-19 and analyze its association with the BMI of elderly people living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCF). This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study, with a quantitative approach, carried out in eight LTCF in the Metropolitan Region of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, with a population of 267 elderly people, between the months of February and December 2018. The Elderly Health Handbook was used to collect data on sociodemographic, health and risk factors. The Pearson’s Chi-square test and odds ratio were used for the analysis. A higher frequency of low weight was observed in elderly people with cognitive impairment (24.6%), and overweight in those hypertensive (23.3%) and diabetics (12.9%). BMI was associated with the age group of 80 years or over, hypertension and diabetes (p = 0.013; p &lt; 0.001; p = 0.001). Hypertensive elderly people were more likely to have low weight when compared to non-hypertensive individuals (RC = 3.6; 95% CI 1.5–8.6). The institutionalized elderly individuals present health conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of adverse outcomes in case of infection by Covid-19. The importance of protective measures for this population must be reinforced, in view of the devastating action of this disease in these institutions."
https://openalex.org/W3119199892,"Background Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a public health issue globally. In Australia high concentrations of PFAS have been found in environments close to sites where Aqueous Film Forming Foams (AFFF) were historically used for firefighting activities. This has resulted in significant community concern about the potential long-term health effects of these chemicals. Objective We describe residents’ perceptions and experiences of PFAS in three regional Australian towns where exposure has occurred. Methods We conducted focus groups to generate free-flowing open discussion on PFAS in three affected communities, including some with significant numbers of First Nations Peoples. We recruited participants using a range of media outlets and postal services. Focus group transcripts were analysed thematically to identify major shared concerns using Atlas Ti. Results One hundred and eighty residents attended fifteen focus groups that were conducted in the three communities. They included 69 First Nations People living in three communities near the town of Katherine in the Northern Territory. Study participants were concerned about potential physical health effects of exposure to PFAS, such as cancer clusters, unexplained deaths, potential exacerbation of existing health conditions, and the future health of their children. They expressed feelings of stress and anxiety about living with uncertainty related to the possible health and the socio-economic impacts of PFAS contamination in their communities. Conclusion While research has concentrated on the physical health effects of PFAS, more attention needs to be given to the immediate psychosocial impacts of living in an affected community."
https://openalex.org/W3120974398,"DNA-sequencing was performed on the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes to investigate the microbial diversity of five samples of fermented freshwater fish ( pla-ra ) from three provinces in northeastern Thailand. The samples had salt concentrations ranging from 7 to 10%, pH values from 4.83 to 7.15, and D-/L-lactic acid concentrations of 90 to 450 mg/l. A total of 598 operational taxonomic units were annotated at various taxonomic ranks based on the SILVA Database. The lactic-acid and halophilic genera Tetragenococcus , Halanaerobium and Lactobacillus were among the dominant taxa of bacteria. The top 20 non-redundant taxa were considered in more detail. In two pla-ra samples, Tetragenococcus muriaticus was commonly identified. Halanaerobium fermentans was the most abundant species in a third sample and co-dominant in another sample. Lactobacillus rennini was dominant in the pla-ra sample from Roi Et Province. Additionally, other beneficial bacteria were detected including Staphylococcus nepalensis , Lactobacillus sakei , Lactobacillus pentosus , Weissella confusa , and Bifidobacterium bifidum . Differences between samples may be due to use of different raw materials, salt concentrations, recipes, processes and fermentation periods. The microbial communities in pla-ra provide a better understanding of the production outcomes of traditional products. Further optimization of the fermentation process, for example by using dominant bacterial taxa in starter cultures, may improve processes of food fermentation, food quality and flavor control, providing useful guidelines for industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W3120806367,"The Glycine max xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (EC 2.4.1.207), GmXTH43, has been identified through RNA sequencing of RNA isolated through laser microdissection of Heterodera glycines -parasitized root cells (syncytia) undergoing the process of defense. Experiments reveal that genetically increasing XTH43 transcript abundance in the H . glycines -susceptible genotype G . max [Williams 82/PI 518671] decreases parasitism. Experiments presented here show decreasing XTH43 transcript abundance through RNA interference (RNAi) in the H . glycines -resistant G . max [Peking/PI 548402] increases susceptibility, but it is unclear what role XTH43 performs. The experiments presented here show XTH43 overexpression decreases the relative length of xyloglucan (XyG) chains, however, there is an increase in the amount of those shorter chains. In contrast, XTH43 RNAi increases XyG chain length. The experiments show that XTH43 has the capability to function, when increased in its expression, to limit XyG chain extension. This outcome would likely impair the ability of the cell wall to expand. Consequently, XTH43 could provide an enzymatically-driven capability to the cell that would allow it to limit the ability of parasitic nematodes like H . glycines to develop a feeding structure that, otherwise, would facilitate parasitism. The experiments presented here provide experimentally-based proof that XTHs can function in ways that could be viewed as being able to limit the expansion of the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W3118883993,"Background/Aims Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in referral practice commonly report mental disorders and functional impairment. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of mental, physical and sleep-related comorbidities in a nationally representative sample of IBS patients and their impact on functional impairment. Methods IBS was defined by modified Rome Criteria based on responses to the chronic conditions section of the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication. Associations between IBS and mental, physical and sleep disorders and 30-day functional impairment were examined using logistic regression models. Results Of 5,650 eligible responders, 186 met criteria for IBS {weighted prevalence 2.5% (SE = 0.3)}. Age &gt;60 years was associated with decreased odds (OR = 0.3; 95% CI:.1-.6); low family income (OR = 2.4; 95% CI:1.2–4.9) and unemployed status (OR = 2.3; 95% CI:1.2–4.2) were associated with increased odds of IBS. IBS was significantly associated with anxiety, behavior, mood disorders (ORs 1.8–2.4), but not eating or substance use disorders. Among physical conditions, IBS was associated with increased odds of headache, chronic pain, diabetes mellitus and both insomnia and hypersomnolence related symptoms (ORs 1.9–4.0). While the association between IBS and patients’ role impairment persisted after adjusting for mental disorders (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5–3.7), associations with impairment in self-care, cognition, and social interaction in unadjusted models (ORs 2.5–4.2) were no longer significant after adjustment for mental disorders. Conclusion IBS is associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, comorbidity with mood, anxiety and sleep disorders, and role impairment. Other aspects of functional impairment appear to be moderated by presence of comorbid mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3120588236,"Autophagy, a conserved cellular process in eukaryotes, has evolved to a sophisticated process to dispose of intracellular constituents and plays important roles in plant development, metabolism, and efficient nutrients remobilization under suboptimal nutrients conditions. Here, we show that OsATG8b , an AUTOPHAGY-RELATED8 ( ATG8 ) gene in rice, was highly induced by nitrogen (N) starvation. Elevated expression of OsATG8b significantly increased ATG8 lipidation, autophagic flux, and grain yield in rice under both sufficient and deficient N conditions. Overexpressing of OsATG8b could greatly increase the activities of enzymes related to N metabolism. Intriguingly, the 15 N-labeling assay further revealed that more N was remobilized to seeds in OsATG8b -overexpressing rice, which significantly increased the N remobilization efficiency (NRE), N harvest index, N utilization efficiency (NUE), and N uptake efficiency (NUpE). Conversely, the osatg8b knock-out mutants had the opposite results on these characters. The substantial transcriptional changes of the overexpressed transgenic lines indicated the presence of complex signaling to developmental, metabolic process, and hormone, etc. Excitingly, the transgenic rice under different backgrounds all similarly be boosted in yield and NUE with OsATG8b overexpression. This work provides an excellent candidate gene for improving N remobilization, utilization, and yield in crops simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W3118613320,"Background Analysis of hospital-acquired bloodstream infection (HA-BSI) trends is important to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threats and guide empiric antibiotic choices. Methods A retrospective 10-year review of neonatal HA-BSI was performed at Tygerberg Hospital’s neonatal unit in Cape Town, South Africa. Neonatal clinical and laboratory data from 2014 to 2018 (Period 2) was compared with published data from 2009 to 2013 (Period 1). Results The neonatal unit’s HA-BSI rate declined between periods from 3.9/1000 inpatient-days in Period 1 to 3.3/1000 inpatient-days in Period 2 (p = 0.002). Pathogen yield and blood culture contamination rate were unchanged (11.0% to 10.4%, p = 0.233; 5.1% to 5.3%, p = 0.636 respectively). Gram-negative pathogens predominated (1047/1636; 64.0%); Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus , Serratia marcescens , Enterococcus species and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most frequent pathogens. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase production was observed in 319/432 (73.8%) of Klebsiella species, methicillin resistance in 171/246 (69.5%) of Staphylococcus aureus and extensive drug resistance in 115/137 (83.9%) of Acinetobacter species (2009–2018). The crude mortality rate of neonatal HA-BSI episodes increased from Period 1 to Period 2 from 139/717 (19.4%) to 179/718 (24.9%) (p = 0.014), but HA-BSI attributable mortality remained unchanged (97/139 [69.8%] vs 118/179 [65.9%], p = 0.542). The in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin declined during Period 2 (74.6% to 61.4%; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Although HA-BSI rates declined in the neonatal unit, antimicrobial resistance rates in BSI pathogens remained high. Continuous BSI surveillance is a valuable tool to detect changes in pathogen and AMR profiles and inform empiric antibiotic recommendations for neonatal units in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3118949822,"Objective To evaluate the utility of teleconsultation in the provision of eye care services during the COVID-19 lockdown. Disparities in the consultation burden of sub-specialities and socio-demographic differences in teleconsultation utilization were also assessed. Methods Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi began audio and video teleconsultation using broadband telecommunication services during the lockdown. Patients’ and consultations’ data gathered during the first three weeks after the commencement of this programme were compared with data from the four weeks prior to lockdown. The weekly consultation ratio and overall consultation burden of sub-specialities were measured. Chi-Square tests of association determined the relationship between different variables (socioeconomic status and consultation characteristics) and consultation modality (on-site vs online). Results In total, 17507 on-site consultations (4377/week) were conducted compared to 1431 teleconsultations (477/week), which maintained 10.89% of the weekly pre-lockdown eye care services. The post-lockdown teleconsultation programme saw a relatively higher percentage of service utility among female (47.09% vs 44.71%), younger-age (31.33±19.45 vs 41.25±23.32 years) and higher-socioeconomic-status (32.21% vs 0.30%) patients compared to pre-lockdown on-site consultations. The most common indication for teleconsultation was red-eye (16.70%). While cornea and glaucoma clinics maintained most of the pre-lockdown services (30.42% and 29% respectively), the highest dropout was seen in optometric and vitreoretinal services supporting only 5.54% and 8.28% of pre-lockdown services, respectively. Conclusion Digital initiatives could partially maintain eye care services during the lockdown. Focused strategies to improve teleconsultation utilization are required during the pandemic and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3120877797,"Objective To examine the association of physical activities (PA) with diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression based on a 10-year follow-up of a large cohort of working-aged diabetic populations in Australia. Methods Nine thousand and eighteen working-aged diabetic patients were enrolled from the baseline of the 45 and Up Study from New South Wales, Australia. Self-reported PA collected by questionnaire at baseline in 2006 was graded into low (&lt;5 sessions/week), medium (≥5–14), and high (≥14) levels. Retinal photocoagulation (RPC) treatment during the follow-up period was used as a surrogate for DR progression and was tracked through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which was available from 2004 to 2016. Cox regression was used to estimate the association between PA and RPC incidence. Results In the fully adjusted model, higher PA level was significantly associated with a lower risk of RPC incident (Cox-regression, p-value for trend = 0.002; medium vs. low, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.61–0.98; high vs. low, HR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.36–0.84. In addition, gender, body mass index, insulin treatment, family history of diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease were significant effect modifiers for the association between PA and RPC. Conclusions Higher PA level was independently associated with a lower risk of DR progression among working-aged diabetic populations in this large cohort study."
https://openalex.org/W3120963484,"Background Influenza is a serious global healthcare issue that is associated with between 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a ‘serious game’ about influenza, on nursing student attitude, knowledge and uptake of the influenza vaccination. Methods 1306 undergraduate nursing students were invited, via email, to play an online game about influenza between September 2018 and March 2019. 430 nursing students accessed the game and completed an 8-item questionnaire measuring their attitudes to influenza between September 2018 and March 2019. In April 2019, 356 nursing students from this sample completed a follow-up 2-item questionnaire about their uptake of the influenza vaccination. A larger separate 40-item knowledge questionnaire was completed by a year one cohort of 124 nursing students in August 2018 prior to receiving access to the game and then after access to the game had ended, in April 2019. This sample was selected to determine the extent to which the game improved knowledge about influenza amongst a homogenous group. Results In the year preceding this study, 36.7% of the sample received an influenza vaccination. This increased to 47.8% after accessing to the game. Nursing students reported perceived improvements in their knowledge, intention to get the vaccination and intention to recommend the vaccination to their patients after playing the game. Nursing students who completed the 40-item pre- and post-knowledge questionnaire scored an average of 68.6% before receiving access to the game and 85.2% after. Using Paired T-Tests statistical analysis, it was determined that this 16.6% increase was highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The research highlights that the influenza game can improve knowledge and intention to become vaccinated. This study suggests that improvement in influenza knowledge is likely to encourage more nursing students to receive the influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3120495970,"To describe the patient population, priority diseases and outcomes in newborns admitted <48 hours old to neonatal units in both Kenya and Nigeria.In a network of seven secondary and tertiary level neonatal units in Nigeria and Kenya, we captured anonymised data on all admissions <48 hours of age over a 6-month period.2280 newborns were admitted. Mean birthweight was 2.3 kg (SD 0.9); 57.0% (1214/2128) infants were low birthweight (LBW; <2.5kg) and 22.6% (480/2128) were very LBW (VLBW; <1.5 kg). Median gestation was 36 weeks (interquartile range 32, 39) and 21.6% (483/2236) infants were very preterm (gestation <32 weeks). The most common morbidities were jaundice (987/2262, 43.6%), suspected sepsis (955/2280, 41.9%), respiratory conditions (817/2280, 35.8%) and birth asphyxia (547/2280, 24.0%). 18.7% (423/2262) newborns died; mortality was very high amongst VLBW (222/472, 47%) and very preterm infants (197/483, 40.8%). Factors independently associated with mortality were gestation <28 weeks (adjusted odds ratio 11.58; 95% confidence interval 4.73-28.39), VLBW (6.92; 4.06-11.79), congenital anomaly (4.93; 2.42-10.05), abdominal condition (2.86; 1.40-5.83), birth asphyxia (2.44; 1.52-3.92), respiratory condition (1.46; 1.08-2.28) and maternal antibiotics within 24 hours before or after birth (1.91; 1.28-2.85). Mortality was reduced if mothers received a partial (0.51; 0.28-0.93) or full treatment course (0.44; 0.21-0.92) of dexamethasone before preterm delivery.Greater efforts are needed to address the very high burden of illnesses and mortality in hospitalized newborns in sub-Saharan Africa. Interventions need to address priority issues during pregnancy and delivery as well as in the newborn."
https://openalex.org/W3120666667,"This study aimed to identify and compare major areas of met and unmet needs reported by 455 homeless or recently housed individuals recruited from emergency shelters, temporary housing, and permanent housing in Quebec (Canada). Mixed methods, guided by the Maslow framework, were used. Basic needs were the strongest needs category identified, followed by health and social services (an emergent category), and safety; very few participants expressed needs in the higher-order categories of love and belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization. The only significant differences between the three housing groups occurred in basic needs met, which favored permanent housing residents. Safety was the only category where individuals reported more unmet than met needs. The study results suggested that increased overall access to and continuity of care with family physicians, MD or SUD clinicians and community organizations for social integration should be provided to help better these individuals. Case management, stigma prevention, supported employment programs, peer support and day centers should particularly be more widely implemented as interventions that may promote a higher incidence of met needs in specific needs categories."
https://openalex.org/W3118517761,"The main goal of the current paper is to contribute to the existing literature of probability distributions. In this paper, a new probability distribution is generated by using the Alpha Power Family of distributions with the aim to model the data with non-monotonic failure rates and provides a better fit. The proposed distribution is called Alpha Power Exponentiated Inverse Rayleigh or in short APEIR distribution. Various statistical properties have been investigated including they are the order statistics, moments, residual life function, mean waiting time, quantiles, entropy, and stress-strength parameter. To estimate the parameters of the proposed distribution, the maximum likelihood method is employed. It has been proved theoretically that the proposed distribution provides a better fit to the data with monotonic as well as non-monotonic hazard rate shapes. Moreover, two real data sets are used to evaluate the significance and flexibility of the proposed distribution as compared to other probability distributions."
https://openalex.org/W3120184236,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease representing a serious unmet medical need. The disease is associated with the loss of self-tolerance and exaggerated B cell activation, resulting in autoantibody production and the formation of immune complexes that accumulate in the kidney, causing glomerulonephritis. TLR7, an important mediator of the innate immune response, drives the expression of type-1 interferon (IFN), which leads to expression of type-1 IFN induced genes and aggravates lupus pathology. Because the lysosomal peptide symporter slc15a4 is critically required for type-1 interferon production by pDC, and for certain B cell functions in response to TLR7 and TLR9 signals, we considered it as a potential target for pharmacological intervention in SLE. We deleted the slc15a4 gene in C57BL/6, NZB, and NZW mice and found that pristane-challenged slc15a4 -/- mice in the C57BL/6 background and lupus prone slc15a4 -/- NZB/W F1 mice were both completely protected from lupus like disease. In the NZB/W F1 model, protection persisted even when disease development was accelerated with an adenovirus encoding IFNα, emphasizing a broad role of slc15a4 in disease initiation. Our results establish a non-redundant function of slc15a4 in regulating both innate and adaptive components of the immune response in SLE pathobiology and suggest that it may be an attractive drug target."
https://openalex.org/W3120214960,"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most severe case of diabetic retinopathy that can cause visual impairment. This study aimed to reveal the factors correlated with better postoperative visual acuity after a long follow-up in patients who underwent vitrectomy for PDR. We retrospectively analyzed the data set including systemic findings, ocular findings, and surgical factors from registered patients who could be completely followed up for 2 or 4 years after vitrectomy. We ultimately enrolled 128 eyes from 100 patients who underwent vitrectomy for PDR between January 2008 and September 2012 and were followed up for &gt;2 years. Among them, 91 eyes from 70 patients could be followed up for 4 years. Factors related to the postoperative visual acuity of ≥20/40 and ≥20/30 after 2 and 4 years were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Better postoperative visual acuity correlated with the following factors: no rubeosis iridis ([≥20/40 at 2 years; odds ratio {OR}, 0.068; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.012–0.39; P = 0.003], [≥20/30 at 2 years; OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01–0.40; P = 0.03], [≥20/30 at 4 years; OR, 0.078; 95% CI, 0.006–0.96; P = 0.04]), no fibrovascular membrane [(≥20/40 at 2 years; OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.061–0.81; P = 0.02), (≥20/40 at 4 years; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–0.94; P = 0.04), (≥20/30 at 4 years; OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04–0.52; P = 0.004)], existing vitreous hemorrhage (≥20/30 at 2 years; OR, 9.55; 95% CI, 1.03–95.27; P = 0.04), and no reoperation ([≥20/40 at 4 years; OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03–0.78; P = 0.02], [≥20/30 at 4 years; OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.07–0.54; P = 0.01]). Treatment provision before disease severity and treatment without complications were associated with good postoperative visual acuity."
https://openalex.org/W3121048865,"Purpose Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) evaluate clinical reasoning, communication skills, and interpersonal behavior during medical education. In France, clinical training has long relied on bedside clinical practice in academic hospitals. The need for a simulated teaching environment has recently emerged, due to the increasing number of students admitted to medical schools, and the necessity of objectively evaluating practical skills. This study aimed at investigating the relationships between OSCE grades and current evaluation modalities. Methods Three-hundred seventy-nine 4 th -year students of University-of-Paris Medical School participated to the first large-scale OSCE at this institution, consisting in three OSCE stations (OSCE#1–3). OSCE#1 and #2 focused on cardiovascular clinical skills and competence, whereas OSCE#3 focused on relational skills while providing explanations before planned cholecystectomy. We investigated correlations of OSCE grades with multiple choice (MCQ)-based written examinations and evaluations of clinical skills and behavior (during hospital traineeships); OSCE grade distribution; and the impact of integrating OSCE grades into the current evaluation in terms of student ranking. Results The competence-oriented OSCE#1 and OSCE#2 grades correlated only with MCQ grades ( r = 0.19, P &lt;0.001) or traineeship skill grades ( r = 0.17, P = 0.001), respectively, and not with traineeship behavior grades ( P &gt;0.75). Conversely, the behavior-oriented OSCE#3 grades correlated with traineeship skill and behavior grades ( r = 0.19, P &lt;0.001, and r = 0.12, P = 0.032), but not with MCQ grades ( P = 0.09). The dispersion of OSCE grades was wider than for MCQ examinations ( P &lt;0.001). When OSCE grades were integrated to the final fourth-year grade with an incremental 10%, 20% or 40% coefficient, an increasing proportion of the 379 students had a ranking variation by ±50 ranks ( P &lt;0.001). This ranking change mainly affected students among the mid-50% of ranking. Conclusion This large-scale French experience showed that OSCE designed to assess a combination of clinical competence and behavioral skills, increases the discriminatory capacity of current evaluations modalities in French medical schools."
https://openalex.org/W3119184708,"The toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is the most conserved important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) often stimulated by bacterial flagellins and plays a major role in the first-line defense against invading pathogenic bacteria and in immune homeostasis. Experimental crystallographic studies have shown that the extracellular domain (ECD) of TLR5 recognizes flagellin of bacteria and functions as a homodimer in model organism zebrafish. However, no structural information is available on TLR5 functionality in the major carp Cirrhinus mrigala (mrigala) and its interaction with bacterial flagellins. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to unravel the structural basis of TLR5-flagellin recognition in mrigala using structural homodimeric TLR5-flagellin complex of zebrafish as reference. Integrative structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore the structural and mechanistic details of TLR5 recognition. Results from structural snapshots of MD simulation revealed that TLR5 consistently formed close interactions with the three helices of the D1 domain in flagellin on its lateral side mediated by several conserved amino acids. Results from the intermolecular contact analysis perfectly substantiate with the findings of per residue-free energy decomposition analysis. The differential recognition mediated by flagellin to TLR5 in mrigala involves charged residues at the interface of binding as compared to the zebrafish complex. Overall our results shows TLR5 of mrigala involved in innate immunity specifically recognized a conserved site on flagellin which advocates the scientific community to explore host-specific differences in receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W3120946254,"Many species show rhythmicity in activity, from the timing of flowering in plants to that of foraging behavior in animals. The free-running periods and amplitude (sometimes called strength or power) of circadian rhythms are often used as indicators of biological clocks. Many reports have shown that these traits are highly geographically variable, and interestingly, they often show latitudinal or longitudinal clines. In many cases, the higher the latitude is, the longer the free-running circadian period (i.e., period of rhythm) in insects and plants. However, reports of positive correlations between latitude or longitude and circadian rhythm traits, including free-running periods, the power of the rhythm and locomotor activity, are limited to certain taxonomic groups. Therefore, we collected a cosmopolitan stored-product pest species, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum , in various parts of Japan and examined its rhythm traits, including the power and period of the rhythm, which were calculated from locomotor activity. The analysis revealed that the power was significantly lower for beetles collected in northern areas than southern areas in Japan. However, it is worth noting that the period of circadian rhythm did not show any clines; specifically, it did not vary among the sampling sites, despite the very large sample size (n = 1585). We discuss why these cline trends were observed in T . castaneum ."
https://openalex.org/W3118737502,"Objectives To investigate three-dimensional morphological variation of the occipital bone between sexes and among populations, to determine how ancestry, sex and size account for occipital shape variation and to describe the exact forms by which the differences are expressed. Methods CT data for 214 modern crania of Asian, African and European ancestry were compared using 3D geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics, including principal component analysis, Hotelling’s T 2 test, multivariate regression, ANOVA, and MANCOVA. Results Sex differences in average occipital morphology are only observed in Europeans, with males exhibiting a pronounced inion. Significant ancestral differences are observed among all samples and are shared by males and females. Asian and African crania have smaller biasterionic breadths and flatter clivus angles compared to Europeans. Asian and European crania are similar in their nuchal and occipital plane proportions, nuchal and occipital angles, and lower inion positions compared to Africans. Centroid size significantly differs between sexes and among populations. The overall allometry, while significant, explains little of the shape variation. Larger occipital bones were associated with a more curved occipital plane, a pronounced inion, a narrower biasterionic breadth, a more flexed clivus, and a lower and relatively smaller foramen magnum. Conclusions Although significant shape differences were observed among populations, it is not recommended to use occipital morphology in sex or population estimation as both factors explained little of the observed variance. Other factors, relating to function and the environment, are suggested to be greater contributors to occipital variation. For the same reason, it is also not recommended to use the occiput in phylogenetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3119756313,"Attachment anxiety has been consistently linked with increased vulnerability to depression, and hyperactivating emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination) have been shown to mediate this relationship. Investigations of mediators of the attachment avoidance to depression relationship have yielded inconsistent findings, and the nature of this relationship remains to be clarified. There is evidence to suggest that the constructs of thought suppression and self-compassion are associated with attachment avoidance and also with depressive symptomology. In order to further clarify the nature of this relationship, the present study tested a serial mediation model, whereby it was hypothesised that thought suppression and self-compassion were serial mediators of the relationship between attachment avoidance and depression. One hundred and forty-eight participants completed an online composite questionnaire consisting of the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire, the White Bear Suppression Inventory, the Self-Compassion Scale, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. Initial results supported the hypothesised serial mediation model (Model A); that is, higher attachment avoidance predicted higher thought suppression, higher thought suppression predicted lower levels of self-compassion and lower levels of self-compassion predicted higher depression. However, this model was no longer significant following the inclusion of attachment anxiety as a covariate within the post-hoc analysis. A second, post-hoc serial mediation model was tested (Model B), with the only difference being that attachment anxiety replaced attachment avoidance as the independent variable. This model was significant, with and without the inclusion of attachment avoidance as a covariate. The study provides evidence for the central role of thought suppression and self-compassion as mechanisms underlying the relationship between insecure attachment and depression, and indicates that these factors operate in opposing directions. The findings are discussed in terms of explicating some of the processes through which insecure attachment confers vulnerability to depression. The implications of the observed degree of shared variance between the two attachment dimensions suggests these constructs may be more appropriately considered overlapping, rather than orthogonal."
https://openalex.org/W3119193584,"Pueraria tuberosa (Roxb. ex Willd.) DC., known as Indian Kudzu belongs to family Fabaceae and it is solicited as “Rasayana” drugs in Ayurveda. In the present study, we analyzed the efficacy of an ethyl acetate fraction from the tuber extract of Pueraria tuberosa (fraction rich in antioxidant compounds, FRAC) against menopausal osteoporosis, and breast and ovarian cancer cells. The FRAC from Pueraria tuberosa was characterized for its phenolic composition (total phenolic and flavonoid amount). Antioxidant property ( in vitro assays) of the FRAC was also carried out followed by the analysis of the FRAC for its antiosteoporotic and anticancer potentials. The antiosteoporotic activity of FRAC was investigated in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats. The cytotoxicity effect was determined in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the FRAC was performed to determine its various phytoconstituents. Docking analysis was performed to verify the interaction of bioactive molecules with estrogen receptors (ERs). The FRAC significantly improved various biomechanical and biochemical parameters in a dose-dependent manner in the ovariectomized rats. FRAC also controlled the increased body weight and decreased uterus weight following ovariectomy in rats. Histopathology of the femur demonstrated the restoration of typical bone structure and trabecular width in ovariectomized animals after treatment with FRAC and raloxifene. The FRAC also exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in the breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cells. Furthermore, genistein and daidzein exhibited a high affinity towards both estrogen receptors (α and β) in the docking study revealing the probable mechanism of the antiosteoporotic activity. GC/MS analysis confirmed the presence of other bioactive molecules such as stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, and stigmasta-3,5-dien-7-one. The FRAC from Pueraria tuberosa has potential for treatment of menopausal osteoporosis. Also, the FRAC possesses anticancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W3120579896,"Surveys are commonly used to quantify public opinions of climate change and to inform sustainability policies. However, conducting large-scale population-based surveys is often a difficult task due to time and resource constraints. This paper outlines a machine learning framework—grounded in statistical learning theory and natural language processing—to augment climate change opinion surveys with social media data. The proposed framework maps social media discourse to climate opinion surveys, allowing for discerning the regionally distinct topics and themes that contribute to climate opinions. The analysis reveals significant regional variation in the emergent social media topics associated with climate opinions. Furthermore, significant correlation is identified between social media discourse and climate attitude. However, the dependencies between topic discussion and climate opinion are not always intuitive and often require augmenting the analysis with a topic’s most frequent n-grams and most representative tweets to effectively interpret the relationship. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of how these results can be used in the policy framing process to quickly and effectively understand constituents’ opinions on critical issues."
https://openalex.org/W3121021234,"Objective We aimed to study fatigue and sleep in registrars working 12-hour rotating shifts in our tertiary neonatal intensive unit. Methods and participants This study involved neonatal registrar’s working day (08:00–21:00) and night (20:30–08:30) shifts. Participants maintained a sleep diary, answered a self-reported sleepiness questionnaire assessing subjective sleepiness, and performed a 10-minute psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) at the start and end of each shift. Primary outcomes: (1) Fatigue at the (i) “start vs end” of day and night shifts, (ii) end of the “day vs night” shifts, and (iii) end of “first vs last shift” in block of day and night shifts. (2) Duration and quality of sleep before the “day vs night” shifts. Mean reaction time (RTM), relative coefficient of variation (RTCV), and lapses (reaction time &gt; 500ms) were used as measures of fatigue on PVT. Secondary outcome: Subjective sleepiness (self-reported sleepiness questionnaire) at the ‘start vs end” of day and night shifts. Results Fifteen registrars completed the study. Acuity was comparable for all shifts. (1) Psychomotor responses were impaired at the end vs start of day shifts [RTM (p = 0.014), lapses (p = 0.001)], end vs start of night shifts [RTM (p = 0.007), RTCV (p = 0.003), lapses (p&lt;0.001)] and end of night vs day shifts [RTM (p = 0.007), RTCV (p = 0.046), lapses (p = 0.001)]. Only lapses were significantly increased at the end of the last (p = 0.013) vs first shift (p = 0.009) in a block of day and night shifts. (2) Duration of sleep before the night (p = 0.019) and consecutive night shifts was decreased significantly (p = 0.034). Subjective sleepiness worsened after day (p = 0.014) and night shifts (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Fatigue worsened after the 12-hour day and night shifts with a greater change after night shifts. Lapses increased after block of day and night shifts. Sleep was decreased before night shifts. Our findings need to be confirmed in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W3121093788,"Background Anemia is a worldwide public health problem and also associated with Helicobacter pylori (H . pylori) infection. Determining the association of anemia with H . pylori infection is important to develop evidence-based decision and intervention strategies, which is not well known in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to determine the association between anemia and H . pylori infection among adult dyspeptic patients attending Wachemo University Nigist Eleni Mohammad Memorial Referral Hospital in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to April 2019 involving 362 consecutive adult dyspeptic patients who came to the hospital during the study period. Socio-demographic, clinical and other related data were collected by structured questionnaires. Four milliliters of the venous blood sample was collected for hematological parameters analysis and blood film preparation. A stool sample was collected to detect H . pylori antigen and intestinal parasites. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 21. Logistic regression analyses were performed and p-value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The overall prevalence of anemia among dyspeptic patients was 24.3% (95%CI: 19.9–28.7). Among H . pylori infected participants 29.2% were anemic, of which 69.2% had mild anemia and 63.5% had normocytic normochromic anemia. Rural residence (AOR: 1.9, 95%CI: 1.1–3.3), H . pylori infection (AOR: 1.77, 95%CI: 1.05–2.98) and intestinal parasitic infection (AOR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.14–4.03) were significantly associated with anemia. Conclusion The prevalence of anemia in this study indicated that it is a moderate public health problem. Rural residence, H . pylori and intestinal parasitic infection were significantly associated with anemia. The findings of this study should be taken into account for the prevention and control of anemia among dyspeptic adults."
https://openalex.org/W3120104806,"Background The U.S. has experienced an unprecedented number of orders to shelter in place throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities; and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of the nation’s first shelter-in-place orders (SIPO) among individuals living in the seven affected counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. Methods We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 –April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area versus elsewhere in the U.S. Results In this non-representative sample, the percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0). Respondents also reported increased difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer, medications, and in particular respondents reported increased difficulty obtaining food in the Bay Area (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.3) and elsewhere (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 9.7). We found limited evidence that level of concern regarding the COVID-19 crisis changed following the announcement. Conclusion This study characterizes early changes in attitudes, behaviors, and difficulties. As states and localities implement, rollback, and reinstate shelter-in-place orders, ongoing efforts to more fully examine the social, economic, and health impacts of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations, are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3118463796,"Incidental radiation exposure to the heart during lung cancer radiotherapy is associated with radiation-induced heart disease and increased rates of mortality. By considering the respiratory-induced motion of the heart it is possible to create a radiotherapy plan that results in a lower overall cardiac dose. This approach is challenging using current clinical practices: manual contouring of the heart is time consuming, and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of our previously developed, atlas-based, automatic heart segmentation tool to delineate the heart in four-dimensional x-ray computed tomography (4D-CT) images. We used a dataset comprising 19 patients receiving radiotherapy for lung cancer, with 4D-CT imaging acquired at 10 respiratory phases and with a maximum intensity projection image generated from these. For each patient, one of four experienced radiation oncologists contoured the heart on each respiratory phase image and the maximum intensity image. Automatic segmentation of the heart on these same patient image sets was achieved using a leave-one-out approach, where for each patient the remaining 18 were used as an atlas set. The consistency of the automatic segmentation relative to manual contouring was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean absolute surface-to-surface distance (MASD). The DSC and MASD are comparable to inter-observer variability in clinically acceptable whole heart delineations (average DSC &gt; 0.93 and average MASD &lt; 2.0 mm in all the respiratory phases). The comparison between automatic and manual delineations on the maximum intensity images produced an overall mean DSC of 0.929 and a mean MASD of 2.07 mm. The automatic, atlas-based segmentation tool produces clinically consistent and robust heart delineations and is easy to implement in the routine care of lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3118473217,"Cleaning covariance matrices is a highly non-trivial problem, yet of central importance in the statistical inference of dependence between objects. We propose here a probabilistic hierarchical clustering method, named Bootstrapped Average Hierarchical Clustering (BAHC), that is particularly effective in the high-dimensional case, i.e., when there are more objects than features. When applied to DNA microarray, our method yields distinct hierarchical structures that cannot be accounted for by usual hierarchical clustering. We then use global minimum-variance risk management to test our method and find that BAHC leads to significantly smaller realized risk compared to state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear filtering methods in the high-dimensional case. Spectral decomposition shows that BAHC better captures the persistence of the dependence structure between asset price returns in the calibration and the test periods."
https://openalex.org/W3119822494,"The Na + /K + ATPase is a key regulator of the hepatocytes ionic homeostasis, which when altered may lead to many liver disorders. We demonstrated recently, a significant stimulation of the Na + /K + ATPase in HepG2 cells treated with the S1P analogue FTY 720P, that was mediated through PGE2. The mechanism by which the prostaglandin exerts its effect was not investigated, and is the focus of this work. The type of receptors involved was determined using pharmacological inhibitors, while western blot analysis, fluorescence imaging of GFP-tagged Na + /K + ATPase, and time-lapse imaging on live cells were used to detect changes in membrane abundance of the Na + /K + ATPase. The activity of the ATPase was assayed by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated in the presence and absence of ouabain. The enhanced activity of the ATPase was not observed when EP4 receptors were blocked but still appeared in presence inhibitors of EP1, EP2 and EP3 receptors. The involvement of EP4 was confirmed by the stimulation observed with EP4 agonist. The stimulatory effect of PGE2 did not appear in presence of Rp-cAMP, an inhibitor of PKA, and was imitated by db-cAMP, a PKA activator. Chelating intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM abrogated the effect of db-cAMP as well as that of PGE2, but PGE2 treatment in a calcium-free PBS medium did not, suggesting an involvement of intracellular calcium, that was confirmed by the results obtained with 2-APB treatment. Live cell imaging showed movement of GFP–Na+/K+ ATPase-positive vesicles to the membrane and increased abundance of the ATPase at the membrane after PGE2 treatment. It was concluded that PGE2 acts via EP4, PKA, and intracellular calcium."
https://openalex.org/W3119897858,"Nowadays, given the technological advance in CT imaging and increasing heterogeneity in characteristics of CT scanners, a number of CT scanners with different manufacturers/technologies are often installed in a hospital centre and used by various departments. In this phantom study, a comprehensive assessment of image quality of 5 scanners (from 3 manufacturers and with different models) for head CT imaging, as clinically used at a single hospital centre, was hence carried out. Helical and/or sequential acquisitions of the Catphan-504 phantom were performed, using the scanning protocols (CTDI vol range: 54.7–57.5 mGy) employed by the staff of various Radiology/Neuroradiology departments of our institution for routine head examinations. CT image quality for each scanner/acquisition protocol was assessed through noise level, noise power spectrum (NPS), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), modulation transfer function (MTF), low contrast detectability (LCD) and non-uniformity index analyses. Noise values ranged from 3.5 HU to 5.7 HU across scanners/acquisition protocols. NPS curves differed in terms of peak position (range: 0.21–0.30 mm -1 ). A substantial variation of CNR values with scanner/acquisition protocol was observed for different contrast inserts. The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean value) of CNR values across scanners/acquisition protocols was 18.3%, 31.4%, 34.2%, 30.4% and 30% for teflon, delrin, LDPE, polystyrene and acrylic insert, respectively. An appreciable difference in MTF curves across scanners/acquisition protocols was revealed, with a coefficient of variation of f 50% /f 10% of MTF curves across scanners/acquisition protocols of 10.1%/7.4%. A relevant difference in LCD performance of different scanners/acquisition protocols was found. The range of contrast threshold for a typical object size of 3 mm was 3.7–5.8 HU. Moreover, appreciable differences in terms of NUI values (range: 4.1%-8.3%) were found. The analysis of several quality indices showed a non-negligible variability in head CT imaging capabilities across different scanners/acquisition protocols. This highlights the importance of a physical in-depth characterization of image quality for each CT scanner as clinically used, in order to optimize CT imaging procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3119960062,"Introduction Adhesions are often considered to be an inevitable consequence of abdominal and pelvic surgery, jeopardizing the medium and long-term success of these procedures. Numerous strategies have been tested to reduce adhesion formation, however, to date, no surgical or medical therapeutic approaches have been successful in its prevention. This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Chitogel with Deferiprone and/or antibacterial Gallium Protoporphyrin in different concentrations in preventing adhesion formation after abdominal surgery. Materials and methods 112 adult (8–10 week old) male Wistar albino rats were subjected to midline laparotomy and caecal abrasion, with 48 rats having an additional enterotomy and suturing. Kaolin (0.005g/ml) was applied to further accelerate adhesion formation. The abrasion model rats were randomized to receive saline, Chitogel, or Chitogel plus Deferiprone (5, 10 or 20 mM), together with Gallium Protoporphyrin (250μg/mL). The abrasion with enterotomy rats were randomised to receive saline, Chitogel or Chitogel with Deferiprone (1 or 5 mM). At day 21, rats were euthanised, and adhesions graded macroscopically and microscopically; the tensile strength of the repaired caecum was determined by an investigator blinded to the treatment groups. Results Chitogel with Deferiprone 5 mM significantly reduced adhesion formation (p&lt;0.01) when pathologically assessed in a rat abrasion model. Chitogel with Deferiprone 5 mM and 1 mM also significantly reduced adhesions (p&lt;0.05) after abrasion with enterotomy. Def-Chitogel 1mM treatment did not weaken the enterotomy site with treated sites having significantly better tensile strength compared to control saline treated enterotomy rats. Conclusions Chitogel with Deferiprone 1 mM constitutes an effective preventative anti-adhesion barrier after abdominal surgery in a rat model. Moreover, this therapeutic combination of agents is safe and does not weaken the healing of the sutured enterotomy site."
https://openalex.org/W3121013595,"Predator recovery driven by single-species management approaches may lead to conservation conflicts between recovered predators and prey species of conservation concern. As part of an aggressive recovery plan, the Eastern Peregrine Falcon Recovery Team released (1975–1985) 307 captive-reared peregrine falcons ( Falco peregrinus ) and successfully established a breeding population within the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, a physiographic region with no historic breeding population and a critical spring staging area for migratory shorebirds. We examined the influence of resident falcons on the distribution of foraging red knots during spring migration. We conducted weekly aerial surveys (2006–2009) along the Virginia barrier islands during the spring staging period (25 April– 6 June) to map foraging red knots ( Calidris canutus ) and evaluated the influence of proximity (0–3, 3–6, &gt;6 km) of beaches to active peregrine falcon nests on knot density (birds/km). Accumulated use of beaches throughout the season by red knots was significantly influenced by proximity of beaches to active falcon nests such that mean density was more than 6 fold higher on beaches that were &gt;6 km compared to beaches that were only 0–3 km from active eyries. Whether or not an eyrie was used in a given year had a significant influence on the use of associated close (0–3 km) beaches. From 6.5 to 64 fold more knots used beaches when associated eyries were not active compared to when they were active depending on the specific site. Historically, red knots and other migratory shorebirds would have enjoyed a peregrine-free zone within this critical staging site. The establishment of a dense breeding population of falcons within the area represents a new hazard for the knot population."
https://openalex.org/W3118427811,"Background Outbreaks of infectious diseases would cause great losses to the human society. Source identification in networks has drawn considerable interest in order to understand and control the infectious disease propagation processes. Unsatisfactory accuracy and high time complexity are major obstacles to practical applications under various real-world situations for existing source identification algorithms. Methods This study attempts to measure the possibility for nodes to become the infection source through label ranking. A unified Label Ranking framework for source identification with complete observation and snapshot is proposed. Firstly, a basic label ranking algorithm with complete observation of the network considering both infected and uninfected nodes is designed. Our inferred infection source node with the highest label ranking tends to have more infected nodes surrounding it, which makes it likely to be in the center of infection subgraph and far from the uninfected frontier. A two-stage algorithm for source identification via semi-supervised learning and label ranking is further proposed to address the source identification issue with snapshot. Results Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world network datasets. It turns out that the proposed label ranking algorithms are capable of identifying the propagation source under different situations fairly accurately with acceptable computational complexity without knowing the underlying model of infection propagation. Conclusions The effectiveness and efficiency of the label ranking algorithms proposed in this study make them be of practical value for infection source identification."
https://openalex.org/W3119665503,"Inconel 718 alloy is widely used in aero-engines and high-temperature environments. However, residual stress caused by processing and molding leads to an uneven distribution of internal pressure, which reduces the reliability of service process. Therefore, numerical simulation of the nanoindentation process was applied to evaluate the effect of residual stress on the machined subsurface of Inconel 718. A gradient material model of Inconel 718 was established in ABAQUS finite element software. Mechanical properties based on nanoindentation testing showed an influence of residual stress in combination with indenter geometry. The orthogonal experimental results show that under diverse residual stress states, the indenter’s geometry can affect the pile-up of the material surface after nanoindentation and significantly influence the test results. With increases in piling-up, the error caused by residual stress on the characterization of the mechanical properties of the hardened layer increases. Through the establishment of a numerical model, the influence of residual stress can be predicted within nanoindentation depths of 300 nm."
https://openalex.org/W3120795617,"The resveratrol-producing rice ( Oryza sativa L.) inbred lines, Iksan 515 (I.515) and Iksan 526 (I.526), developed by the expression of the groundnut ( Arachis hypogaea ) resveratrol synthase 3 ( AhRS3 ) gene in the japonica rice cultivar Dongjin, accumulated both resveratrol and its glucoside, piceid, in seeds. Here, we investigated the effect of the AhRS3 transgene on the expression of endogenous piceid biosynthesis genes ( UGTs ) in the developing seeds of the resveratrol-producing rice inbred lines. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis revealed that I.526 accumulates significantly higher resveratrol and piceid in seeds than those in I.515 seeds and, in I.526 seeds, the biosynthesis of resveratrol and piceid reached peak levels at 41 days after heading (DAH) and 20 DAH, respectively. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression patterns of UGT genes differed significantly between the 20 DAH seeds of I.526 and those of Dongjin. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses confirmed the data from RNA-seq analysis in seeds of Dongjin, I.515 and I.526, respectively, at 9 DAH, and in seeds of Dongjin and I.526, respectively, at 20 DAH. A total of 245 UGT s, classified into 31 UGT families, showed differential expression between Dongjin and I.526 seeds at 20 DAH. Of these, 43 UGT s showed more than 2-fold higher expression in I.526 seeds than in Dongjin seeds. In addition, the expression of resveratrol biosynthesis genes ( PAL , C4H and 4CL ) was also differentially expressed between Dongjin and I.526 developing seeds. Collectively, these data suggest that AhRS3 altered the expression pattern of UGT genes, and PAL , C4H and 4CL in developing rice seeds."
https://openalex.org/W3121026654,"Rac proteins, members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, have been implicated in transducing a number of signals for various biological mechanisms, including cell cytoskeleton organization, transcription, proliferation, migration, and cancer cell motility. Among human cancers, Rac proteins are highly activated by either overexpression of the genes, up-regulation of the protein, or by mutations that allow the protein to elude normal regulatory signaling pathways. Rac proteins are involved in controlling cell survival and apoptosis. The effects of Rac inhibition by the Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor NSC23766 or by transfection of dominant negative Rac (Rac-DN) were examined on three human-derived oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines that exhibit different malignancy grades, OSC-20 (grade 3), OSC-19 (grade 4C), and HOC313 (grade 4D). Upon suppression of Rac, OSC-19 and HOC313 cells showed significant decreases in Rac activity and resulted in condensation of the nuclei and up-regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, OSC-20 cells showed only a slight decrease in Rac activity, which resulted in slight activation of JNK and no change in the nuclei. Fibroblasts treated with NSC23766 also showed only a slight decrease in Rac activity with no change in the nuclei or JNK activity. Our results indicated that apoptosis elicited by the inhibition of Rac depended on the extent of decreased Rac activity and the malignant state of the squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, activation of JNK strongly correlated with apoptosis. Rac inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3121126285,"Introduction Maintaining virologic suppression of children and adolescents on ART in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa is challenging. We explored switching drug regimens to protease inhibitor (PI) based treatment and reducing nevirapine and zidovudine use in a differentiated community service delivery model in rural Zimbabwe. Methods From 2016 through 2018, we followed 306 children and adolescents on ART in Hurungwe, Zimbabwe at Chidamoyo Christian Hospital, which provides compact ART regimens at 8 dispersed rural community outreach sites. Viral load testing was performed (2016) by Roche and at follow-up (2018) by a point of care viral load assay. Virologic failure was defined as viral load ≥1,000 copies/ml. A logistic regression model which included demographics, treatment regimens and caregiver’s characteristics was used to assess risks for virologic failure and loss to follow-up (LTFU). Results At baseline in 2016, 296 of 306 children and adolescents (97%) were on first-line ART, and only 10 were receiving a PI-based regimen. The median age was 12 years (IQR 8–15) and 55% were female. Two hundred and nine (68%) had viral load suppression (&lt;1,000 copies/ml) and 97(32%) were unsuppressed (viral load ≥1000). At follow-up in 2018, 42/306 (14%) were either transferred 23 (7%) or LTFU 17 (6%) and 2 had died. In 2018, of the 264 retained in care, 107/264 (41%), had been switched to second-line, ritonavir-boosted PI with abacavir as a new nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Overall viral load suppression increased from 68% in 2016 to 81% in 2018 (P&lt;0.001). Conclusion Viral load testing, and switching to second-line, ritonavir-boosted PI with abacavir significantly increased virologic suppression among HIV-infected children and adolescents in rural Zimbabwe."
https://openalex.org/W3118256819,"Several sinogram inpainting based metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods have been proposed to reduce metal artifact in CT imaging. The sinogram inpainting method treats metal trace regions as missing data and estimates the missing information. However, a general assumption with these methods is that data truncation does not occur and that all metal objects still reside within the field-of-view (FOV). These assumptions are usually violated when the FOV is smaller than the object. Thus, existing inpainting based MAR methods are not effective. In this paper, we propose a new MAR method to effectively reduce metal artifact in the presence of data truncation. The main principle of the proposed method involves using a newly synthesized sinogram instead of the originally measured sinogram. The initial reconstruction step involves obtaining a small FOV image with the truncation artifact removed. The final step is to conduct sinogram inpainting based MAR methods, i.e., linear and normalized MAR methods, on the synthesized sinogram from the previous step. The proposed method was verified for extended cardiac-torso simulations, clinical data, and experimental data, and its performance was quantitatively compared with those of previous methods (i.e., linear and normalized MAR methods directly applied to the originally measured sinogram data). The effectiveness of the proposed method was further demonstrated by reducing the residual metal artifact that were present in the reconstructed images obtained using the previous method."
https://openalex.org/W3120207073,"High accuracy in estimating energy expenditure is essential for enhancing sports performance. The resting metabolic rate (RMR), as a primary component of total energy expenditure (TEE), is commonly estimated using predictive equations. However, these references may not be applicable to adolescent athletes. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to analyse the differences between predicted RMR in relation to energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry (IC) among 45 Brazilian male adolescent football athletes. Indirect calorimetry (IC) and anthropometric (bioimpedance) measurements were recorded at a single visit to the laboratory after fasting overnight. The mean age was 15.6 ± 1.14 years, body mass was 63.05 ± 7.8 kg, and height was 172 ± 7.5 cm. The RMR values predicted by equations proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (United Nations), Henry and Rees (HR), Harris Benedict (HB), and Cunningham (CUN) were compared with IC RMR values, by correlation analysis. The FAO and HR predictive equations yielded different values from IC (IC: 1716.26 ± 202.58, HR: 1864.87 ± 147.78, FAO: 1854.28 ± 130.19, p = 0.001). A moderate correlation of 0.504 was found between the results of HB and IC. In the survival-agreement model, the CUN equation showed low disagreement with the IC RMR, with error values between 200 and 300 kcal/day. The results showed that HB and CUN yielded similar values as IC, with the CUN equation showing low disagreement with IC; hence, adolescent athletes should undergo evaluation with precise laboratory methods to ensure that accurate information about RMR is recorded."
https://openalex.org/W3118345804,"The knowledge on the deposition and retention of the viral particle of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract during the very initial intake from the ambient air is of prime importance to understand the infectious process and COVID-19 initial symptoms. We propose to use a modified version of a widely tested lung deposition model developed by the ICRP, in the context of the ICRP Publication 66, that provides deposition patterns of microparticles in different lung compartments. In the model, we mimicked the ""environmental decay"" of the virus, determined by controlled experiments related to normal speeches, by the radionuclide 11 C that presents comparable decay rates. Our results confirm clinical observations on the high virus retentions observed in the extrathoracic region and the lesser fraction on the alveolar section (in the order of 5), which may shed light on physiopathology of clinical events as well on the minimal inoculum required to establish infection."
https://openalex.org/W3119942618,"Random effects regression models are routinely used for clustered data in etiological and intervention research. However, in prediction models, the random effects are either neglected or conventionally substituted with zero for new clusters after model development. In this study, we applied a Bayesian prediction modelling method to the subclinical ketosis data previously collected by Van der Drift et al. (2012). Using a dataset of 118 randomly selected Dutch dairy farms participating in a regular milk recording system, the authors proposed a prediction model with milk measures as well as available test-day information as predictors for the diagnosis of subclinical ketosis in dairy cows. While their original model included random effects to correct for the clustering, the random effect term was removed for their final prediction model. With the Bayesian prediction modelling approach, we first used non-informative priors for the random effects for model development as well as for prediction. This approach was evaluated by comparing it to the original frequentist model. In addition, herd level expert opinion was elicited from a bovine health specialist using three different scales of precision and incorporated in the prediction as informative priors for the random effects, resulting in three more Bayesian prediction models. Results showed that the Bayesian approach could naturally take the clustering structure of clusters into account by keeping the random effects in the prediction model. Expert opinion could be explicitly combined with individual level data for prediction. However in this dataset, when elicited expert opinion was incorporated, little improvement was seen at the individual level as well as at the herd level. When the prediction models were applied to the 118 herds, at the individual cow level, with the original frequentist approach we obtained a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 83.8% at the optimal cutoff, while with the three Bayesian models with elicited expert opinion, we obtained sensitivities ranged from 78.7% to 84.6% and specificities ranged from 75.0% to 83.6%. At the herd level, 30 out of 118 within herd prevalences were correctly predicted by the original frequentist approach, and 31 to 44 herds were correctly predicted by the three Bayesian models with elicited expert opinion. Further investigation in expert opinion and distributional assumption for the random effects was carried out and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3120947074,"Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were measured on a comprehensive sampling of feathers from two spring Hooded Warblers ( Setophaga citrina ) in Texas to evaluate isotopic variability between feathers and during molt. Isotopic homogeneity within each bird was found across all four isotopic systems, supporting the hypothesis that molt in these neotropical migrants is fully completed on the breeding grounds. This homogeneity suggests that the isotopic composition of a single feather is may be representative of the whole songbird. However, each bird was found to have one or two outlier feathers, which could signify regrowth of lost feathers after prebasic molt."
https://openalex.org/W3118327144,"Background Pre-lacteal feeding persists in low and middle-income countries as deep-rooted nutritional malpractice. It imposes significant negative consequences on neonatal health, including increased risk of illness and mortality. Different studies revealed that pre-lacteal feeding practice is decreased over time. Even though different studies are done on the prevalence and determinants of pre-lacteal feeding practice, up to our knowledge, the spatial distribution and the determinants of the change in pre-lacteal feeding practice over time are not researched. Objective To assess the spatial distribution and determinants of the change in pre-lacteal feeding practice over time in Ethiopia. Methods We used the Ethiopian demographic and health surveys (EDHSs) data. For this study, a total weighted sample of 14672 (5789 from EDHS 2005, 4510 from EDHS 2011, and 4373 from EDHS 2016) reproductive-age women who gave birth within two years preceding the respective surveys and whoever breastfeed were used. The logit-based multivariate decomposition analysis was used to identify factors that contributed to the decrease in pre-lacteal feeding practice over the last 10 years (from 2005 to 2016). Using the 2016 EDHS data, we also conducted a spatial analysis by using ArcGIS version 10.3 and SaTScan version 9.6 software to explore the spatial distribution and hotspot clusters of pre-lacteal feeding practice. Result Pre-lacteal feeding practice was decreased from 29% [95% Confidence interval (CI): 27.63–29.96%] in 2005 to 8% [95% CI: 7.72–8.83%] in 2016 with annual rate of reduction of 7.2%. The overall decomposition analysis showed that about 20.31% of the overall decrease in pre-lacteal feeding practice over the last 10 years was attributable to the difference in composition of women (endowment) across the surveys, while, the remaining 79.39% of the overall decrease was explained by the difference in the effect of characteristics (coefficient) across the surveys. In the endowment component, the difference in composition of residence, perception of distance from the health facility, maternal educational level, wealth status, occupation, ANC visit, place of delivery, the timing of breastfeeding initiation, and wanted last-child/pregnancy were found to be significant contributing factors for the decrease in pre-lacteal feeding practice. After controlling for the role of compositional changes, the difference in the effect of distance from the health facility, wealth status, occupation, antenatal care (ANC) visit, and wanted last-child/pregnancy across the surveys were significantly contributed to the observed decrease in pre-lacteal feeding practice. Regarding the spatial distribution, pre-lacteal feeding practice was non-random in Ethiopia in which the primary and secondary clusters’ of pre-lacteal feeding identified in Somalia and the Afar region respectively. Conclusion Pre-lacteal feeding practice has shown a significant decline over the 10-year period. Program interventions considering women with poor maternal health service utilization such as ANC visits, women with poor socioeconomic status, women with an unintended pregnancy, and women from remote areas especially at border areas such as Somali and Afar could decrease pre-lacteal feeding practice in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3119159575,"Methanol is often considered as a non-competitive substrate for methanogenic archaea, but an increasing number of sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRMs) have been reported to be capable of respiring with methanol as an electron donor. A better understanding of the fate of methanol in natural or artificial anaerobic systems thus requires knowledge of the methanol dissimilation by SRMs. In this study, we describe the growth kinetics and sulfur isotope effects of Desulfovibrio carbinolicus , a methanol-oxidizing sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium, together with its genome sequence and annotation. D . carbinolicus can grow with a series of alcohols from methanol to butanol. Compared to longer-chain alcohols, however, specific growth and respiration rates decrease by several fold with methanol as an electron donor. Larger sulfur isotope fractionation accompanies slowed growth kinetics, indicating low chemical potential at terminal reductive steps of respiration. In a medium containing both ethanol and methanol, D . carbinolicus does not consume methanol even after the cessation of growth on ethanol. Among the two known methanol dissimilatory systems, the genome of D . carbinolicus contains the genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase but lacks enzymes analogous to methanol methyltransferase. We analyzed the genomes of 52 additional species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that have been tested for methanol oxidation. There is no apparent relationship between phylogeny and methanol metabolizing capacity, but most gram-negative methanol oxidizers grow poorly, and none carry homologs for methyltransferase (mtaB). Although the amount of available data is limited, it is notable that more than half of the known gram-positive methanol oxidizers have both enzymatic systems, showing enhanced growth relative to the SRMs containing only alcohol dehydrogenase genes. Thus, physiological, genomic, and sulfur isotopic results suggest that D . carbinolicus and close relatives have the ability to metabolize methanol but likely play a limited role in methanol degradation in most natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W3119871676,"Background Qualitative strategies can uncover the relationship between the external realities of people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the barriers that are associated with disease self-management. Information from in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) can be used to devise psychological models that could potentially facilitate behaviour changes in people with T2D. We aim to identify salient factors that govern the external realities of people with T2D in relation to disease management. Methods A qualitative study was conducted at a regional primary care clinic in Malaysia using a Grounded Theory Approach. People with T2D were recruited through purposeful sampling to determine their living experiences with the disease. A total of 34 IDIs with 24 people with T2D and 10 health care professionals, followed by two FGDs with people with T2D, were conducted. Results Three major processes that arbitrate self-management practices include– 1) external reality, 2) internal reality, 3) mediators of behaviour. Within the context of external reality, three important sub-themes were identified—intrinsic background status, personal experience, and worldview. Lifestyle habits of persons with T2D play a central role in their disease management. Another common recurring concern is the issue of a low-quality food environment in the country. More importantly, individuals with T2D have a high degree of expectations for a more person-centered approach to their illness. Conclusions We identified modifiable and non-modifiable behavioural factors that influence the daily living environment of people with T2D. This information can be used to customize the management of T2D through targeted behavioural interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3120512743,"Reducing the water content of oily sludge is essential for the disposal of it. Despite conditioning and solid-liquid separation, the water content of oily sludge generally exceeds 65%. A large amount of this water exists in the form of emulsified and bound water, reducing the efficiency of water removal during the natural semi-drying process of oily sludge. To shorten the time required for natural semi-drying, this study applied an orthogonal test to screen an oily sludge modified material (OSM). The effect and mechanism of OSM on the natural semi-drying of oily sludge were studied using a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface tension measurement, and microscopic observations. The results show that when the ambient temperature exceeded 10°C, the OSM increased in mass by 8–10%, and the time required for the natural semi-drying of oily sludge was shortened from 15 days to less than 5 days. OSM can rupture the emulsion, reduce the surface tension, convert the emulsion and bound water in the oily sludge into free water, and accelerate the rate of water migration, diffusion, and natural evaporation from the inside of the oily sludge to the surface and air. The research results show that changing the form of water can speed up the drying of oily sludge, creating positive economic benefits in the process of oily sludge reduction and recycling."
