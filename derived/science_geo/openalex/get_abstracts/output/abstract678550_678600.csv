https://openalex.org/W3190581971,"Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard and hinders sustainable development1,2. Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods3. Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization4, flood mitigation infrastructure5 and increasing settlements in floodplains6. Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty3,7–11. Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255–290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58–86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates7. Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods. Satellite imagery for the period 2000–2018 reveals that population growth was greater in flood-prone regions than elsewhere, thus exposing a greater proportion of the population to floods."
https://openalex.org/W3192789395,"An animal's nervous system changes as its body grows from birth to adulthood and its behaviours mature1-8. The form and extent of circuit remodelling across the connectome is unknown3,9-15. Here we used serial-section electron microscopy to reconstruct the full brain of eight isogenic Caenorhabditis elegans individuals across postnatal stages to investigate how it changes with age. The overall geometry of the brain is preserved from birth to adulthood, but substantial changes in chemical synaptic connectivity emerge on this consistent scaffold. Comparing connectomes between individuals reveals substantial differences in connectivity that make each brain partly unique. Comparing connectomes across maturation reveals consistent wiring changes between different neurons. These changes alter the strength of existing connections and create new connections. Collective changes in the network alter information processing. During development, the central decision-making circuitry is maintained, whereas sensory and motor pathways substantially remodel. With age, the brain becomes progressively more feedforward and discernibly modular. Thus developmental connectomics reveals principles that underlie brain maturation."
https://openalex.org/W3185710912,"Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women1,2, but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease."

https://openalex.org/W3189459060,"Abstract Olfactory systems must detect and discriminate amongst an enormous variety of odorants 1 . To contend with this challenge, diverse species have converged on a common strategy in which odorant identity is encoded through the combinatorial activation of large families of olfactory receptors 1–3 , thus allowing a finite number of receptors to detect a vast chemical world. Here we offer structural and mechanistic insight into how an individual olfactory receptor can flexibly recognize diverse odorants. We show that the olfactory receptor Mh OR5 from the jumping bristletail 4 Machilis hrabei assembles as a homotetrameric odorant-gated ion channel with broad chemical tuning. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we elucidated the structure of Mh OR5 in multiple gating states, alone and in complex with two of its agonists—the odorant eugenol and the insect repellent DEET. Both ligands are recognized through distributed hydrophobic interactions within the same geometrically simple binding pocket located in the transmembrane region of each subunit, suggesting a structural logic for the promiscuous chemical sensitivity of this receptor. Mutation of individual residues lining the binding pocket predictably altered the sensitivity of Mh OR5 to eugenol and DEET and broadly reconfigured the receptor’s tuning. Together, our data support a model in which diverse odorants share the same structural determinants for binding, shedding light on the molecular recognition mechanisms that ultimately endow the olfactory system with its immense discriminatory capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3188322823,"The topological protection of wave transport, originally observed in the context of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases1, has been shown to apply broadly to a range of physical platforms, including photonics2-5, ultracold atoms in optical lattices6-8 and others9-12. That said, the behaviour of such systems can be very different from the electronic case, particularly when interparticle interactions or nonlinearity play a major role13-22. A Thouless pump23 is a one-dimensional model that captures the topological quantization of transport in the quantum Hall effect using the notion of dimensional reduction: an adiabatically, time-varying potential mathematically maps onto a momentum coordinate in a conceptual second dimension24-34. Importantly, quantization assumes uniformly filled electron bands below a Fermi energy, or an equivalent occupation for non-equilibrium bosonic systems. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate quantized nonlinear Thouless pumping of photons with a band that is decidedly not uniformly occupied. In our system, nonlinearity acts to quantize transport via soliton formation and spontaneous symmetry-breaking bifurcations. Quantization follows from the fact that the instantaneous soliton solutions centred upon a given unit cell are identical after each pump cycle, up to translation invariance; this is an entirely different mechanism from traditional Thouless pumping. This result shows that nonlinearity and interparticle interactions can induce quantized transport and topological behaviour without a linear counterpart."
https://openalex.org/W3192299379,"One in four women suffers from uterine leiomyomas (ULs)-benign tumours of the uterine wall, also known as uterine fibroids-at some point in premenopausal life. ULs can cause excessive bleeding, pain and infertility1, and are a common cause of hysterectomy2. They emerge through at least three distinct genetic drivers: mutations in MED12 or FH, or genomic rearrangement of HMGA23. Here we created genome-wide datasets, using DNA, RNA, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and HiC chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) sequencing of primary tissues to profoundly understand the genesis of UL. We identified somatic mutations in genes encoding six members of the SRCAP histone-loading complex4, and found that germline mutations in the SRCAP members YEATS4 and ZNHIT1 predispose women to UL. Tumours bearing these mutations showed defective deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. In ULs, H2A.Z occupancy correlated positively with chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and negatively with DNA methylation, but these correlations were weak in tumours bearing SRCAP complex mutations. In these tumours, open chromatin emerged at transcription start sites where H2A.Z was lost, which was associated with upregulation of genes. Furthermore, YEATS4 defects were associated with abnormal upregulation of bivalent embryonic stem cell genes, as previously shown in mice5. Our work describes a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis-epigenetic instability caused by deficient H2A.Z deposition-and suggests that ULs arise through an aberrant differentiation program driven by deranged chromatin, emanating from a small number of mutually exclusive driver mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3190900928,"The hippocampus is thought to encode a ""cognitive map,"" a structural organization of knowledge about relationships in the world. Place cells, spatially selective hippocampal neurons that have been extensively studied in rodents, are one component of this map, describing the relative position of environmental features. However, whether this map extends to abstract, cognitive information remains unknown. Using the relative reward value of cues to define continuous ""paths"" through an abstract value space, we show that single neurons in primate hippocampus encode this space through value place fields, much like a rodent's place neurons encode paths through physical space. Value place fields remapped when cues changed but also became increasingly correlated across contexts, allowing maps to become generalized. Our findings help explain the critical contribution of the hippocampus to value-based decision-making, providing a mechanism by which knowledge of relationships in the world can be incorporated into reward predictions for guiding decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3187128303,"MFSD2A is a sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine symporter that is responsible for the uptake of docosahexaenoic acid into the brain1,2, which is crucial for the development and performance of the brain3. Mutations that affect MFSD2A cause microcephaly syndromes4,5. The ability of MFSD2A to transport lipid is also a key mechanism that underlies its function as an inhibitor of transcytosis to regulate the blood-brain barrier6,7. Thus, MFSD2A represents an attractive target for modulating the permeability of the blood-brain barrier for drug delivery. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of mouse MFSD2A. Our structure defines the architecture of this important transporter, reveals its unique extracellular domain and uncovers its substrate-binding cavity. The structure-together with our functional studies and molecular dynamics simulations-identifies a conserved sodium-binding site, reveals a potential lipid entry pathway and helps to rationalize MFSD2A mutations that underlie microcephaly syndromes. These results shed light on the critical lipid transport function of MFSD2A and provide a framework to aid in the design of specific modulators for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3033185959,"There are increasingly applications of natural language processing techniques for information retrieval, indexing and topic modelling in the engineering contexts. A standard component of such tasks is the removal of stopwords, which are uninformative components of the data. While researchers use readily available stopword lists which are derived for general English language, the technical jargon of engineering fields contains their own highly frequent and uninformative words and there exists no standard stopword list for technical language processing applications. Here we address this gap by rigorously identifying generic, insignificant, uninformative stopwords in engineering texts beyond the stopwords in general texts, based on the synthesis of alternative data-driven approaches, and curating a stopword list ready for technical language processing applications."
https://openalex.org/W3190088325,"We evaluated the safety and efficacy of fully closed-loop insulin therapy compared with standard insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis. In an open-label, multinational, two-center, randomized crossover trial, 26 adults with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis (17 men, 9 women, average age 68 ± 11 years (mean ± s.d.), diabetes duration of 20 ± 10 years) underwent two 20-day periods of unrestricted living, comparing the Cambridge fully closed-loop system using faster insulin aspart ('closed-loop') with standard insulin therapy and a masked continuous glucose monitor ('control') in random order. The primary endpoint was time in target glucose range (5.6-10.0 mmol l-1). Thirteen participants received closed-loop first and thirteen received control therapy first. The proportion of time in target glucose range (5.6-10.0 mmol l-1; primary endpoint) was 52.8 ± 12.5% with closed-loop versus 37.7 ± 20.5% with control; mean difference, 15.1 percentage points (95% CI 8.0-22.2; P < 0.001). Mean glucose was lower with closed-loop than control (10.1 ± 1.3 versus 11.6 ± 2.8 mmol l-1; P = 0.003). Time in hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol l-1) was reduced with closed-loop versus control (median (IQR) 0.1 (0.0-0.4%) versus 0.2 (0.0-0.9%); P = 0.040). No severe hypoglycemia events occurred during the control period, whereas one severe hypoglycemic event occurred during the closed-loop period, but not during closed-loop operation. Fully closed-loop improved glucose control and reduced hypoglycemia compared with standard insulin therapy in adult outpatients with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis. The trial registration number is NCT04025775."
https://openalex.org/W3188204143,"Regulated cell death is an integral part of life, and has broad effects on organism development and homeostasis1. Malfunctions within the regulated cell death process, including the clearance of dying cells, can manifest in diverse pathologies throughout various tissues including the gastrointestinal tract2. A long appreciated, yet elusively defined relationship exists between cell death and gastrointestinal pathologies with an underlying microbial component3-6, but the direct effect of dying mammalian cells on bacterial growth is unclear. Here we advance a concept that several Enterobacteriaceae, including patient-derived clinical isolates, have an efficient growth strategy to exploit soluble factors that are released from dying gut epithelial cells. Mammalian nutrients released after caspase-3/7-dependent apoptosis boosts the growth of multiple Enterobacteriaceae and is observed using primary mouse colonic tissue, mouse and human cell lines, several apoptotic triggers, and in conventional as well as germ-free mice in vivo. The mammalian cell death nutrients induce a core transcriptional response in pathogenic Salmonella, and we identify the pyruvate formate-lyase-encoding pflB gene as a key driver of bacterial colonization in three contexts: a foodborne infection model, a TNF- and A20-dependent cell death model, and a chemotherapy-induced mucositis model. These findings introduce a new layer to the complex host-pathogen interaction, in which death-induced nutrient release acts as a source of fuel for intestinal bacteria, with implications for gut inflammation and cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3188919106,"Macroscale analogues1–3 of microscopic spin systems offer direct insights into fundamental physical principles, thereby advancing our understanding of synchronization phenomena4 and informing the design of novel classes of chiral metamaterials5–7. Here we introduce hydrodynamic spin lattices (HSLs) of ‘walking’ droplets as a class of active spin systems with particle–wave coupling. HSLs reveal various non-equilibrium symmetry-breaking phenomena, including transitions from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order that can be controlled by varying the lattice geometry and system rotation8. Theoretical predictions based on a generalized Kuramoto model4 derived from first principles rationalize our experimental observations, establishing HSLs as a versatile platform for exploring active phase oscillator dynamics. The tunability of HSLs suggests exciting directions for future research, from active spin–wave dynamics to hydrodynamic analogue computation and droplet-based topological insulators. A macroscopic analogue of a spin system is shown to emerge in an ensemble of droplets bouncing on the surface of a vibrating bath, revealing symmetry-breaking phenomena such as ‘magnetic’ ordering."
https://openalex.org/W3139014590,"Objectives In severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the appropriate timing and dosing of corticosteroids (CS) is not known. Patient subgroups for which CS could be more beneficial also need appraisal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of early CS in COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to the ICU on the occurrence of 60-day mortality, ICU-acquired-bloodstream infections(ICU-BSI), and hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia(HAP-VAP). Methods We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to 11 ICUs belonging to the French OutcomeRea TM network from January to May 2020. We used survival models with ponderation with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results The study population comprised 303 patients having a median age of 61.6 (53–70) years of whom 78.8% were male and 58.6% had at least one comorbidity. The median SAPS II was 33 (25–44). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 34.8% of the patients. Sixty-six (21.8%) patients were in the Early-C subgroup. Overall, 60-day mortality was 29.4%. The risks of 60-day mortality ( IPTW HR = 0.86;95% CI 0.54 to 1.35, p = 0.51), ICU-BSI and HAP-VAP were similar in the two groups. Importantly, early CS treatment was associated with a lower mortality rate in patients aged 60 years or more ( IPTW HR, 0.53;95% CI, 0.3–0.93; p = 0.03). In contrast, CS was associated with an increased risk of death in patients younger than 60 years without inflammation on admission ( IPTW HR = 5.01;95% CI, 1.05, 23.88; p = 0.04). Conclusion For patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, early CS treatment was not associated with patient survival. Interestingly, inflammation and age can significantly influence the effect of CS."
https://openalex.org/W3188451370,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly altered the routine of life and caused unanticipated changes resulting in severe psychological responses and mental health crisis. The study aimed to identify psycho-social factors that predicted distress among Indian population during the spread of novel Coronavirus. Method An online survey was conducted to assess the predictors of distress. A global logistic regression model was built, by identifying significant factors from individual logistic regression models built on various groups of independent variables. The prediction capability of the model was compared with the random forest classifier. Results The respondents ( N = 1060) who are more likely to be distressed, are in the age group of 21-35 years, are females (OR = 1.425), those working on site (OR = 1.592), have pre-existing medical conditions (OR = 1.682), do not have health insurance policy covering COVID-19 (OR = 1.884), have perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (OR = 1.239), have lack of trust in government (OR = 1.246) and whose basic needs’ fulfillment are unsatisfactory (OR = 1.592). The ones who are less likely to be distressed, have higher social support and psychological capital. Random forest classifier correctly classified 2.3% and 17.1% of people under lower and higher distress respectively, with respect to logistic regression. Conclusions This study confirms the prevalence of high distress experienced by Indians at the time of COVID-19 and provides pragmatic implications for psychological health at macro and micro levels during an epidemiological crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3189626768,"Abstract During the splicing of introns from precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) must undergo stable integration into the spliceosomal A complex—a poorly understood, multistep process that is facilitated by the DEAD-box helicase Prp5 (refs. 1–4 ). During this process, the U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) forms an RNA duplex with the pre-mRNA branch site (the U2–BS helix), which is proofread by Prp5 at this stage through an unclear mechanism 5 . Here, by deleting the branch-site adenosine (BS-A) or mutating the branch-site sequence of an actin pre-mRNA, we stall the assembly of spliceosomes in extracts from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae directly before the A complex is formed. We then determine the three-dimensional structure of this newly identified assembly intermediate by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure indicates that the U2–BS helix has formed in this pre-A complex, but is not yet clamped by the HEAT domain of the Hsh155 protein (Hsh155 HEAT ), which exhibits an open conformation. The structure further reveals a large-scale remodelling/repositioning of the U1 and U2 snRNPs during the formation of the A complex that is required to allow subsequent binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, but that this repositioning is blocked in the pre-A complex by the presence of Prp5. Our data suggest that binding of Hsh155 HEAT to the bulged BS-A of the U2–BS helix triggers closure of Hsh155 HEAT , which in turn destabilizes Prp5 binding. Thus, Prp5 proofreads the branch site indirectly, hindering spliceosome assembly if branch-site mutations prevent the remodelling of Hsh155 HEAT . Our data provide structural insights into how a spliceosomal helicase enhances the fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W3191529559,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in quarantine/lockdown measures in most countries. Quarantine may create intense psychological problems including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) especially for the vulnerable critically developing children/adolescents. Few studies evaluated PTSD associated with infectious disasters but no Saudi study investigated PTSD associated with COVID-19 in children/adolescents. This study was undertaken to screen for PTSD in children/adolescent in Saudi Arabia to identify its prevalence/risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic and its quarantine. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted after 2 months form start of quarantine for COVID-19 pandemic utilizing the original English version and an Arabic translated version for the University of California at Los Angeles Brief COVID-19 Screen for Child/Adolescent PTSD that can be parent-reported or self-completed by older children/adolescents. Participants (Saudi citizens/non-Saudi residents) were approached online via social media. Results Five hundred and thirty seven participants were enrolled. The participants were 262 boys and 275 girls with a mean age of 12.25±3.77 years. Symptoms of no, minimal, mild and potential PTSD were identified in 15.5%, 44.1%, 27.4% and 13.0% of children/adolescents, respectively. The age, gender, school grade, and residence were not predictive of PTSD symptoms. Univariate analysis of risk factors for PTSD revealed that work of a close relative around people who might be infected was significantly different between groups of PTSD symptoms, but this difference disappeared during multivariate analysis. Children/adolescents of Saudi citizens had significantly lower median total PTSD score than children/adolescents of expatriate families (p = 0.002). Conclusion PTSD associated with the COVID-19 and its resultant quarantine shouldn’t be overlooked in different populations as it is expected in a considerable proportion of children/adolescents with variable prevalence, risk factors and severity. Parents/healthcare providers must be aware of PTSD associated with COVID-19 or similar disasters, so, they can provide children/adolescent with effective coping mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3190873122,"Abstract Jupiter’s upper atmosphere is considerably hotter than expected from the amount of sunlight that it receives 1–3 . Processes that couple the magnetosphere to the atmosphere give rise to intense auroral emissions and enormous deposition of energy in the magnetic polar regions, so it has been presumed that redistribution of this energy could heat the rest of the planet 4–6 . Instead, most thermospheric global circulation models demonstrate that auroral energy is trapped at high latitudes by the strong winds on this rapidly rotating planet 3,5,7–10 . Consequently, other possible heat sources have continued to be studied, such as heating by gravity waves and acoustic waves emanating from the lower atmosphere 2,11–13 . Each mechanism would imprint a unique signature on the global Jovian temperature gradients, thus revealing the dominant heat source, but a lack of planet-wide, high-resolution data has meant that these gradients have not been determined. Here we report infrared spectroscopy of Jupiter with a spatial resolution of 2 degrees in longitude and latitude, extending from pole to equator. We find that temperatures decrease steadily from the auroral polar regions to the equator. Furthermore, during a period of enhanced activity possibly driven by a solar wind compression, a high-temperature planetary-scale structure was observed that may be propagating from the aurora. These observations indicate that Jupiter’s upper atmosphere is predominantly heated by the redistribution of auroral energy."
https://openalex.org/W3189347993,"This paper aims to shed light on the question whether, and how, social media self-control failure is related to mindfulness and wellbeing. Using a 3-wave longitudinal design, the present study among 594 daily social media users examined the reciprocal relationships between social media self-control failure and mindfulness, and between social media self-control failure and wellbeing (as assessed by subjective vitality and life satisfaction). Results of the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model showed that social media self-control failure has a time-invariant negative association with mindfulness and subjective vitality. No full reciprocal influence was found between social media self-control failure and mindfulness, yet part of this trajectory was observed, suggesting that social media self-control failure could impair mindfulness, which, in turn, might increase future social media self-control failure. For wellbeing, life satisfaction was found to predict subsequent drops in social media self-control failure."
https://openalex.org/W3187464801,"New emerging infectious diseases are identified every year, a subset of which become global pandemics like COVID-19. In the case of COVID-19, many governments have responded to the ongoing pandemic by imposing social policies that restrict contacts outside of the home, resulting in a large fraction of the workforce either working from home or not working. To ensure essential services, however, a substantial number of workers are not subject to these limitations, and maintain many of their pre-intervention contacts. To explore how contacts among such ""essential"" workers, and between essential workers and the rest of the population, impact disease risk and the effectiveness of pandemic control, we evaluated several mathematical models of essential worker contacts within a standard epidemiology framework. The models were designed to correspond to key characteristics of cashiers, factory employees, and healthcare workers. We find in all three models that essential workers are at substantially elevated risk of infection compared to the rest of the population, as has been documented, and that increasing the numbers of essential workers necessitates the imposition of more stringent controls on contacts among the rest of the population to manage the pandemic. Importantly, however, different archetypes of essential workers differ in both their individual probability of infection and impact on the broader pandemic dynamics, highlighting the need to understand and target intervention for the specific risks faced by different groups of essential workers. These findings, especially in light of the massive human costs of the current COVID-19 pandemic, indicate that contingency plans for future epidemics should account for the impacts of essential workers on disease spread."

https://openalex.org/W3187692526,"Land reclamation projects and the installation of drainage infrastructure has impacted coastal wetlands worldwide. By altering water levels and inundation extent, these activities have changed the viable ecosystems onsite and resulted in the proliferation of freshwater species. As more than 50% of tidal wetlands have been degraded globally over the last 100 years, the importance of this issue is increasingly being recognised and tidal wetland restoration projects are underway worldwide. However, there are currently limited sites where large-scale reintroduction of tidal flushing has been implemented with the explicit aim to foster the growth of a threatened ecosystem. In this study, the tidal restoration of an internationally recognised Ramsar listed wetland in eastern Australia is described to highlight how coastal saltmarsh can be targeted by mimicking inundation depths and hydroperiod across the 410-ha site. Coastal saltmarsh is particularly important to this site as it is part of the east Australasian flyway for migratory birds and the minimum saltmarsh extent, as listed within the Ramsar’s limits of acceptable change, have been breached. To recreate coastal saltmarsh habitat onsite, water level and hydroperiod criteria were established based on similar vegetation patterns within the adjacent estuary. A calibrated 2D hydrodynamic model of the site was then used to test how the preferred inundation criteria could be applied to the largest possible restored wetland area. Once optimised, a synthetic tidal signal was implemented onsite via automated hydraulic controls. The onsite vegetation response over an 8-year period was assessed to highlight the ecosystem response to controlled tidal inundation and denoted substantial saltmarsh expansion during the period. The techniques applied onsite have successfully met the restoration targets and can be applied at similar sites worldwide, offsetting sea level rise impacts to natural inundation hydroperiod."

The alterations of gut microbiota were studied after intestinal obstruction. Intraluminal fecal samples proximal to the obstruction were collected at different time points (24, 48 and 72 hours after obstruction) and analyzed by 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing technology and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for target bacterial groups. Furthermore, intestinal claudin-1 mRNA expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, and serum sIgA, IFABP and TFF3 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Small bowel obstruction led to significant bacterial overgrowth and profound alterations in gut microbiota composition and diversity. At the phylum level, the 16S rDNA sequences showed a marked decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and increased abundance of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes. The qPCR analysis showed the absolute quantity of total bacteria increased significantly within 24 hours but did not change distinctly from 24 to 72 hours. Further indicators of intestinal mucosa damage and were observed as claudin-1 gene expression, sIgA and TFF3 levels decreased and IFABP level increased with prolonged obstruction.Small bowel obstruction can cause significant structural and quantitative alterations of gut microbiota and induce disruption of gut mucosa barrier."
https://openalex.org/W3190707570,"Background The most commonly diagnosed cancers among women are breast and cervical cancers, with cervical cancer being a relatively bigger problem in low and middle income countries (LMICs) than breast cancer. Methods The main aim of this study was to asses factors associated with and socioeconomic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening among women aged 15–64 years in Botswana. This study is part of the broad study on Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases in Botswana conducted (NCD survey) in 2016. The NCD survey was conducted across 3 cities and towns, 15 urban villages and 15 rural areas of Botswana. The survey collected information on several NCDs and risk factors including cervical and breast cancer screening. The survey adopted a multistage sampling design and a sample of 1178 participants (males and females) aged 15 years and above was selected in both urban and rural areas of Botswana. For this study, a sub-sample of 813 women aged 15–64 years was selected and included in the analysis. The inequality analysis was conducted using decomposition analysis using ADePT software version 6. Logistic regression models were used to show the association between socioeconomic variables and cervical and breast cancer screening using SPSS version 25. All comparisons were considered statistically significant at 5%. Results Overall, 6% and 62% of women reported that they were screened for breast and cervical cancer, respectively. Women in the poorest (AOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.06–0.45) and poorer (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.14–0.96) wealth quintiles were less likely to report cervical cancer screening compared to women in the richest wealth quintile. Similarly, for breast cancer, the odds of screening were found to be low among women in the poorest (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.06–0.68) and the poorer (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.13–0.81)) wealth quintiles. Concentration indices (CI) showed that cervical (CI = 0.2443) and breast cancer (CI = 0.3975) screening were more concentrated among women with high SES than women with low SES. Wealth status was observed to be the leading contributor to socioeconomic inequality observed for both cervical and breast cancer screening. Conclusions Findings in this study indicate the need for concerted efforts to address the health care needs of the poor in order to reduce cervical and breast cancer screening inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W3117152075,"Eye-tracking is becoming an increasingly popular tool for understanding the underlying behavior driving human decisions. However, an important unanswered methodological question is whether the use of an eye-tracking device itself induces changes in participants’ behavior. We study this question using eight popular games in experimental economics chosen for their varying levels of theorized susceptibility to social desirability bias. We implement a simple between-subject design where participants are randomly assigned to either a control or an eye-tracking treatment. In seven of the eight games, eye-tracking did not produce different outcomes. In the Holt and Laury risk assessment (HL), subjects with multiple calibration attempts demonstrated more risk averse behavior in eye-tracking conditions. However, this effect only appeared during the first five (of ten) rounds. Because calibration difficulty is correlated with eye-tracking data quality, the standard practice of removing participants with low eye-tracking data quality resulted in no difference between the treatment and control groups in HL. Our results suggest that experiments may incorporate eye-tracking equipment without inducing changes in the economic behavior of participants, particularly after observations with low quality eye-tracking data are removed."

A method for accelerating the process of phytoremediation by the combined effect of magnetic and weak electric fields is proposed. The purpose of this study is to determine the values of the parameters of the magnetic and weak electric fields that are most suitable for extracting cuprum ions from wastewater using the higher aqua plants ( Lemna minor ). A corresponding technological process based on the results of the study is proposed. The results have shown that the removal of copper cations from sulfate solutions effectively occurs in the initial period of time (1–5 hours) under the influence of a magnetic field with an intensity of H = 2 kA/m. Under the combined influence of an electrical current with density j = 240 μA/cm 2 and a magnetic field ( H = 2 kA/m) the highest rate of copper extraction by duckweed leaves is achieved. Under these conditions, the greatest growth and development of plant leaves occurs. The paper presents the results of determining of the parameters of the electrochemical release from the eluate of the spent phytomass of duckweed. It has been determined that the release of metal occurs at E = 0.32 V. An original scheme for wastewater treatment from copper with subsequent separation of copper from the spent phytomass of duckweed is proposed. In general, the presented results are a scientific justification of wastewater treatment technologies and a contribution to resolving the crisis in the field of fresh water supply. An important contribution in the circular economy is a technology recommendation proposed for recovering copper from duckweed after wastewater treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3191965066,"In habitat modelling, environmental variables are assumed to be proxies of lower trophic levels distribution and by extension, of marine top predator distributions. More proximal variables, such as potential prey fields, could refine relationships between top predator distributions and their environment. In situ data on prey distributions are not available over large spatial scales but, a numerical model, the Spatial Ecosystem And POpulation DYnamics Model (SEAPODYM), provides simulations of the biomass and production of zooplankton and six functional groups of micronekton at the global scale. Here, we explored whether generalised additive models fitted to simulated prey distribution data better predicted deep-diver densities (here beaked whales Ziphiidae and sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus) than models fitted to environmental variables. We assessed whether the combination of environmental and prey distribution data would further improve model fit by comparing their explanatory power. For both taxa, results were suggestive of a preference for habitats associated with topographic features and thermal fronts but also for habitats with an extended euphotic zone and with large prey of the lower mesopelagic layer. For beaked whales, no SEAPODYM variable was selected in the best model that combined the two types of variables, possibly because SEAPODYM does not accurately simulate the organisms on which beaked whales feed on. For sperm whales, the increase model performance was only marginal. SEAPODYM outputs were at best weakly correlated with sightings of deep-diving cetaceans, suggesting SEAPODYM may not accurately predict the prey fields of these taxa. This study was a first investigation and mostly highlighted the importance of the physiographic variables to understand mechanisms that influence the distribution of deep-diving cetaceans. A more systematic use of SEAPODYM could allow to better define the limits of its use and a development of the model that would simulate larger prey beyond 1,000 m would probably better characterise the prey of deep-diving cetaceans."
https://openalex.org/W3187248908,"Key to our understanding of how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber. Even in phases of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still has a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than five decades ago1–15, but, so far, band-structure renormalization and the pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here we report the observation of the unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero wavenumber with a pseudogap of 30–240 millielectronvolts from the Fermi level. This is wavenumber renormalization caused by resonance scattering, leading to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of disordered alkali metal (sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium) allows the classification of the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators doped by disordered dopants16–20, such as the waterfall dispersion observed in copper oxides. A back-bending band structure and an emerging pseudogap are observed at the interface between a crystalline solid (black phosphorus) and disordered alkali-metal dopants."
https://openalex.org/W3190987273,"Evidence for the real impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on preterm birth is unclear, as available series report composite pregnancy outcomes and/or do not stratify patients according to disease severity. The purpose of the research was to determine the real impact of asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection on preterm birth not due to maternal respiratory failure. This case-control study involved women admitted to Sant Anna Hospital, Turin, for delivery between 20 September 2020 and 9 January 2021. The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 was compared between preterm birth (case group, n = 102) and full-term delivery (control group, n = 127). Only women with spontaneous or medically-indicated preterm birth because of placental vascular malperfusion (pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications) were included. Current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by nasopharyngeal swab testing and detection of IgM/IgG antibodies in blood samples. A significant difference in the cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 between the case (21/102, 20.5%) and the control group (32/127, 25.1%) ( P = 0.50) was not observed, although the case group was burdened by a higher prevalence of three known risk factors (body mass index &gt; 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension) for severe Coronavirus disease-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection was not an independent predictor of spontaneous and medically-indicated preterm birth due to pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications (0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.43). Pregnant patients without comorbidities need to be reassured that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection does not increase the risk of preterm delivery. Preterm birth and severe Coronavirus disease-19 share common risk factors (i.e., body mass index &gt; 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension), which may explain the high rate of indicated preterm birth due to maternal conditions reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3192050693,"Introduction In a majority of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), levels of child growth failure (CGF) have steadily declined since 2000. However, some countries show a different trend. Despite continued investment from the government of Ethiopia as well as donors, CGF levels are still high in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess trends in CGF and associated sociodemographic, economic and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) factors from 2000 to 2016 in Ethiopia. Methods Data were taken from four rounds of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). Children aged between 0 to 59 months were included. CGF indicators were categorised based on height-for-age z-score (HAZ) &lt; -2 Standard deviation (SD), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) &lt; -2 SD and weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) &lt; -2 SD. CGF trends were estimated for predicted probabilities and odds ratios (ORs) between 2000 and 2016. Results A total sample size of 31978 for HAZ, 32045 for WAZ and 32246 for WHZ were included in the current study. Stunting decreased from an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.88) in 2005 to an AOR = 0.45 (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.53) in 2016 compared with the year 2000. Compared with data in 2000, underweight decreased from an AOR of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.80) in 2005 to an AOR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.50) in 2016. Wasting declined from an AOR of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.75 to 1.10) in 2005 to an AOR of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.94) in 2016, compared with data in 2000. Conclusions Between 2000 to 2016, there was a decline in CGF levels albeit the levels are still relatively high compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) cut-off levels for public health concern. Observed rates of change varied across sociodemographic, economic and WASH factors which suggest that interventions tailored towards addressing the imbalances across those factors are required."

We investigated 604 sera from hunted pheasants and 152 sera from wild caught pheasants between 2011 to 2015, with the aim to determine the prevalence of specific antibodies against different viruses: Avian influenza virus (AIV) of subtypes H5, H7, H9, paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV-1), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), infectious bursitis disease virus (IBDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and Salmonella sp., Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG). In addition, 178 caeca were investigated for Histomonas meleagridis . The study reveals an ongoing circulation of IBV in the wild pheasant population during the study. Also high seroprevalences of specific antibodies against aMPV depending on the area and a strong increase in prevalence of IBDV antibodies in sera of pheasants in Lower Saxony were detected. ILTV antibody prevalences differed between areas and AEV antibody detection differed between years significantly, whereas specific antibodies against PMV-1 could not be detected and antibodies against AIV-H5, -H7 and -H9 and Mycoplasma spp . were detected in very few cases."

Models reported previously have had two major problems: lack of information on the 3D protein structure and processing of incomplete sequencing data in the modeling procedure. We propose obtaining the 3D structural information of viral proteins by using homology modeling and molecular field mapping, instead of just their primary amino acid sequences. The molecular field potential parameters reflect the physicochemical characteristics associated with the 3D structure of the proteins. We also introduce the Bayesian conditional mutual information theory to estimate the probabilities of occurrence of all possible protein candidates from an incomplete sequencing sample. This approach allows for the effective use of uncertain information for the modeling process. We applied these data analysis techniques to the HIV-1 protease inhibitor dataset and developed drug resistance prediction models with reasonable performance."
https://openalex.org/W3191873685,"Urban seismology has gained scientific interest with the development of seismic ambient noise monitoring techniques and also for being a useful tool to connect society with the Earth sciences. The interpretation of the sources of seismic records generated by sporting events, traffic, or huge agglomerations arouses the population’s curiosity and opens up a range of possibilities for new applications of seismology, especially in the area of urban monitoring. In this contribution, we present the analysis of seismic records from a station in the city of Brasilia during unusual episodes of silencing and noisy periods. Usually, cultural noise is observed in high-fequency bands. We showed in our analysis that cultural noise can also be observed in the low-frequency band, when high-frequency signal is attenuated. As examples of noisy periods, we have that of the Soccer World Cup in Brazil in 2014, where changes in noise are related to celebrations of goals and the party held by FIFA in the city, and the political manifestations in the period of the Impeachment trial in 2016, which reached the concentration of about 300,000 protesters. The two most characteristic periods of seismic silence have been the quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the trucker strike that occurred across the country in 2018, both drastically reducing the movement of people in the city."
https://openalex.org/W3192824781,"Background Nutritional support is becoming more widely acknowledged as a crucial component of the key package of care for HIV/AIDS patients. This nutritional support is exceptionally important for patients in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, where HIV/AIDS is very prevalent. However, there is a lack of evidence on the recovery rate and predictors at the study site and at large in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study will give some insight into the recovery rate and its predictors among under-nourished HIV-positive adults treated with Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) attending at Debre Markos referral hospital. Moreover, the findings of this study will be used by both governmental and non-governmental organizations to allocate more resources to mitigate the nutritional problems for people living with HIV. Methods An institution-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 453 under-nourished HIV positive adults treated with RUTF at Debre Markos referral Hospital from the 1 st of July, 2015 to the 31 st of December, 2017. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were extracted from patient charts using a standardized data extraction checklist. Data were entered into Epi-Data Version 4.2 and analyzed using Stata Version 14. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to estimate the time to recovery. Log-rank test was used to compare the recovery time between different baseline categorical variables. The bivariable and multivariable Cox-proportional hazard regression models were fitted for potential predictors of recovery time. Adjusted hazard Ratios (AHRs) with 95% CIs were used to measure the strength of association and test statistical significance. Results A total of 453 undernourished HIV-positive adults were included in the final analysis. About 201, 44.4% (95%CI: 38.9, 49.0%) patients participating in the RUTF program were recovered based on predetermined exit criteria with incidence of 10.65 (95% CI: 9.28, 12.23) per 100 person-month observations. Being moderately undernourished (AHR: 11.0, 95% CI: 5.3, 23.1), WHO clinical stage (I or II) (AHR:1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.6), and working functional status at baseline (AHR = 2.34, 95%CI: 1.01,5.45) were predictors of recovery time. Conclusion This study concluded that the overall nutritional recovery rate was below the acceptable minimum requirement which at least 75% of patients should recovered. Mild to moderate undernutrition at baseline, WHO clinical stage I or II at enrolment, and working functional status were found to be predictors of recovery time in HIV/AIDS patients treated with the RUTF. As a result, special attention should be paid to severely malnourished patients, WHO clinical stages III or higher, and patients who are bedridden or ambulatory during treatment."

We propose a new method to identify manufactured gas production, storage, and distribution infrastructure in bulk by applying feature extraction and machine learning techniques to digitized historic Sanborn fire insurance maps. Our approach, which relies on a two-part neural network to classify candidate map regions, increases the rate of site identification 20-fold compared to unaided visual coding."
https://openalex.org/W3188614817,"Influenza is a highly contagious viral respiratory disease that affects million of people worldwide each year. Annual vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization with the goal of reducing influenza severity and limiting transmission through elicitation of antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. The antibody response elicited by current seasonal influenza virus vaccines is predominantly strain-specific, but pre-existing influenza virus immunity can greatly impact the serological antibody response to vaccination. However, it remains unclear how B cell memory is shaped by recurrent annual vaccination over the course of multiple seasons, especially in high-risk elderly populations. Here, we systematically profiled the B cell response in young adult (18-34 year old) and elderly (65+ year old) vaccine recipients that received annual split inactivated influenza virus vaccination for 3 consecutive seasons. Specifically, the antibody serological and memory B-cell compartments were profiled for reactivity against current and historical influenza A virus strains. Moreover, multiparametric analysis and antibody landscape profiling revealed a transient increase in strain-specific antibodies in the elderly, but with an impaired recall response of pre-existing memory B-cells, plasmablast (PB) differentiation and long-lasting serological changes. This study thoroughly profiles and compares the immune response to recurrent influenza virus vaccination in young and elderly participants unveiling the pitfalls of current influenza virus vaccines in high-risk populations."

The students have coped by turning to the online resources to keep pace with the change. To determine the type and practice of online resources used by undergraduate medical students and compare the use of online resources with gender and GPA. This was a cross-sectional study in which an online self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate the type and practices of the online resources used by the medical students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Complete enumeration sampling method was used to collect the data from 180 medical students studying at College of Medicine, Majmaah University, Saudi Arabia. One hundred and thirty students (72.2%) were unaware of the free online resources offered by the University. Most students (58.3%, n = 105) consulted peers for online references. Male students preferred PowerPoint presentations and consulting online resources for studying as compared to the females, whereas females preferred to study textbooks predominantly as compared to males (p = 0.005). Male students significantly shifted to the online resources during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to females (p = 0.028). Students with the highest GPA scores shifted to online educational resources during pandemic. A significant proportion of the undergraduate medical students at College of Medicine, Majmaah University used online educational resources for learning. We recommend that the college administration for deliberation with the medical educationalists for necessary curricular amendments and taking necessary steps to make the college Academic supervision and mentorship program more proactive to meet the challenges of students’ use of online educational resources."
https://openalex.org/W3192724041,"Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is a tumor suppressor downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, two of the fastest rising cancers worldwide. We compared MATα1 (protein encoded by MAT1A) interactome in normal versus cancerous livers by mass spectrometry to reveal interactions with 14-3-3ζ. The MATα1/14-3-3ζ complex was critical for the expression of 14-3-3ζ. Similarly, the knockdown and small molecule inhibitor for 14-3-3ζ (BV02), and ChIP analysis demonstrated the role of 14-3-3ζ in suppressing MAT1A expression. Interaction between MATα1 and 14-3-3ζ occurs directly and is enhanced by AKT2 phosphorylation of MATα1. Blocking their interaction enabled nuclear MATα1 translocation and inhibited tumorigenesis. In contrast, overexpressing 14-3-3ζ lowered nuclear MATα1 levels and promoted tumor progression. However, tumor-promoting effects of 14-3-3ζ were eliminated when liver cancer cells expressed mutant MATα1 unable to interact with 14-3-3ζ. Taken together, the reciprocal negative regulation that MATα1 and 14-3-3ζ exert is a key mechanism in liver tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3187404658,"Background African ancestry individuals with comparable overall anthropometric measures to Europeans have lower abdominal adiposity. To explore the genetic underpinning of different adiposity patterns, we investigated whether genetic risk scores for well-studied adiposity phenotypes like body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) also predict other, less commonly measured adiposity measures in 2420 African American individuals from the Jackson Heart Study. Methods Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated using GWAS-significant variants extracted from published studies mostly representing European ancestry populations for BMI, waist-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for BMI (WHR BMIadj ), waist circumference adjusted for BMI (WC BMIadj ), and body fat percentage (BF%). Associations between each PRS and adiposity measures including BF%, subcutaneous adiposity tissue (SAT), visceral adiposity tissue (VAT) and VAT:SAT ratio (VSR) were examined using multivariable linear regression, with or without BMI adjustment. Results In non-BMI adjusted models, all phenotype-PRS were found to be positive predictors of BF%, SAT and VAT. WHR-PRS was a positive predictor of VSR, but BF% and BMI-PRS were negative predictors of VSR. After adjusting for BMI, WHR-PRS remained a positive predictor of BF%, VAT and VSR but not SAT. WC-PRS was a positive predictor of SAT and VAT; BF%-PRS was a positive predictor of BF% and SAT only. Conclusion These analyses suggest that genetically driven increases in BF% strongly associate with subcutaneous rather than visceral adiposity and BF% is strongly associated with BMI but not central adiposity-associated genetic variants. How common genetic variants may contribute to observed differences in adiposity patterns between African and European ancestry individuals requires further study."

A non-parametric Malmquist approach is used to measure farm specific productivity change and its decomposition. We use a bootstrap regression to analyze factors that cause differences in productivity change and its components, testing, in particular, the role women’s empowerment plays. The empirical application focuses on a sample of Bangladesh rice farms over the crop cultivation period 2011 and 2014. Results suggest that improvements in women’s empowerment in agriculture were associated with higher levels of productivity change, efficiency change, and technical change, while they had no impact on scale efficiency change. We find that empowering women, specifically, improving their ability to make independent choices regarding agricultural production had a statistically significant positive association with productivity change, efficiency change, and technical change. We also find that lowering the gender parity gap is positively related with improving productivity of the sample farms."

The aim of the study is to design a score for predicting suspected MINOCA among an overall group of STEMI patients. Materials and methods Based on the Polish national registry of PCIs, we evaluated patients between 2014 and 2019, and selected 526,490 subjects treated with PCI and 650,728 treated using only coronary angiography. These subjects were chosen out of 1,177,218 patients who underwent coronary angiography. Then, we selected 124,663 individuals treated with pPCI due to STEMI and 5,695 patients with STEMI and MINOCA. The score for suspected MINOCA was created using the regression model, while the coefficients calculated for the final model were used to construct a predictive model in the form of a nomogram. Results Patients with MINOCA differ significantly from those in the MI-CAD group; they were significantly younger, less often males and demonstrated smaller burden of concomitant diseases. The model allowed to show that patients who scored more than 600 points had a 19% probability of MINOCA, while for those scoring more than 650 points, the likelihood was 71%. The other end of the MINOCA probability scale was marginal for patients who scored less than 500 points (&lt; .2%). Conclusions Based on the created MINOCA score presented in the current publication, we are able to distinguish MINOCA from MI-CAD patients in the STEMI group."

We aimed to analyze the rate and risk factors of relapse after reducing the dose of oral 5-ASA used for maintenance therapy of UC. Methods UC patients whose 5-ASA dose was reduced in clinical remission (partial Mayo score of ≤ 1) at our institution from 2012 to 2017 were analyzed. Various clinical variables of patients who relapsed after reducing the dose of oral 5-ASA were compared with those of patients who maintained remission. Risk factors for relapse were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Cumulative relapse-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results A total of 70 UC patients were included; 52 (74.3%) patients maintained remission and 18 (25.7%) patients relapsed during the follow-up period. Multivariate analysis indicated that a history of acute severe UC (ASUC) was an independent predictive factor for clinical relapse ( p = 0.024, odds ratio: 21, 95% confidence interval: 1.50–293.2). Based on Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, the cumulative relapse-free survival rate within 52 weeks was 22.2% for patients with a history of ASUC, compared with 82.0% for those without. the log-rank test showed a significant difference in a history of ASUC ( p &lt; 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W3187255217,"Morphology of organisms is an essential source of evidence for taxonomic decisions and understanding of ecology and evolutionary history. The geometric structure (i.e., numeric description of shape) provides richer and mathematically different information about an organism’s morphology than linear measurements. A little is known on how these two sources of morphological information (shape vs. size) contribute to the identification of organisms when implied simultaneously. This study hypothesized that combining geometric information on the outline with linear measurements results in better species identification than either evidence alone can provide. As a test system for our research, we used the microscopic spores of fungi from the genus Subulicystidium (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota). We analyzed 2D spore shape data via elliptic Fourier and principal component analyses. Using flexible discriminant analysis, we achieved the highest species identification success rate for a combination of shape and size descriptors (64.7%). The shape descriptors alone predicted species slightly better than size descriptors (61.5% vs. 59.1%). We conclude that adding geometric information on the outline to linear measurements improves the identification of the organisms. Despite the high relevance of spore traits for the taxonomy of fungi, they were previously rarely analyzed with the tools of geometric morphometrics. Therefore, we supplement our study with an open access protocol for digitizing and summarizing fungal spores’ shape and size information. We propagate a broader use of geometric morphometric analysis for microscopic propagules of fungi and other organisms."

Among them, adjunctive balloon angioplasty and stent placement was performed in 94 patients. Technical and clinical success regarding stage and cause of DVT was assessed. Results Technical success (complete thrombus removal without residual thrombus or stenosis) was achieved in 89.6%, and subjective symptom improvement was stated by 71.5% of treated patients. The primary patency rates were 88.1%, 81.6%, 76.0%, 74.1% and 69.1% at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 30 months, respectively. Recurrent IFDVT occurred in 19.3% (26/135) of patients, 0.79 cases per patients-years of follow up. According to the analysis by causes of IFDVT, recurrence rate was 19.3% (11/57), 21.2% (12/57), and 14.3% (3/21) in unknown, compression/invasion of the vein by cancerous mass, and May-Thurner syndrome groups, respectively (p = 0.798). No procedure-related complication developed. Conclusions Endovascular treatment based on MAT is a feasible treatment option with favorable outcomes and minimal risk of complication in cancer patients with symptomatic IFDVT."

We aimed to investigate the association between carrier status of PON1 Q192R and high platelet reactivity (HPR) with clopidogrel in patients undergoing elective neurointervention. Methods Post-clopidogrel platelet reactivity was measured using a VerifyNow ® P2Y12 assay in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) for consecutive patients before the treatment. Genotype testing was performed for PON1 Q192R and CYP2C19*2 and *3 (no function alleles), and *17 . PRU was corrected on the basis of hematocrit. We investigated associations between factors including carrying ≥1 PON1 192R allele and HPR defined as original and corrected PRU ≥208. Results Of 475 patients (232 men, median age, 68 years), HPR by original and corrected PRU was observed in 259 and 199 patients (54.5% and 41.9%), respectively. Carriers of ≥1 PON1 192R allele more frequently had HPR by original and corrected PRU compared with non-carriers (91.5% vs 85.2%, P = 0.031 and 92.5% vs 85.9%, P = 0.026, respectively). In multivariate analyses, carrying ≥1 PON1 192R allele was associated with HPR by original (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–3.76) and corrected PRU (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.21–4.74) after adjustment for age, sex, treatment with antihypertensive medications, hematocrit, platelet count, total cholesterol, and carrying ≥1 CYP2C19 no function allele. Conclusions Carrying ≥1 PON1 192R allele is associated with HPR by original and corrected PRU with clopidogrel in patients undergoing elective neurointervention, although alternative results related to other genetic polymorphisms cannot be excluded."
