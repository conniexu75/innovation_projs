https://openalex.org/W2145803213,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 are signal transducers for lipopolysaccharide, the major proinflammatory constituent in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. We observed that membrane lipoproteins/lipopeptides from Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, and Mycoplasma fermentans activated cells heterologously expressing TLR2 but not those expressing TLR1 or TLR4. These TLR2-expressing cells were also stimulated by living motile B. burgdorferi, suggesting that TLR2 recognition of lipoproteins is relevant to naturalBorrelia infection. Importantly, a TLR2 antibody inhibited bacterial lipoprotein/lipopeptide-induced tumor necrosis factor release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and TLR2-null Chinese hamster macrophages were insensitive to lipoprotein/lipopeptide challenge. The data suggest a role for the native protein in cellular activation by these ligands. In addition, TLR2-dependent responses were seen using whole Mycobacterium avium andStaphylococcus aureus, demonstrating that this receptor can function as a signal transducer for a wide spectrum of bacterial products. We conclude that diverse pathogens activate cells through TLR2 and propose that this molecule is a central pattern recognition receptor in host immune responses to microbial invasion.

The immediate response to the invading organism is coordinated by the innate immune system. The cells of this system are responsible for first-line bacterial clearance and modulation of the adaptive immune response through soluble factors or co-stimulatory signals provided by antigen-presenting cells (1Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Janeway and co-workers (2Janeway C.A.J. Immunol.

Toll is a type I transmembrane receptor, first described inDrosophila, that shares homology to components of the interleukin-1 (IL-1)1signaling pathway (4Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Toll, and the related molecule 18-Wheeler, appear to control important antimicrobial responses against both fungi and bacteria in the fruit fly (5Williams M.J. Rodriguez A. Kimbrell D.A. Eldon E.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6120-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2989) Google Scholar). In evolutionary terms, these proteins are primordial pattern recognition receptors for animals that totally lack acquired immunity. Recently, mammalian homologues of Toll have been cloned and designated Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (7Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C. Nguyen V. Nguyen O. Massa H.F. Eby M. Jasmin A. Trask B.J. Hood L.

At least 10 such receptors have been identified, but only 2 TLRs have any known function. TLR2 and TLR4 have been implicated in cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane (10Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A.

However, the mechanism behind TLR-mediated recognition of LPS, the interactions with other receptor molecules, such as CD14 (13Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Lyme disease and syphilis are acute and chronic inflammatory disorders caused by the spirochetal pathogens Borrelia burgdorferi andTreponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, respectively (15Steere A.C. N.

Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 726-737Google Scholar). Both spirochetes lack LPS (17Takayama K. Rothenberg R.J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2311-2313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hardy P.H.J. Levin J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1983; 174: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, they do possess abundant membrane lipoproteins (19Belisle J.T. Brandt M.E. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There now exists a large body of evidence that spirochetal lipoproteins and synthetic lipohexapeptide analogs are potent activators of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts and that acyl modification of the peptides is essential for these proinflammatory activities (20Knigge H.

More recent observations suggest that the mechanisms underlying monocytic cell activation by motile B. burgdorferi and T. pallidum are identical to those employed by their purified membrane constituents (30Sellati T.J. Bouis D.A. Caimano M.J. Feulner J.A. Ayers C. Lien E. Radolf J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2049-2056PubMed Google Scholar). These results support the notion that lipoproteins are the principle component of intact spirochetes driving the host immune response during Lyme disease and syphilis. Similarly, lipoproteins and lipopeptides derived from the human pathogen Mycoplasma fermentans are also potent activators of monocytes/macrophages and may play an important role in the inflammatory response during infection (31Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 32Garcia J. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. Rawadi G. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular activation induced by the lipoproteins or lipoprotein-derived lipopeptides from B. burgdorferi andT. pallidum resembles that of the LPS signaling pathway, as CD14 appears to facilitate cellular activation by both types of pathogenic membrane structures (21Sellati T.J. Bouis D.A. Kitchens R.L. Darveau R.P. Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Gangloff S.C. Goyert S.M. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5455-5464PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wooten R.M. Morrison T.B. Weis J.H. Wright S.D. Thieringer R. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5485-5492PubMed Google Scholar). However, several differences have been observed between LPS and lipoprotein cellular activation, indicating the utilization of different signaling elements. For example, spirochetal and mycoplasma lipoproteins and lipopeptides activate macrophages from LPS hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice (23Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Levi M.E. Shen Y.

Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells become remarkably sensitive to LPS after transfection with CD14 (34Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34391-34398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that differences in main signaling components exist between lipoproteins and LPS. We have recently found that CHO-K1 cells do not express an mRNA transcript for full-length and functional TLR2 (37Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar). This observation raised the possibility that the lack of functional TLR2 might account for the failure of CHO/CD14 cells to respond to bacterial structures other than LPS. To test this hypothesis, we engineered stable CHO/CD14 fibroblast cell lines that express TLR2. The transfected cells were highly susceptible to activation by lipoproteins and lipopeptides fromB. burgdorferi, T. pallidum, and M. fermentans, as well as to activation by live motile B. burgdorferi. In contrast, cells expressing TLR1 or TLR4 did not acquire responsiveness to bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides. Moreover, we observed a TLR2-mediated cell activation byMycobacterium avium, an important pathogen in AIDS. Similar studies have documented inducible responses to other bacteria as well, including staphylococci, listeria, tuberculosis, and the pneumococcus, suggestive of wide-spread recognition of bacteria by TLR2 (10Yang R.B.

(1999) Science 285,732–736 We propose that TLR2 mediates cellular responses to structures from numerous microbial cell wall constituents and may thus be central in host recognition of diverse bacterial pathogens. Therapies directed at the TLRs may be useful anti-inflammatory agents for a large variety of chronic and acute bacterial infections. PBS, Ham's F-12 medium, RPMI 1640 medium, and trypsin-versene mixture (trypsin-EDTA) were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Low endotoxin FBS was from Summit Biotechnologies (Greeley, CO), and ciprofloxacin was a gift from Miles Pharmaceuticals (West Haven, CT).

Qureshi (Middleton Veterans Affairs Hospital, Madison, WI). Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from Becton Dickinson, and human IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Native OspA (nOspA) was immunoaffinity purified from B. burgdorferi strain TI1-EV (40Norgard M.V. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Harrich D.A. Radolf J.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hexapeptides similar to the N termini of B. burgdorferi OspA (CKQNVS)), OspC (CNNSGK), and T. pallidum 47-kDa major lipoprotein (CGSSHH) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) peptide synthesizer. Lipopeptides (OspAL, OspCL, and 47L) corresponding to the acylated N termini of natural OspA, OspC and 47-kDa lipoprotein were synthesized using tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-cysteine in a solid-phase procedure (41DeOgny L. Pramanik B.C. Arndt L.L. Jones J.D. Rush J. Slaughter C.A. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Pept. Res. 1994; 7: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic (s) lipopeptide based upon the full-length MALP-2 membrane lipopeptide from M. fermentans (sMALP-2; CGNNDESNISFKEK) was prepared using dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine as described (32Garcia J.

Lipoproteins and lipopeptides were frozen at −20 °C as 1 mg/ml or 200 μm (sMALP-2) stock solutions in PBS (OspAL, OspCL, and 47L) or in PBS, 25 mm octyl glucoside (nOspA and sMALP-2). Endotoxin levels were undetectable in all lipoprotein/lipopeptide stock solutions as measured byLimulus assay. B. burgdorferi strain B31 (42Fraser C.M. Casjens S. Huang W.M. Sutton G.G. Clayton R.

Lathigra, MedImmune, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was grownin vitro at 34 °C in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly H medium (Sigma). Microorganisms were quantified by dark-field microscopy. Spirochetes were passaged five times or less prior to experimentation, and infectivity was assessed by intradermal infection of C3H/HeJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), followed by culture of an ear biopsy. For flow cytometry experiments, B. burgdorferi were labeled with PKH2 green fluorescent dye (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. M. avium strain 969 A45, originally a clinical isolate, was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with OADC supplementation (Baltimore Biological Laboratories, Baltimore, MD). The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice and resuspended in PBS, passed through a 5 μm filter to remove cell clumps, and enumerated by plating. Heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) was prepared as described (38Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bioparticles consisting of killed Escherichia coli K-12 strain were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and resuspended in PBS. The CHO/CD14.ELAM.Tac reporter cell line (clone 3E10) expresses inducible membrane CD25 under control of a region from the human E-selectin promoter containing nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding sites; this promoter element is absolutely dependent upon NF-κB (43Delude R.L. Yoshimura A. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar). Control reporter cells (CHO/ELAM.Tac (clone EL1)) were similarly constructed to express surface CD25 upon IL-1 or TNF stimulation by transfecting cells with the reporter construct and the hygromycin vector pCEP4 alone (i.e. without CD14). CHO/CD14 cells expressing TLRs were engineered by stable transfection of the CHO/CD14 reporter cell line with the cDNA for human TLR1, TLR2, or TLR4 in the pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (a gift from C. Kirschning and M. Rothe, Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA (11Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill A.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar)) as described (38Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All CHO reporter cell lines were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin, and 400 units/ml hygromycin B. The TLR expressing cell lines contained additional selection antibiotics (for CD14/TLR2, 0.5 mg/ml G418; for CD14/TLR1 and CD14/TLR4, 50 μg/ml puromycin). A CHO/CD14 reporter cell line with defects in the LPS signaling pathway (clone 7.7 (43Delude R.L. Yoshimura A. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar)) was stably transfected with TLR2 or TLR4 using calcium phosphate as described elsewhere 4A. Yoshimura, H. Heine, and D. T. Golenbock, manuscript in preparation. and grown in the presence of hygromycin and G418. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes. The following day, the cells were stimulated as indicated in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS (total volume of 0.25 ml/well). Subsequently, the cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-CD25 in PBS, 1% FBS for 30 min on ice. After labeling, the cells were washed once and resuspended in PBS, 1% FBS containing propidium iodide to exclude dead cells. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan microfluorometer (Becton Dickinson). Ten-week-old Chinese hamsters (Cytogen Research and Development, West Roxbury, MA) and C3H/OuJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 3% thioglycollate (Sigma). After 3 days, peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by lavage with 7 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. The cells were washed with medium, counted, and plated at a density at 1.2 × 106cells/well in six-well dishes, followed by overnight incubation. The nonadherent cells were then removed by washing with medium. Two days after harvesting, the cells were washed twice with medium and stimulated for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were isolated and analyzed for binding to a 32P-labeled NF-κB specific oligonucleotide by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, as described (35Delude R.L. Fenton M.J. Savedra Jr., R. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Thieringer R. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22253-22260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human PBMC were isolated by gradient centrifugation of heparinized blood on Histopaque® 1077 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human serum and plated at a density of 7 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well dish. Immediately before stimulation with the indicated compounds, 1:5 (v/v) dilutions of a hybridoma supernatant containing the TLR2-specific antibody TL2.12 or a control antibody (mouse IgG, Sigma, diluted in hybridoma medium), to a final antibody concentration of 5 μg/ml, was added. The cells were stimulated for 12 h, and cell-free supernatants were harvested and analyzed for TNFα release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (matching antibody pair from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In order to test the potential role of TLRs inB. burgdorferi and T. pallidum infections, we constructed several TLR-expressing reporter cell lines in a CHO fibroblast background that contained an inducible NF-κB-dependent promoter driving the surface expression of membrane CD25 (43Delude R.L. Yoshimura A. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of proinflammatory activity could be quantified by flow cytometry. We exposed CHO/CD14, CHO/CD14/TLR1, CHO/CD14/TLR2, and CHO/CD14/TLR4 reporter cell lines to the purified native B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (nOspA), a synthetic lipohexapeptide based upon the N terminus of the 47-kDa major T. pallidum lipoprotein (47L), and a synthesized version of the sMALP-2 full-length M. fermentanslipopeptide. All of the cell lines were engineered to express CD14, thereby conferring responsiveness to LPS, as indicated by increased membrane expression of the CD25 reporter transgene. Cells expressing TLR2 were activated by lipoprotein or lipopeptide structures (Fig.1 A). In contrast, CHO/CD14, CHO/CD14/TLR1, and CHO/CD14/TLR4 cells were not activated by any of the spirochetal molecules. These results also illustrate an important point concerning the purity of our preparations. Lack of stimulation of the highly LPS-sensitive CHO/CD14 line is strong evidence against the possibility that environmental endotoxin contaminated our preparations. The N terminus of mature B. burgdorferi and T. pallidum lipoproteins consists of a diacylglyceryl moiety in thioether linkage to a cysteine residue and a third fatty acid amide-linked to the α-amino group of the cysteine (19Belisle J.T. Brandt M.E. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast,M. fermentans MALP-2 possesses anN-acyl-S-diacylglceryl cysteine with a free N terminus (31Muhlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Several reports demonstrate dependence on lipid modification for both in vivo and in vitrocellular activation by B. burgdorferi, T. pallidum, and M. fermentans lipoproteins and synthetic lipopeptides (22Sellati T.J. Abrescia L.D. Radolf J.D. Furie M.B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3180-3187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Radolf J.D. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Levi M.E. Shen Y. Davis L.S. Norgard M.V. J.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, only lipidated peptides (B. burgdorferi OspCL, OspAL, T. pallidum 47L, and M. fermentans sMALP-2) activated the CHO/CD14/TLR2 reporter cell line, whereas the nonlipidated peptides completely lacked stimulatory activity. These data demonstrate that TLR2 mediates cellular activation by lipoproteins/lipopeptides and that the N-acyl-S-diacylglceryl moiety appears to be more important than the amide/linked fatty acid for their biological activity. Although the inability of the CHO/CD14/TLR4 cell line to respond to lipoproteins and lipopeptides may reflect the fact that TLR4 is not involved in lipoprotein recognition, it is possible that these cell lines expressed a nonfunctional TLR4. Control conditions were difficult to establish, because LPS already activates CHO/CD14 cells through the endogenous hamster TLR4. Therefore, an alternative approach was employed to confirm the functionality of the transfected TLR4 protein before concluding that bacterial lipoproteins and lipopeptides were not TLR4 ligands. Our laboratory has recently described CHO/CD14 cells with a genetic defect in LPS, but not in IL-1- or TNF-induced signal transduction (43Delude R.L. Yoshimura A. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar). These cells respond to LPS after transfection with TLR2 or TLR4, as these Toll proteins bypass their genetic lesion.4 As shown in Fig. 2, transfection with TLR2 enabled the cells to respond to lipopeptides, lipoproteins, and LPS. In stark contrast, TLR4-transfected cells responded to LPS only, demonstrating that the transfected TLR4 is functional in CHO/CD14 cells but will not transduce a signal in response to lipoproteins/lipopeptides. These data suggest that TLR2 is able to serve as a receptor for a broad repertoire of bacterially derived ligands, whereas TLR4 appears to be a more specific receptor for LPS. Similar to spirochetal lipoproteins/lipopeptides, live B. burgdorferi and T. pallidum activated monocytic cells but failed to stimulate CHO/CD14 cells (30Sellati T.J. Bouis D.A. Caimano M.J. Feulner J.A. Ayers C. Lien E. Radolf J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2049-2056PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are one of several pieces of evidence supporting the hypothesis that live spirochetes and their constituent lipoproteins activate cells by similar, if not identical, mechanisms. In light of these results and the above observations it was of interest to test whether motile spirochetes signal through TLR2. We found that only TLR2-transfected cells were activated upon exposure to B. burgdorferi (Fig. 3 A), whereas CHO/CD14/TLR4 cells remained insensitive to spirochetal challenge (data not shown). Experiments with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled B. burgdorferi showed a similar high degree of binding of the spirochete to all cell lines (data not shown), indicating that membrane attachment was not sufficient to initiate cellular responses. Again, motile B. burgdorferi stimulated the TLR2-transfected LPS nonresponder mutant CHO/CD14 cells, whereas TLR4-transfected cells were enabled to respond to LPS, but not to the spirochetes (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the recognition of lipopeptides and lipoproteins by TLR2 appears to be relevant to the responses observed during natural infection in man. These results demonstrate that TLR2 but not TLR4 mediates responses to whole B. burgdorferi and that TLR4 is unlikely to be involved in responses to spirochetes. Many microbial infections induce similar clinical symptoms, which may reflect similarities in host responses to invasion. Recent observations suggest that bacterial cell wall structures, such as peptidoglycan from Gram-positive organisms (38Yoshimura A. Lien E."

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon such as the appearance of a sporadic mutation in a given stem cell during embryogenesis or mitotic segregation, giving different degrees of heteroplasmy in tissues. However, these mechanisms cannot be the only ones involved in tissue specificity. In this paper, we propose an additional mechanism contributing to tissue specificity. It is based on the metabolic expression of the defect in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes that can present a biochemical threshold. The value of this threshold for a given OXPHOS complex can vary according to the tissue; thus different tissues will display different sensitivities to a defect in an OXPHOS complex. To verify this hypothesis and to illustrate the pathological consequences of the variation in biochemical thresholds, we studied their values for seven OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria isolated from five different rat tissues.

In addition, it has been shown that defects in oxidative phosphorylations (OXPHOS)1are able to affect any tissue, thus leading to the concept of mitochondrial cytopathies (21Di Mauro S. Moraes C. Arch. Neurol. 1993; 50: 1197-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This underlies the problem of the variability of the phenotypic expression of an mtDNA mutation. Indeed, an OXPHOS deficit due to such a mutation will not necessarily lead to a pathology. Moreover, mitochondrial cytopathies present a tissue specificity characterized by the fact that even if a mutation is present in all tissues, only some will be affected, leading to the pathology (4Wallace D.C. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Chomyn A. Am. J. Hum.

Opin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1992; 5: 622-632PubMed Google Scholar).A first mechanism proposed to explain this tissue specificity is based on the random segregation of wild type and mutant mtDNAs during embryogenesis, giving different levels of heteroplasmy in tissues (4Wallace D.C. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,7Lestienne P. Ponsot G. Lancet. 1988; i: 885Abstract Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Moraes C.T. DiMauro S.

Servidei S. DiDonato S. Ann. Neurol. 1990; 28: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this case, only tissues with a high proportion of mutated mtDNA would be affected. However, in patients where the mitochondrial mutation is homoplasmic (25Nonaka I. Curr. Opin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1992; 5: 622-632PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jacobs H.T. Ann. Med. 1997; 29: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in the case of nuclear mutations giving a uniform deficiency in all tissues, this mechanism can no longer explain the tissue specificity. For this reason, we propose another mechanism based on the threshold effect in the expression of a defect. This effect can be characterized by the following: (i) a low quantity of normal mtDNA can suffice to maintain a normal level of oxidative phosphorylation, but (ii) a minute decrease in this quantity may make the respiration and ATP synthesis of mitochondria collapse.This phenomenon has been particularly studied by Wallace and co-workers (4Wallace D.C.

Bioenerget. 1994; 17: 59-98Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) who have shown that an mtDNA mutation could present a threshold effect at the level of the phenotypic expression. Since then, the same type of observation has been reported by various authors on different models (31Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C.

We have evidenced a more specific threshold effect concerning the expression of an OXPHOS deficiency on mitochondrial respiration (36Letellier T. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem.

Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 148: 409-417Crossref Google Scholar), and we have shown that this biochemical threshold can be predicted in the framework of the metabolic control theory (41Kacser H. Burns J.A. Davis D.D. Rate Control of Biological Processes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1973: 65-104Google Scholar, 42Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J.

Biol. 1988; 135: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar).A mechanism that we propose in order to explain tissue specificity is based on this biochemical threshold effect. Indeed, its extent for each OXPHOS complex can vary according to the tissues, thus changing their sensitivity to a defect in this complex. To verify this hypothesis and to illustrate the pathological consequences of the variation in the biochemical thresholds, we studied their values for seven OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria isolated from five different tissues. Two types of behavior in the threshold curves can be distinguished, corresponding to two modes of OXPHOS response to a deficiency evidencing either an “excess of enzyme activity” or a “buffering effect by the metabolic network.” We therefore propose a classification of the tissues according to the threshold values and the type of OXPHOS response to a given complex deficiency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsRotenone, antimycin, oligomycin, carboxyatractyloside (CATR), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, cyanide (KCN), andN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) were from Sigma.AnimalsMale Wistar rats weighing 200–300 g with free access to water and standard laboratory diet were used for this study. Experimental animals were sacrificed by cervical shock and decapitation.Mitochondrial PreparationsRat muscle (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus) and heart mitochondria were isolated as detailed by Morgan-Hughes et al. (44Morgan-Hughes J.A. Darveniza P. Kkahn S.N. Landon D.N. Sherratt R.M. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Brain. 1977; 100: 617-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Liver and kidney mitochondria were isolated as described by Johnson and Lardy (45Johnson D. Lardy H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1188) Google Scholar).Brain mitochondria were isolated from whole brain according to the method described by Clark and Nicklas (46Clark J.B. Nicklas W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4724-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Protein concentration was estimated by the Biuret method (47Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The mitochondria were made up to a concentration of 50–80 mg of protein per ml in their isolation buffer.Oxygraphic MeasurementsMitochondrial oxygen consumption was monitored at 30 °C in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber equipped with a Clarke oxygen electrode, in the following respiration buffer: mannitol 75 mm, sucrose 25 mm, KCl 100 mm, Tris phosphate 10 mm, Tris/HCl 10 mm, pH 7.4, EDTA 50 μm plus respiratory substrates (pyruvate 10 mm in presence of malate 10 mm). The mitochondrial concentration used for this study was 1 mg/ml and the state 3 (according to Chance and Williams (48Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar)) was obtained by addition of ADP 2 mm.The respiratory rates were expressed in nanoatoms of O/min/mg of proteins.Enzymatic DeterminationComplex I (NADH:Ubiquinone Reductase)The oxidation of NADH by complex I was recorded using the ubiquinone analogue decylubiquinone as electron acceptor (49Birch-Machin M.A. Sheperd M. Warmough J. Sherratt H.S.A. Bartlett K. Darley-Usmar V.M. Milligan W.A. Welch R.J. Aynsley-Green A. Turnbull D.M. Pediatr. Res. 1989; 25: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Complex III (Ubiquinol:Cytochrome c Reductase)The oxidation of 20 μm decylubiquinone by complex III was determined using cytochrome c (III) as electron acceptor (49Birch-Machin M.A. Sheperd M. Warmough J. Sherratt H.S.A. Bartlett K. Darley-Usmar V.M. Milligan W.A. Welch R.J. Aynsley-Green A. Turnbull D.M. Pediatr. Res. 1989; 25: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Complex IV (Cytochrome c Oxidase)Two methods for the determination of this step were used as follows: in the first, cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using cytochrome c (II) as substrate (50Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). In the second, cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured polarographically in the presence of antimycin using ascorbate 3 mm and TMPD 0.25 mm as electron donor system.All enzymatic activities were measured at 30 °C in a final volume of 1 ml and were expressed in micromoles of product formed per min and per mg of mitochondrial proteins.Titration CurvesThe titration curves of the various steps involved in the oxidative phosphorylations were determined using specific inhibitors of these steps: rotenone for complex I, antimycin for complex III, KCN for complex IV, oligomycin for ATP synthase, CATR for adenine nucleotide translocator, mersalyl for phosphate carrier, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate for pyruvate carrier.The inhibition curves of the isolated mitochondrial respiratory rate were obtained at state 3 in the presence of pyruvate 10 mm, malate 10 mm, and enough ADP (2 mm) to maintain a stable steady state of respiration.For complexes I, III, and IV, the inhibition curves of the respiratory rate (global flux) and of the enzymatic complexes (isolated steps) were determined experimentally.However, in some cases, it was impossible to determine the activity of the isolated step in the same conditions as for the global flux. This was the case for the ATP synthase, the adenine nucleotide translocator, the phosphate carrier, and the pyruvate carrier, the activity of which are dependent on the ΔμH+generated by the respiratory chain. In these cases, the method presented by Gellerich et al. (51Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used. This method uses a non-linear regression that fits the respiratory rate inhibition curve. Non-linear fitting was done using the program Simfit (53Holzhüter H.G. Colosimo A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar).For these complexes but also for complex IV, we drew, with the program TK Solver Plus (Universal Technical Systems, Rockford, IL), the inhibition curve of the isolated step activity (Fig. 1 A, line b) using the parameters obtained by the fitting procedure and the model equations.In a previous work (36Letellier T. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we had validated the use of this model by showing that for complex IV, the experimental and fitted titration curves were superimposable.Threshold Curves and Determination of Threshold ValueThe threshold curves come from the titration curves. Each point of a threshold curve represents the respiratory rate inhibition percentage as a function of inhibition percentage of the isolated step activity for the same inhibitor concentration.For complexes I and III, the threshold curves were plotted graphically from the raw titration data. One point of the threshold curve represents the mean of several determinations on both titration curves (respiration on the ordinate versus isolated step on the abscissa) for the same inhibitor concentration.For complex IV, ATP synthase, adenine nucleotide translocator, phosphate carrier, and pyruvate carrier, the threshold curves were obtained using the titration curves resulting from the fit of the respiratory rate titration curves (51Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The threshold values were determined as described in Villani and Attardi (52Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Two linear regressions on the first and last points of the threshold curve were done using the least squares method. We then defined the threshold value as the abscissa of the intersection point between these two regression lines.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we explain part of the tissue specificity observed in mitochondrial cytopathies by the existence of a threshold (37Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40Letellier T. Malgat M. Rossignol R. Mazat J.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 148: 409-417Crossref Google Scholar) in the metabolic expression of a biochemical defect in an OXPHOS complex. We show that the threshold value for a given OXPHOS complex can vary according to the tissue. Furthermore, the threshold value can change according to the steady state of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylations that can also vary in different tissues. Thus, if in a given tissue a step has a high biochemical threshold, a mutation giving a defect of this step will not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in the mitochondrial metabolism and consequently will not affect this tissue. Conversely, if in another tissue this same step has a low biochemical threshold, the same mutation could induce a pathology.Control of Experimental ConditionsMany parameters such as the nature of mitochondria or the conditions of respiratory rate measurement (temperature, pH, and buffer composition) can change the respiratory steady state and therefore modify the threshold values (36Letellier T. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,37Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 52Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). So that the observed threshold variations can be attributed to physiological tissue properties and not to variations in experimental conditions, it was important to control these conditions, both for mitochondrial isolation and respiratory rate measurement. Thus, only the nature of the mitochondria can be responsible for any variation detected in the biochemical threshold values between different tissues.There is a risk of damaging mitochondria during their isolation and thus modifying the threshold. A loss of cytochrome c or an increase in the leak may lead to a new steady state and therefore to a possible modification of threshold values. A useful parameter to evaluate mitochondrial damage is the respiratory control ratio (48Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in our study, we used mitochondrial preparations only when the respiratory control ratio was close to values reported in the literature for the same tissues and in the same conditions. Respiratory control ratio values routinely obtained are listed in Table I.Table IRespiratory rates and respiratory control ratios of isolated mitochondria in different tissuesTissue nRespiratory rateRespiratory control ratioState 4State 3 nanoatoms O/min/mgMuscle1539.3 ± 12.1170 ± 35.64.5 ± 2.1Heart1141.5 ± 10.7189 ± 41.15.1 ± 1.2Liver1141.8 ± 9.2142 ± 20.63.2 ± 1.1Kidney936.4 ± 13.0165 ± 21.34.4 ± 1.9Brain1030.2 ± 13.9128 ± 32.42.6 ± 1.4Respirations were performed in the same respiratory buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence of pyruvate 10 mm and malate 10 mm.

Open table in a new tab In addition, the choice of respiratory conditions is decisive so that only the nature of the mitochondria is responsible for the threshold value. Indeed, state 3 respiratory rate depends on experimental conditions and notably on the buffer composition. Since optimal respiratory buffers developed for mitochondria isolated from different tissues have too great a variation in their composition (phosphate concentration, isotony maintained by sucrose or KCl), we used the same respiratory buffer for all titration experiments.Finally, the experimental parameter that we chose to characterize the steady state of the oxidative phosphorylations was the state 3 respiratory rate value. As shown in Table I, these values measured in mitochondria isolated from different tissues are similar, so the mitochondria in this experiment can be considered in the same steady state of respiration, whatever their tissue origin. The exception is the brain where the state 3 respiratory rate has an inferior value.Explanation of Threshold Curve ProfilesThreshold curves obtained in this study are similar to those already observed by many authors (37Letellier T.

In Figs. 2 and 3, however, two profiles can be distinguished independently of the step studied and of the mitochondrial tissue origin.Threshold curve profiles can be explained by an excess of enzyme activity that accounts for the plateau phase of type I threshold curves. This excess of enzyme activity can be due to an excess of enzyme (excess protein) or to up-regulating the intrinsic activity by modification in the apparent kinetic properties (different apparentK m values for instance) of the enzymatic complex. On the other hand, if there is no excess of enzyme activity, the isolated step inhibition will have a direct effect on the flux (type II profile), so the threshold curve will no longer have a plateau phase.However, a second mechanism can be implied in the type I and type II threshold curve profiles. This mechanism can be explained in the framework of metabolic control analysis (41Kacser H. Burns J.A. Davis D.D. Rate Control of Biological Processes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1973: 65-104Google Scholar, 42Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 43Reder C. J. Theor. Biol. 1988; 135: 175-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 61Kacser H. Burns J.A. Genetics. 1980; 97: 639-666Crossref Google Scholar) and involves the buffering of individual step perturbation in a metabolic network. According to this theory, the metabolic network (kinetic properties of the enzymes and structure of the system, intermediary pools of substrates, etc.) is responsible for this buffering effect. On threshold curves, buffering will give a more or less pronounced breakage. This effect is not important for a precise determination of the threshold value for type I curves because this value is principally dependent on the length of the plateau phase. Conversely, for type II curves, the buffering effect is largely responsible for the smooth shape of the curve and therefore of the difficulty in the determination of the threshold value.In summary, type I threshold curves should correspond to enzymes with a high excess of enzyme activity and type II threshold curves to enzymes with a low one. For a given enzyme, whatever its excess of activity, the buffering effect by the metabolic network will be involved in the threshold effect and will be more decisive for giving the shape of type II curves.A good example to illustrate the excess of enzyme activity and its role is shown in the threshold curve of adenine nucleotide translocator in liver mitochondria respiring on different substrates (Fig.3 F). Indeed, for this carrier, the following two profile types can be observed when the mitochondrial respiration is modified by changing respiratory substrates: type I on pyruvate and type II on succinate. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that on succinate the oxygen consumption flux (respiratory rate) increases (211 ± 13 nanoatoms of O/min/mg of proteins against 142 ± 20 nanoatoms of O/min/mg of proteins on pyruvate) and that the amount of adenine nucleotide translocator 290 pmol/mg proteins (estimated by the quantity of CATR that completely inhibits phosphorylation) allows an excess of enzyme activity on pyruvate respiration but not on succinate. Thus, the threshold value obtained with pyruvate (92 ± 1.6) was considerably decreased when succinate was used (58.6 ± 6.62). Conversely, in muscle, there is no type II threshold curve on succinate because the higher amount of adenine nucleotide translocator (1600 pmol/mg proteins) allows an excess of enzyme activity on pyruvate and even on succinate (see also Doussière et al.(58Doussière J. Ligeti E. Brandolin G. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). This behavior stresses the fact that excess of enzyme activity depends upon the OXPHOS steady state, which is in turn determined upstream by the respiratory substrate and downstream by the energy demand of the tissue (30Ballinger S.W. Shoffner J.M. Wallace D.C. Curr. Top. Bioenerget. 1994; 17: 59-98Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In summary, all the threshold curves obtained in this study clearly show that the two profile types (type I and II) can be observed for some complexes depending on the tissue origin of the mitochondria and the OXPHOS steady state.Threshold Values in Different Tissues and Tissue GroupsFor complex III and the adenine nucleotide translocator, threshold values are high and do not present a tissue variation. Thus, for these two complexes, there could be a large excess of enzyme"

Based on our finding that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) promotes free cholesterol (FC) exchange between high density lipoprotein (HDL) and cells, we tested whether SR-BI would effect FC movement in vivo using [14C]FC- and [3H]cholesteryl ester (CE)-labeled HDL in mice with increased (SR-BI transgenic (Tg)) or decreased (SR-BI attenuated (att)) hepatic SR-BI expression. The initial clearance of HDL FC was increased in SR-BI Tg mice by 72% and decreased in SR-BI att mice by 53%, but was unchanged in apoA-I knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. Transfer of FC to non-HDL and esterification of FC were minor and could not explain differences. The hepatic uptake of FC was increased in SR-BI Tg mice by 34% and decreased in SR-BI att mice by 22%. CE clearance and uptake gave similar results, but with much slower rates. The uptake of HDL FC and CE by SR-BI Tg primary hepatocytes was increased by 2.2- and 2.6-fold (1-h incubation), respectively, compared with control hepatocytes. In SR-BI Tg mice, the initial biliary secretion of [14C]FC was markedly increased, whereas increased [3H]FC appeared after a slight delay.

Epidemiological studies demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between HDL levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (1Gordon D.J. Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). Although detailed mechanisms remain uncertain, it has been proposed that HDL promotes reverse cholesterol transport by facilitating transfer of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for secretion into bile (Ref. 2Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see Ref. 3Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar for a recent review). Early studies using HDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL) with radiolabeled free cholesterol (FC) showed that FC in HDL is the preferred source for biliary cholesterol (4Schwartz C.C. Berman M.

Cantafora A. Argiolas L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent work with plant sterols provided further evidence that HDL is the preferred carrier for the transport of cholesterol into bile (9Robins S.J. Fasulo J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on the observations that HDL FC is preferentially utilized for biliary secretion and that, in tissue culture studies, HDL, but not LDL, selectively binds FC (10Stein Y. Glangeaud M.C. Fainaru M. Stein O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), Schwartz et al. (5Schwartz C.C. Halloran L.G. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gregory D.H. Swell L. Science. 1978; 200: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) predicted that a cell-surface HDL receptor might be involved in the hepatic uptake of HDL FC. As a counterpoint to this idea, free cholesterol exchanges readily between lipoproteins and cells, suggesting that passive FC uptake by the liver might be possible. Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) has recently been identified as an authentic HDL receptor that mediates the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (CE) (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.

In mice with hepatic overexpression of SR-BI, the biliary concentration of cholesterol is increased (18Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 25Sehayek E. Ono J.G. Shefer S. Nguyen L.B. Wang N. Batta A.K. Salen G. Smith J.D. Tall A.R. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These results led us to hypothesize that SR-BI plays a physiological role in vivo in promoting the hepatic uptake of HDL FC and facilitating the secretion of cholesterol into bile. We tested this hypothesis in mice with increased or attenuated expression of SR-BI. SR-BI Tg and SR-BI att mice were generated as described previously (19Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R.

ApoA-I knockout (apoA-I0) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The SR-BI Tg mice used have been backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice five times, and the apoA-I knockout mice backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice >10 times. The SR-BI att mice were in a mixed background of BALB/c/ByJ and C57BL/6J (22Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Gosselin M.L. Dixon K.L. Deeds J.D. Acton S.L. Tall A.R. Huszar D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The animals were 6 months old, weighed 25–35 g, and were housed at 22 °C under a constant light/dark cycle (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) with ad libitum access to water and rodent chow. Before the experiments, animals were fasted for 10–12 h (11:00 p.m. to 9:00–11:00 a.m.). HDL (d = 1.063–1.21) was provided from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation and was dual-labeled with [4-14C]FC and [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl oleate (NEN Life Science Products) or labeled with [cholesteryl-1,2-3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (CEth) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (26Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of the dual-labeled HDL was ∼55,000 cpm [14C]FC/μg of HDL FC and 36,000 cpm [3H]CE/μg of HDL CE. Animals were lightly anesthetized and injected with dual-labeled HDL in 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline via the femoral vein. Blood was collected periodically via the retro-orbital plexus; the plasma was immediately separated; and the HDL fraction was rapidly obtained by precipitating LDL and very low density lipoprotein with heparin/Mn2+ (HDL cholesterol reagent, Sigma). The radioactivity in HDL and the plasma was determined with a β-counter. The radioactivity in the non-HDL fraction was obtained by subtracting the radioactivity in HDL from that in the plasma. The radioactivity of 0.5 min post-injection is defined as 100% of injected radioactivity. Based on the clearance curves of HDL tracers (see Fig. 1 A), fractional clearance rates (FCRs) were calculated using a two-compartment model as described (27Le N.A. Ramakrishnan R. Dell R.B. Ginsberg H.N. Brown W.V. Methods. Enzymol. 1986; 129: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To measure esterification of HDL FC in the plasma, plasma samples were collected periodically and lipid-extracted (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar); FC and CE were separated by TLC; and radioactivity was measured. The esterification ratio is expressed as the percentage of cholesterol converted to ester. At the end of clearance experiments (usually 1 h post-injection), the liver was perfused thoroughly via the portal vein with phosphate-buffered saline. The liver was blotted dry, weighed, and stored at −80 °C. A 200-mg piece was later homogenized and lipid-extracted (29Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and radioactivity was determined. The total accumulation of HDL [14C]FC in the liver of each individual mouse was calculated from the total weight of the organ. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion (collagenase type I (Worthington), ∼0.3 mg/ml in Hanks' balanced solution supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) (30Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To prevent nonspecific digestion, protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, EDTA-free tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the perfusion buffer according to the manufacturer's instruction. Viable cells were obtained after low speed centrifugation in Percoll (Sigma). The cells were then washed, resuspended, and maintained on a six-well plate in Williams' E medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite (Life Technologies, Inc.), 30 mm pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The HDL cholesterol uptake experiment was performed the next day with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Williams' E medium. After incubation with dual-labeled HDL, cells were washed, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured (12Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The animals were anesthetized with ketamine (140 μg/g) and xylazine (14 μg/g) intraperitoneally. The abdomen was opened; the distal part of the common bile duct was ligated; and the gallbladder was incised and cannulated. The dual- or [3H]CEth-labeled HDL was injected, and bile samples were collected periodically while the animals were placed under a heating lamp to maintain body temperature. The radioactivity in bile was determined by either direct counting (no more than 40 μl of bile in 10 ml of scintillation mixture) or counting after lipid extraction and TLC. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data. To explore the role of SR-BI in the metabolism of HDL FC, the clearance of HDL cholesterol was studied in mice with different levels of hepatic SR-BI expression. [14C]FC- and [3H]CE-labeled HDL was injected intravenously, and blood samples were obtained at different time points. To avoid ex vivo transfer of free cholesterol radioactivity between lipoproteins, HDL was rapidly separated from other plasma components by precipitation (7Portman O.W. Alexander M. O'Malley J.P.

Invest. 1982; 70: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the clearance of HDL [14C]FC was dramatically faster in SR-BI Tg mice and slower in SR-BI att mice. Fifty percent of HDL FC was removed from the plasma within 1.8 min (t 12) in SR-BI Tg mice, compared with 3.2 and 7.0 min in WT and SR-BI att mice, respectively. To determine whether the increased clearance of HDL FC in SR-BI Tg mice was due simply to a decreased level of HDL, the clearance of HDL FC was also measured in apoA-I0 mice, which have similarly decreased levels of HDL (32Williamson R. Lee D. Hagaman J. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7134-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but normal hepatic SR-BI expression (14Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Despite dramatically decreased plasma HDL levels, apoA-I0 mice exhibited a similar clearance of HDL FC compared with WT mice, especially in the initial stage (t 12 = 3.0 min) (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether the accelerated clearance of HDL FC in SR-BI Tg mice was caused by rapid transfer of HDL FC to other plasma lipoproteins, the clearance of [14C]FC in the non-HDL fraction of the plasma was measured. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the activity of [14C]FC in the non-HDL fraction was relatively low and similar in mice of different genotypes, indicating that transfer of HDL [14C]FC to non-HDL lipoproteins could not account for differences in the rapid disappearance of HDL [14C]FC. The FCRs of HDL FC in different mice were calculated using a two-compartment model (27Le N.A. Ramakrishnan R. Dell R.B. Ginsberg H.N. Brown W.V. Methods. Enzymol. 1986; 129: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and are shown in TableI. The FCR was increased by 292% in SR-BI Tg mice and decreased by 54% in SR-BI att mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01 for both). The FCR was increased by 66% in apoA-I0 mice (p < 0.01) compared with WT mice, reflecting the strong influence of the final time point in the model. However, when the initial rate of clearance was calculated, the value was almost the same for apoA-I0 and WT mice (15.8 versus16.3 pools/h), but the increase in SR-BI Tg mice and the decrease in SR-BI att mice remained (by 72 and 53%; p = 0.007 and 0.00001, respectively) (Table I). The data indicate that the observed differences in HDL FC clearance are related primarily to SR-BI expression and not to HDL pool size.Table IFractional clearance rates of HDL [ 14 C]FC and [ 3 H]CE in miceMiceSR-BI TgWTApoA-I0SR-BI attFCR1-aThe FCRs were calculated using a two-compartment model (27) and are expressed as pools/h.

Open table in a new tab To assess the possibility of HDL cholesterol being rapidly taken up by the liver as ester, the esterification rate of HDL FC in plasma was measured. The esterification of FC was negligible 0.5 min after HDL injection: 0.6 and 0.4% of HDL [14C]FC was esterified in WT and SR-BI Tg mice, respectively. At 4 min, only 2.1 and 1.6% of [14C]FC was converted to ester, whereas by that time, >60 and 80% of [14C]FC had already been removed from HDL in WT and SR-BI Tg mice, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Cholesterol esterification is decreased in SR-BI Tg mice due to a functional deficiency of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (19Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rapid clearance of HDL [14C]FC in SR-BI Tg mice was not a result of the hepatic uptake of esterified [14C]cholesterol from HDL. The clearance of HDL CE was measured simultaneously with the clearance of HDL FC (data not shown). Consistent with our earlier observations (19Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Gosselin M.L. Dixon K.L.

A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the clearance of HDL [3H]CE was accelerated in SR-BI Tg mice (t 12 = 0.4 h) and decreased in SR-BI att mice (t 12 = 2.4 h) compared with WT mice (t 12 = 1.1 h); the clearance of HDL [3H]CE in apoA-I0 mice (t 12 = 0.9 h) was similar to that in WT mice. In all cases, HDL CE was cleared much slower than HDL FC. SR-BI Tg mice overexpress SR-BI specifically in the liver, whereas SR-BI att mice have 50% decreased hepatic expression of SR-BI. To determine the effect of SR-BI expression on the hepatic uptake of HDL [14C]FC from the plasma, the accumulation of [14C]FC in the liver was measured. As shown in Fig.2, ∼76% of [14C]FC was taken up by the liver in SR-BI Tg mice 1 h after HDL was injected, a 34% increase compared with WT mice (p < 0.05). In contrast, SR-BI att mice exhibited a 22% decrease in the hepatic uptake of HDL FC (p < 0.05). Compared with WT mice, the uptake of HDL [14C]FC by the liver in apoA-I0 mice was not significantly different (47% versus 42%). Similarly, the hepatic uptake of HDL [3H]CE was increased by 346% in SR-BI Tg mice and decreased by 63% in SR-BI att mice (p < 0.01 for both), consistent with earlier reports (19Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H.

The uptake of HDL CE in apoA-I0 mice was not significantly different from that in WT mice (10.3% versus 9.4%). In vitro experiments were also performed to compare the uptake of HDL cholesterol by primary hepatocytes with different expression levels of SR-BI. The SR-BI protein levels in primary hepatocytes from SR-BI Tg mice, assessed at the end of the experiments, were ∼6-fold higher than in hepatocytes from control mice (data not shown). During a 1-h incubation, hepatocytes in primary culture from SR-BI Tg mice exhibited a 2.2-fold increase in the uptake of HDL [14C]FC compared with WT hepatocytes; the uptake of HDL [3H]CE was increased by 2.6-fold in SR-BI Tg hepatocytes (Fig. 3). Thus, the cellular uptake of HDL FC and CE by hepatocytes was stimulated by increased levels of SR-BI expression. Taken together, both in vivo and in vitro data demonstrate clearly that SR-BI plays a critical role in the hepatic uptake of HDL FC as well as HDL CE from the circulation. To explore the role of SR-BI in biliary cholesterol secretion, dual-labeled HDL was injected, and the transport of HDL cholesterol into bile was compared in different mice. The rise in biliary [14C]FC radioactivity paralleled the fall in plasma HDL [14C]FC radioactivity and reached a plateau within 17.5 min (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig. 4, in SR-BI Tg mice, HDL [14C]FC radioactivity appeared more rapidly in bile than HDL [3H]CE radioactivity. At 2.5 and 7.5 min, the secretion of HDL [14C]FC into bile was increased by 5.1- and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared with WT mice (p < 0.05 for both). In contrast, the initial secretion rate of cholesterol derived from HDL [3H]CE was not significantly different in SR-BI Tg mice versus WT mice, but was significantly increased at later time points (Fig.4 B). SR-BI att mice tended to have decreased biliary secretion of HDL FC and CE radioactivity, although the difference between SR-BI att and WT mice was not significant (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, these data indicate that SR-BI overexpression enhances the rate of biliary secretion of cholesterol derived from both HDL FC and CE. Biliary cholesterol from SR-BI Tg mice was characterized by TLC after lipid extraction. Although almost all (>99%) HDL [14C]FC remained unesterified in bile, ∼73% of HDL [3H]CE appeared in unesterified form, and surprisingly, 27% was secreted into bile as CE. To confirm this observation, HDL labeled with non-hydrolyzable [3H]CEth was injected. A portion of [3H]CEth (0.2%) was detected in bile 1 h after HDL injection, compared with 2.1% of HDL [3H]CE and 2.2% of HDL [14C]FC. The results indicate that, in mice, a significant amount of HDL CE is secreted into bile as an intact molecule, although most of HDL CE is hydrolyzed before secretion. This study provides the first evidence for an in vivorole of SR-BI in the metabolism of HDL FC. SR-BI promotes the uptake of HDL FC by primary hepatocytes and facilitates the rapid clearance of HDL FC by the liver. The magnitude of these effects was large (Fig. 1 and Table I), suggesting that a major part of the clearance of FC from plasma is receptor-mediated rather than passive. Furthermore, SR-BI overexpression enhances the secretion of HDL cholesterol radioactivity into bile, including both the initial secretion of HDL FC and the slower secretion of FC and CE derived from HDL CE. Our study provides strong evidence that the rapid clearance of HDL FC by the liver and its subsequent appearance in bile (5Schwartz C.C. Halloran L.G. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gregory D.H. Swell L. Science. 1978; 200: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) can be mediated by SR-BI. HDL plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis. It has been recognized for >2 decades that HDL FC is the preferred substrate for biliary steroid (see Ref. 33Botham K.M. Bravo E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar for review). Schwartz et al.(4Schwartz C.C. Berman M. Vlahcevic Z.R. Halloran L.G. Gregory D.H. Swell L. J. Clin.

By injecting [3H]FC- or [14C]FC-labeled HDL and LDL simultaneously into bile fistula patients, these investigators further showed that a much larger fraction of HDL FC than LDL FC is used for biliary secretion and that the radioactivity of HDL FC appears and peaks in bile much faster than that of LDL (5Schwartz C.C.

To characterize the regulation of Smad7 at the transcriptional level, we isolated the promoter region of the mouse Smad7 gene. When the Smad7 promoter luciferase reporter gene (−408 and +112 bp) was expressed in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, its transcriptional activity was increased following TGF-β or activin treatment. In addition, this region of the Smad7 promoter was stimulated by ectopic expression of Smad3 as well as constitutively active TGF-β and activin receptors, indicating that Smad7 transcription was modulated by the signaling downstream those two receptors. A gel mobility shift assay indicated that a DNA fragment spanning −408 to −126 base pairs (bp) was able to directly bind purified Smad4. Furthermore, a consensus Smad3-Smad4 binding element (SBE) was discovered in this region of the promoter with a palindromic sequence of GTCTAGAC. A 33-bp Smad7 promoter fragment containing this SBE was able to bind Smad3 and Smad4. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the expression of constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor was able to induce the formation of a Smad3- and Smad4-containing nuclear protein complex that bound the SBE. In HepG2 cells, TGF-β1 treatment could induce the formation of an endogenous SBE-binding complex.

Smad proteins, when translocated into the nucleus, function as transcriptional regulators that control the expression of target genes (2Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Smad exerts its transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with either a specific transcription factor or a specific DNA element. In Xenopus, Smad2 and Smad4 participate in the activin-mediated transcriptional induction of the Mix.2promoter through an interaction with a specific DNA-binding transcription factor, forkhead activin signal transducer-1 (FAST-1), a member of the winged-helix forkhead transcription factor family (24Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar,25Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). FAST-1 has two functional domains that mediate DNA binding and Smad association respectively. The DNA binding motif of FAST-1 mediates the interaction of FAST-1 with an activin-responsive element on theXenopus Mix.2 promoter, and the Smad interaction domain is involved in the association with the Smad2-Smad4 complex (25Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition to the interaction of Smad with other transcription factors, recent studies have suggested that Smad can directly bind DNA. In Drosophila, Mad protein is able to directly bind a GC-rich region of various enhancers (32Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A PCR-based screening with random sequences has led to the discovery of specific binding of Smad3 and Smad4 with a palindromic DNA sequence (33Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad4 were also found to bind a CAGA motif in the promoter of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (34Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). Once Smad protein associates with either a transcription factor or a DNA element, its C-terminal MH2 domain may exert a transactivation function (6Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J.

This function of the MH2 domain was supported by the recent discovery that Smad may interact with the general transcription coactivators CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300 (35Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Feng X.H. Zhang Y.

CBP/p300 may bridge the general transcription machinery and Smad proteins or the Smad-associated transcription factors, e.g, FAST-1 or FAST-2, and enable the transcriptional regulation of target genes. Recent studies have indicated that the inhibitory Smad proteins may play a role in a negative feedback loop that modulates the signaling by TGF-β, activin, and BMP. Treatment of Mv1Lu mink lung cells and HaCaT keratinocytes with TGF-β led to a transient increase of the Smad7 mRNA steady state level (17Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). In mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells, activin is able to induce an increase of the steady state level of Smad7 mRNA (19Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Nakao A. Nonaka K. Ohguchi M. ten Dijke P. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24293-24296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment with BMP2 or BMP7 induces an increase of the Smad6 mRNA level in a number of mouse cell lines (39Takase M. Imamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Those studies have suggested that the inhibitory Smad proteins could be up-regulated by signaling of the TGF-β superfamily; such a regulation might be involved in desensitization of the cells to the continued exposure of ligand. To understand the mechanism underlying the regulation of the inhibitory Smad message, we isolated a mouse Smad7 promoter and characterized the regulation of the promoter by TGF-β and activin signaling at the transcriptional level. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Transient cell transfection was performed by a calcium phosphate method for HEK293 cells (12Chen Y. Lebrun J.J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and a DEAE-dextran method for HepG2 cells (40Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment corresponding to about 500 bp of the 5′-end of a rat Smad7 cDNA was used to screen a mouse 129SvJ genomic library (Stratagene) under high stringency conditions. Ten positive clones were isolated from 5 × 105 phages. The inserts of these clones were released byEcoRI digestion and subcloned into KS+ pBluescript (Stratagene). Analysis by restriction enzyme digestion and partial sequencing of each of those clones revealed that 6 of them have DNA sequences 5′ to the Smad7 cDNA probe. Both strands of a 520-bp fragment (released by KpnI and XhoI digestion) next to the 5′-end of the cDNA probe were completely sequenced (Sequenase version 2, United States Biochemical). The clone that contained the largest 5′ sequence of the Smad7 gene was 4.3 kb. The whole 4.3-kb fragment contained multiple KpnI sites at the positions −4.2, −2.2, and −408 bp and a single XhoI site at +112 bp relative to the major transcription initiation site. Different lengths of the Smad7 promoter generated by partial digestion by KpnI and complete digestion by XhoI were subcloned into the pGL2-basic luciferase plasmid (Promega). The −408 to −124-bp Smad7 promoter/luciferase construct was generated by digestion of the Smad7 genomic clone with KpnI and StuI followed by subcloning into the same luciferase plasmid. The −283 to −124-bp promoter construct was generated by XbaI and StuI digestion, and the released fragment was subcloned into KS+ pBluescript and then cloned into the luciferase plasmid. The −283 to −124-bp construct would change the putative Smad binding motif GTCTAGAC of the Smad7 promoter to CTCTAGAC. For promoter assays, approximately 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates were transfected with different combinations of plasmid DNA. PCMV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection by lysis with 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (15Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In TGF-β- or activin-treated groups, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) or activin A (10 ng/ml) for 12 h before harvest. Twenty μl of the lysate was used for the β-galactosidase assay as reported previously (12Chen Y. Lebrun J.J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and 10 μl of the lysate was used for the luciferase assay using a Promega luciferase assay kit. The samples were counted for 10 s in a FB12 luminometer (Zylux), and the data were represented as the relative light unit/second. An oligonucleotide (5′-GCTCGAGTCCTTCTGCCGCCG-3′) corresponding to the very 5′-end of the known mouse Smad7 cDNA sequence was labeled at its 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the presence of [γ32P]ATP. The labeled probe was annealed with total RNA (2–4 μg) isolated from mouse aorta, mouse whole brain, and C2C12 mouse myoblast cells. The extension reaction was performed in the presence of actinomycin D (20 ng/ml), the four dNTPs (0.5 mm each), 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 50 °C for 30 min. The reaction was then extracted with phenol, precipitated by isopropanol, and loaded on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. An unrelated plasmid was sequenced and used as a marker to determine the relative position of the primer extension product. A 282-bp fragment (−408 to −124 bp) of the Smad7 promoter was released byKpnI and StuI digestion and subcloned into KS+ pBluescript. This insert was then cut from pBluescript byKpnI and BamHI digestion and labeled with32P by a fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega). A 33-bp probe containing the putative Smad binding element was generated by annealing two oligonucleotides (5′-TCGACAGGGTGTCTAGACGGCCACG-3′ and 5′-TCGACGTGGCCGTCTAGACACCCTG-3′). This reaction created a 5′ overhang, which was labeled with32P using a fill-in reaction as described above. The probes (5 × 104 cpm) were incubated with about 0.2 μg of GST or GST-fusion proteins or 2 μg of nuclear extracts in a buffer containing a final concentration of 4% glycerol, 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC). The nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously by others (41Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then separated by 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE and detected by autoradiography. The wild type Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and the constitutively active activin type I receptor have been described previously (12Chen Y. Lebrun J.J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Chen Y. Bhushan A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12938-12943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Smad3 (G/S) mutant was generated by a PCR strategy that specifically changed glycine 379 to serine. The C-terminal truncation of Smad3 was generated by removing the region that spans a HpaI site and the end the cDNA clone. These mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of the GST fusion proteins were generated by in-frame fusion of the full-length Smad cDNA with pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 strain (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. Smad7 is a newly found regulatory protein that is able to antagonize TGF-β and activin signaling (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad7 has been implicated in a negative feedback loop in which TGF-β and activin treatment in different cells were able to increase the expression of Smad7 (17Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 19Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Nakao A. Nonaka K. Ohguchi M. ten Dijke P. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24293-24296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether the regulation of Smad7 expression occurs at the transcriptional level, we isolated the 5′ region of the mouse Smad7 gene. A 500-bp probe corresponding to the 5′-end of rat Smad7 cDNA was used to screen a mouse genomic library at high stringency. Six independent clones that contain sequences 5′ to the Smad7 cDNA were isolated. Genomic mapping analysis using restriction enzyme digestion and partial sequencing of these clones confirmed that we obtained as much as 4.3 kb of the 5′ sequence of the Smad7 gene (data not shown). The 512-bp fragment adjacent to the Smad7 cDNA sequence was subjected to full sequencing (Fig. 1 A). To identify the putative transcription initiation site, we used a primer extension assay with the total RNA isolated from mouse aorta, mouse whole brain, or the mouse C2C12 myoblast cells. In all of the RNA samples, a major extension product was detected 113 bp upstream of the extension primer (Fig. 1 B) with two minor sites located at 241 and 302 bp, respectively (Fig. 1 B). For clarity of data presentation, this major initiation site was designated the +1 position. Sequence information suggests that there was no TATA box in the promoter region. However, the promoter region has multiple Sp1 sites, which are common to most TATA-less promoters (42Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In addition, there appears to be a transcription factor IId (TFIID) binding site about 200 bp away from the major initiation site, indicating that the binding of TFIID at this site might contribute to the initiation of Smad7 transcription. We next determined whether this putative Smad7 promoter was regulated by TGF-β and activin signaling. Different lengths of Smad7 promoter sequence were fused with a basic luciferase reporter that did not contain any promoter sequence or TATA box. These reporter constructs spanned from −4.2 kb, −2.2kb, or −408 to +112 bp relative to the major transcription initiation site. When these three luciferase fusion plasmids were transfected in HEK293 cells, all of them gave rise to very high luciferase activity, over 100-fold higher than the value from the cells transfected with the parental luciferase vector (data not shown). These data suggested that the Smad7 genomic clone that we isolated, especially the −408 to +112-bp region, did contain an endogenous transcription initiation site controlled by the basic transcriptional machinery. In addition, we have made another luciferase fusion plasmid that contains the sequence from the −2.2 kb to −408-bp region, and when transfected in HEK293 cells, this construct gave no appreciable promoter activity (data not shown), further indicating that the transcription of the Smad7 gene starts from a region within the −408 to +112-bp area. We next transfected these luciferase constructs into human HepG2 cells that contain functional TGF-β and activin receptors (30Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 43Zauberman A. Oren M. Zipori D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1705-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of these cells with activin A or TGF-β1 was able to stimulate the activity of these promoter constructs (Fig.2 A). Activin or TGF-β treatment was able to induce the activity of all three promoter constructs 5–7-fold. Both of the longer constructs had a slightly higher basal activity when compared with the −408 to +112-bp construct. However, the fold inductions by either activin or TGF-β treatment were very similar among the three promoter constructs. These data, therefore, provided the first piece of evidence that the Smad7 promoter could be regulated by TGF-β and activin at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, they suggested that the putative regulatory element(s) that mediates the TGF-β and activin effect is localized within the −408 to +112-bp region. To further characterize the regulation of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β and activin signaling, we analyzed the ability of different Smad proteins and serine receptor kinases of the TGF-β superfamily to transactivate the Smad7 promoter (Fig. 2 B). Transfection of Smad3, but not Smad1, Smad2, or Smad4 alone, into HepG2 cells was able to stimulate the promoter activity of the −408 to +112-bp construct. This is consistent with previous findings that Smad3, when overexpressed, is able by itself to up-regulate target genes downstream of TGF-β and activin signaling (12Chen Y. Lebrun J.J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, Smad3 appeared to synergize with Smad4 to stimulate the Smad7 promoter, as co-expression of Smad3 and Smad4 was able to strongly increase the promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the constitutively active activin type I receptor (ALK-4) and TGF-β type I receptor (ALK-5), but not the type I receptor for BMP2/4 (ALK-3) were able to significantly stimulate the Smad7 promoter, although TGF-β type I receptor appeared to be stronger than ALK-4 in the transactivation. Interestingly, activation of the Smad7 promoter by ALK-4 and ALK-5 could be antagonized by co-expression of Smad7 (Fig. 2 B). In addition, we used dominant negative Smad3 to further determine whether Smad proteins were involved in the activation of the Smad7 promoter by TGF-β signaling. Both the Smad3 G/S point mutation and the C-terminal deletion constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells together with the −408 to +112-bp Smad7 promoter construct (Fig. 2 C). The G/S mutation was originally discovered in Drosophila Mad in which it led to a compromised development characteristic of a defective decapentaplegic (dpp) pathway (44Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this mutation is able to disrupt the signaling by TGF-β family members. The C terminus or MH2 domain of Smads has been implicated in the transactivating activity of these proteins (6Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). We found that both G/S point mutation and C-terminal deletion of Smad3 was able to significantly ablate the TGF-β-mediated activation of Smad7 promoter. Taken together, these data would support a model in which Smad7 is involved in a mutual feedback regulation in TGF-β and activin signaling. Activation of TGF-β or activin signaling by ligand binding may initiate Smad7 transcription, which may desensitize the further signaling by TGF-β or activin. Meanwhile, the shut-off of this signaling by up-regulated Smad7 also blocks its own transcription, making the cells available to respond to new stimuli after a certain delay that would be dependent on the turnover rate of Smad7. Transcriptional regulation by TGF-β or activin signaling is achieved mainly by two pathways. One of them is the interaction of Smad proteins with other transcription factors that bind specific sequences of TGF-β/activin-responsive promoters. The classical example of this category is the FAST-2-mediated transcriptional regulation of the Mix.2 promoter in which Smad2 and Smad4 need to complex with FAST-2 in order to mediate TGF-β or activin response (24Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The second mode of transcriptional regulation by TGF-β or activin is through direct binding of Smad3 and Smad4 with specific DNA sequences. This pathway is exemplified by the finding that these two Smad proteins are able to associate with the promoter of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene (34Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). To explore the possible mechanism underlying the TGF-β- and activin-mediated transcriptional regulation of the Smad7 promoter, we used a gel mobility shift assay to determine whether Smad proteins directly bind Smad7 promoter. A 282-bp DNA fragment that spans from −408 to −126 bp was labeled with32P and used in a gel shift assay with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 GST fusion proteins (Fig.3 A). Compared with GST alone (Fig. 3 A, lane 1), the full-length Smad2 protein could not cause any appreciable shift of the probe (lane 2). The full-length Smad3 protein led to a slightly detectable shift of the probe (lane 3). Furthermore, this 282-bp probe was significantly shifted by the full-length Smad4 fusion protein (lane 7), and this shift could be competed off by the excess of cold 282-fragment (lane 8), supporting the specificity of the binding of Smad4 to the sequence. Our gel shift assay with the 282-bp probe provided the clue that Smad3 and Smad4 may directly bind the Smad7 promoter and mediate the transcriptional response by TGF-β and activin signaling. Careful examination of the Smad7 promoter sequence has led our attention to a putative Smad binding element inside the −408 to +112-bp region, in which there is indeed a consensus Smad binding sequence previously identified through a PCR-based oligonucleotide screening with the MH1 domain of Smad3 and Smad4 (33Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). It has been found that both Smad3 and Smad4 could preferentially bind an octamer sequence GTCTAGXC (X stands for any one of the four nucleotides). The Smad7 promoter contains a palindromic sequence of GTCTAGAC in the area spanning −285 to −278 bp (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether this putative Smad binding element (SBE) confers the binding of Smad7 promoter to Smad3 and Smad4, we used a synthetic oligonucleotide probe that covered this consensus binding element. As shown in Fig.3 B, this 33-bp probe was not able to bind GST or the Smad2 fusion protein (lanes 1 and 2). However, Smad3 was able to associate with this probe (lane 4), and this binding could be competed off by increasing concentrations of the cold oligonucleotide (lanes 5-7). Furthermore, the binding of Smad3 with the 33-bp probe could be supershifted by an anti-Myc antibody that recognizes the Myc epitope tag of Smad3 (lanes 8-10). In addition to Smad3 binding, the probe could strongly bind the Smad4 (lane 11) that was competed off by the cold probe (lanes 12-14), and it appeared that Smad4 might bind this sequence as a monomer, dimer, or trimer. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that Smad3 and Smad4 were able to directly associate with the consensus Smad binding motif of the Smad7 promoter. To further determine whether the binding of Smad3 or Smad4 with this consensus sequence is involved in the binding of these Smad proteins with the longer Smad7 promoter (i.e. the 282-bp probe), we examined the ability of the 33-bp cold probe to compete with the binding of Smad proteins with the 282-bp fragment. Inclusion of this 33-bp cold oligonucleotide was able to completely compete off the binding of Smad4 with the 282-bp probe (Fig. 3 A, lane 9), further indicating that the binding of these Smad proteins to the Smad7 promoter is conferred by the SBE. We next examined whether an intact SBE was required for the responsiveness of the Smad7 promoter to activin and TGF-β treatment. We used two Smad7 promoter constructs, −408 to −124 bp and −283 to −124 bp. The −283 to −124-bp construct had a partial truncation in the 5′-end of the SBE, and this truncation changed the putative SBE of the Smad7 promoter from GTCTAGAC to CTCTAGAC (i.e. G to C at the first position). When the −408 to −124-bp construct containing the intact SBE sequence was transfected into HepG2 cells, it was stimulated by both activin and TGF-β treatment (Fig.4). However, the −283 to −124-bp construct was no longer responsive to activin or TGF-β, further indicating that this consensus Smad binding motif in the Smad7 promoter was involved in activin- and TGF-β-mediated transcriptional regulation. Ligand binding of TGF-β or activin to membrane receptors is followed by the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 at the C-terminal ends by the kinase activity of the type I receptor. The phosphorylated Smads then complex with Smad4, and the complex is then translocated into the nucleus. We used another gel shift experiment to determine whether the nucleus-localized Smad2-Smad4 and Smad3-Smad4 complexes activated by the TGF-β receptor attained the capacity to bind the SBE of Smad7 promoter. The Myc-tagged Smad2, Myc-tagged Smad3, and FLAG-tagged Smad4 were transfected into HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor, CA-ALK-5. The transfected cells were used to prepare nuclear extracts for a gel shift assay with the 33-bp SBE probe. As shown in Fig.5 A, expression of CA-ALK-5 did not induce a detectable SBE-binding complex in vector-transfected cells (lane 2 compared with lane 1), indicating that the endogenous level of the Smad2-Smad4 or Smad3-Smad4 complexes activated by the receptor might be too low to be detected under our experimental condition. Likewise, transfection of Smad2 or Smad4 alone could not lead to a detectable complex that binds the probe upon co-expression of CA-ALK-5 (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). However, expression of Smad3 in these cells was able to mediate the formation of a SBE-binding complex that was induced by co-expressed TGF-β type I receptor (lane 6 compared with lane 5), indicating that the activated receptor may aid in the nuclear translocation of Smad3 or the expressed Smad3 could cooperate with endogenous Smad4 to bind Smad7 SBE. When Smad2 was co-expressed with Smad4 in these cells, CA-ALK-5 clearly induced a SBE binding complex (lane 10 compared with lane 9) that contained Smad4, as detected by the supershift assay with an anti-FLAG antibody (lane 12). As expected, co-expression of Smad3 with Smad4 led to a receptor-inducible formation of a complex that binds Smad7 promoter (lane 14 compared with lane 13), and this complex contained both Smad3 (lane 15, supershift with anti-Myc antibody) and Smad4 (lane 16, supershift with anti-FLAG antibody). These data clearly indicate that TGF-β signaling is able to induce the formation of Smad2-Smad4 and Smad3-Smad4 complexes in the nucleus and that these complexes are implicated in the regulation of Smad7 promoter through the direct interaction of Smad3 or Smad4 with the SBE of the Smad7 promoter. It is also interesting to note that the putative nuclear Smad2-Smad4 complex may behave differently from the Smad3-Smad4 complex in its interaction with the Smad7 promoter. We could not detect a convincing presence of Smad2 in the hypothetical SBE-binding Smad2-Smad4 complex by the gel shift assay (Fig. 5 A, lane 11), although Smad2 expression was confirmed by anti-Myc Western blotting analysis with the same nuclear extracts (data not shown). This observation indicates that Smad4 may dissociate from Smad2 after the Smad2-Smad4 complex is translocated into the nucleus. Our functional analysis with Smad7 promoter constructs has indicated that signaling with TGF-β and activin was able to activate the promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). To further confirm that this transactivation was directly related to the regulation of the SBE present in Smad7 promoter, we asked whether or not TGF-β1 treatment in HepG2 cells was able to induce the formation of an endogenous nuclear protein complex that binds the SBE. HepG2 cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 30, 60, and 120 min, and the nuclear extracts were used in a gel shift experiment with the 33-bp SBE probe. As shown in Fig. 5 B, TGF-β1 did induce the formation of a nuclear complex that associated with this SBE probe, and the association appeared to reach a maximum at 60 min after the treatment. Because this SBE was able to associate specifically with Smad3 and Smad4 (Figs. 3 and 5 A), these data strongly suggest that TGF-β was able to induce the formation of an endogenous Smad complex that binds the SBE of Smad7 promoter. In conclusion, our initial characterization of the Smad7 promoter provides one of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of this inhibitory Smad by TGF-β and activin signaling at the transcriptional level. Treatment with TGF-β and activin in HepG2 cells was able to stimulate the activity of the Smad7 promoter. Furthermore, the Smad7 promoter contains a Smad binding element that is able to directly associate with Smad3 and Smad4. Activation of TGF-β signaling by the activated type I receptor was able to mediate the formation of a nuclear Smad3-Smad4 complex that bound the Smad7 promoter. These data clearly indicated that TGF-β and activin signaling may activate their cognate Smad proteins to transactivate the promoter of Smad7, which in turn blocks the signaling by these two extracellular factors. In addition to the function in a negative feedback loop that modulates TGF-β and activin signaling, regulation of the Smad7 message has been identified in other biological processes. The Smad7 mRNA level is up-regulated by laminar shear stress in vascular endothelial cells (45Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.Y. Deeds J.D. Feeley R. Gimeno C.J. Woolf E.A. Tayber O. Mays G.G. Sampson B.A. Schoen F.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ is also able to stimulate the expression of Smad7 through JAK1 and STAT1 to block TGF-β signaling (46Ulloa L. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). With the cloned Smad7 promoter, it is now more feasible to address the question of how this inhibitory Smad is regulated by multiple signals at the transcriptional level. We thank R. Harland for the mouse Smad2 clone and M. Schutte for the human Smad4 clone. We also thank L. Carr for careful reading and constructive comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2006823377,"The chromophore binding properties of the higher plant light-harvesting complex II have been studied by site-directed mutagenesis of pigment-binding residues. Mutant apoproteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and then refoldedin vitro with purified chromophores to yield holoproteins selectively affected in chlorophyll-binding sites. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization showed a specific loss of pigments and absorption spectral forms for each mutant, thus allowing identification of the chromophores bound to most of the binding sites. On these bases a map for the occupancy of individual sites by chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b is proposed. In some cases a single mutation led to the loss of more than one chromophore indicating that four chlorophylls and one xanthophyll could be bound by pigment-pigment interactions. Differential absorption spectroscopy allowed identification of the Qy transition energy level for each chlorophyll within the complex. It is shown that not only site selectivity is largely conserved between light-harvesting complex II and CP29 but also the distribution of absorption forms among different protein domains, suggesting conservation of energy transfer pathways within the protein and outward to neighbor subunits of the photosystem. The chromophore binding properties of the higher plant light-harvesting complex II have been studied by site-directed mutagenesis of pigment-binding residues. Mutant apoproteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and then refoldedin vitro with purified chromophores to yield holoproteins selectively affected in chlorophyll-binding sites. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization showed a specific loss of pigments and absorption spectral forms for each mutant, thus allowing identification of the chromophores bound to most of the binding sites. On these bases a map for the occupancy of individual sites by chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b is proposed.

Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These pigment proteins are organized around photosynthetic reaction centers to form supramolecular complexes embedded into the thylakoid membranes. Lhc proteins bind about 70% of the pigments involved in plant photosynthesis. Understanding of energy transfer processes in the antenna and reaction centers requires recognition of the topological organization of subunits (2Bassi R. Sandonà D. Croce R. Physiol.

Although the elucidation of LHCII structure at 3.4 Å resolution (5Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) has allowed localization of chlorophyll-binding sites and of their relative distances, identification of transition dipole orientation and energy levels are precluded by insufficient resolution of the structure so far obtained or are not accessible by structural methods. Among Lhc proteins the most abundant is LHCII, which can be isolated as an heterotrimeric complex of the Lhcb1–3 gene products (6De Luca C. Varotto C. Svendsen I. Polverino-De Laureto P. Bassi R. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 49: 50-60Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). LHCII binds 7 Chl1 a, 5 Chl b, and three xanthophyll molecules/mol of polypeptide (1.6–1.8 mol of lutein, 0.2–0.4 mol of violaxanthin, and 1.0 mol of neoxanthin) and is the best characterized Lhc polypeptide.

Knowledge of the energy transfer factors for this protein would be a major step toward elucidation of light harvesting function. In this study we have used mutation analysis with the aim of the identification and characterization of the chromophores bound to each site; a series of mutant apoproteins was constructed by overexpression in bacteria of theLhcb1 gene in which individual chlorophyll-binding residues (5Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) were substituted for by residues unable to coordinate porphyrins. Upon in vitro refolding with purified pigments, proteins missing specific chromophores were obtained in their monomeric form, which could be trimerized by addition of lipids (11Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this work we focus on the monomeric form of LHCII to avoid the effect of inter-subunit interactions on the spectral properties of individual chlorophylls that could complicate the attribution of spectral forms to individual sites. Biochemical analysis and differential absorption spectroscopy allows a proposed map for the chemical nature and the absorption properties of chlorophylls within individual sites. Plasmids were constructed using standard molecular cloning procedures (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutations were obtained according to the method of Yukenberg et al. (16Yukenberg P.D. Withey F. Geisselsoder J. McClary J. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 27-48Google Scholar). The sequence was determined by the dideoxy method (17Sanger F. Nicken S. Carlson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) by an automated apparatus (Applied Biosystems model 377). LHCII was isolated from the SG13009 strain transformed with the lhcb1 construct following a protocol previously described (10Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 18Nagai K. Thogersen H.C.

Purification was performed as described in Giuffra et al. (20Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with the modifications reported in Croce et al. (10Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For determination of pigment to protein stoichiometry, it was necessary to obtain fully purified complexes that did not contain any residual contamination by bacterial proteins. The reconstituted LHCII was thus purified by preparative isoelectrofocusing (21Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by ultracentrifugation in glycerol gradient (15–40% including 0.06% dodecylmaltoside and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6; run was for 12 h at 60,000 rpm in SW60 Beckman rotor) to eliminate ampholytes. The concentration of the LHCII apoprotein purified from E. coli inclusion bodies was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). For stoichiometric (pigments/protein ratio) determination, the protein concentration was determined by the ninhydrin method (23Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 325-329Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined by the method of Porra et al. (24Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was as in Ref. 25Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 543: 137-145Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar. Chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratio was independently measured by fitting of acetone extract spectra with the spectra of individual purified pigments as described previously (9Connelly J.P. Muller M. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were obtained using a SLM-Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were obtained by using a Jasco-600 spectrofluorimeter. CD spectra were obtained at 8 °C with a Jasco FP-777 spectropolarimeter. Samples were in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.06% dodecylmaltoside, 20% glycerol. Chlorophyll concentration was about 10 g/ml for CD and absorption measurements and 0.01 g/ml for fluorescence measurements. Analysis of spectra by Gaussian deconvolution and second derivative analysis was performed by using the (OriginTM MicroCal. Soft. Inc.) software package. Mutations were performed on the nine amino acid residues in the LHCII sequence that have been proposed from the structure to provide ligation of Chl molecules (5Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). In the case of Chl A6 ligand proposed to be the peptidyl carbonyl group of glycine 78, which is made available for coordination by being not involved in intra-helix H-bonds with the α-amino group of the proline residue 82, we have changed proline 82 into valine to eliminate the peptidyl-carbonyl of Gly78from coordination by H binding to Val82. In the case of ligation by glutamate/arginine ionic pairs, mutation of the glutamate only would leave a noncompensated charged residue into the hydrophobic core of the protein thus disturbing protein folding (26Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandonà D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); we therefore performed double mutations of both glutamate and arginine to noncharged residues in the case of sites A1 and A4. In the case of site B5 both the single mutants and the double mutants were constructed and analyzed. All mutations yielded inclusion bodies with a yield of 3.5 ± 32 mg/g of bacterial cells. TableI gives a summary of mutant proteins analyzed in this work.Table ILHCII mutantsA1, E180V/R70IA2, N183VA3, Q197VA4, E65V/R185LA5, H68IA6, P82VB3, H212VB5.1, E139LB5.2, F139L/R142LB6.1, Q131VB6.2, Q131EEach mutant is designated by the site as assigned by Kuhlbrandt and co-workers (11Hobe S.

To detect differences in pigment binding induced by mutations that could be attributed to the native protein in thylakoid membrane, it was essential to reproduce the properties of LHCII by in vitroreconstitution of recombinant Lhcb1 apoprotein. In preliminary experiments LHCII was reconstituted by using different Chl a/Chl b/xanthophyll ratios into the reconstituted mixture. The pigment to apoprotein ratio was also explored. LHCII purified from maize thylakoids binds 7 molecules of Chl a, 5 Chl b, 1.8 lutein, 0.2 violaxanthin, and 1.0 neoxanthin per polypeptide. This composition was reproduced with Lhcb1 very closely (7 Chl a, 5 Chl b, 1.68 lutein, 0.32 violaxanthin, and 1.0 neoxanthin) by using pigment mixture during reconstitution with Chl a/b ratio of 2.3 and Chl a+b/carotenoids = 4.2. The composition of the carotenoid extract was the following: neoxanthin/violaxanthin/lutein/carotene = 16/16/50/18. The ratio between protein and Chl in the mixture was 0.57 (w/w). At first we encountered difficulty in reproducing this result routinely because of fluctuations in the a/b ratio of the reconstituted complex between 1.6 and 1.4. This was due to partial aggregation of pigments during the procedure of refolding, thus yielding a green band close to the bottom of the sucrose gradient and causing random changes in the Chl a/b ratio of the pigments actually available for binding to the protein. Decreasing pigment concentration in the reconstitution mixture avoided aggregation. However, exceedingly lower pigment concentration led to a LHCII protein binding 11 Chl rather than 12 (one Chl b was missing). The conditions used in this work allowed reconstitution of LHCII binding 12 Chl with Chl a/b ratio of 1.4 in 75% of the experiments. In each experiment one WT sample was included and the products of experiments in which the Chl a/b ratio of WT LHCII differed from 1.4 by more than 0.03 were discarded. The data reported here refer to three independent reconstitution experiments for each mutant protein. WT LHCII was reconstituted with a yield of 35% on a protein basis (Fig.1). Mutant proteins were reconstituted with a similar yield with some exceptions; the A1 mutant (E180L/R70I) had a yield of 10%, suggesting that this ionic pair is important in stabilizing the structure, whereas, interestingly, mutants in the other intra-helix ionic pair (A4 site, E65V/R185L) did not show a decrease in reconstitution yield. Three mutations in helix C, disrupting the intra-helix ionic pair (B5.1 and B5.2) or the Chl binding (B6.1) decreased the reconstitution yield to 25, 12, and 25%, respectively. Stability of the complexes was checked by keeping the samples in ice or at room temperature and repeating absorption spectra during the following 24 h. WT and all mutants but A1 showed no shift in the wavelength of the Qy transition peak within 0.2 nm for 24 h in ice or 6 h at RT. The A1 mutant was stable for 4–6 h in ice. The function of LHCII is the light harvesting by the three different chromophore types present in the complex and excitation energy transfer to Chl a prior to further transfer to photosynthetic reaction centers. High efficiency of energy transfer can only be obtained if the relative distances and orientation between chromophores is maintained. This can be assessed by fluorescence emission analysis using three different wavelengths of excitation (440, 475, and 500 nm) specifically absorbed by Chl a, Chl b, and xanthophylls. Emission from impaired individual or groups of chlorophyll will show up at different wavelengths. For WT LHCII and most of the mutant proteins, fluorescence emission spectra typically showed a single major peak at 681 nm. The spectra were essentially identical irrespective of excitation wavelength, implying energy transfer and equilibration between all the bound pigments (Fig.2). This indicates that mutations did not significantly disrupt protein structure or disturb pigment-pigment interactions between chromophores not specifically affected by the mutation. Nevertheless, small differences in peak emission wavelengths indicate that the relative distribution of the Chl absorption forms was modified. Some Chl b emission at 660 nm was observed in the helix C mutants B5.1, B5.2, and B6.1, indicating that a fraction of the energy absorbed by Chl b could not be transferred to Chl a. However, even in the case of B5.1 and B6, most of energy was equilibrated as shown by the identical shape of the spectra above 670 nm. The only clear exception to this pattern was the B5.2 mutant, in which energy from carotenoid excitation at 500 nm was transferred to a different Chl a pool emitting at higher wavelengths with respect to the overall Chl a emission excited at 440 nm. This implies that energy transfer between two different Chl a groups was impaired. The A2 mutant was equilibrated, but its emission peak was blue shifted by 4 nm, indicating the Chl affected by the mutation is probably the chromophore with the lowest energy level in the complex. Site A2 was suggested to be important for energy transfer toward neighboring antenna proteins on the basis of its protruding position in LHCII structure (5Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). To verify whether mutations have affected selectively different Chl absorption forms, we have analyzed WT and mutant LHCII proteins by room temperature absorption spectroscopy. The Qy region of the spectra is shown in Fig.3 with their second derivative analysis. WT monomeric recombinant LHCII shows two broad peaks respectively at 652 and 674 nm (Fig. 3) as previously shown for the native complex purified from thylakoids (27Bassi R. Silvestri M. Dainese P. Giacometti G.M. Moya I. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 6: 381-394Google Scholar, 28Peterman E.J.G. Dukker F.M. van Grondelle R. Van Amerongen H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2670-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This protein could be made into trimers by incubation with lipid extract leading to the changes on absorption and CD spectra previously reported to be due to trimerization in native LHCII (27Bassi R. Silvestri M. Dainese P. Giacometti G.M. Moya I. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 6: 381-394Google Scholar, 28Peterman E.J.G. Dukker F.M. van Grondelle R. Van Amerongen H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2670-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Here we report on monomeric proteins. Mutations at sites A1 and A4 affect Glu/Arg ionic pairs in the helix A/helix B cross. The spectrum of the A4 mutant shows a red shift of the major (Chl a) peak by 1.2 nm with respect to the WT and higher amplitude of the 652 nm shoulder (Fig. 3 A). The second derivative analysis showed a decreased amplitude of a spectral form around 675 nm (Fig. 3 A.1). Mutation at site A1 (E180L/R70I) yielded a large blue shift (4 nm) of the Chl a peak, and the ratio of the amplitudes of the Chl a versus Chl b peaks was lower with respect to the WT. Second derivative analysis clearly shows perturbation of the red-most signal at around 680 nm (Fig. 3,A and A.1). Mutations at sites A2 and A5 also affect two Chls close to the center of the LHCII structure (Fig. 1). The A2 mutant spectrum (Fig.3 B) shows a blue shift of 2 nm with respect to the WT because of the complete loss of the red most signal at around 680 nm (Fig. 3 B.1). The mutation in the A5 site (H68I) yields a spectrum rather similar to the A4 mutation showing a decrease in the ratio between the Chl a and Chl b peaks with respect to the WT, because of the loss of a spectral form absorbing at 674–675 nm (Fig. 3,B and B.1). The Chl bound to site A6 has been proposed to be coordinated through the Gly78 peptidyl-carbonyl. The absorption spectrum of the P82V mutant is identical to that of WT, suggesting that if this is the ligand of Chl in site A6, the availability of this group is not essential to Chl binding (Fig. 3, C and C.1). Mutations B5.1, B5.2, B6.1, and B6.2 are targeted to ligands on helix C. Their absorption spectra show similar characteristics, suggesting that the chromophores affected by these mutation might be part of a common pool (Fig. 3, D and D.1). The main feature is a decrease of the Chl b peak at around 652 nm with the amplitude of the effect being in the order B5.1 (E139L) < B6.1 (Q131L) < B5.2 (E139L/R142L). Differences with respect to the WT spectrum are also evident in the Chl a region, where blue shifts of the peak, by 2, 2, and 3 nm, respectively, were observed. The second derivative analysis also shows that upon removal of bulk 652 nm absorption, a 646 nm signal is revealed in the B5.2 (E139L/R142L) mutant, suggesting that this absorption form is associated to a site located in a protein domain not affected by helix C mutations (Fig. 3 D.1). Differences are also detected in the Chl a spectral region as changes in the relative amplitude of the different absorption forms (Fig.3 D.2). The B6.2 (Q131E) mutation is intended to substitute a Chl-binding residue with another putative one present, in the same position, in homologous proteins like CP29, CP26, or LHCI. This mutation leads to a decreased Chl b absorption (652 nm) accompanied by increased absorption at around 675 nm (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that the B6 site decreases its affinity for Chl b in favor of Chl a. The spectrum is otherwise similar to WT. The targets of B3 and A3 mutations are located in the D helix domain. The absorption spectra of both mutant proteins shows a decreased Chl b (652 nm) absorption (Fig. 3 E). Nevertheless, the trough between Chl a and Chl b peaks became more evident, suggesting that blue Chl a absorption forms at around 663–665 nm are depleted as indicated by the second derivative analysis (Fig. 3 E.1). The spectral effects displayed by mutant proteins clearly indicate that mutations are specific for different absorption forms covering the whole of the LHCII spectrum. This suggests that these constructions can be used for correlating the absorption forms with specific chromophores in LHCII. Previous work on carotenoid-binding sites of LHCII showed that maize Lhcb1 has three sites tightly binding xanthophylls in agreement with the results with LHCII from thylakoid membranes (8Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 9Connelly J.P. Muller M. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R.

Two of them, located in the helix A/helix B cross as detected by electron crystallography (5Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), can bind either lutein or violaxanthin in a 1.8 to 0.2 ratio. In this work, because of the slightly different conditions of reconstitution we obtained 1.68 ± 0.02 lutein and 0.32 ± 0.03 violaxanthin for WT LHCII. The third site, not resolved in the structure, is selective for neoxanthin. Pigment composition of WT and mutant proteins was determined by HPLC analysis and extrapolation from the absorption spectra of the acetone extracts. This combined approach proved to be effective in minimizing errors in the Chl/car ratio (9Connelly J.P. Muller M. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because the lutein-binding sites are located in the loops between α-helices (29Pichersky E. Jansson S. Ort D.R. Yokum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 507-521Google Scholar), which are not targeted by mutations, we tentatively used lutein (1.68 mol/mole of protein) as a reference. The results are shown in TableII. The validity of the assumption of 1.68 luteins/polypeptide was verified by direct measurement of the Chl to protein stoichiometry as previously performed in the homologous protein CP29 (26Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandonà D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the amount of material and the number of repetitions needed for this determination allowed reliable results only on mutant proteins obtained with high yield (TableIII). These results support the validity of the data in Table II, although a discrepancy was found in the case of the A4 mutant.Table IIPigment composition of WT and mutant LHCII proteins as determined by HPLC analysis and acetone extract fittingChl a/bChl totalChl aChl bLuteinneoviolaΔChl aΔChl bΔChlWT1.412751.681.050.32A1 (E180L/R70I)1.0810.55.455.051.651.080.07−1.5−1.5A2 (N183L)1.449.45.543.841.680.840.07−1.5−1.2−2.7A3 (Q197L)1.45116.514.491.7210.2−0.5−0.5−1.0A4 (E65L/R185L)1.5111.77.074.671.681.170.19−0.3−0.3*A4 (E65L/R185L)1.51106.023.981.4310.16−1.0−1.0−2.0A5 (H68I)1.1911651.671.10.12−1−1.0A7 (P82V)1.412751.680.850.2B3 (H212V)1.43116.474.531.680.830.16−0.5−0.5−1.0B5.1 (E139L)1.57106.13.91.680.640.1−0.9−1.1−2.0B5.2 (E139L/R142L)3.7186.31.71.660.040.09−0.7−3.3−4.0B6.1 (Q131L)1.82106.453.541.670.480.06−0.5−1.5−2.0B6.2 (Q131E)1.18126.55.51.681.00.15−0.5+0.5Values are in mol/mol LHCII polypeptide as calculated in the assumption of 1.68 lutein/polypeptide chain.

All the mutant proteins showed a lower Chl content per 1.68 luteins than the WT protein with the exception of the P82V (site A7), which had the same composition as the WT, and the Q131E (site B6), which showed a higher Chl a content, suggesting the mutation increased the affinity for Chl a in site B6. The A4 mutant showed very little change in pigment composition on a lutein basis. However, strong effects on the absorption spectrum (Fig. 3 B) and the Chl/protein stoichiometry of 10 (Table III) consistently indicated the loss of two Chl. We therefore recalculated the pigment composition of the A4 mutant on the basis of 10 Chl (a+b); these values are given as (*A4) in TableII. From this new normalization it appears that this mutant lost part of its lutein, whereas the neoxanthin content was not affected. Three mutant proteins were found to bind 11 chlorophylls; the A5 mutant lost Chl a only, whereas the A3 and B3 mutants appear to loose both Chl a and Chl b, thus leading to the tentative conclusion that site A5 binds Chl a, while B3 and A3 sites can be occupied by either Chl a or Chl b with roughly equal probability. Somewhat similar is the case of mutant A1, which appears to lose Chl a only in the amount of 1.5 mol/mole of protein. This result suggests not only that site A1 is occupied by Chl a but also that a neighbor site occupied by Chl a is affected. This is probably site B1, which is the closest one for which a specific binding residue was not detected. These results are in agreement with data obtained in the homologous protein CP29 (26Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandonà D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The most striking result, however, was the loss of more than one and up to four Chl molecules in the case of five mutant proteins (B5.1, B5.2, B6.1, A2, and A4). This is evident not only from the stoichiometry on lutein or protein basis but also from the Chl a/b ratio. The expected values in the case of a single Chl a or Chl b loss are respectively of 1.2 and 1.75, whereas values up to 3.7 from the WT result of 1.4 were obtained. This indicates that"

Upon ligand binding, a cytoplasmic pool of ERα translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor, driving the expression of genes that contain estrogen-response elements. The activity of ERα is regulated by a number of proteins, including cytosolic chaperones and nuclear cofactors. Here, we show that caveolin-1 potentiates ERα-mediated signal transduction. Coexpression of caveolin-1 and ERα resulted in ligand-independent translocation of ERα to the nucleus as shown by both cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopic studies. Similarly, caveolin-1 augmented both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent ERα signaling as measured using a estrogen-response element-based luciferase reporter assay. Caveolin-1-mediated activation of ERα was sensitive to a well known ER antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen. However, much higher concentrations of tamoxifen were required to mediate inhibition in the presence of caveolin-1. Interestingly, caveolin-1 expression also synergized with a constitutively active, ligand-independent ERα mutant, dramatically illustrating the potent stimulatory effect of caveolin-1 in this receptor system. Taken together, our results identify caveolin-1 as a new positive regulator of ERα signal transduction.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). To engage in these processes, caveolae have a protein and lipid composition that is distinct from the plasma membrane proper. More specifically, they are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and sphingomyelin as well as lipid-modified signaling proteins (10Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). The principal coat proteins of caveolae are the caveolins. Thus far, three distinct mammalian caveolin genes have been identified, and their 20–25-kDa gene products are broadly expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types (12Kurzchalia T. Dupree P.

In addition to interacting with an array of integral membrane, lipid-modified, and soluble signaling molecules, the caveolins share the ability to self-oligomerize, to bind cholesterol, and to cross-link cell-surface gangliosides (10Okamoto T.

In general, caveolins bind to and inactivate signaling molecules. Such examples include, but are not limited to, the following: receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Neu) and their downstream targets (e.g. Ha-Ras, MEK1, and ERK2), serpentine receptors (e.g. endothelin receptor) and their attendant enzymes (e.g. various Gα subunits, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A), and regulated enzymes (e.g. endothelial nitric-oxide synthase). All these signaling components are inhibited by their interaction with caveolins (reviewed in Ref. 21Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The interaction of caveolin-1 with many of the proto-oncogene products described above has important consequences for cellular transformation and, perhaps, cancer. Several experimental lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, caveolin-1 is down-regulated in a variety of oncogenically transformed cells (22Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Second, when the caveolin-1 cDNA is reintroduced into RasG12V-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, anchorage-independent growth is abrogated (23Engelman J.A. Wycoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Third, disruption of caveolae by antisense-mediated down-regulation of caveolin-1 protein expression in normal NIH 3T3 cells results in (i) hyperactivation of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, (ii) anchorage-independent growth, and (iii) tumor formation in nude mice (24Galbiati F. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Fourth, pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol with a concomitant morphologic loss of caveolae also results in p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (25Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Finally, the caveolin-1 and -2 genes are co-localized to a known tumor suppressor locus in mice and humans (7q31.1/D7S522) (reviewed in Ref. 26Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Volonte D.

We recently uncovered a reciprocal relationship between Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 expression in mammary adenocarcinomas (27Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). An increase in Neu kinase activity correlated with a decrease in caveolin-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, overexpression of caveolin-1 inhibited Neu kinase activityin vivo. As the c-Neu proto-oncogene is mutationally activated in human breast cancers, these results may have implications for understanding the functional role of caveolin expression in the prevention of mammary tumorigenesis. In this report, we address the possible role of caveolin-1 in estrogen receptor (ER)1 signal transduction, another major pathway that is thought to be involved in the development of human breast cancers. Here, we show that caveolin-1 re-expression in MCF-7 cells, an estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line, promotes nuclear translocation of ERα. The possible implications of these findings for understanding ERα signaling and breast carcinogenesis are discussed. Estradiol (E2) was purchased from Sigma.

MCF-7 cells (ATCC/HTB-22) were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection and were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% donor bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded into tissue culture dishes containing phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and cultured for at least 24 h prior to all experimental treatments. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells from one 60-mm diameter plate were harvested by gentle scraping into phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Cells were then subjected to hypotonic lysis in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 20 mmNa2MoO7, passed through a 26-gauge needle, and then sonicated. Cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as we described in detail previously (24Galbiati F. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Samples were brought to the same volume, and equal-volume aliquots from each fraction were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis (35Schlegel A. Schwab R. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. Blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) and 0.05% Tween 20 and then placed in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 2% nonfat milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Blots were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies, washed with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). Bound IgGs were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescent labeling was performed as described previously (28Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M.C. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and doubly immunostained with mouse anti-caveolin-1 IgG (cl 2234) and rabbit anti-ERα IgGs (H-184). Bound primary antibodies were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and lissamine rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Cells were viewed with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope using a 60× objective, and images were collected with a Photonics cooled CCD camera. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, ∼1 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates and cultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Cells were then transfected with 1 μg of vector (pCB7) or vector containing caveolin cDNA (Cav-1/pCB7), 1 μg of ERE2TK81LUC reporter, and 200 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase by calcium phosphate precipitation. One microgram of the wild-type human ERα cDNA or a constitutively active (Y537S) ERα mutant cDNA was also cotransfected. Twelve hours after addition of calcium phosphate precipitates, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for an additional 24 h in medium containing E2 or an equivalent volume of vehicle (ethanol). In all experiments, the final concentration of ethanol was 0.1% (v/v). In antagonist studies, OHT dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added from stock solutions such that the final concentration of solvent was 0.1% (v/v). Lysates were prepared 24 h after pharmacological treatment and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Results represent the mean ± S.D. of luciferase activity normalized to β-galactosidase activity (n = 3). Immunoprecipitation of ERα was performed essentially as we described previously for another transcription factor, C/EBPβ (36Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subjected to lysis in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4 supplemented with protease inhibitors). DNA was sheered by brief sonication on ice, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and then transferred to fresh tubes containing 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitation buffer. Ten micrograms of anti-ERα IgGs were added to the mixture. Following a 6-h incubation rotating at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer lacking Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors, and disrupted by boiling in 1% SDS. Mammary epithelial cells normally express both caveolin-1 and -2, whereas many mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines such as MCF-7 show selective down-regulation of caveolin-1 (reviewed in Ref. 26Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Sotgia F. Pestell R.G. Minetti C. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1578-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, MCF-7 cells continue to express wild-type ERα. Thus, we employed MCF-7 cells as a model system to study the effects of recombinant caveolin-1 expression on the behavior of endogenous ERα. Fig. 1 A (upper panel) shows that transient expression of caveolin-1 in MCF-7 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in the cytoplasmic pool of ERα. To ensure equal protein loading, the same blots were reprobed with antibodies against both membrane (caveolin-2) and cytosolic (GDI) proteins (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). To examine whether the decrease in the cytoplasmic pool of ERα was due to its degradation, total cellular proteins were recovered by lysis in 1% SDS; the amount of ERα was determined by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 1 B shows that ERα levels were identical in caveolin-1 transfectants and mock-transfected control cells both in the presence and absence of estradiol. As expected, estradiol treatment decreased the steady-state levels of ERα expression, as ligand binding results in nuclear translocation and subsequent ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation (37Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease in cytoplasmic ERα levels following caveolin-1 transfection is most likely due to enhanced nuclear translocation. Next, we tested whether caveolin-1 expression can influence ERα translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus using subcellular fractionation techniques. In unstimulated control cells, ERα resided in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm; the cytoplasmic pool underwent translocation to the nucleus when stimulated with estradiol (Fig.2 A, left panel) (38Picard D. Kumar V. Chambon P. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in unstimulated cells, caveolin-1 caused a shift in the subcellular localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. 2 A, right panel). As a control, we verified that caveolin-1 expression did not alter the location of a known cytosolic protein, GDI (Fig.2 B). Thus, it appears that caveolin-1 expression can cause ligand-independent nuclear translocation of ERα. Similar results were obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy. In caveolin-1-transfected cells and in the absence of ligand, the cytoplasmic pool of endogenous ERα shifted to the nucleus (Fig.3 A). More important, this effect was cell autonomous, as adjacent untransfected cells did not show enhanced nuclear concentration of ERα (Fig. 3, A andC, compare caveolin-1 transfectants to the left with the corresponding untransfected cells to the right in the same field). As a positive control for these studies, we also evaluated the ability of estradiol to induce nuclear translocation of ERα under identical conditions. Note that when cells were stimulated with estradiol, caveolin-1 expression did not influence nuclear translocation of ERα; as expected, both caveolin-1-transfected and adjacent untransfected cells showed nuclear concentration of ERα (Fig. 3, B andD, compare caveolin-1 transfectants to the left with the corresponding untransfected cells to the right in the same field). These data independently confirm our results obtained via cell fractionation (Fig. 2). Since caveolin-1 causes ligand-independent ERα translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, we wondered whether caveolin-1 expression also results in ERα-mediated transcriptional activation of estrogen-responsive genes. To evaluate this possibility, we employed an established luciferase-based reporter system that has been used extensively by other investigators to monitor ERα-mediated signal transduction in vivo. This reporter contains two EREs linked 5′ to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter that drives luciferase expression (33Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that when unstimulated cells were transfected with caveolin-1, an ∼2-fold increase was observed in ERE reporter activity. In addition, when caveolin-1-transfected cells were stimulated with a range of estradiol concentrations (from 5 to 100 nm), caveolin-1 induced a dramatic increase (up to ∼7–8-fold) in ERα reporter activity. Thus, caveolin-1 expression is sufficient to induce ligand-independent activation of ERα, and caveolin-1 can potentiate ERα signaling in the presence of ligand. We next evaluated whether caveolin-1-mediated potentiation of ERα signaling is sensitive to ER antagonists (Fig.5). For this purpose, we treated cells with estradiol (10 nm) in the absence or presence of OHT (0.1–100 nm). Note that in cells transfected with vector alone, OHT had an IC50 of <0.1 nm. In contrast, in cells transfected with caveolin-1, the IC50for OHT was increased >5-fold to ∼0.5 nm. These results indicate that caveolin-1 expression can prevent OHT-mediated inhibition of ERα signaling in vivo. In addition, these data may have clinical implications for understanding the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast and ovarian cancer cells, as tamoxifen is routinely used in a variety of cancer chemotherapy regimens. As caveolin-1 expression can potentiate both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ERα signaling, we next determined if caveolin-1 can influence signal transduction mediated by a mutated, constitutively activated form of ERα. For this purpose, we utilized a well characterized constitutively active mutant (ERαY573S) that is known to dramatically increase ERE-dependent transcription in the absence of ligand (39Weis K.E. Ekena K. Thomas J.A. Lazennec G. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1388-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that caveolin-1 expression augmented ERαY573S activation of estrogen signaling, resulting in an ∼7–8-fold increase in transcription both in the presence and absence of estradiol. As compared with wild-type ERα, in the absence of caveolin-1 (Fig. 6, see vector-alone controls (open bars)), ERαY573S plus caveolin-1 resulted in an ∼150-fold increase in ERα ligand-independent signaling. These findings directly support our observation that caveolin-1 causes nuclear translocation and activation of wild-type ERα (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). One possible mechanism by which caveolin-1 potentiates ERα signaling is through a direct or indirect interaction between caveolin-1 and ERα itself. Although caveolin-1 is an integral membrane protein, a soluble cytoplasmic pool of caveolin-1 has been reported (7Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y.-S. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that caveolin-1 can move in and out of membranes (existing as a soluble protein) depending on the oxidation state of caveolin-bound membrane cholesterol. To evaluate the potential interaction of caveolin-1 with ERα, we cotransfected 293T cells with their corresponding cDNAs. We chose 293T cells for these studies as they do not express either caveolin-1 or ERα endogenously. Cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against ERα. Fig.7 shows that when cells were cotransfected with ERα and caveolin-1, caveolin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against ERα (third lane). In contrast, when cells were transfected with the caveolin-1 cDNA alone, anti-ERα antibodies did not coprecipitate caveolin-1 (Fig. 7, first lane). These results indicate that the observed caveolin-1 co-immunoprecipitation with ERα is highly specific, as it was strictly dependent on ERα expression. Caveolins are known to interact with a diverse group of signaling molecules. However, it remains unknown whether caveolins influence steroid receptor signaling pathways. Here, we have provided several independent lines of evidence that suggest that caveolin-1 acts as a positive modulator of estrogen receptor signaling in vivo. (i) We found that caveolin-1 directly potentiated estrogen signaling by inducing translocation of ERα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, even in the absence of ligand. (ii) Caveolin-1-driven ERα nuclear translocation resulted in increased transcription from an ERE-dependent reporter gene. (iii) Caveolin-1 conferred resistance to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen (with a >5-fold increase in IC50). (iv) Caveolin-1 augmented the transcriptional activation of a constitutively active form of the estrogen receptor, ERαY537S. (v) Finally, we observed that caveolin-1 interacted with ERα in vivo, as evidence by co-immunoprecipitation studies. The interaction of signaling molecules with caveolins is mediated largely by the caveolin scaffolding domain, a 20-aminoacyl residue membrane proximal domain (40Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Using a phage display-based approach, we have previously defined a consensus caveolin-binding motif,i.e. φXφXXXXφ and φXXXXφXXφ, where φ is an aromatic residue and X is any residue (41Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the protein sequence of ERα failed to identify a putative caveolin-binding motif. We recently reported that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 interacts with caveolin-1 through a motif that diverges slightly from the above-described consensus,63LGYLLFRDF71, where Leu substitutes for an aromatic amino acid (42Carman C.V. Lisanti M.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8858-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gαq has similar substitutions for aromatic residues in its caveolin-binding motif, but Gαq still co-immunoprecipitates caveolin-1 (43de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, ERα may interact with caveolins through a divergent caveolin-binding motif or may be recognized by other caveolin domains that have been shown to interact with signaling molecules (44Venema V.J. Ju H. Zou R. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28187-28190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 45Razani B. Rubin C.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26353-26360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Finally, we consider the significance of the caveolin-1/ERα interaction. ERα-expressing breast cancer cells show enhanced tumorigenicity; however, these ERα-positive cells have less of a propensity to metastasize (reviewed in Refs. 46Prall O.W.J. Rogan E.M. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 47Rochefort H. Platet N. Hayashido Y. Derocq D. Lucas A. Cunat S. Garcia M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One possibility is that caveolin-1 expression may help prevent metastasis by potentiating estrogen-mediated transcription in these cells. This view is consistent with the suggestion that caveolin-1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is down-regulated during cell transformation (23Engelman J.A. Wycoff C.C.

This process is accompanied by the vectorial transport of protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane (“proton pumping”). The mechanism of proton pumping is still a matter of debate. Many proposed mechanisms require structural changes during the reaction cycle of cytochrome c oxidase. Therefore, the structure of the cytochrome c oxidase was determined in the completely oxidized and in the completely reduced states at a temperature of 100 K. No ligand exchanges or other major structural changes upon reduction of the cytochrome coxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans were observed. The three histidine CuB ligands are well defined in the oxidized and in the reduced states. These results are hardly compatible with the “histidine cycle” mechanisms formulated previously.

The three histidine CuB ligands are well defined in the oxidized and in the reduced states. These results are hardly compatible with the “histidine cycle” mechanisms formulated previously. Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) is the terminal enzyme in the respiratory chains of mitochondria and many aerobic bacteria (see for reviews Refs. 1Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar and 2Michel H. Behr J. Harrenga A. Kannt A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 329-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the electron transfer from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and forms water as the product of the reaction. The free energy of this electron transfer reactions is used to generate an electrochemical proton gradient, which drives protons back through the ATP synthases across the membrane, a process that is coupled to the generation of ATP. A total of eight charges is translocated across the membrane per reduced dioxygen. Because the protons needed for water formation and the electrons donated by cytochrome c are taken up from opposite sides of the membrane, a pH and an electric field difference are generated. In addition, the cytochrome c oxidase translocates (“pumps”) up to four protons per oxygen molecule across the membrane, thereby enhancing the yield of energy conservation. Since the discovery that the cytochrome coxidase is a proton pump (3Wikström M.K. Nature. 1977; 266: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of proton pumping has remained unclear.Two fundamentally different types of mechanisms are usually discussed: direct mechanisms in which the redox chemistry is associated with small changes occurring very close to the binuclear center, and indirect mechanisms where the coupling is achieved by major conformational changes in the protein. Many research groups favor a directly coupled proton pump mechanism in combination with a gating element because the energy for the proton pumping is generated by oxygen reduction, which takes place in the binuclear center, the characteristic feature of the heme-copper-containing terminal oxidase superfamily (4Garcia-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Rumbley J. Jixiang M. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Previously proposed gating mechanisms involve protonation and ligand exchanges on heme a 3 (5Rousseau D.L. Ching Y.C. Wang J. J. Bioenerg.

Iwata S. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) allowed to determine its structure in two forms, containing either four or two subunits (10;11). Because there was no electron density for the CuB ligand His-325 in the oxidized, azide-treated enzyme, Iwata et al. (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) adapted the “histidine cycle” on the grounds of possible multiple conformations of this ligand and two different proton access routes, maintaining strict electroneutrality for the redox changes around the binuclear center (12Rich P.R. Aust. J. Plant. Physiol. 1995; 22: 479-486Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In order to test the “histidine cycle” mechanism and other proposed gating mechanisms, the structure of the cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificans was determined at a temperature of 100 K for the azide-free, completely oxidized, and completely reduced states.DISCUSSIONThe mechanism of coupling between electron transfer and proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidases is a subject of intense studies. The missing electron density for the CuB ligand His-325 in the oxidized, azide-treated cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificans (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) can be interpreted in two different ways; (a) the treatment of the enzyme with azide results in a ligand displacement on CuB, or (b) the crystals are partially reduced by free electrons and radicals produced by the x-rays during data collection. Both interpretations indicate a possible structural flexibility of this CuBligand. On the basis of possible multiple orientations for the ligand His-325, the “histidine cycle” (7Wikström M. Bogachev A. Finel M. Morgan J.E. Puustinen A. Raitio M. Verkhovskaja M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was adapted by Iwata et al. (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). It predicts that one histidine ligand is not a CuB ligand anymore in the completely reduced state. This prediction was tested by the use of cryo-crystallography. Care was taken that the x-ray data were collected on defined redox states. At a temperature of 100 K, structural changes following the possible reduction of the oxidized cytochrome c oxidase by radicals and free electrons produced by the x-rays can be prevented. As a second advantage, the reduced enzyme does not react with oxygen and therefore the reduced state can be studied easily. Because only very small crystals can be frozen without drastic lost of crystal quality, the effective resolution is slightly lower than that of the non-frozen crystals (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). The quality of the synchrotron beam must be very high to enable data collection. For the measurements using frozen cytochromec oxidase crystals, the availability of the high brilliance beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) was absolutely necessary.In order to show that the experimental procedures resulted in the expected redox states and that these are not influenced by the crystal lattice of cytochrome c oxidase, optical absorbance spectra were recorded with a single crystal microscope-photometer. The spectra of the cytochrome c oxidase crystals do not differ from the spectra of the enzyme in solution. The cytochrome c oxidase in the crystals can be reduced and binds carbon monoxide after reduction. It is therefore unlikely that the crystal contacts between adjacent molecules inhibit large domain or helix movements.One would expect reduction of the metal centers to induce structural changes coupled to proton pumping. However, significant structural differences between the completely oxidized and completely reduced cytochrome c oxidase could not be observed at the given resolution. Although high resolution x-ray data could not be collected, the crystallographic measurements show that no ligand exchange occurs at the binuclear center. All three CuB ligands are well defined in the completely oxidized and completely reduced states. This observation is in agreement with recent extended X-ray absorption fine structure data, which describe only minor changes at CuB of the ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli upon reduction (23Ralle M. Verkhovskaja M.L. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7185-7194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas the structural changes observed upon ligation with carbon monoxide (23Ralle M. Verkhovskaja M.L. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7185-7194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are hardly compatible with earlier x-ray crystallographic data observed with the bovine heart mitochondrial cytochromec oxidase (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Additionally, the histidine hemea 3 ligand does not change its conformation in a redox-dependent manner. An exchange with a nearby tyrosine residue has already been ruled out by mutagenesis experiments (25Mitchell D.M. Ädelroth P. Hosler J.P. Fetter J.R. Brzezinski P. Pressler M.A. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Alben J.O. Babcock G.T. Gennis R.B. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results are clearly not compatible with the proposed pumping mechanisms, which postulate ligand exchanges at hemea 3 (5Rousseau D.L. Ching Y.C. Wang J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), between heme a 3and CuB (6Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and at CuB (the “histidine cycle”; Ref. 7Wikström M. Bogachev A. Finel M. Morgan J.E. Puustinen A. Raitio M. Verkhovskaja M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).An indirect mechanism associated with major conformational changes in the protein can also be excluded for this bacterial cytochromec oxidase, because no backbone movements occur in the protein moiety. Such a movement has been described for the bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase affecting a loop in subunit I around the residue Asp-51 (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). However, this loop facing the cytoplasm is not conserved in the cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificans. It is only found in cytochrome coxidases of animals. Therefore, it cannot be part of a general mechanism, which must be expected due to the remarkable structural conservation of the key features of this enzyme (10;11;26). Redox structural changes, apart from the movement of this non conserved surface loop, are not described for the bovine heart cytochromec oxidase (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the structural change around Asp-51 observed upon reduction of the bovine cytochrome c oxidase is the following; Asp-51 is deprotonated in the oxidized enzyme, and its negative charge is stabilized by the three hydrogen bonds observed with the carboxylate group as acceptor. Upon reduction of CuA, which is only 6.7 Å away from this carboxylate group, Asp-51 will be electrostatically repelled from the electron on CuA, and assumes its new position further away from CuA.Mechanisms, which involve structural changes of cytochrome coxidases upon reduction, are not compatible with the results of the crystallographic studies, on both the bacterial and the mammalian enzyme. The existence of large volume changes upon reduction postulated on the basis of dilatometry measurements (27Kornblatt J.A. Kornblatt M.J. Rajotte I. Hoa G.H.B. Kahn P.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is not observed for the bacterial and mammalian enzymes in the crystallographic studies.Not only the structure but also the static behavior upon reduction seem to be conserved among the cytochrome c oxidases. This feature makes it inevitable that we consider new mechanisms for the coupling between electron transfer and proton pumping which do not involve ligand exchanges or major conformational changes. A new detailed mechanism (28Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12819-12824Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) has been suggested on the basis of the structure and electrostatic calculations (29Kannt A. Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), proposing that the interplay of the conserved residue Glu-278 with the propionates of the two hemes is sufficient for the proton pumping across the membrane and there is no need for exchanging protonatable metal ligands. In this mechanism protons are taken up from the inner side to balance the charge of the electron. These protons are stored around the heme propionates, and electrostatically repelled and thus pumped by protons approaching the catalytic site in line with Rich's electroneutrality principle (12Rich P.R. Aust. J. Plant. Physiol. 1995; 22: 479-486Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7185-7194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are hardly compatible with earlier x-ray crystallographic data observed with the bovine heart mitochondrial cytochromec oxidase (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Additionally, the histidine hemea 3 ligand does not change its conformation in a redox-dependent manner. An exchange with a nearby tyrosine residue has already been ruled out by mutagenesis experiments (25Mitchell D.M. Ädelroth P. Hosler J.P. Fetter J.R. Brzezinski P. Pressler M.A. Aasa R. Malmström B.G. Alben J.O. Babcock G.T. Gennis R.B. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results are clearly not compatible with the proposed pumping mechanisms, which postulate ligand exchanges at hemea 3 (5Rousseau D.L. Ching Y.C. Wang J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), between heme a 3and CuB (6Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and at CuB (the “histidine cycle”; Ref. 7Wikström M. Bogachev A. Finel M. Morgan J.E. Puustinen A. Raitio M. Verkhovskaja M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).An indirect mechanism associated with major conformational changes in the protein can also be excluded for this bacterial cytochromec oxidase, because no backbone movements occur in the protein moiety. Such a movement has been described for the bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase affecting a loop in subunit I around the residue Asp-51 (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). However, this loop facing the cytoplasm is not conserved in the cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificans. It is only found in cytochrome coxidases of animals. Therefore, it cannot be part of a general mechanism, which must be expected due to the remarkable structural conservation of the key features of this enzyme (10;11;26). Redox structural changes, apart from the movement of this non conserved surface loop, are not described for the bovine heart cytochromec oxidase (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for the structural change around Asp-51 observed upon reduction of the bovine cytochrome c oxidase is the following; Asp-51 is deprotonated in the oxidized enzyme, and its negative charge is stabilized by the three hydrogen bonds observed with the carboxylate group as acceptor. Upon reduction of CuA, which is only 6.7 Å away from this carboxylate group, Asp-51 will be electrostatically repelled from the electron on CuA, and assumes its new position further away from CuA.Mechanisms, which involve structural changes of cytochrome coxidases upon reduction, are not compatible with the results of the crystallographic studies, on both the bacterial and the mammalian enzyme. The existence of large volume changes upon reduction postulated on the basis of dilatometry measurements (27Kornblatt J.A. Kornblatt M.J. Rajotte I. Hoa G.H.B. Kahn P.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is not observed for the bacterial and mammalian enzymes in the crystallographic studies.Not only the structure but also the static behavior upon reduction seem to be conserved among the cytochrome c oxidases. This feature makes it inevitable that we consider new mechanisms for the coupling between electron transfer and proton pumping which do not involve ligand exchanges or major conformational changes. A new detailed mechanism (28Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12819-12824Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) has been suggested on the basis of the structure and electrostatic calculations (29Kannt A. Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), proposing that the interplay of the conserved residue Glu-278 with the propionates of the two hemes is sufficient for the proton pumping across the membrane and there is no need for exchanging protonatable metal ligands. In this mechanism protons are taken up from the inner side to balance the charge of the electron. These protons are stored around the heme propionates, and electrostatically repelled and thus pumped by protons approaching the catalytic site in line with Rich's electroneutrality principle (12Rich P.R. Aust. J. Plant. Physiol. 1995; 22: 479-486Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mechanism of coupling between electron transfer and proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidases is a subject of intense studies. The missing electron density for the CuB ligand His-325 in the oxidized, azide-treated cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificans (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) can be interpreted in two different ways; (a) the treatment of the enzyme with azide results in a ligand displacement on CuB, or (b) the crystals are partially reduced by free electrons and radicals produced by the x-rays during data collection. Both interpretations indicate a possible structural flexibility of this CuBligand. On the basis of possible multiple orientations for the ligand His-325, the “histidine cycle” (7Wikström M. Bogachev A. Finel M. Morgan J.E. Puustinen A. Raitio M. Verkhovskaja M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was adapted by Iwata et al. (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). It predicts that one histidine ligand is not a CuB ligand anymore in the completely reduced state. This prediction was tested by the use of cryo-crystallography. Care was taken that the x-ray data were collected on defined redox states. At a temperature of 100 K, structural changes following the possible reduction of the oxidized cytochrome c oxidase by radicals and free electrons produced by the x-rays can be prevented. As a second advantage, the reduced enzyme does not react with oxygen and therefore the reduced state can be studied easily. Because only very small crystals can be frozen without drastic lost of crystal quality, the effective resolution is slightly lower than that of the non-frozen crystals (10Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). The quality of the synchrotron beam must be very high to enable data collection. For the measurements using frozen cytochromec oxidase crystals, the availability of the high brilliance beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) was absolutely necessary. In order to show that the experimental procedures resulted in the expected redox states and that these are not influenced by the crystal lattice of cytochrome c oxidase, optical absorbance spectra were recorded with a single crystal microscope-photometer. The spectra of the cytochrome c oxidase crystals do not differ from the spectra of the enzyme in solution. The cytochrome c oxidase in the crystals can be reduced and binds carbon monoxide after reduction. It is therefore unlikely that the crystal contacts between adjacent molecules inhibit large domain or helix movements. One would expect reduction of the metal centers to induce structural changes coupled to proton pumping. However, significant structural differences between the completely oxidized and completely reduced cytochrome c oxidase could not be observed at the given resolution. Although high resolution x-ray data could not be collected, the crystallographic measurements show that no ligand exchange occurs at the binuclear center. All three CuB ligands are well defined in the completely oxidized and completely reduced states. This observation is in agreement with recent extended X-ray absorption fine structure data, which describe only minor changes at CuB of the ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli upon reduction (23Ralle M.

At present the Dbl family consists of more than thirty members; many have not been phenotypically or biochemically characterized. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors universally feature a Dbl homology domain followed by a pleckstrin homology domain. Employing data base screening we identified a recently cloned cDNA, KIAA0424, showing substantial sequence homology with Rac activators such as Tiam1, Sos, Vav, and PIX within the catalytic domain. This cDNA appears to be the human homologue of the Ascidian protein Posterior End Mark-2 (PEM-2). We refer to this exchanger as hPEM-2. hPEM-2 encodes a protein of 70 kDa and features an N-terminal src homology 3 domain, followed by tandem Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains. The gene is highly expressed in brain and is localized on the human X-chromosome. Employing biochemical activity assays for Rho-like GTPases we found that hPEM-2 specifically activates Cdc42 and not Rac or RhoA. Ectopic expression of hPEM-2 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts revealed a Cdc42 phenotype featuring filopodia formation, followed by cortical actin polymerization and cell rounding. hPEM-2 represents an exchange factor, which may have a role in the regulation of a number of cellular processes through Cdc42.

The Rho family of GTPases now comprises more than ten distinct gene products, which are conserved in all higher organisms studied. The importance of this family was first outlined when they were identified as key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (1Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3830) Google Scholar). These GTPases have since been implicated in a plethora of signaling events ranging from cell adhesion and motility, transcription activation, cell cycle progression, and cell fate determination (3Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Deactivation of Rho-like GTPases is principally regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 that stimulate their intrinsic GTPase activity. Downstream signals are mediated by effector proteins, which specifically recognize the conformation of the GTP-bound protein. The activation of these GTPases is regulated by proteins referred to as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF proteins) (4Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cross-talk between the members of the Rho family has been proposed. Cdc42 and Rac lie in a linear cascade in which Cdc42 activates Rac, whereas Rho in many cell types has opposing effects to Cdc42 and Rac on the actinomyosin cytoskeleton (5Leeuwen F.N.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These relationships imply that a complex network of signaling molecules is orchestrated and regulated by small GTPases. Activators or GEF proteins for Rho-like GTPases are modular proteins that universally feature a catalytic DH-PH combination. In addition they often contain other motifs conserved in signaling molecules such as src homology 2 (SH2), src homology 3 (SH3), and post-synaptic density-disc large-ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domains, suggesting that they participate in multiprotein signaling complexes. Indeed GEF proteins have been implicated in a diverse array of cellular processes including responses to extracellular signals (8Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

We and others have shown that membrane localization of GEF proteins is a prerequisite for their biological activity in a variety of cell types. Membrane localization is mediated by the lipid binding capacity of the PH domain (15Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J.

Recent studies on the DH domains from SOS, PIX, and Trio have all shown the same fundamental structure, which is entirely α-helical (17Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Aghazadeh B. Zhu K. Kubiseski T.J. Liu G.A. Pawson T. Zheng Y. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct.

The most conserved residues form a putative interface with the GTPase, possibly with the cooperation of the PH domain to stabilize the GTPase in the nucleotide free conformation. This facilitates the ejection of GDP from the active site and its replacement with GTP, which exceeds intracellular GDP by 10-fold. Tiam1 activity appears specific for Rac in most cell types, and we became interested in identifying other putative Rac activators that might play similar roles in the regulation of cell adhesion and invasion (20Habets G.G.

We wanted to see if grouping these uncharacterized proteins together according to their primary structures would allow us to predict their specificity toward each of the members of the Rho family. A number of studies have used recent developments in sequence manipulation and analysis to explore enzyme specificity and activity in relation to sequence homologies. Such analysis has already been performed for groups of enzymes such as kinases and phosphatases (23Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 24Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J.

We used several sequence analysis techniques with the DH domains from a number of well characterized members of the DH family to identify other putative activators of Rac. In this way we selected a GEF, KIAA0424 identified by the Kazusa sequencing project, which featured a strong homology with Tiam1 within the DH domain. A homologue of KIAA0424, termed posterior end mark-2 (PEM-2), has also been implicated in the polarization of early embryos in the Ascidian Ciona savignyi (26Satou Y. Satoh N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For simplicity we refer to this GEF as hPEM-2. By employing novel biochemical activity assays for Rho-like GTPases and by determining the morphological effect on the actin cytoskeleton, we have examined the activity of this GEF toward Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. We obtained pBluescript KIAA0424 from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan. We generated pBKHA by inserting the sequence CTA GCC ACC ATG GAA CAA AAA CTC ATC TCA GAA GAG GAT CTG GGA GGA G between the NheI and BamHI sites of pBKCMV (Stratagene). pBKHA-hPEM-2 was generated through standard polymerase chain reaction with the oligomers CTG TGG AAT TCA TGA CGT TGC TGA TCA C and AGC TCT CGA GAT CTG CCT CCC TGT AGG TA and then inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBKHA.

COS-7 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 1.3 × 106COS-7 cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes and the following day transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 24 h later cells were lysed in an Nonidet P-40 buffer and the GTPase activation state determined with the pull-down assay. Cells were activated with 20 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min or with 5 μm LPA for 15 min before lysis. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% new born calf serum. Cells were seeded onto glass slides and grown overnight. The following day, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE or Effectine (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and either antibodies 12CA5 to HA, 9E10 to Myc, or anti-T7 (Novagen) as appropriate. Preparations were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Recombinant Rac, Cdc42, and Rho were prepared from Escherichia coli using a bacterial expression system as described previously (30Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gpp(NH)p (Sigma), a nonhydrolyzable GTP-analogue, was exchanged for the bound GDP of the respective GTPases as described (31Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). 2 μg of the respective GTPase in GDP- and GppNHp-bound form were mixed with 10 μg of GST-C21 or GST-PAK-CD in a total volume of 1 ml of a Nonidet P-40 fish buffer and rotated for 30 min (27Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The samples were then washed three times, and the bound GTPases were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. To determine cellular activation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, cells were harvested by scraping in Nonidet P-40 fish buffer (27Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). After centrifugation to remove debris, the lysates were rotated for 1 h with 5 μl of GSH-Sepharose loaded with about 20 μg of either GST-C21 or GST-PAK-CD. The beads were washed three times with the Nonidet P-40 buffer, and then the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE before Western blot analysis. Rho proteins were detected with 12C4 monoclonal and Cdc42 with P1 polyclonal antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Rac was detected with 23A8 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and HA was detected with monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Northern blotting was performed according to standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using a pre-prepared poly(A)+ RNA blot purchased from Origene Technologies. A 5.4-kilobase insert from pBluescript KIAA0424 was excised with SalI/NotI and was used as template for the probe, which was then hybridized to the blot before washing and analysis by autoradiography, according to the supplied protocols. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as RNA loading control. To find GEFs that might activate Rac, we conducted data base searches with the catalytic DH domain from Tiam1. We found that most mammalian DH proteins grouped together according to their sequence homology and their reported specificity for distinct Rho-like GTPases. An uncharacterized expressed sequence tag, named KIAA0424 (hPEM-2), appeared particularly similar to Tiam1 in the DH domain (Fig.1 A). A homologue of KIAA0424 from the Ascidian C. savignyi called PEM-2 was recently identified as a patterning gene expressed during the early stages of development (26Satou Y. Satoh N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), therefore we refer to this gene as hPEM-2. Phylogenetic processing of sequences derived from DH domains of mammalian GEFs was used to classify these GEFs into subfamilies (32Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35469) Google Scholar,33Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The output depicted in Fig. 1 B shows that there is a varying degree of similarity between many members of the DH family proteins that infers their specificity. In this analysis there are four principle branches, which are labeled either “mostly Rho,” “mostly Rac,” “Rho and Cdc42,” and “no consensus” according to the published literature (34Stam J.C. Collard J.G. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 51-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The arm that interested us contained most of the reported exchangers for Rac such as Tiam1, Vav, PIX, and Sos. The similarity of hPEM-2 to Tiam1 in the DH domain, the putative role in embryonic polarization and also the modular similarity to the recently cloned GEF for Rac PIX/COOL prompted us to select it for more extensive analysis. Genomic analysis using the Unigene data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information localized hPEM-2 to a position 145 cR from the top of chromosome X in humans. The protein encoded by hPEM-2 was predicted to encode a protein of approximately 70 kDa, featuring an N-terminal src homology 3 domain, followed by a DH-PH combination, and finally a proline-rich sequence in the C terminus (Fig. 1 C). Northern blotting revealed that hPEM-2 was expressed almost exclusively in the brain, although at longer exposures some signal was also seen in heart tissues. The size of this mRNA ran slightly smaller than the 6-kb marker, suggesting that the 5.4-kb cDNA we obtained initially was full-length (Fig.2 A). This cDNA showed a single open reading frame containing a start codon, preceded by stop codons in all three frames, also indicating that it was full-length. To examine the consequences of hPEM-2 expression in cells, we expressed an N-terminally HA-tagged hPEM-2 in COS-7 cells. As predicted from the cDNA sequence, we found that hPEM-2 was expressed as a 70-kDa protein in these cells (Fig. 2 B). To investigate the activity and specificity of this exchange factor we devised an assay based on the fact that activated, GTP-bound Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 bind specifically to their downstream effectors. We used the CRIB domain from PAK1B (GST-PAK-CD) to probe for activated Rac and Cdc42 (27Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and the REM1 domain from the Rho effector protein Rhotekin (termed GST-C21) to probe for activated Rho (28Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Similar assays have previously been used to investigate the activity of small GTPases in response to stimuli, including Ras, Ral, Rap, Rac, and Rho (27Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the specificity and capacity of the GST-linked proteins to bind to recombinant Rho family GTPases. The GTPases were used either in their inactive GDP-bound form or the in the active conformation after the GDP was exchanged for the GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p. As expected, the GST-PAK-CD fusion appeared specific for Gpp(NH)p Rac and Cdc42, but did not bind to either Gpp(NH)p or GDP Rho (Fig.3 A). GST-C21 featuring the Rho effector motif from Rhotekin was capable only of binding the Gpp(NH)p-RhoA and not the GDP form. It did not bind Rac or Cdc42. We next used growth factors to see whether we could detect stimulation of these GTPases in intact cells using these probes. In morphological studies, PDGF has been reported to activate Rac (1Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), whereas LPA has been described as a Rho stimulus (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3830) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations we found that PDGF stimulation of COS-7 cells led to an increase in the amount of Rac-GTP in GST-PAK-CD pull-downs (Fig.3 B). In pull-downs with GST-C21, RhoA was stimulated by LPA. To study the activity of hPEM-2 in cells we made use of transient expression in COS-7 cells. We used the well characterized GEF proteins, Tiam1 and Dbl, as controls. As previously reported, Dbl activated both Rho and Cdc42 but not Rac (Fig. 4), Tiam1 activated Rac and Cdc42 (Fig. 4, B and C). The activation of Cdc42 by Tiam1 was somewhat surprising. However, we have observed activation of Cdc42 by Tiam1 in other cell types such as PC12 cells (7van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally Tiam1-induced activation of Pak and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) via Cdc42 has previously been reported in COS-7 cells (39Zhou K. Wang Y. Gorski J.L. Nomura N. Collard J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16782-16786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In BW 5147 T-lymphocyte cells, Madin Darby canine kidney cells and NIH3T3, cells Tiam1 specifically activates Rac, 2T. Reid, A. Bathoorn, M. R. Ahmadian, and J. G. Collard, unpublished observations. suggesting that some cell-type variations may exist in the specificity of GEF proteins. In these studies, we found no evidence that hPEM-2 was able to activate either Rac or Rho but it did activate Cdc42 to the same degree as either Tiam1 or Dbl (Fig. 4, A–C). The specificity demonstrated by the two control GEF proteins confirms previously published data and validates the technique as a general method for determining exchange factor specificity in intact cells. We then transfected HA-hPEM-2 into NIH3T3 cells, because COS-7 cells are not well suited to morphological analysis. As controls we also used the GEFs Tiam1 and Dbl. 24-h post-transfection we fixed and stained the cells for expression of HA-hPEM-2 and polymerized actin. Although there was no specific localization of hPEM-2 in these cells, we did notice the formation of filopodia, associated with a profoundly rounded phenotype (Fig.5). The rounded phenotype, which featured a thick ring of cortical actin, seemed more reminiscent of the phenotype exhibited by V12Cdc42 than that of V12Rac, which induced cell spreading (Fig. 5). Transfection of V14Rho also induced some rounding but profoundly effected the architecture of focal adhesions and stress fiber organization, which we failed to observe in cells expressing hPEM-2 (Fig. 5). Although Dbl caused rounding similar to that induced by hPEM-2, there was a concomitant increase in stress fibers that was not seen in cells expressing hPEM-2. In cells that expressed Tiam1, as previously reported, we found an induction of cell spreading and plasma membrane ruffling (22Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed phenotype was consistent with the results of the pull-down assay. In this report we have attempted to group together the specificities of the DH group of GEF proteins using computational methods. A large number of reports have implied that the specificity of DH proteins toward their downstream GTPases is inferred by the DH domain alone. For Lfc, it appears that the PH can bind to tubulin, but is not absolutely required for activity of the DH domain. The PH domain can be replaced with an isoprenylation signal to tag it to the plasma membrane that restores its transforming activity (16Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,40Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We too have found that a chimeric protein featuring the DH domain from Dbl inserted into Tiam1 retains the capacity to activate Rho and Cdc42.2 This indicates that for Dbl, the DH domain alone is sufficient for both specificity and activity provided it is localized at the plasma membrane. With this information, we attempted to see if we could identify a group of related exchange factors based upon sequence analysis using the DH domain from Tiam1 as a probe. BLAST searches with the DH domain from Tiam1 identified other proteins that were reported GEFs for Rac such as PIX/COOL, Vav, and Sos (41Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 42Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

The cladogram shown in Fig. 1 B summarizes our findings and correlates reasonably well with the published data regarding GTPase specificity (reviewed in Ref. 34Stam J.C. Collard J.G. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 51-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although sequence comparisons led us to believe that hPEM-2 would be an exchange factor for Rac, it activates Cdc42 alone. When we expressed this protein in fibroblasts we saw cell rounding rather than the characteristic flattening and plasma membrane ruffling associated with Rac. We examined the specificity of this enzyme using pull-down assays and found that hPEM-2 was specifically a GEF protein for Cdc42 rather than Rac1 or RhoA. This is in agreement with the data from the phenotypic analysis. Moreover, the results from the activity assay for Tiam1 and Dbl also correlated with the published data from previous morphological studies. In these experiments Dbl activated both Rho and Cdc42 (44Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), whereas Tiam1 activated Rac1 (22Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 27Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Tiam1 expression also activated Cdc42 in COS-7 cells, as it also does in PC12 cells (7van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). PEM-2 was originally identified as a transcript in the AscidianC. savignyi, as a maternally encoded gene involved in blastocyst patterning. The polarized staining of PEM-2 transcripts in Ascidian embryos is very reminiscent of V12Cdc42 localization in microinjected blastocysts (26Satou Y. Satoh N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Clayton L. Hall A. Johnson M.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc42 is a principle regulator of cellular orientation to diverse stimuli such as wounding, hormonal, and chemotactic gradients in yeast and in mammalian cells (46Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 47Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Cdc42, but not Rho or Rac, is implicated in lymphocyte polarization toward antigen presenting cells during activation (49Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5027-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Experiments in yeast demonstrated a requirement for Cdc42 to determine the bud site in dividing cells and polarity in mating cells. Recently this has been shown to be principally regulated by the GEF Cdc24 (13Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies point to a role for Cdc42 in the initiation and maintenance of cellular polarity. This might infer a role for hPEM-2 in the localized organization and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton through Cdc42 activity. There is now a wealth of evidence that points to a key role for the members of the Rho family GTPases in the spatial organization of cerebral neuronal processes, where hPEM-2 is most highly expressed in adults. Other work has indicated a role for the Rac and Cdc42 effector PAK in neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (17Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 50Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas another report indicates a role for Cdc42 in the cytoskeletal reorganization, which accompanies differentiation and dendrite formation in cultured neurons (51Threadgill R. Bobb K. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). These reports imply a diverse role for Cdc42, particularly in the regulation of cellular orientation and polarization. Given the possible role of PEM-2 in the regulation of polarity in development, it might be interesting to examine the role of hPEM-2 in neuronal polarization. In conclusion, we have identified a new GEF protein and have shown by morphological analysis and with a biochemical GTP loading assay that it specifically activates Cdc42. Homologues of this gene have been linked to the development of polarity in other cell systems. We are presently investigating whether this DH protein may link polarization and directional organization of the cytoskeleton to Cdc42.

In this study, we explore the possibility that myeloperoxidase-derived HOCl might oxidize nucleic acids. When we exposed 2′-deoxycytidine to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system, we obtained a single major product that was identified as 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine using mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, UV-visible spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. 5-Chloro-2′-deoxycytidine production by myeloperoxidase required H2O2 and Cl−, suggesting that HOCl is an intermediate in the reaction. However, reagent HOCl failed to generate 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine in the absence of Cl−. Moreover, chlorination of 2′-deoxycytidine was optimal under acidic conditions in the presence of Cl−. These results implicate molecular chlorine (Cl2), which is in equilibrium with HOCl through a reaction requiring Cl− and H+, in the generation of 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine. Activated human neutrophils were able to generate 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine. Cellular chlorination was blocked by catalase and heme poisons, consistent with a myeloperoxidase-catalyzed reaction.

In striking contrast, only cell-associated RNA acquired detectable levels of 5-chlorocytosine when intact Escherichia coli was exposed to the myeloperoxidase system. This observation suggests that oxidizing intermediates generated by myeloperoxidase selectively target intracellular RNA for chlorination.

We have previously demonstrated that HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase is in equilibrium with molecular chlorine (Cl2) through a reaction that requires Cl− and H+ (30Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M.

HOCl+H++Cl−↔Cl2+H2O (REACTION2) In vitro studies suggested that the production of 3-chlorotyrosine by reagent HOCl involves molecular chlorine rather than HOCl itself. Moreover, Cl2 derived from HOCl converted cholesterol into a battery of chlorinated and oxygenated sterols (9Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Duffin K. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23080-23088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that 3-chlorotyrosine levels are selectively elevated in human atherosclerotic tissue, strongly suggesting that oxidative reactions involving HOCl or its derivatives are physiologically relevant to tissue damage at sites of inflammation (8Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of cancer, raising the possibility that reactive intermediates generated by phagocytes might damage nucleic acids in living cells, compromising the integrity of the genome or altering cellular functions (31Weitzman S.A. Gordon L.I. Blood. 1990; 76: 655-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover,in vitro studies have identified numerous modified nucleic acids as products of oxidative reactions. Bases in DNA, for example, are hydroxylated by hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen (32Wiseman H. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 33Luo Y.

Halliwell B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), although DNA does not contain uracil. Nucleobases also can be modified by aldehydes, which result from lipid peroxidation (43Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Reddy G.R. Yeola S.N. Morrow J.D. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J.

However, the pathways that promote the production of oxidized nucleobases in vivo and their relevance to human pathology are incompletely understood. We examined the ability of the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system to oxidize nucleic acids by using 2′-deoxycytidine as a target. Using mass spectrometry, chromatography, UV-visible spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy, we identified 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine as the major stable product. Activated neutrophils were also observed to generate 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine in a reaction that was inhibited by heme poisons and catalase. Reactions with reagent HOCl implicated molecular chlorine as the oxidizing intermediate in the reaction pathway. Unexpectedly, 5-chlorocytosine was generated in the RNA but not the DNA of Escherichia coli exposed to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system. These observations raise the possibility that chlorinating intermediates generated by myeloperoxidase modify nucleic acids of pathogens that are attacked by phagocytes. Such intermediates also might modify nucleic acids in host cells at sites of inflammation, setting the scene for carcinogenesis or other deleterious changes. Sodium hypochlorite, H2O2, organic solvents, and sodium phosphate were obtained from Fisher. Methionine and nuclease P1 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).bis-(Trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA)1 + 1% trimethylchlorosilane,N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide + 1% tert-butyl-dimethylchlorosilane (MtBSTFA + 1%tert-butyl-dimethylchlorosilane), silylation grade pyridine, and acetonitrile were from Regis Technologies, Inc. (Morton Grove, IL). Porcine eosinophil peroxidase was provided by Dr. M. L. McCormick (Department of Medicine, University of Iowa). Unless otherwise indicated, all other materials were purchased from Sigma. HL-60 cells were used as starting material for preparation of myeloperoxidase. The enzyme was isolated by sequential lectin affinity and size exclusion chromatographies (20Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar,47Rakita R.M. Michel B.R. Rosen H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Purified myeloperoxidase (A 430/A 280 ratio of 0.6) was dialyzed against water and stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε430 = 178 mm−1cm−1) (48Morita Y. Iwamoto H. Aibara S. Kobayashi T. Hasegawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were prepared by density gradient centrifugation and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.0 (magnesium-, calcium-, phenol red-, and bicarbonate-free; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (49Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1861-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells (≥96% neutrophils; ≤4% eosinophils) were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and maintained in suspension with intermittent inversion. The reaction was terminated by addition of methionine to 6 mm and centrifugation of the cells at 400 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was concentrated to dryness under vacuum, dissolved in 0.3 ml of water, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and subjected to HPLC fractionation. Chloride-free sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was prepared by a modification of previously described methods (12Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Reagent NaOCl (100 ml) mixed with ethyl acetate (100 ml) was protonated by dropwise addition of concentrated phosphoric acid (final pH ≤ 6) with intermittent shaking. The organic phase containing HOCl was washed twice with H2O, and HOCl was re-extracted into H2O by the dropwise addition of NaOH (final pH ≥ 9). Residual ethyl acetate in the aqueous solution of chloride-free NaOCl was removed by bubbling with N2. The concentration of NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically (ε292 = 350m−1 cm−1; Ref. 50Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in gas-tight vials and initiated by addition with a gas-tight syringe of oxidant (H2O2 or HOCl) through a septum while vortexing the sample. Reactions were terminated by addition of a molar excess of l-methionine (6 mm) to eliminate any remaining HOCl, Cl2, and chloramines. The concentration of H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically (ε240 = 43.6m−1 cm−1; Ref. 51Beers R.J. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence of 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine formation was determined using reaction mixtures containing phosphoric acid, monobasic sodium phosphate, and dibasic sodium phosphate (final concentration, 50 mm) that had been treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad). The pH of the reaction mixture (without l-methionine) was determined at the end of incubation. RNA and DNA were extracted with one volume of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl acetate (v/v/v) and one volume of 24:1 chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (v/v) prior to precipitation with [½] volume of 7.5 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol (52Crain P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). ReagentN-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine was synthesized (14Patton W. Bacon V. Duffield A.M. Halpern B. Hoyano Y. Pereira W. Lederberg J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by adding 1 mm HOCl to 1 mm 2′-deoxycytidine in chloride-free 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7). The reaction mixture was not quenched with methionine. Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, N-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine was isolated by HPLC as described below. 2′-Deoxycytidine oxidation products were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a C18column (μPorasil; 5-μm resin, 4.6 × 250 mm; Beckman) with monitoring of absorbance at the 2′-deoxycytidine maximum of 280 nm. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.5), and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol (pH 2.5). The column was equilibrated with 95% solvent A. Compounds were eluted with a discontinuous gradient of solvent B. The gradient was 5% solvent B for 4 min, 5–100% solvent B over 20 min, and then 100% solvent B for 10 min. UV-visible spectra for individual HPLC peaks were obtained using a Beckman diode array detector. For mass spectrometric analysis, HPLC fractions were collected and concentrated under vacuum. 5-Chloro-2′-deoxycytidine yield was quantified by comparison of integrated peak areas to standard curves generated using authentic material. For NMR analysis, 10-fold concentrated reaction mixtures were fractionated on a semi-preparative C18 column (μPorasil; 5-μm resin, 10 × 250 mm; Beckman) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with an isocratic gradient consisting of 90% 20 mmammonium formate (pH 6.3) and 10% methanol.N-Chloro-2′-deoxycytidine (retention time, 10 min) was isolated with a μPorasil C18 column using 5% methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Reaction products were isolated by HPLC, solubilized in D2O and analyzed at 25 °C with a Varian Unity-Plus 500 spectrometer (499.843 MHz for 1H) equipped with a Nalorac indirect detection probe. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d 4 in D2O. Spectra were recorded from 8 transients with a 12-s preacquisition delay over a spectral width of 8000 Hz. E. coli (American Type Tissue Collection, strain 11775) from frozen stocks was cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani broth (Difco Laboratories, Detriot, MI). and used to inoculate 50 ml of broth. Cells were harvested midway through log phase as assessed by absorbance at 600 nm, then chilled to 4 °C, and washed twice with ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). To expose E. coli to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system, cells (5 × 108 cells/ml) were suspended in buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5) at 37 °C. Following the addition of 50 nmmyeloperoxidase and 300 μm H2O2, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 6 mml-methionine and extracting nucleic acids. RNA and DNA were extracted using a modification of the procedure described by Ausubelet al. (53Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 4.4.1-4.4.4Google Scholar). Bacterial cell walls were digested with 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min on ice. Cell lysis was induced by treatment with 1% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 90 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl acetate (25:24:1 v/v/v) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v). Nucleic acids were precipitated with 0.5 volume of 7.5 mammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. For RNA analysis DNA was removed by DNase I digestion in the presence of placental ribonuclease inhibitor, whereas for DNA analysis RNA was removed with a combination of RNase T1 and RNase A (52Crain P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Nucleases and cell debris were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and nucleic acid polymers were isolated by ethanol precipitation. For GC/MS analysis, ethanol-precipitated nucleic acids were suspended in 99% formic acid and hydrolyzed for 45 min at 140 °C under a helium or argon atmosphere. For HPLC fractions of cell media, 3 pmol 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine internal standard was added to each sample. Uniform derivatization efficiency between samples was confirmed by monitoring the m/z 300 ion [M+· − C4H9·] of derivatized 5-fluorocytosine. After drying under vacuum, residual water was removed from the samples by forming an azeotrope with 50 μl of pyridine and again drying the suspension under vacuum. DNA bases were converted to dimethyl, tert-butylsilyl (DMTBS) derivatives with excessN-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide containing 1% t-butyl-dimethylchlorosilane (MtBSTFA + 1%tert-butyl-dimethylchlorosilane) in acetonitrile (3:1 v/v) at 100 °C for 60 min. 1-μl aliquots of the reaction solution were analyzed on a Varian Star 3400 CX gas chromatograph equipped with a 12-m DB-1 capillary column (0.2-mm inner diameter, 0.33-μm film thickness; J&W Scientific) interfaced with a Finnigan SSQ 7000 mass spectrometer operated in the positive electron ionization mode. Injector and interface temperatures were 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The initial GC oven temperature was 80 °C for 2 min, followed by a 60 °C/min increasing ramp to 180 °C and a final 10 °C/min ramp to 220 °C. Samples were analyzed in order of increasing concentration, and derivatizing reagent injections were analyzed between samples to ensure that traces of analyte were not adhering to the injector. GC retention times were established for each analysis session by injection of authentic compounds. HPLC fractions were subjected to solid phase extraction on a C18 column (Supelclean LC-18 SPE tubes, 3 ml; Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA) equilibrated with H2O to remove TFA. The column was washed with 2 ml of H2O and eluted with 3 ml of 50% methanol, and the recovered product was dried under vacuum. Full mass scanning, zoom scanning, and low energy collisionally activated dissociation were carried out on a Finnigan LCQ. A 5-μl portion of sample was injected into the electrospray source at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The electrospray needle was held at 4500 V, and the counterelectrode was held at ground potential. Methanol/water/acetic acid (50:49:1 v/v/v) was used to dissolve samples and as carrier solvent. Helium was used as a damping gas and collision activation partner. The flow of gas (1 ml/min) into the mass analyzer cavity was regulated by a pressure regulator and a capillary restrictor. Flow rates were matched to adjust the partial pressure of helium in the mass analyzer cavity to approximately 10−3 Torr. The temperature of the heated capillary was 200 °C. The collision energy was varied by changing the resonance excitation RF voltage. In the full scan mode (m/z 150 to m/z 300), injection time and microscans were 300 ms and 3 s for acquiring each scan, respectively. For each full scan mass spectrum, 10 scans were signal averaged, and the background from the same number of scans was subtracted. In preliminary experiments, we exposed adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine 2′-deoxynucleosides to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system in buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 100 μm DTPA, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5). After terminating the reaction with methionine (which scavenges HOCl, chloramines, and H2O2), we analyzed the reaction mixture by HPLC, monitoring absorbance at 254 nm for purines and 280 nm for pyrimidines. 2′-Deoxycytidine generated the highest yield of product (Fig. 1). The oxidation product generated by myeloperoxidase eluted from a reverse phase column at a higher methanol concentration than 2′-deoxycytidine; it also absorbed ultraviolet light at a longer wavelength (Fig. 1, inset). The product comigrated with authentic 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine (Fig. 1). Moreover, its absorption spectrum and that of authentic 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine were indistinguishable. When reagent HOCl was substituted for the enzymatic system, we obtained a product from 2′-deoxycytidine whose chromatographic behavior was identical to that of 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine. These observations suggest that the HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase converts 2′-deoxycytidine into 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine. To further investigate the oxidation product structure, we isolated the compounds by HPLC and subjected them to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The positive ion mass spectra of the myeloperoxidase product (Fig. 2 A), the hypochlorite reaction product, and authentic 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine yielded the same major [M + H]+ ion atm/z 262. All three compounds also exhibited a prominent ion at m/z 264. The relative abundances of the ions at m/z 262 and 264 reflected that of the natural isotopic abundance of 35Cl and37Cl, strongly suggesting that the 2′-deoxycytidine oxidation product was monochlorinated. The collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrum of the m/z 262 ion generated a product ion at m/z 146, which is consistent with cleavage of the N-glycoside bond of 5-chloro-2′-deoxycytidine to yield 35Cl-substituted cytosine (Fig. 2 B). The collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrum of the m/z 264 ion likewise generated a product ion at m/z 148, consistent with cleavage of the chlorinated nucleoside to yield37Cl-substituted cytosine (Fig. 2 C). The electrospray ionization MS/MS spectrum of the myeloperoxidase product indicates that the chlorine substitution site is likely to reside on the cytosine base of 2′-deoxycytidine. Further structural characterization of the modified nucleobase generated from 2′-deoxycytidine by myeloperoxidase was achieved using GC/MS to obtain an informative electron ionization mass spectrum and GC retention time from material isolated by HPLC. This procedure yields information only about the nucleo"
https://openalex.org/W2076939714,"We have investigated the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ (Ca m ) homeostasis in cell survival. Disruption of Ca m homeostasis via depletion of the mitochondrial Ca2+ store was the earliest event that occurred during staurosporine-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). The decrease of Ca m preceded activation of the caspase cascade and DNA fragmentation. Overexpression of the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 led to increased Ca m load, increased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m ), and inhibition of staurosporine-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, ectopic expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bik led to decreased Ca m load and decreased ΔΨ m. Inhibition of calcium uptake into mitochondria by ruthenium red induced a dose-dependent apoptosis as determined by nuclear staining and DNA ladder assay. Similarly, reducing the Ca m load by lowering the extracellular calcium concentration also led to apoptosis. We suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 is related to its ability to maintain a threshold level of Ca m and ΔΨ m while the pro-apoptotic protein Bik has the opposite effect. Furthermore, both ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ stores are important, and the depletion of either one will result in apoptosis. Thus, our results, for the first time, provide evidence that the maintenance of Ca m homeostasis is essential for cell survival.

Thus, our results, for the first time, provide evidence that the maintenance of Ca m homeostasis is essential for cell survival. endoplasmic reticulum mitochondrial Ca2+ cytoplasmic Ca2+ extracellular Ca2+ carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone thapsigargin sarcoplasmic reticulum hemagglutinin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium staurosporine 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid mitochondrial membrane potential mitochondrial permeability transition tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester Cellular Ca2+ signaling is a complex process involving coordinated action of various subcellular compartments including endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1mitochondria, nucleus as well as plasma membrane (1Berridge M.J.

While earlier Ca2+ mobilization studies have emphasized the interaction between the plasma membrane and the ER Ca2+ store, recent work from several laboratories has clearly indicated the active participation of mitochondria in this intracellular Ca2+network (3Rizzuto R.

The availability of novel optical indicators for Ca2+ ions has now enabled studies of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling in living cells. It has been demonstrated that, during Ca2+ signaling events, functionally competent mitochondria can rapidly sequester cytoplasmic Ca2+(Ca c ) through a uniporter and subsequently release Ca2+ slowly via the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (10Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamic studies of adrenal chromaffin cells (6Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and T lymphocytes (7Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; : 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) indicate that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake limits the rise of cytosolic Ca2+ and underlies the rapid decay of Ca c signal. Furthermore, suppressing export of Ca2+ by inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger hastens final recovery of Ca c (6Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 7Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; : 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It is suggested that mitochondria are essential for both the generation of Ca2+ signals, and the modulation of store-operated or “capacitative” Ca2+entry. Studies in excitable and nonexcitable cells have suggested several important consequences of Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria. First, increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration (Ca m ) are believed to modulate the production of ATP. Several dehydrogenases that supply substrates for the electron transport chain, are stimulated by Ca2+ (11Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hansford R.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Nichols B.J. Denton R.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 203-212Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recentin vivo studies have also verified that mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ is accompanied by increased levels of NADH or NADPH (5Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 14Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) and activation of the matrix enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (15Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia T. Pozzan T. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This behavior is thought to couple the rate of ATP production to demand such that, during periods of high cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration ([Ca c ]), the increased rate of ATP hydrolysis by Ca2+ pumps is balanced by enhanced ATP generation. In addition, mitochondrial uptake may help to maintain normal calcium homeostasis and protect cells from apoptotic insult. The anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 is localized to the mitochondrial membrane as well as ER and nuclear membranes (16Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-localization of Bcl-2 with Ca2+ pumps and channels on ER and nuclear membrane has raised the possibility for a role of Bcl-2 in the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in these compartments. Previously, several groups including ours have reported modulation of ER (17He H. Lam M. MacDonald T.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Kuo T.H. Kim H-R.C. Yu L. Zhu Y. Lin H-M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) or nuclear Ca2+ stores by Bcl-2 (19Marin M. Fernandez A. Bick R.J. Brisbay S. Buja L.M. Snuggs M. McConkey D.J. von Eschenbach A.C. Keating M.J. McDonnell T.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2259-2266PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of Bcl-2 on mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis has been unclear. In the present study, we have examined the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on mitochondrial Ca2+ load and the relationship between mitochondrial Ca2+ load and the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m ). We find that Bcl-2 enhances mitochondrial Ca2+ load and enables cells to maintain a stable ΔΨ m to offset the insult by pro-apoptotic agents such as Bik or staurosporine which promote the decrease of ΔΨ m and cause depletion of the mitochondrial Ca2+ store. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C. Recombinant adenovirus type 5 expressing human Bcl-2 and Escherichia coli LacZ have been described (20Uhlmann E.J. Subramanian T. Vater C.A. Lutz R. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17926-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Construction of recombinant adenovrius expressing human Bik tagged with HA epitope will be described elsewhere. To overexpress Bcl-2, LacZ, or Bik, cells were infected with the appropriate virus at 100 plaque-forming units/cell in DMEM with 5% serum. After 6 h of infection, the medium was replaced with DMEM growth medium containing 10% serum. Cells were used 24 h later after virus infection. The expression of the Bcl-2 or HA-Bik was verified by Western blot analysis. For detecting Bcl-2 or Bik protein expression, 70–80% confluent cells were lysed and protein samples were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel for Western blotting as described previously (18Kuo T.H. Kim H-R.C. Yu L. Zhu Y. Lin H-M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 antibody was obtained from Dako. A monoclonal antibody 12CA5 that recognizes HA epitope was used for Bik detection. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was measured using the Photon Technology International instrument and the fluorescent dye Fura-2 as described previously (21Liu B.F. Xu X. Fridman R. Muallem S. Kuo T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5536-5544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells grown on coverslip (approximately 5 × 104 cells/coverslip) were loaded with Fura 2/AM (4 μm) in loading buffer A containing (in mm) 5.4 KCl, 137 NaCl, 0.44 KH2PO4, 4.2 NaHCO3, 0.34 Na2HPO4, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4), 11.1 d-glucose, 2 CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Fura 2 fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 500 nm. To begin the fluorescence measurement, cells were rinsed (after 30 min of dye loading) in loading buffer A without Ca2+. After establishing the base line, cells were then treated with either ionomycin (10 μm) plus 0.1 mm EGTA or thapsigargin (1 μm) plus 0.1 mm EGTA. A standard curve was used to convert the fluorescence ratio to Ca2+ concentration. Rhod2-AM was used to measure mitochondrial Ca2+ according to the procedure of Hajnoczky et al. (14Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Rhod2-AM has a net positive charge, which facilitates its sequestration into mitochondria due to membrane potential-driven uptake. The use of dihydro-rhod2-AM enhances the selectivity for mitochondrial loading because this dye exhibits Ca2+-dependent fluorescence only after it is oxidized and this occurs preferentially within mitochondria. Cells were loaded with 4 μm dihydro-rhod2-AM for 60 min. The residual cytosolic fraction of the dye was eliminated when the cells were kept in culture for an additional 18 h after loading, whereas the mitochondrial dye fluorescence was maintained. Cellular fluorescence was measured by the Photon Technology International system with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 580 nm or by image acquisition using the Meridian ACAS laser confocal microscope. The fluorescence units (counts/s) or the average pixel intensity/cell was determined. Rhod2 fluorescence was not calibrated in terms of [Ca2+], since it is not a radiometric dye and is localized in only a small compartment within the cell (14Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) was used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m ) according to Ichas et al. (22Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.-P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Cells infected with recombinant adenovirus (for 24 h) were loaded with 0.2 μm TMRM for 20 min in culture medium. Cells were then rinsed and transferred to a chamber on the microscope stage in the same loading buffer A (containing glucose and no Ca2+) as the Fura-2 experiments. Images were collected at every 10 s using Meridian ACAS laser confocal microscope with excitation at 514 nm and emission at 575 nm, and the average pixel intensity/cell was determined. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33258 according to Jacobson and Raff (23Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Apoptotic nuclei were visualized and counted under epifluorescence illumination (340 nm excitation and 510 nm barrier filter) using a 40× oil immersion objective (more than 200 cells/culture were counted, and counts were made in at least four to six separate cultures). Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate in 100-mm plate and grown for 24 h in medium containing 10% serum. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of ruthenium red in medium without serum for 24 h. Cells were then scraped and pelleted. The cell pellet was lysed in buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. DNA was extracted and analyzed on 1% agarose gel as described by Loo and Rillema (24Loo D.T. Rillema J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 57: 251-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1% Trition x-100. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for protein determination and caspase assay (Biomol kit). Caspase 3-like activity was determined by continuously monitoring the proteolysis of the substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide at 405 nm in a microtiter plate (Bio-Rad). Data were collected at 30-s intervals for the entire assay period up to 30 min. An inhibitorN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde was used to measure the nonspecific activity. The specific activity was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific activity from the total activity as described by the protocol from the Biomol kit. Values are mean ± S.D. Significance was determined by Student's t test. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered to be significant. We have examined the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on the Ca2+ load of the internal store in the neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). For this purpose, cells infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing Bcl-2 (Ad-Bcl2) were compared with cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing E. coli LacZ (Ad-LacZ). Fig. 1 A shows the Western analysis of Bcl-2 protein in the cell lysate prepared 24 h after infection. Results from three experiments indicated that there was a low level of endogenous Bcl-2 present in control cells infected with Ad-LacZ, while the level of Bcl-2 was enhanced by more than 2-fold in cells infected with Ad-Bcl2. To estimate the loading state of the internal stores, Bcl-2 overexpressing cells and control cells were treated with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore that releases Ca2+ from ER store as well as mitochondrial store. The addition of ionomycin (10 μm) resulted in the release of Ca2+ into the cytosol, where it was measured by Fura-2 as an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (21Liu B.F. Xu X. Fridman R. Muallem S. Kuo T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5536-5544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To block Ca2+ influx due to the release of internal Ca2+store, i.e. the capacitative Ca2+ entry (25Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar), these experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (see “Materials and Methods”). Under this condition, the increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+(Ca c ) triggered by ionomycin is largely due to release from the ER and the mitochondrial stores. After reaching a peak within 60 s, the Ca c started to decline to near basal level. Fig. 1 B shows that the resting level of Ca c was similar for Bcl-2 expressing cells and control cells (ranging from 66 ± 2.4 nm for control, and 70 ± 6.5 nm for Bcl-2 cells, n = 8). However, the ionomycin-induced release of Ca2+ was significantly higher in Bcl-2 expressing cells (151 ± 22 nm) as compared with controls (87 ± 9.7,p < 0.001, n = 5). The results suggest increased loading of the internal store in the Bcl-2 overexpressing cells. Since the ionomycin-sensitive stores encompass both the ER and the mitochondria compartments, we then examined the effect of Bcl-2 on the Ca2+ load of the ER store, which is sensitive to thapsigargin (Tg, 1 μm), a specific inhibitor of the ER calcium ATPase. Fig. 1 C shows that Tg induced a larger increase of Ca c in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells than controls. Results from five independent experiments indicated that the Tg-releasable ER Ca2+ was 90 ± 7.8 nmfor Bcl-2 and 73 ± 4.6 nm for controls (p < 0.01). These results are consistent with our previous report of enhanced ER Ca2+ load in the breast epithelial cells by Bcl-2 overexpression (18Kuo T.H. Kim H-R.C. Yu L. Zhu Y. Lin H-M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To further test if the mitochondria Ca2+ store is also increased by Bcl-2, we evaluated the mitochondrial store in SH-SY5Y cells infected with Ad-Bcl2 or Ad-LacZ by using rhod2 as the specific probe for mitochondria Ca2+ (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 2 A shows the time-resolved measurement of mitochondrial Ca2+(Ca m ). The concentration of Ca m was represented in fluorescence units. Initially, at the resting state, in the absence of external Ca2+, Ca m was at a basal level. Addition of FCCP (4 μm, see arrow), a protonophore led to collapse of the mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨ m ), and release of Ca m as shown by a rapid reduction in rhod2 fluorescence. Since de-energized mitochondria no longer take up Ca2+, the magnitude of the fluorescence reduction was used to estimate the Ca2+ load in the mitochondrial store. Fig.2 A shows that the addition of 4 μm FCCP caused larger release of Ca m in Bcl-2 cells than control cells. Calculation of the percentage of release (defined as the difference between the initial fluorescence and the final fluorescence that occurred within 100 s after FCCP addition, divided by the initial fluorescence) indicated 6.7% for Bcl-2 cells and 2.4% for controls. Results from four independent experiments indicated that the percentage of release (representing Ca m load) was approximately 3 times higher in the Bcl-2 group as compared with the control group (Bcl-2/control = 3.4 ± 1.0,n = 4). In addition, comparison of basal fluorescence intensity under the same loading condition (i.e. same day and same cell density), also indicated an average value of 9245 ± 600 counts/s for Bcl-2 group versus 7875 ± 475 for the control group (two independent experiments). The results are consistent with an enhanced load of Ca m in the Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. This conclusion is further supported by the Fura-2 experiment that monitors the change in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (Ca c ). Fig.2 B shows that addition of 4 μm FCCP led to a gradual and sustained increase of Ca c as a consequence of mitochondrial release. FCCP triggered a larger increase of Ca c in Bcl-2 cells than controls. We have determined the optimal concentration of FCCP required for the maximal release of Ca m for Bcl-2 cells and control cells. Fig. 3(A and B) shows the dose-response experiments of the control and Bcl-2 groups, respectively. Initially, at 4 μm FCCP, the release of Ca m was minimal. Replacement of 4 μm FCCP with 6 μmFCCP led to further release of Ca m. Successive additions of higher concentration of FCCP were accompanied by incremental release of Ca m until maximal response was reached. Fig. 3 C shows the dependence of Ca m release on FCCP concentration for both Bcl-2 cells and control cells. There was a linear relationship between the FCCP concentration and Ca m release until maximal release was obtained. Results from several independent experiments indicated that maximal release of Ca m occurred at 10 μm FCCP for the control group (13 ± 3%,n = 3) and 16 μm FCCP for the Bcl-2 group (33 ± 8%, n = 4). In agreement with Fig. 2, there was a larger release of Ca m for Bcl-2 cells than controls at 4 μm of FCCP, confirming the enhanced Ca m load in the Bcl-2 cells. The present study of the living cell is consistent with a study of isolated mitochondria showing enhanced calcium uptake by Bcl-2 (26Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Because uptake of Ca m by the uniporter is directly proportional to mitochondrial membrane potential (27Wingrove D.E. Amatruda J.M. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9390-9394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Akerman K.E.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 502: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the increased Ca m accumulation in the Bcl-2 cells suggests an increased ΔΨ m in the Bcl-2 mitochondria (to be shown later). In order to understand the functional significance of mitochondrial Ca2+ loading, we proceeded to examine the status of the Ca m in cells that overexpress Bik, a pro-apoptotic protein that has antagonistic function to Bcl-2 (29Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma cells were infected with the adenovirus vector expressing human Bik insert (see “Materials and Methods”). After 24 h, the cells were lysed and analyzed for Bik expression by Western blot. The results indicated that there was no HA-Bik expression in the control cells (infected with Ad-LacZ) while HA-Bik expression was prominent in cells infected with the Ad-Bik (Fig.4 A). The status of the Ca m load was examined in a laser cytometer (Meridian Instrument), where changes of fluorescence image were followed at the single cell level for Bcl-2, control and Bik groups (Fig. 4 B). Comparison of basal fluorescence indicated that the average pixel intensity per cell was 822 ± 151 (n = 13) for Bcl-2, 580 ± 110 (n= 5) for control, and 413 ± 100 (n = 10) for Bik-expressing cells. More quantitative evaluation of the Ca m load by FCCP-sensitive release (Fig.4 B) also indicated that the addition of 20 μmFCCP caused 14.6 ± 4.5% (n = 8) of Ca m release in Bcl-2, 9.0 ± 1.7% (n = 6) for control, and 5.1 ± 4% (n = 9) for Bik cells. Thus the Ca m load was highest in the Bcl-2 group, intermediate in the control group, and lowest in the Bik group. Interestingly, this study at the single cell level also revealed that Bcl-2 cells were more resistant to 20 μm FCCP treatment than Bik-expressing cells (compare Bcl-2 panel with the Bik panel in Fig. 4 B). While the release of Ca m by FCCP was completed in 30 s for the Bik-expressing cells, it required almost 300 s to deplete the Ca m in the Bcl-2 cells. We also measured mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ m ) in cells that overexpress Bcl-2 or Bik. A cationic fluorophore, TMRM, was used as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential ΔΨ m (30Heiskanen K.M. Bhat M.B. Wang H.-W. Ma J. Nieminen A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,31Scaduto Jr., R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). After loading (20 min) and removal of excess TMRM, the fluorescence in the cells were compared at t = 0. There was stronger TMRM fluorescence (warmer pseudocolored image) in a typical Bcl-2-expressing cell than a typical Bik-expressing cell (data not shown), suggesting higher membrane potential in the former than in the latter. Furthermore, the fluorescence was stable in the Bcl-2-expressing cell during the measurement when image scan was continuously monitored at every 10-s interval for 3 min. In contrast, the fluorescence of Bik-expressing cells was continuously declining indicating the loss of ΔΨ m. In fact, it required the addition of oligomycin, a mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, to prevent the hydrolysis of cellular ATP and thereby stabilize the ΔΨ m temporarily. Hence, the measurement of TMRM fluorescence in the presence of oligomycin represented an overestimate of ΔΨ m for the Bik cells. Results from three independent experiments indicated that the Bcl-2 cells had TMRM fluorescence of 719 ± 159 units versus283 ± 12 units (n = 3, p < 0.02) for the Bik cells. Therefore the ΔΨ m of the Bcl-2 cells was at least 2.6 ± 0.4-fold higher than Bik cells. Taken together, these experiments indicate that higher ΔΨ m is associated with increased Ca m load in Bcl-2 cells and lower ΔΨ m is associated with decreased Ca m load in Bik cells. To further demonstrate that Ca m load is important for normal mitochondrial function and cell survival, we tested the effect of staurosporine (STS), a commonly used apoptosis inducer. It has been shown in SH-SY5Y cells that treatment with 0.5 μm STS leads to translocation of endogenous Bax from cytosol to mitochondria at 15 min, release of cytochrome c at 1 h, activation of caspase at 2–4 h, and initiation of apoptosis at 4 h (32McGinnis K.M. Gnegy M.E. Wang K.K.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have also confirmed these observations. 2L. Zhu, S. Ling, X.-D. Yu, and T. H. Kuo, unpublished results. In addition, we demonstrate here that STS triggers an immediate release of Ca m in these cells (which precedes Bax translocation and cytochrome c release). Fig.5 A shows that STS caused an immediate release of Ca m similar to the effect of FCCP shown in Fig. 2 A. The STS-induced Ca m release was also concomitant with an increase of Ca c (data not shown). Comparing control cells (Fig. 5 A) with Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5 B) indicated that Bcl-2 cells were more resistant to STS treatment. While it was sufficient to use 0.5 μm STS to completely deplete the Ca m store in control cells, the same STS concentration caused only partial depletion of the store in Bcl-2 cells. Presumably this remaining Ca m load may be sufficient for cell survival. We have also determined caspase activity using cell extracts that was prepared after 4 h of treatment with 0.5 μm STS (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 5 C shows that STS treatment for 4 h led to prominent activation of caspase in control cells but no activation in the Bcl-2 cells (data were taken continuously at 30-s intervals during the 30-min assay). The caspase 3-like activity was 1.8 OD/min/mg of cell extract for control cells, while Bcl-2 cells had zero activity. Since at 0.5 μm, STS caused complete depletion of Ca m in control cells and only partial depletion in Bcl-2 cells, the results suggest that maintenance of Ca m load at a threshold level by Bcl-2 relates to its anti-apoptotic activity. To demonstrate a direct relationship between mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and cell survival, we then treated normal SH-SY5Y cells with ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial uniporter. Prior control study has indicated that ruthenium red (25 μm) was effective to block the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (data not shown). The ability of ruthenium red to promote apoptosis was judged by the Hoechst dye staining of the apoptotic nuclei (see “Materials and Methods”). It should be mentioned that this assay gave a conservative estimate of apoptosis because only cells attached to the coverslip were counted, while the dead cells that became detached from the coverslip were not counted. Results from four independent experiments (Fig.6 A), indicated that while the untreated control group had negligible number of apoptotic nuclei per 200 counted cells (0.4 ± 0.2, n = 10), treatment with ruthenium red (25 μm, 24 h) led to significant increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei (3.3 ± 1.8,p < 0.001, n = 8). This effect was concentration-dependent such that increasing ruthenium red to 100 μm produced more apoptotic nuclei (6.3 ± 0.5, p < 0.001, n = 8). This result was confirmed by the DNA ladder assay (Fig. 6 B), where increasing ruthenium red concentration from 25 μm to 1 mm produced a dose-dependent increase in the ladder formation as compared with untreated control. These data demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by ruthenium red results in efficient apoptosis. We reasoned that if depletion of Ca m leads to cell death, then strategies to increase or maintain the mitochondrial Ca2+ store should promote cell survival. Therefore"

Medium conditioned by mouse F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells stably transfected to express either Xenopus Wnt-5a or Wnt-8 was used to test primitive endoderm formation of F9 stem cells. F9 stem cells expressing the rat Frizzled-1 receptors demonstrated endoderm formation in response to conditioned medium containing Wnt-8 but not to medium containing Wnt-5a. Primitive endoderm formation stimulated by Wnt-8 acting on the rat Frizzled-1 receptor was blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin by depletion of either Gαo or Gαq via antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, as well as by inhibitors of protein kinase C (bisindoylmaleimide) and of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (PD98059). Our results demonstrate the requirement for G-protein subunits Gαo (a pertussis toxin substrate) and Gαq for signaling by Frizzled-1, and an obligate role for the protein kinase C (likely mediated through stimulation of Gαq) and mitogen-activated protein kinase network at the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.

Formation of primitive endoderm in response to Wnt stimulation is used as the read-out for activation of the Rfz-1 receptor. Xwnt-8, but not Xwnt-5a, induced formation of primitive endoderm in F9 stem cells, and this response can be blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin and by depletion of G-proteins Gαo and Gαq.

Although Frizzled-1 members display the same tentative heptihelical motif, far less is known about how Frizzled-1 receptors signal. In this work, we express Xenopus Wnt-5a and -8 in mouse F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells to generate conditioned medium with which to supplement clones expressing the rat frizzled 1 (Rfz-1)1 receptor. Formation of primitive endoderm in response to Wnt stimulation is used as the read-out for activation of the Rfz-1 receptor. Xwnt-8, but not Xwnt-5a, induced formation of primitive endoderm in F9 stem cells, and this response can be blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin and by depletion of G-proteins Gαo and Gαq."

The SOD was a glycoprotein; the apparent molecular mass of its native form was 120 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration chromatography, and that of its monomer was 22,072 Da, as estimated by time of flight mass spectroscopy. The protein had manganese with a stoichiometry of 0.80 Mn/monomer. The cDNA clone for a gene encoding the extracellular Mn-SOD was isolated. Sequence analysis showed that it has a strong similarity to germin (oxalate oxidase) and germin-like proteins (GLPs) of several plant species and possesses all the characteristic features of members of the germin family. The clone encoding this extracellular Mn-SOD was therefore designated B. unguiculata GLP (BuGLP). BuGLP had no oxalate oxidase activity. In addition, the cDNA for a gene encoding the moss mitochondrial Mn-SOD was isolated. Its amino acid sequence had little similarity to that of BuGLP, even though a close similarity was observed among the mitochondrial Mn-SODs of various organisms.

Some Gram-positive bacteria produce extracellular SODs: Nocardia asteroides secretes into the medium a unique form of SOD containing Fe, Mn, and Zn (16Beaman B.L. Scates S.M. Moring S.E. Deem R.

Thus, germins are suggested to catalyze cell-wall reinforcement by oxidative cross-linking (23Lane B.G. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or to protect leaves against infectious microorganisms by generating H2O2 (22Vallelian-Bindschedler L. Mösinger E. Metraux J.-P.

Phytopathol. 1995; 33: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In plants other than wheat and barley, proteins closely related to germins are identified and termed germin-like proteins (GLPs) (25Dunwell J.M. Biotechnology Genet. Eng. Rev. 1998; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Some of these GLPs have no oxalate oxidase activity, and the biological function of some GLPs is not comparable to germins.Our interest in this study has been focused on determining how land plants evolved SOD molecules to adapt cells to the oxygen-accumulated atmosphere. We have taken notice of SODs of the bryophytes, which are considered to be the first land plants and to occupy a critical position in the evolution of land plants. We first studied SODs of liverwort, Marcantia paleacea var. diptera, which is evolutionarily the most basal lineage among bryophytes, and found that it has a cytosolic CuZn-SOD with properties similar to CuZn-SODs found in choloroplasts in higher plants (26Tanaka K. Takio S. Yamamoto I. Satoh T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Tanaka K. Takio S. Yamamoto I. Satoh T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Then, we expanded the study to the SODs of a moss, Barbula unguiculata, that is considered morphologically to be more closely related to vascular plants. During the study, we found that cells of the moss excreted Mn-SOD in the medium. The extracellular Mn-SOD was found, quite interestingly, a germin-like protein with Mn-SOD activity but no oxalate oxidase activity. The protein is the first germin-like protein with SOD activity carrying manganese as a prosthetic group.DISCUSSIONThe present report deals with distinctive nature of an extracellular protein newly isolated from a moss, B. unguiculata. The sequence of the protein showed clearly the similarity to germin or GLPs of plant origins but not to the mitochondrial Mn-SOD of the same moss. As for activity, on the contrary, it had SOD activity with manganese as a prosthetic group but none of the oxalate oxidase activity commonly shown in germins. Although there are no reports that germins or GLPs possess SOD activity, the present results on the sequence similarity, together with the in vivo oligomeric form (120 kDa) with glycosylated monomers (22,072 Da), indicates that the EC Mn-SOD is a member of GLPs.Although there is little sequence similarity between BuGLP with Mn-SOD activity and the moss mitochondrial Mn-SOD, one interesting question is whether the amino acid residues, which are highly indicative of a role in manganese binding and enzyme activity, are similar between them. Gane et al. (37Gane P.J. Dunwell J.M. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed the germin/oxalate oxidase three-dimensional model and described that the three histidine residues (His-88, His-90, and His-134, numbered as for BuGLP in Fig. 3) lie on neighboring antiparallel β-strands and form a cluster of adjacent side-chain imidazole groups. They predicted that the histidine cluster is the metal-binding site, the oxalate oxidase active site, although the metal cofactor of germin/oxalate oxidase has never been demonstrated. Kotsira and Clonis (30Kotsira V.P. Clonis Y.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) employed chemical techniques to modify barley root germin to identify amino acid residues essential for enzyme activity and suggested that germin is a metalloenzyme, the metal(s) of which is involved in the oxidative mechanism, although the metal has not yet been identified. BuGLP has Mn-SOD activity, and manganese was actually identified with a stoichiometry of 0.80 atom/monomer. This is the first identification of metal in germins and GLPs. The primary sequence of BuGLP indicates that the protein has the germin box, including three histidine residues (His-88, His-90, and His-134). This, together with the fact that three histidines and an aspartate in mitochondrial Mn-SOD have been shown to ligate manganese (36Jackson S.M.J. Cooper J.B. BioMetals. 1998; 11: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicates that the histidine cluster in BuGLP could be assigned as the manganese-binding site. More detailed experiments are being conducted to prove the hypothesis.The specific role of germins is considered to be generation of Ca2+ and H2O2 by degradation of oxalate, both of which are required for peroxidase-mediated reactions, such as cross-linking reaction of cell wall polysaccharides and lignification during germination (23Lane B.G. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GLPs are isolated in gymnosperms, such as pines, and in dicot species (25Dunwell J.M. Biotechnology Genet. Eng. Rev. 1998; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but some of GLPs have no oxalate oxidase activity. Thus, it is still unclear whether their biological function is comparable to germins despite numerous studies on GLPs and their expression. In plants, extracellular CuZn-SODs are identified (14Streller S. Wingsle G. Planta. 1994; 192: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Ogawa K. Kanematsu S. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 790-799Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the physiological function of which is considered to be the production of H2O2 from superoxide, which also facilitates the biosynthesis of lignin. The fact that BuGLP is extracted readily by 1 m NaCl from the moss cells suggests that BuGLP is localized outside of the cell and probably associated with the cell wall with no covalent cross-link. The evidence, together with the lack of oxalate oxidase activity in BuGLP, makes it possible to speculate that BuGLP is also involved in supplying H2O2 by disproportionation of superoxide for the cross-linking of cell wall. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 (EC 1.15.1.1) is of major importance in protecting living cells against superoxide anion toxicity produced under oxidatively stressed circumstances.

Although there is little sequence similarity between BuGLP with Mn-SOD activity and the moss mitochondrial Mn-SOD, one interesting question is whether the amino acid residues, which are highly indicative of a role in manganese binding and enzyme activity, are similar between them. Gane et al. (37Gane P.J. Dunwell J.M. Warwicker J. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed the germin/oxalate oxidase three-dimensional model and described that the three histidine residues (His-88, His-90, and His-134, numbered as for BuGLP in Fig. 3) lie on neighboring antiparallel β-strands and form a cluster of adjacent side-chain imidazole groups. They predicted that the histidine cluster is the metal-binding site, the oxalate oxidase active site, although the metal cofactor of germin/oxalate oxidase has never been demonstrated. Kotsira and Clonis (30Kotsira V.P. Clonis Y.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) employed chemical techniques to modify barley root germin to identify amino acid residues essential for enzyme activity and suggested that germin is a metalloenzyme, the metal(s) of which is involved in the oxidative mechanism, although the metal has not yet been identified. BuGLP has Mn-SOD activity, and manganese was actually identified with a stoichiometry of 0.80 atom/monomer. This is the first identification of metal in germins and GLPs. The primary sequence of BuGLP indicates that the protein has the germin box, including three histidine residues (His-88, His-90, and His-134). This, together with the fact that three histidines and an aspartate in mitochondrial Mn-SOD have been shown to ligate manganese (36Jackson S.M.J. Cooper J.B. BioMetals. 1998; 11: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicates that the histidine cluster in BuGLP could be assigned as the manganese-binding site. More detailed experiments are being conducted to prove the hypothesis. The specific role of germins is considered to be generation of Ca2+ and H2O2 by degradation of oxalate, both of which are required for peroxidase-mediated reactions, such as cross-linking reaction of cell wall polysaccharides and lignification during germination (23Lane B.G. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GLPs are isolated in gymnosperms, such as pines, and in dicot species (25Dunwell J.M. Biotechnology Genet. Eng. Rev. 1998; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but some of GLPs have no oxalate oxidase activity. Thus, it is still unclear whether their biological function is comparable to germins despite numerous studies on GLPs and their expression. In plants, extracellular CuZn-SODs are identified (14Streller S. Wingsle G. Planta. 1994; 192: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Ogawa K. Kanematsu S. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 790-799Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the physiological function of which is considered to be the production of H2O2 from superoxide, which also facilitates the biosynthesis of lignin. The fact that BuGLP is extracted readily by 1 m NaCl from the moss cells suggests that BuGLP is localized outside of the cell and probably associated with the cell wall with no covalent cross-link. The evidence, together with the lack of oxalate oxidase activity in BuGLP, makes it possible to speculate that BuGLP is also involved in supplying H2O2 by disproportionation of superoxide for the cross-linking of cell wall."

In this study, we have investigated the recognition of AREs by AUF1 in vitro using oligoribonucleotide substrates.

In many cases, sequence elements within individual mRNAs function ascis-acting determinants of their stability, either constitutively or in response to external stimuli. Conceptually, modulation of mRNA turnover rates may be envisioned as altering the activity or accessibility of one or more ribonucleases toward a specific transcript. At present, however, few mechanistic details are available linking cis-acting RNA sequence elements with the decay machinery necessary for hydrolysis of the target mRNA. AREs1 are potentcis-acting determinants of rapid cytoplasmic mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. They generally consist of one or more overlapping AUUUA pentamers contained within or near a U-rich tract (3Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), suggesting that some link also exists between protein synthesis and mRNA decay mechanisms. AUF1 is an RNA-binding protein that exhibits many characteristics of atrans-acting factor participating in ARE-directed mRNA turnover (reviewed in Ref. 21Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that AUF1 may function as a targeting system for AREs, either recruiting or promoting the assembly of multisubunit trans-acting complexes at these sites (22Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 23DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Several cytoplasmic proteins co-immunoprecipitate with AUF1, indicating that AUF1 associates with additional factors in vivo (25Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Some of these have been identified immunologically as the translation initiation factor eIF4G, poly(A)-binding protein, heat shock protein 70, and the 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein (26Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The identification of these associated proteins is evidence of a physical link between AUF1 and factors involved in translation and mRNA turnover. Elucidation of the mechanisms contributing to rapid mRNA turnover by AREs will require further understanding of both the molecular architecture of the trans-acting complex(es) as well as the molecular events involved in recognition of AREs by these factors. In particular, the direct interaction of AUF1 with target RNA sequences may serve to nucleate factor binding or transduce some signal to activate pre-assembled complexes. In this study, we have investigated the interaction of AUF1 in vitro with the following two U-rich oligoribonucleotides: the core ARE from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA, and a uridylate homopolymer. We present evidence that recognition of U-rich RNA sequences by AUF1 initiates the assembly of AUF1 multimers involving both RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions by sequential binding of AUF1 dimers. The application of fluorescence anisotropy to the study of RNA:AUF1 solution equilibria allowed estimation of the equilibrium constants for both initial and secondary binding events as well as an assessment of complex dynamics by off-rate analyses. Finally, we discuss potential functional consequences of RNA-dependent AUF1 oligomerization in the control of cytoplasmic mRNA turnover. All RNA oligonucleotides (2′-hydroxyl) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Boulder, CO). The sequence of each RNA probe is listed in Fig. 1 A. Following 2′-O-deprotection according to the manufacturer's instructions (27Scaringe S.A. Wincott F.E. Caruthers M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11820-11821Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), RNA oligonucleotides were quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Estimates of the extinction coefficients for each RNA probe at 260 nm were calculated as described (28.Google Scholar). For fluorescein-tagged probes, absorbance at 260 nm was corrected by quantitation of the fluorescein moiety at 495 nm as described (29Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The substrate “TNFα ARE” corresponds to the core ARE from the 3′-UTR of human TNFα mRNA. The RNA substrate “U32” contains a uridylate homopolymeric sequence, and “Rβ” encodes a fragment of the rabbit β-globin coding region. Duplicate oligoribonucleotides containing 5′-fluorescein labels were also synthesized and are designated Fl-TNFα ARE, Fl-U32, and Fl-Rβ, respectively. For gel mobility shift assays, TNFα ARE, U32, and Rβ substrates were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) and [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) to specific activities of 3–5 × 103 cpm/fmol. Unincorporated radiolabel was removed by spin column chromatography using G-25 Quick Spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Probe-specific activity was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and RNA integrity was verified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. 32P-Labeled RNA probes were detected as single bands (data not shown) indicating that they were predominantly (>99%) full length. The construction of plasmids pTrcHisB-AUF1-(1–257) and pTrcHisB-AUF1-(1–229) was described previously (24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pTrcHisB-AUF1-(1–257) encodes a stable, N-terminal His6-tagged mutant of human p37AUF1lacking 30 amino acid residues from the C terminus but showing comparable ARE binding activity to full-length p37AUF1(24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pTrcHisB-AUF1-(1–229) encodes a truncation mutant of p37AUF1 lacking all sequences C-terminal of the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Recombinant His6-AUF1 mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described (30Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods Compan. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and were judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. For protein cross-linking studies, His6 proteins were dialyzed against 10 mmHEPES·KOH (pH 7.5) prior to concentration. Where indicated, a 3500-Da N-terminal fragment containing the His6 tag was removed from His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) using the recombinant enterokinase kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mock-digested reaction was also assembled to control for changes in protein activity resulting from prolonged incubation at room temperature (2 h). All recombinant proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein concentrations were also evaluated by comparison of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels containing recombinant proteins and a titration of bovine serum albumin. Determination of protein concentrations by both methods yielded estimates within 10%. Binding reactions for gel mobility shift assays were performed with a range of His6-AUF1 fusion protein concentrations and 0.15 nm32P-labeled RNA in a final volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermine, 0.1 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin, 8 units of RNasin (Promega), 33% glycerol, and 1 μg/μl heparin. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and immediately fractionated through 6% (40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) non-denaturing gels as described (30Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods Compan. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reaction products were visualized by PhosphorImager scan (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP)-mediated protein cross-linking was performed in 10-μl reactions containing 10 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm magnesium acetate. In this buffer system, HEPES-dialyzed His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) or His6-p37AUF1-(1–229) was diluted to 5 μm in the presence or absence of 1.5 μmRNA. DSP (Pierce) was then added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was then quenched by addition of Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) to 1 m final concentration and incubation for a further 15 min. Reaction products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents. Complexes containing AUF1 were identified by probing immunoblots with anti-AUF1 antiserum (25Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Secondary antibody detection was performed using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Detection Kit (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made using the Beacon 2000 variable temperature fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) equipped with fluorescein excitation (490 nm) and emission (535 nm) filters. Binding reactions were assembled as described for gel mobility shift assays (above) except that no glycerol was added, and the final volume was 100 μl. For equilibrium binding experiments, the polarimeter was operated in static mode, with each sample read as blank prior to addition of fluorescein-labeled RNA probes. Following probe addition, samples were incubated for 1 min before anisotropy was measured. Preliminary on-rate analyses demonstrated that anisotropic equilibrium was reached within 10 s (data not shown). Data points represent the mean of 10 measurements for each binding reaction. Samples for off-rate analyses were similarly assembled, except that following an initial reading (t = 0), a 5000-fold molar excess of unlabeled RNA competitor was added to the binding mixture and rapidly mixed. Anisotropy measurements were taken in kinetic mode in intervals of 15 s, with five measurements taken at each time point. All non-linear regression fitting of anisotropic data and statistical evaluations were performed using PRISM software version 2.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Human TNFα mRNA contains an ARE in its 3′-UTR which contributes to its rapid turnover in vivo (32Raabe T. Bukrinsky M. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 974-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,33Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). It is also sufficient to destabilize a heterologous mRNA in transfected cell systems (12Xu N. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic proteins have been identified binding this element in vitro (34Hel Z. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5579-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The core sequence of the TNFα ARE is similar to others identified as high affinity AUF1-binding sites (23DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Taken together, these features make the TNFα ARE a strong candidate for high affinity interaction with AUF1. In gel mobility shift assays, binding of His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) to the TNFα ARE and U32 sequences generated two distinct complexes (Fig.1, B and C). No detectable binding was observed to the rabbit β-globin substrate (Fig. 1 D), consistent with the selectivity of AUF1 for A + U-rich RNA sequences (23DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). For both the TNFα ARE and U32 probes, the distribution of complexes with RNA was dependent on protein concentration, with the faster migrating complexes (complex I) appearing at lower concentrations of His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) (0.5–5 nm). Levels of complex I diminished as the abundance of complex II increased, consistent with the possibility of a precursor-product relationship. The diffuse smearing observed below binding complexes is likely due to RNA-protein dissociation in the gel. No additional binding events were observed in these assays, with protein concentrations tested up to 500 nm (data not shown). Previous hydrodynamic studies demonstrated that AUF1 forms dimeric structures in solution involving an N-terminal alanine-rich region (24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Monomeric AUF1 was not detected in these experiments, indicating that dimers are generated with high affinity. To determine whether AUF1 oligomerization might contribute to the formation of complexes with the TNFα ARE, RNA-protein binding reactions were treated with the chemical cross-linker DSP, permitting covalent linkage through primary amino groups. In the absence of cross-linker, His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) migrates at an apparentM r ≈ 43,000 by SDS-PAGE, larger than its predicted M r of 32,600 (data not shown). In cross-linking reactions lacking RNA, His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) was primarily detected as a dimer (Fig. 2, lane 1), consistent with the hydrodynamic studies of the full-length p37AUF1 (24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cross-links were generated specifically through the DSP linker, since they were cleaved following treatment with reducing agents (data not shown). The presence of a non-binding RNA substrate (Rβ) did not alter the distribution of cross-linked protein products (Fig. 2, lane 2). However, larger protein complexes up to and including tetramers were observed in the presence of high affinity RNA targets (U32 and TNFα ARE; Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). The generation of these larger AUF1 complexes in the presence of U32 indicated that these species were unlikely to be the result of RNA bridging, since there is a paucity of primary amino groups contained within U32 RNA. Furthermore, the lack of detectable AUF1 tetramers in the absence of a high affinity RNA target even at high concentrations of protein (5 μm) suggests that dimer-dimer association does not occur in the absence of U-rich RNA sequences. Two binding complexes of AUF1 and RNA were detected by gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 1, B and C). The slowest mobility complex (complex II) likely represents RNA associated with the AUF1 tetramer, since it represents the largest change in mobility relative to the free probe, and its abundance increases with protein concentration. Complex I is observed at lower concentrations of protein and could thus represent an AUF1 monomer, dimer, or trimer associated with RNA. However, because unbound AUF1 is dimeric (24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), interpretation of complex I as an AUF1 dimer rather than a monomer or trimer bound to RNA is the sole case in which monomeric AUF1 species are not required. Given both the absence of additional intermediate binding species observed by gel mobility shift analysis (Fig. 1) and the absence of detectable monomeric AUF1 by gel filtration and sedimentation velocity experiments (24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the contribution of monomeric AUF1 to the binding equilibrium is likely to be negligible. Given the following findings, (i) His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) association with TNFα ARE and U32 RNAs generates two RNA-protein complexes, (ii) formation of these complexes is dependent on protein concentration, (iii) AUF1 complexes as large as tetramers are associated with these RNA targets, and (iv) AUF1 dimers do not interact in the absence of U-rich RNA targets, we propose that AUF1 associates with these RNA probes by sequential dimer binding. In this model, complex I (Fig. 1) represents the AUF1 dimer-bound RNA (P2R), and complex II represents an RNA-associated AUF1 tetramer (P4R). Whereas the re-iterative nature of AREs suggests that AUF1 oligomers may be the result of multiple binding sites on the RNA target, RNA-dependent tetramer cross-linking indicates that adjacent dimers are held in close proximity in the P4R complex, making interaction between these subunits likely. Furthermore, AUF1·ARE binding equilibria evaluated by remaining free probe concentration (Fig. 1, see also Refs.23DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) are not resolved by Scatchard analysis, suggesting that binding events involving multiple AUF1 dimers are not independent (data not shown). However, the model does not exclude the possibility that the initial dimer binding event may occur at one of several sites on a given RNA target. For this reason, the AUF1 dimer-RNA equilibrium may reflect an average of multiple simultaneous P2R variants. The generation of tetrameric His6-p37AUF1-(1–257) structures on U-rich RNA targets indicates that protein-protein interactions may be generated between AUF1 dimers in an RNA-dependent manner. Whereas previous studies demonstrated that formation of AUF1 dimers in the absence of RNA required sequences near the N terminus, sequences C-terminal to the RRMs were dispensable for dimer assembly (24DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27635-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the contribution of C-terminal sequences to tetramer formation in the presence of an RNA target, gel mobility shift assays were also performed using the truncation mutant His6-p37AUF1-(1–229), which lacks all sequences C-terminal of the RRMs. Association of His6-p37AUF1-(1–229) with the TNFα ARE generated primarily a single complex consistent with P2R (Fig. 3 A, complex I), whereas a complex consistent with P4R (complex II) was detected only weakly at higher concentrations of protein. Similar binding products were observed with the U32 probe, and no binding activity was observed to Rβ, indicating that RNA-binding specificity was not compromised by deletion of the C-terminal sequences of AUF1 (data not shown). Although association with TNFα ARE was observed at very low concentrations of His6-p37AUF1-(1–229) (0.5 nm), complete probe association was not detected (Fig. 3 A), even at protein concentrations up to 2 μm (data not shown). This suggests that maintenance of His6-p37AUF1-(1–229)-RNA complexes may be hindered by gel fractionation, possibly involving rapid dissociation in the sample wells or during electrophoresis. Covalent cross-linking of His6-p37AUF1-(1–229) with DSP confirmed that this protein forms dimers in the absence of RNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). A small amount of trimeric AUF1 was also detected but is likely the product of partial oxidation or aggregation in the protein preparation. Inclusion of the Rβ RNA oligonucleotide in the cross-linking reaction did not alter the distribution of covalently linked products (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). Similarly, only minimal changes in the recovery of trimeric AUF1 were observed by addition of the TNFα ARE (Fig.3 B, lane 4), and tetrameric species were not detected. However, binding reactions containing U32displayed both trimeric and tetrameric cross-linked species (Fig.3 B, lane 3). Taken together, these data indicate that the ability of AUF1 to form RNA-dependent tetramers is compromised but not completely abrogated by removal of sequences between amino acid residues 229 and 257. In particular, tetramer formation with His6-p37AUF1-(1–229) was observed only with the uridylate homopolymer, where the possibility of multiple identical binding sites exists on the RNA. This suggests that a bona fide ARE, like that in TNFα mRNA, presents a hierarchy of AUF1-binding sites consistent with a sequential binding model, in which AUF1 sequences between 229 and 257 contribute to secondary binding events. In order to evaluate the validity of the sequential dimer-binding model for AUF1 oligomerization on an ARE, it was necessary to first express the equilibrium relationships between each component mathematically. Subsequently, fluorescence-based solution binding experiments performed under equilibrium conditions were employed to test the accuracy of these equations in describing the sequential association of AUF1 dimers with a high affinity RNA target. The steady state concentrations of P2R and P4R may be described in terms of the concentrations of RNA [R] and dimeric protein [P2] by Equations 1 and 2. [P2R]=K1[R][P2]Equation 1 [P4R]=K1K2[R][P2]2Equation 2 By titrating excess protein [P2]totagainst a constant concentration of RNA substrate where [R]tot ≪ 1/K 1, [P2]free remains in vast excess over [P2R] and [P4R]. Accordingly, [P2]free is well approximated by [P2]tot and is henceforth referred to simply as [P2]. By using fluorescein-labeled RNAs, RNA-protein complexes are distinguishable in solution based on differences in the intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy exhibited by each species resulting from changes in molecular volume under conditions of constant temperature and viscosity (36Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 373: 254-256Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 37Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). An initial experiment was performed to determine whether the quantum yield of the fluorescein-labeled RNA changed as a result of AUF1 binding. By using Fl-TNFα ARE and a titration of His6-p37AUF1-(1–229), no significant change in fluorescence intensity was observed with protein concentrations up to 250 nmHis6-p37AUF1-(1–229) dimer (Fig.4 A), demonstrating that AUF1 binding did not alter the quantum yield of the fluorescein-labeled RNA. Accordingly, the measured anisotropy A t of the fluorescent RNA probe may be interpreted using Equation 3. At=∑iAifiEquation 3 where A i represents the intrinsic anisotropy of each fluorescing species (in this case R, P2R, or P4R), and f i its fractional concentration (38Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J.

https://openalex.org/W1981023326,"Sympathetic nerve excitation stimulates β-adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes by release of noradrenaline, leading to an increase in the contractility. This cardiostimulant effect is mediated by an increase in Ca2+ permeability resulted from cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of voltage-gated ion channels (Figure 1). Opening of phosphorylated L-type Ca2+ channels and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels results in a transient intracellular Ca2+ concentration increase ([Ca2+]i transient) which is greater than without sympathetic stimulation. The increased [Ca2+]i is further amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels, leading to strengthened contraction. In CICR in the heart, both cyclic ADP-ribose (cADP-ribose) and Ca2+ cooperatively activate type-II ryanodine receptors to release Ca2+. However, no information on the concentration of cADP-ribose after β-adrenoceptor stimulation has yet been reported (Figure 2)."

Gorboulev V. Arndt P. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It was first cloned from human placenta and was shown to transport organic cations (2Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this transporter was also shown to mediate the Na+-dependent uptake of carnitine (3Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transport of carnitine via OCTN2 is a Na+-coupled process whereas the transport of organic cations via OCTN2 is Na+-independent. To our knowledge, this is a unique finding among the Na+-coupled organic solute transporters cloned thus far. No other transporter has been shown to transport some substrates in a Na+-dependent manner and other substrates in a Na+-independent manner. Even within the family of the organic cation transporters to which OCTN2 belongs, no other member of the family exhibits this intriguing characteristic. Carnitine plays an obligatory role in fatty acid oxidation (5Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and Na+-coupled transport of carnitine via OCTN2 is essential for the maintenance of high concentrations of carnitine inside the cells (6Kerner J. Hoppel C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). OCTN2 is widely expressed in human tissues including the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, intestine, and placenta (2Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The finding that OCTN2 also mediates the cellular uptake of organic cations indicates that the transporter may have hitherto unrecognized functions of significant pharmacological relevance. Genetic defects in OCTN2 are the cause of primary carnitine deficiency (12Wang Y. Ye J. Ganapathy V. Longo N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The clinical symptoms of this disease include cardiomyopathy, progressive muscle weakness, non-ketotic hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. The severity of the clinical outcome of defects in OCTN2 is further supported by a mouse model, known as the juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs) mouse, that is defective in OCTN2 and develops microvesicular fatty infiltration of the viscera and marked cardiomyopathy (16Lu K. Nishimori H. Nakamura Y. Shima K. Kuwajima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Koizumi T. Nikaido H. Hayakawa J. Nonomura A. Yoneda T.

Most of the mutations in OCTN2 identified in humans with primary carnitine deficiency result in truncated proteins and loss of carnitine transport function (12Wang Y. Ye J. Ganapathy V. Longo N.

Seth P. Yuen P. Fok T. Hjelm N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mutation in jvs mouse has recently been reported (16Lu K. Nishimori H. Nakamura Y. Shima K. Kuwajima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and it is also a missense mutation (L352R). Both of these mutations are associated with the loss of carnitine transport function (4Wu X. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Seth P. Rajan D.P. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tang N. Ganapathy V. Wu X. Hui J. Seth P. Yuen P. Fok T. Hjelm N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which explains the clinical consequences of these mutations. The present investigation was undertaken to investigate the influence of these two missense mutations on the organic cation transport function. These studies have led to a very interesting observation that these mutations have differential effects on the carnitine transport function versus the organic cation transport function. Whereas the L352R mutation causes a complete loss of both transport functions, the P478L mutation interferes only with the carnitine transport function. These interesting observations formed the basis for additional studies with cross-species chimeric OCTN2 transporters and several new OCTN2 mutants. These studies demonstrate that the organic cation transport site and the carnitine transport site overlap but are not identical. l-[3H]Carnitine (specific radioactivity, 65 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA), and [ethyl-1-14C]tetraethylammonium (TEA) bromide (specific radioactivity, 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Cell culture media and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the human OCTN2 and rat OCTN2 mutants according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the details of the procedure have been described previously (4Wu X. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Seth P. Rajan D.P. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar). The entire coding region of the mutant cDNAs was sequenced using an automated Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer to confirm the presence of the introduced mutations and the absence of any unwanted mutations arising from polymerase chain reactions. A total of 13 mutants were generated: M352R and P478L of human OCTN2, L352R and P478L of rat OCTN2, and nine tyrosine mutants of rat OCTN2 (Y211F, Y239F, Y251F, Y358F, Y426F, Y479F, Y482F, Y486F, and Y492F). Cross-species chimeras were constructed between human OCTN2 and rat OCTN2 by swapping specific restriction fragments between the two cDNAs. This was made possible because of the presence of several homologous regions at the nucleotide level in the coding region between human OCTN2 and rat OCTN2. A total of six chimeras were constructed. Chimeras 1 and 2 were constructed with the splice junction at the amino acid position 449/450 by using the BsrGI restriction site. Chimeras 3 and 4 were constructed with the splice junction at the amino acid position 239/240 by using the NsiI restriction site. Chimeras 5 and 6 were constructed with the splice junction at the amino acid position 122/123 by using the AatII restriction site. The splice junctions of all of the chimeras were in-frame and did not alter the reading frame. Each of the chimeras was sequenced at the splice site for confirmation of the switching of the cross-species restriction fragments. The wild type, mutant, or chimeric OCTN2 cDNAs were oriented in the pSPORT vector in such a way that their sense transcription was under the control of the T7 promoter. The cDNAs were heterologously expressed in HeLa cells by using the vaccinia virus expression technique as described previously (2Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4Wu X. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Seth P. Rajan D.P. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar). Transport measurements were made 12 h after transfection. Transport of [14C]TEA or [3H]carnitine was measured at room temperature with a 30-min incubation. The composition of the transport buffer was 140 mm NaCl (Na+-containing buffer) or 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (Na+-free buffer), 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. The Na+-containing medium was buffered with 25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5. The Na+-free medium was buffered with either 25 mmHepes/Tris, pH 7.5 or 25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 8.5. The transport medium containing varying concentrations of Na+was prepared by appropriately mixing the Na+-containing buffer and the Na+-free buffer. Transport was terminated by aspiration of the medium followed by two quick washes with 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. The cells were then solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH and transferred to vials for quantitation of radioactivity associated with the cells. HeLa cells transfected with vector alone under similar conditions served as control. The L352R mutation was identified in the jvs mouse, an animal model for primary carnitine deficiency (16Lu K. Nishimori H. Nakamura Y. Shima K. Kuwajima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A comparison of amino acid sequences of wild type OCTN2s shows that the amino acid at position 352 is leucine in rat OCTN2 as it is in mouse OCTN2, but the corresponding amino acid in human OCTN2 is methionine. The P478L mutation was identified in a patient with primary carnitine deficiency (13Tang N. Ganapathy V. Wu X. Hui J. Seth P. Yuen P. Fok T. Hjelm N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The proline residue at position 478 is conserved in wild type OCTN2s of all three species (mouse, rat, and human). To assess the influence of these mutations on transport function, we introduced these mutations in rat and human OCTN2s by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the mutants (M352R of human OCTN2, L352R of rat OCTN2, and P478L of rat and human OCTN2s) and the corresponding wild type OCTN2s in HeLa cells (Fig.1). The carnitine transport function was assessed by measuring the transport of 20 nm carnitine at pH 7.5 in the presence of Na+, and the organic cation transport function was assessed by measuring the transport of 20 μm TEA at pH 8.5 in the absence of Na+. These experimental conditions were chosen for optimal transport of the two substrates. The M352R mutation in human OCTN2 and the L352R mutation in rat OCTN2 completely abolished the transport of carnitine. Similarly, the P478L mutation in rat and human OCTN2s also abolished the carnitine transport function by >95%. However, the influence of these mutations on the organic cation transport function was different. The M352R mutation in human OCTN2 and the L352R mutation in rat OCTN2 caused a loss of >90% of TEA transport whereas the P478L mutation did not interfere with TEA transport. In fact, TEA transport was significantly higher in the case of the mutant OCTN2 than the wild type OCTN2. The increase in TEA transport as a consequence of the P478L mutation was 3.7-fold for human OCTN2 and 1.3-fold for rat OCTN2. Because the two mutations showed differential influence on the carnitine transport function and the organic cation transport function, we investigated the mutual interaction between carnitine and TEA during transport via OCTN2 (Fig. 2). In the case of rat OCTN2, carnitine transport was saturable with aKt of 22 ± 1 μm andV max of 1.57 ± 0.06 nmol/106cells/30 min. The presence of TEA (0.12 mm) increased theKt value almost 2-fold to 38 ± 2 μm without affecting the V max(1.52 ± 0.06 nmol/106 cells/30 min). In the case of human OCTN2, carnitine transport was saturable with aKt of 5.0 ± 0.3 μm andV max of 1.20 ± 0.03 nmol/106cells/30 min. The presence of TEA (4 mm) increased theKt value 3-fold to 17 ± 1 μmwithout affecting the V max markedly (0.79 ± 0.02 nmol/106 cells/30 min). These kinetic analyses show that the transport of carnitine is competitively inhibited by TEA, suggesting that carnitine and TEA compete for a common binding site in rat and human OCTN2s. Because carnitine transport via OCTN2 is Na+-dependent whereas TEA transport via OCTN2 is Na+-independent, a possible explanation for the differential effect of the P478L mutation on the transport of these two substrates is that the mutation lies in the Na+-binding site and hence interferes with carnitine transport without affecting TEA transport. To test this possibility, we analyzed the Na+ activation kinetics of carnitine transport for wild type rat OCTN2 and the P478L mutant of rat OCTN2. Even though the rat mutant possessed only about 3% of carnitine transport activity of the wild type transporter, this residual activity could be used for Na+ activation kinetics. The results of these experiments showed that the Na+ activation kinetics were similar for the wild type and mutant rat OCTN2s (Fig.3). The activation curves were hyperbolic in both cases with a Hill coefficient of 1. The values forK 0.5 (i.e. the concentration of Na+ needed for half-maximal activation) were 8.5 ± 1.4 mm for wild type OCTN2 and 7.6 ± 0.6 mm for the P478L mutant. Thus, the Na+activation kinetics of carnitine transport were similar for the wild type and P478L mutant OCTN2 even though the carnitine transport activity was affected markedly by the mutation. Tyrosyl residues are believed to be potential sites for Na+ binding in Na+-coupled solute transporters based on studies with tyrosyl group-modifying agents (18Wright E.M. Peerce B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14993-14996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Peerce B.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6026-6031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kulanthaivel P.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar). A scanning of rat OCTN2 for tyrosyl residues in or near the putative transmembrane domains identified nine tyrosyl residues. To determine whether any of these tyrosyl residues represents the Na+-binding site, we mutated each of these nine tyrosyl residues and assessed the influence of these mutations on carnitine transport and TEA transport. It was expected that mutation of a potential Na+-binding site would interfere with carnitine transport without affecting TEA transport. These experiments identified two tyrosine mutations, Y358F and Y486F, that abolished the carnitine transport function as well as the TEA transport function (TableI). One mutant, Y211F, exhibited the characteristics expected of a mutation in the Na+-binding site. This mutation caused a 90% loss of carnitine transport but did not interfere with TEA transport. The remaining tyrosine mutations did not affect OCTN2 function. We then analyzed the Na+activation kinetics of the residual carnitine transport of the Y211F mutant. Contrary to our expectations, the Na+ activation kinetics of the mutant were similar to that of wild type OCTN2 even though the carnitine transport activity was reduced markedly by the mutation (Fig. 3). The K 0.5 for Na+activation was 8.9 ± 0.4 mm. Thus, the P478L mutant and the Y211F mutant exhibited similar features. Both mutations affected only carnitine transport without interfering with TEA transport and Na+ activation kinetics. The Y358F and Y486F mutants, on the other hand, were similar to the M352R/L352R mutant in that these mutations abolished both carnitine transport and TEA transport. These studies also show that tyrosyl residues are not likely to constitute the Na+-binding site in OCTN2.Table IInfluence of tyrosine mutations in rat OCTN2 on TEA transport and carnitine transportcDNATEA transportCarnitine transport pmol/10 6 cells/30 minWild type189.2 ± 2.91.63 ± 0.10Y211F216.3 ± 41.10.16 ± 0.00Y239F169.9 ± 5.71.33 ± 0.23Y251F217.7 ± 10.91.16 ± 0.00Y358F3.0 ± 0.50Y426F150.6 ± 13.11.13 ± 0.01Y479F103.2 ± 16.51.72 ± 0.39Y482F204.0 ± 4.01.14 ± 0.01Y486F22.6 ± 0.20.01 ± 0.00Y492F135.0 ± 6.70.61 ± 0.08HeLa cells were transfected with wild type and mutant rat OCTN2 cDNAs, and the vaccinia virus expression technique was used to functionally express the transfected cDNAs. Transport of TEA (20 μm) was measured at pH 8.5 in the absence of Na+. Transport of carnitine (20 nm) was measured at pH 7.5 in the presence of Na+. Transport measured in cells transfected with vector alone was subtracted from transport in cDNA-transfected cells to determine cDNA-specific transport. Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were transfected with wild type and mutant rat OCTN2 cDNAs, and the vaccinia virus expression technique was used to functionally express the transfected cDNAs. Transport of TEA (20 μm) was measured at pH 8.5 in the absence of Na+. Transport of carnitine (20 nm) was measured at pH 7.5 in the presence of Na+. Transport measured in cells transfected with vector alone was subtracted from transport in cDNA-transfected cells to determine cDNA-specific transport. The findings that the P478L mutation and the Y211F mutation are not located in the Na+-binding site but still abolish carnitine transport without affecting TEA transport suggest that the carnitine transport site and the TEA transport site may not be identical. However, they may overlap with each other to some extent, providing the basis for the observed competitive interaction between the two substrates. The P478L and Y211F mutations may be located at a site involved only in carnitine transport but not in TEA transport. In contrast, the mutations that abolish carnitine transport as well as TEA transport may be located at a site involved in the transport of both substrates. To investigate whether there is spatial separation of the sites involved in the transport of carnitine versus TEA, we constructed cross-species OCTN2 chimeras between human OCTN2 and rat OCTN2 and studied their transport function. Human OCTN2 possesses severalfold greater ability to transport carnitine than to transport TEA whereas the ability of rat OCTN2 to transport these two substrates is comparable. As shown in Fig. 4, there was a 51-fold increase in carnitine transport in HeLa cells transfected with human OCTN2 cDNA compared with carnitine transport in vector-transfected HeLa cells. The corresponding increase in TEA transport was 3-fold. In the case of rat OCTN2, carnitine transport as well as TEA transport increased 13-fold. We used these differential characteristics of rat and human OCTN2s as diagnostic criteria to analyze the transport functions of the rat/human chimeric OCTN2s and identify the domains involved in TEA transport and carnitine transport. Three sets of complementary chimeras were constructed for this purpose with splice junctions at amino acid positions 449/450, 239/240, and 122/123. The first splice site lies in the fifth extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 9 and 10, the second splice site in the 5th transmembrane domain, and the third splice site in the first extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (Fig.5). The transport characteristics of these six chimeras are given in Fig. 4. Chimera 1 behaved like human OCTN2, and chimera 2 behaved like rat OCTN2 in carnitine transport function as well as in TEA transport function. This suggests that switching the C-terminal domains (108 amino acids) between the two OCTN2s did not alter the transport function. This domain contains the site of the P478L mutation. Because this mutation affected only the transport of carnitine, this domain is likely to be involved exclusively in carnitine transport. In addition, the function of this domain in facilitating carnitine transport is apparently identical in human OCTN2 and rat OCTN2 because swapping of this domain between the two transporters did not influence their transport characteristics. The findings that the P478L mutation stimulates TEA transport suggest that the mutation might cause conformational changes in the protein in such a way as to facilitate TEA transport.Figure 5Location of the splice junctions in chimeric OCTN2s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chimeras 3 and 4 are very interesting. Chimera 3 functions as human OCTN2 in terms of carnitine transport and as rat OCTN2 in terms of TEA transport. Chimera 4 functions as rat OCTN2 in terms of carnitine transport and as human OCTN2 in terms of TEA transport. These data provide the first indication that the sites responsible for carnitine transport and TEA transport are spatially separated. The region downstream to the 239/240 splice junction appears to be involved in TEA transport, and the region upstream to the splice junction appears to be involved in carnitine transport. Chimeras 5 and 6 provide additional evidence for the spatial separation of the transport sites for carnitine and TEA. Chimera 5 functions as rat OCTN2 in terms of carnitine transport and as human OCTN2 in terms of TEA transport. The converse is true with chimera 6. These data show that the region downstream to the 122/123 splice junction is involved in carnitine transport, and the region upstream to the splice junction is involved in TEA transport. Taken together, the results with the chimeric transporters indicate that the TEA transport site consists of the region containing the first 122 amino acids and the region containing the amino acids 240–449. The carnitine transport site consists of the region containing the amino acids 123–239 and the region containing the C-terminal 108 amino acids. To our knowledge, this is the first example of significant spatial separation of the transport sites for different substrates in an organic solute transporter. This also constitutes the first report of mutations in a transporter that have differential influence on the handling of different substrates. Furthermore, the present findings are of significant clinical relevance because these mutations have been identified in humans with primary carnitine deficiency. Patients with such mutations exhibit impairment in OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport function but are unlikely to have any impairment in OCTN2-mediated organic cation transport function. Similarly, there may be mutations in OCTN2 in humans that abolish the organic cation transport function but leave the carnitine transport function unaffected. Such individuals are not expected to have primary carnitine deficiency but may experience defective handling of organic cations in various tissues.

Pretreatment of Jurkat T-cells with the 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, markedly reduced (IC50 ≈1–2 μm) α4β1-dependent adhesion to fibronectin (FN) stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) which modulates post-receptor events. In contrast, lovastatin did not inhibit Jurkat cell adhesion to FN induced by the β1integrin-activating monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8A2, which directly modulates β1 integrin affinity. Similarly, pretreatment of U937 cells with lovastatin inhibited PMA-stimulated, but not mAb 8A2-stimulated, α6β1-dependent leukocyte adhesion to laminin. The inhibition of lovastatin on PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion was not mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. The inhibitory effect of lovastatin on PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion was reversed by co-incubation with geranylgeraniol, but not with farnesol, with concurrent reversal of the inhibition of protein prenylation as shown by protein RhoA geranylgeranylation.

The adhesive capacity of leukocyte integrins is highly regulated. Integrin receptors in low adhesive state do not mediate strong adhesion to other cells or ligands. However, when leukocytes are appropriately activated there is often a detectable increase in integrin adhesiveness within a few seconds to minutes. Some activation stimuli induce a measurable change in integrin receptor affinity, whereas others mediate their effects by post-receptor events such as cytoskeleton-dependent clustering of receptors that serve to increase overall avidity (1Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For example, the functional activity of β1 integrins on human T-cells can be regulated by treatment with certain divalent cations or activating monoclonal antibody (mAbs)1that directly increase the affinity of β1 integrins for their ligands, presumably by altering receptor conformation (3Faull R.J. Kovach N.J. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast, the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), generally promotes adhesion by targeting events that occur following receptor occupancy without significantly affecting the affinity of the receptor for the ligand (3Faull R.J. Kovach N.J. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For a given leukocyte cell type, different activation stimuli may modulate integrin adhesivity by one or the other mechanism.Although a number of cytoplasmic protein regulators of integrin adhesiveness have been identified and characterized (5Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of adhesiveness are still not fully elucidated. Several studies, however, have implicated the involvement of Ras family proteins. By using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with β1 integrins, Hugheset al. (6Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Kinsberg M.H. Cell. 1977; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Ha-Ras suppressed increases in integrin affinity and that suppression by Ha-Ras correlated with activation of the MAP kinase pathway. These results suggested that the Ha-Ras-linked MAP kinase pathway mediated a negative feedback loop for integrin affinity modulation. Zhang et al.(7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) showed that R-Ras promoted the ligand-binding activity of β1 integrins in CHO cells. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA has also been shown to be required for stimulated integrin adhesiveness in some leukocytes (8Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). More recently, D'Souza-Schoreyet al. (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 16: 3936-3946Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that the Rho subfamily protein, Rac, regulated integrin-mediated spreading and increased adhesion of T-lymphocytes.Ras-related small G-proteins, which regulate cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, are modified by farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups. This isoprenylation is required for their translocation to the plasma membrane and function (11Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Nature. 1989; 341: 384-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Khosravi-Far R. Clark G.J. Abe K. Cox A.D. McLain T. Lutz R.J. Sinensky M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24363-24368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two post-translational modifications are catalyzed by the enzymes farnesyltransferase (FTase) and type I geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase I) which recognize proteins that end with the motif CaaX at their carboxyl termini (C is cysteine, a is aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). FTase prefers proteins that end with X as serine or methionine, whereas GGTase I prefers X as leucine or isoleucine. Ha-Ras, having the carboxyl-terminal CVLS (the aliphatic amino acids (aa) are valine and leucine, X is serine), is selectively farnesylated, whereas Rho and Rac family GTPases have leucine at a carboxyl-terminal X position and are geranylgeranylated (13Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,14Hori Y. Kikuchi A. Isomura M. Katayama M. Miura Y. Fujioka H. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). K-Ras in which X is methionine is naturally farnesylated but becomes geranylgeranylated when FTase is inhibited (15Lerner E.C. Zhang T.T. Knowles D.B. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The prenylation status of R-Ras is unclear, but its carboxyl-terminal sequence, CVLL, suggests that it would be geranylgeranylated. This is also supported by the fact that FTase inhibitors do not inhibit R-Ras-induced transformation (17Carboni J.M. Yan N. Cox A.D. Bustelo X. Graham S.M. Lynch M.J. Weinmann R. Seizinger B.R. Der C.J. Barbacid M. Manne V. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1905-1913PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we have investigated the role of protein prenylation in integrin-dependent Jurkat and U937 leukocyte adhesion by utilizing lovastatin and prenyltransferase inhibitors. Lovastatin and related drugs in this class are inhibitors of 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an early and rate-limiting enzyme in the sterol synthesis pathway (18Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Albert-Schonberg S.G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). In addition to lowering cholesterol, lovastatin reduces the level of isoprenoids including geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by depleting cellular pools of the precursors. FPP is a substrate for protein farnesyltransferase and GGPP is a substrate for protein geranylgeranyltransferase.Notably, recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that a statin decreased CD11b expression and reduced CD11b-dependent adhesion of monocytes to endothelium (19Weber C. Erl W. Weber K.S. Weber P.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1997; 30: 1212-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), decreased ICAM-1 and LFA-1 expression in monocytes (20Niwa S. Totsuka T. Hayashi S. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1996; 18: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and reduced leukocyte-endothelium interactions in vivo (21Kimura M. Kurose I. Russell J. Granger D.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 17: 1521-1526Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We found that lovastatin inhibited PMA-stimulated adhesion, a post-receptor event, but not adhesion induced by an activating mAb that directly modulates β1 integrin affinity. Inhibition of PMA-stimulated cell adhesion by lovastatin was reversed by co-incubation with geranylgeraniol but not farnesol and correlated with inhibition of geranylgeranylation of proteins, such as RhoA. Moreover, the protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I inhibitor, GGTI-298 (22Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar), but not farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-277 (22Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion. These results demonstrate that a geranylgeranylated protein(s) is required for PMA-stimulated, integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion and suggest potential new targets for small molecule inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion.DISCUSSIONIntegrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion is modulated by alterations in receptor affinity or by post-receptor events (1Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Faull R.J. Kovach N.J. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of Jurkat T-cells with lovastatin markedly reduced α4β1-dependent adhesion to FN stimulated by PMA, which modulates post-receptor events. In contrast, lovastatin did not inhibit Jurkat cell adhesion to FN induced by the β1 integrin-activating mAb 8A2, which directly modulates β1 integrin affinity. Similarly, pretreatment of U937 cells with lovastatin inhibited PMA-, but not mAb 8A2-, stimulated α6β1-dependent leukocyte adhesion to LN. Flow cytometry analysis showed that treatment with lovastatin did not alter the integrin expression on U937 or Jurkat cell surface (not shown), indicating that the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on cell adhesion was not due to a reduction of receptor number. Thus, lovastatin inhibited PMA-stimulated adhesion of two different β1 integrin receptors, in two different leukocyte cell lines, by targeting signaling pathways regulating post-receptor events, but not by inhibiting the integrin expression on the cell surface.Recently, several proteins involved in signal transduction have been shown to be lipid-modified by covalent attachment of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups, which are derived from mevalonic acid (31Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Lovastatin inhibits the biosynthesis of both of these isoprenoids. Thus, one possible mechanism by which lovastatin inhibits leukocyte adhesion is interference with a signaling pathway(s) that requires an isoprenylated protein(s). The fact that all-trans-GGOH, but not FOH, prevented lovastatin-induced inhibition of leukocyte adhesion suggested that a protein(s) modified by a geranylgeranyl-group, not a farnesyl-group, was required for PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion. However, since lovastatin targets an early step in the sterol synthesis pathway, lovastatin might also inhibit the biosynthesis of other lipid moieties, which are required for leukocyte adhesion (Fig.8). Although the rescue by GGOH and the inhibition of RhoA geranylgeranylation strongly suggested that a geranylgeranylated protein(s) regulated leukocyte adhesion, it remained possible that GGOH itself or a derivative lipid, like vitamin Q (also called ubiquinone) which can be converted from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, regulates cell adhesion (Fig. 8). Also, integrin-modulating factor-1, possibly an isoprenyl lipid, has been reported to regulate integrin function (32Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Van-Strijp J.A. Swiggard W.J. Wright S.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 341-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GGTI-298 inhibits protein geranylgeranylation without changing cellular lipid content by targeting protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I. Thus, the inhibitory effect of GGTI-298 demonstrated a geranylgeranylated protein(s) indeed regulates post-receptor events in PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 8). Whether this geranylgeranylated protein(s) regulates kinases (e.g. RhoA kinase), the synthesis of integrin-modulating lipids, or other signaling pathways remains to be determined. The fact that the specific FTase inhibitor, FTI-277, did not inhibit leukocyte adhesion confirmed the rescue experiments showing that farnesylated proteins are not involved (Fig. 8).Ras family proteins require prenylation for function, and several have been implicated in the regulation of integrin function. Ha-Ras was shown to suppress integrin affinity in CHO cells through activation of the MAPK pathway (6Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Kinsberg M.H. Cell. 1977; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that lovastatin and GGTI-298 inhibit PMA-stimulated adhesion, which involves post-receptor events rather than affinity modulation (1Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Faull R.J. Kovach N.J. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ha-Ras requires farnesylation for function (33D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas PMA-stimulated adhesion requires a geranylgeranylated protein(s). Furthermore, inhibition of the MAPK pathway did not affect PMA-stimulated adhesion. Ha-Ras is therefore not involved in our model system.In contrast to Ha-Ras, R-Ras, was shown to promote integrin-dependent adhesion in CHO cells (7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, the effect of R-Ras again involved increases in receptor affinity rather than post-receptor events. Also, R-Ras may signal through PI-3 kinase (34Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY 294002 had no effect on PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion. Thus, although it is probably geranylgeranylated, R-Ras is not likely involved in PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion.Rho subfamily proteins are geranylgeranylated, and two members, Rac and RhoA, have been reported to be involved in β1integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion (8Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J.

An activated mutant of Rac triggered adhesion and spreading of a T-lymphocyte line to FN, but, importantly, a dominant-negative Rac did not block PMA-stimulated spreading on FN (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 16: 3936-3946Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RhoA by C3 transferase exoenzyme inhibited PMA-stimulated β2integrin-dependent human neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen and α4β1-dependent murine lymphocyte cell line adhesion to VCAM-1 (8Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, C3 transferase exoenzyme did not inhibit PMA-stimulated β2integrin-dependent lymphocyte adhesion to ICAM-1 (35Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4208-4216PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, C3 transferase exoenzyme treatment increased PMA-stimulated β1 integrin-dependent monocyte and U937 cell spreading on FN (36Aepfelbacher M. Essler M. Huber E. Czech A. Weber P.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5070-5075PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of RhoA in PMA-stimulated leukocyte adherence is uncertain. Although our studies show that reduced isoprenylation of RhoA correlated with the inhibition of PMA-stimulated adhesion by lovastatin, we cannot conclude that RhoA is the critical geranylgeranylated protein regulating post-receptor events.It is interesting that lovastatin inhibited PMA-induced adhesion without blocking the MAPK cascade signaling pathway. PMA activates PKC which is generally considered to lie upstream of Ras (33D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J.

Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since Ras lies upstream of the MAPK cascade (34Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 39Font-de M.J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1997; 186: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), activation of Ras will stimulate and blockade of Ras will inhibit the MAPK cascade. Ras has to be isoprenylated in order to function (28McGuire T.F. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our study shows that at concentrations of lovastatin at which protein isoprenylation and cell adhesion were inhibited, activation of the MAPK cascade was not inhibited. A likely explanation is that PKC in fact functions downstream of Ras by activating Raf-1 kinase as previously reported (23Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tapper T.I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 41Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, although Ras function was likely blocked by lovastatin, PKC still activated the MAPK cascade via Raf-1. Since lovastatin inhibited PMA-stimulated cell adhesion, but not MAPKK activation, we surmise that in Jurkat cells the PMA-stimulated signaling pathway regulating β1integrin-dependent adhesion does not involve the MAPK cascade. This conclusion is supported by studies showing that the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 (10 μm) potently inhibited PMA-stimulated MAPKK activity but did not inhibit PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion.In conclusion, lovastatin blocked PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion, and GGOH but not FOH reversed this inhibitory effect. The GGTase-specific inhibitor, GGTI-298, but not FTase-specific inhibitor, FTI-277, also blocked PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion. Together, these results demonstrate that a geranylgeranylated protein(s) regulates post-receptor events in integrin-dependent PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion as shown in Fig. 8. The essential role of leukocyte integrin receptors in cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion in the inflammatory and immune systems is well established. The adhesive capacity of leukocyte integrins is highly regulated. Integrin receptors in low adhesive state do not mediate strong adhesion to other cells or ligands. However, when leukocytes are appropriately activated there is often a detectable increase in integrin adhesiveness within a few seconds to minutes. Some activation stimuli induce a measurable change in integrin receptor affinity, whereas others mediate their effects by post-receptor events such as cytoskeleton-dependent clustering of receptors that serve to increase overall avidity (1Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For example, the functional activity of β1 integrins on human T-cells can be regulated by treatment with certain divalent cations or activating monoclonal antibody (mAbs)1that directly increase the affinity of β1 integrins for their ligands, presumably by altering receptor conformation (3Faull R.J. Kovach N.J. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast, the protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), generally promotes adhesion by targeting events that occur following receptor occupancy without significantly affecting the affinity of the receptor for the ligand (3Faull R.J. Kovach N.J. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For a given leukocyte cell type, different activation stimuli may modulate integrin adhesivity by one or the other mechanism. Although a number of cytoplasmic protein regulators of integrin adhesiveness have been identified and characterized (5Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of adhesiveness are still not fully elucidated. Several studies, however, have implicated the involvement of Ras family proteins. By using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with β1 integrins, Hugheset al. (6Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Kinsberg M.H. Cell. 1977; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (434) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Ha-Ras suppressed increases in integrin affinity and that suppression by Ha-Ras correlated with activation of the MAP kinase pathway. These results suggested that the Ha-Ras-linked MAP kinase pathway mediated a negative feedback loop for integrin affinity modulation. Zhang et al.(7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) showed that R-Ras promoted the ligand-binding activity of β1 integrins in CHO cells. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA has also been shown to be required for stimulated integrin adhesiveness in some leukocytes (8Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 9Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). More recently, D'Souza-Schoreyet al. (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 16: 3936-3946Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that the Rho subfamily protein, Rac, regulated integrin-mediated spreading and increased adhesion of T-lymphocytes. Ras-related small G-proteins, which regulate cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, are modified by farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups. This isoprenylation is required for their translocation to the plasma membrane and function (11Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M.

These two post-translational modifications are catalyzed by the enzymes farnesyltransferase (FTase) and type I geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase I) which recognize proteins that end with the motif CaaX at their carboxyl termini (C is cysteine, a is aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). FTase prefers proteins that end with X as serine or methionine, whereas GGTase I prefers X as leucine or isoleucine. Ha-Ras, having the carboxyl-terminal CVLS (the aliphatic amino acids (aa) are valine and leucine, X is serine), is selectively farnesylated, whereas Rho and Rac family GTPases have leucine at a carboxyl-terminal X position and are geranylgeranylated (13Didsbury J.R.

The extended ternary complex model of receptor activation assumes that GPCRs exist either in an inactive “R” state or an active “R*” state (4Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T.

Similarly, it is unknown why fMLF is much more potent at activating chemotaxis than lysosomal enzyme release and superoxide radical formation (8Klinker J.F. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Gen.

Furthermore, it is not clear whether the FPR couples differentially to Giα isoforms.This latter question is intriguing in view of several findings. First, phagocytes express Giα2 at a much higher level than Giα3, and Giα1 is not expressed at all (11Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

Second, certain GPCRs, including the receptors for the chemoattractant interleukin-8, differ substantially in their coupling efficiency to various Giα isoforms (29Grünewald S. Reiländer H.

Third, data obtained with the Giα2 knock-out mouse suggest that this G protein has unique functions in signal transduction (35Rudolph U. Finegold M.J. Rich S.S. Harriman G.R. Srinivasan Y. Brabet P. Boulay G. Bradley A. Birnbaumer L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 36Hornquist C.E. Lu X. Rogers-Fani P.M. Rudolph U. Shappell S. Birnbaumer L. Harriman G.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1068-1077PubMed Google Scholar).Perhaps most importantly, Giα2 has a lower GDP affinity than Giα1 and Giα3 (37Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Carty D.J. Padrell E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6268-6273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Gsα isoforms, it has been shown that the GDP affinity of Gα has a substantial impact on the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling. Particularly, GsαL (the long splice variant of the α-subunit of the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase Gs) has a lower GDP affinity than GsαS (the short splice variant) (7Seifert R.

Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the GPCR activation energy required for releasing GDP from GsαL is lower than the corresponding activation energy needed for GDP release from GsαS. Accordingly, the β2AR catalyzes GDP release from GsαL more readily than from GsαS. Experimentally, this results in increased efficacy and potency of partial agonists and increased efficacy of inverse agonists when the β2AR is coupled to GsαL as compared with the corresponding ligand properties when coupling of the β2AR to GsαS is considered (7Seifert R.

In other words, GsαL confers to the β2AR the properties of a constitutively active GPCR. Intriguingly, when coupled to Giα2, the FPR is constitutively active as well as assessed by strong inhibitory effects of the inverse agonist CsH on the high basal GTPγS binding (25Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 277: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, all these findings raise the question of the impact of the different Giα isoforms on constitutive activity of the FPR.The aim of our present study was to quantitatively analyze FPR coupling to the three Giα isoforms. To achieve this aim, we fused the FPR to Giα1, Giα2, and Giα3 and expressed the fusion proteins in Sf9 cells. Fusion of GPCR to Gα ensures a defined 1:1 stoichiometry and efficient coupling of the signaling partners and allows for the sensitive detection of differences in the coupling of a given GPCR to different G proteins (7Seifert R.

Most intercellular signal molecules exert their effects through GPCRs1 that couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, which in turn regulate the activity of effector systems (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

The extended ternary complex model of receptor activation assumes that GPCRs exist either in an inactive “R” state or an active “R*” state (4Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T.

GPCRs can isomerize from R to R* spontaneously, and this process is referred to as constitutive activity. Receptor agonists stabilize the R* state and increase basal G protein activity, whereas inverse agonists stabilize the R state and reduce basal G protein activity (4Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S.

The FPR is expressed predominantly in phagocytic cells and plays a crucial role in host defense against bacterial infections (8Klinker J.F. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Gen.

Consequently, phagocyte functions such as chemotaxis, lysosomal enzyme release, and superoxide radical formation are activated (8Klinker J.F. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Gen.

Based on the comparison ofB max values of agonist saturation binding and ligand-regulated GTPγS binding, it was proposed that the FPR activates G proteins catalytically, i.e. one FPR activates several Gi proteins (22Gierschik P.

Specifically, it is unclear why the K d value for high affinity [3H]fMLF binding is ∼3 nm, whereas the EC50 value of fMLF at activating Gi proteins in terms of GTP hydrolysis, AA-GTP labeling, and GTPγS binding is much higher (∼0.1–1 μm) (8Klinker J.F.

Similarly, it is unknown why fMLF is much more potent at activating chemotaxis than lysosomal enzyme release and superoxide radical formation (8Klinker J.F. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 33-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Rossi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 20Dillon S.B. Verghese M.W.

Furthermore, it is not clear whether the FPR couples differentially to Giα isoforms. This latter question is intriguing in view of several findings. First, phagocytes express Giα2 at a much higher level than Giα3, and Giα1 is not expressed at all (11Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klinker J.F. Schwaner I. Offermanns S. Hagelüken A. Seifert R. Biochem.

Second, certain GPCRs, including the receptors for the chemoattractant interleukin-8, differ substantially in their coupling efficiency to various Giα isoforms (29Grünewald S. Reiländer H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15162-15173Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8200-8206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, data obtained with the Giα2 knock-out mouse suggest that this G protein has unique functions in signal transduction (35Rudolph U. Finegold M.J. Rich S.S. Harriman G.R. Srinivasan Y. Brabet P. Boulay G. Bradley A. Birnbaumer L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 36Hornquist C.E. Lu X. Rogers-Fani P.M. Rudolph U. Shappell S. Birnbaumer L. Harriman G.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1068-1077PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps most importantly, Giα2 has a lower GDP affinity than Giα1 and Giα3 (37Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Carty D.J. Padrell E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6268-6273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Gsα isoforms, it has been shown that the GDP affinity of Gα has a substantial impact on the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling. Particularly, GsαL (the long splice variant of the α-subunit of the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase Gs) has a lower GDP affinity than GsαS (the short splice variant) (7Seifert R.

Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the GPCR activation energy required for releasing GDP from GsαL is lower than the corresponding activation energy needed for GDP release from GsαS. Accordingly, the β2AR catalyzes GDP release from GsαL more readily than from GsαS. Experimentally, this results in increased efficacy and potency of partial agonists and increased efficacy of inverse agonists when the β2AR is coupled to GsαL as compared with the corresponding ligand properties when coupling of the β2AR to GsαS is considered (7Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U. Sanders-Bush E. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5109-5116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In other words, GsαL confers to the β2AR the properties of a constitutively active GPCR. Intriguingly, when coupled to Giα2, the FPR is constitutively active as well as assessed by strong inhibitory effects of the inverse agonist CsH on the high basal GTPγS binding (25Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 277: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, all these findings raise the question of the impact of the different Giα isoforms on constitutive activity of the FPR. The aim of our present study was to quantitatively analyze FPR coupling to the three Giα isoforms. To achieve this aim, we fused the FPR to Giα1, Giα2, and Giα3 and expressed the fusion proteins in Sf9 cells. Fusion of GPCR to Gα ensures a defined 1:1 stoichiometry and efficient coupling of the signaling partners and allows for the sensitive detection of differences in the coupling of a given GPCR to different G proteins (7Seifert R.

Vesicular uptake of the anionic herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was markedly stimulated by an inward sodium gradient but only in the presence of glutarate, indicating the presence of apical dicarboxylate/organic anion exchange.

Under both conditions, uptake was dramatically slowed and overshoot was abolished by probenecid. Likewise, apical accumulation of 2,4-D by intact bovine choroid plexus tissue in vitro was stimulated by external glutarate in the presence of sodium.

Apical exit is also carrier-mediated, but is not well characterized and could involve either potential or exchange driven mechanisms (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). A number of other epithelia are also capable of active organic anion transport (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Of these the choroid plexus, which comprises the blood/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)1barrier, is particularly important. It mediates the removal of organic anions from the CSF into the blood for their subsequent elimination by liver or kidney, e.g. neurotransmitter metabolites like 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (from serotonin) and homovanillic acid (from dopamine) (12Neff N.H. Tozer T.N. Brodie B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1967; 158: 214-218PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cserr H.F. Van Dyke D.H. Am. J.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for choroid plexus transport are largely unexplored, but one fundamental difference from excretory epithelia is evident: organic anions are transported into the blood, not extracted from it. Indeed, this reversal of function is reflected in other important ways, most notably in the unique apical distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase in choroid plexus, whereas it is basolateral in virtually all other epithelia (19Ernst S.A. Palacios J.R. Aas A.T. Siegel G.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Villalobos A.R. Parmelee J.T. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

However, not all transporters present in choroid plexus demonstrate this reversed polarity. We recently demonstrated that the apical organic cation transporter present in primary cultures of neonatal rat choroid plexus cells is a proton/organic cation exchanger, i.e. the same transport activity that is seen apically in kidney (20Villalobos A.R. Parmelee J.T. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. Villalobos, A. R. Walden, and J. Pritchard, unpublished observations. 2A. Villalobos, A. R. Walden, and J. Pritchard, unpublished observations.) A similar conclusion was reached by Whittico et al. (22Whittico M.T. Yuan G. Giacomini K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 615-623PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine apical membrane vesicles to study cimetidine transport. Therefore, the aims of the studies presented below were 2-fold: 1) to determine the mechanism responsible for removal of organic anions from the CSF, and 2) to establish whether the organic anion transport system was, like Na+,K+-ATPase, polarized differently in choroid plexus than in renal epithelium. For these studies, we used the anionic herbicide, 2,4-D, since it is transported by the basolateral indirect sodium-coupled mechanism of the kidney (23Villalobos A.R. Dunnick C.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 582-589PubMed Google Scholar), and it is transported more effectively by choroid plexus than the classical renal substrate, p-aminohippurate (PAH) (15Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 354-359PubMed Google Scholar). Adult, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250–400 g) were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Rats were euthanized with CO2, and lateral choroid plexi were removed immediately and transferred to ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) previously gassed with 95% oxygen, 5% CO2. aCSF composition was 118 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na3PO4, 18 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm urea, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm CaCl2, and 12 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (20Villalobos A.R. Parmelee J.T. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar). Choroid plexus tissue was obtained with the assistance of a contractor who excised lateral plexi from the brains of Holstein cows within 10 min after they were killed at a local abattoir. Tissue was placed immediately into pregassed aCSF and held on ice until delivery to the laboratory within 1 h. BBM vesicles were isolated from 6 to 8 bovine choroid plexi using a modification of the method previously described (24Whittico M.T. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. J. Pharmacol.

The homogenization buffer contained 100 mm mannitol, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-hydroxymethylaminoethane (Tris) adjusted to pH 7.4 with HEPES. After an initial centrifugation at 300 × g, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to precipitate basolateral and internal membranes, and the apical membranes (BBMV) were harvested by differential centrifugation. The final membrane fraction was suspended at 3–5 mg/ml protein in vesicle buffer (100 mm KCl, 100 mm mannitol, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4) and held in a 4 °C cold box for use the next day. As compared with the initial homogenate, the final membrane fraction was enriched 20-fold in Na+,K+-ATPase, which is an apical marker enzyme in choroid plexus. The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase was enriched only 2–3-fold. Accumulation of 2,4-D was measured in fragments of bovine (5–15 mg) or rat (0.5–1.0 mg) choroid plexus incubated in 1 ml of aCSF containing 10 μm[3H]2,4-D in the presence or absence of 20 μmglutarate and gently shaken at room temperature. Other additions to the uptake medium are described in the figure legends. Uptake was terminated by removal of the plexus. It was then rinsed in ice-cold aCSF, blotted, and weighed. Tissue was solubilized by incubation in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH for 30 min in a 150 °F oven and neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl. Tissue accumulation of [3H]2,4-D was calculated from the radioactivity/mg wet weight tissue and the medium specific activity and expressed as the tissue to medium ratio (T/M; dpm/mg wet weight/dpm/μl of medium). Accumulation of 10 μm [3H]PAH acid by rat choroid plexus tissue was measured similarly. Uptake of 3H- and14C-labeled substrates in vesicles was measured using the rapid filtration technique as described previously (25Pritchard J.B. Renfro J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2603-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The vesicles were homogenized, placed on ice, and allowed to pre-equilibrate with fresh vesicle buffer for at least 60 min before use. Uptake was initiated by diluting 10 μl of vesicles (30–50 μg of protein) with 90 μl of transport buffer. The transport buffer was similar to the vesicle buffer but also contained 10 μml-[3H]proline, [3H]2,4-D, or [14C]glutarate. When an out > in Na+gradient was required, 100 mm NaCl replaced KCl in transport buffer. Complete details of buffer composition and additions are described in the figure legends. Transport was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer, and the suspension was immediately collected under vacuum on a Millipore filter (HAWP, 45 μm pore size). Filters were then washed with 3 ml of buffer and air-dried at room temperature. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Vesicular uptake was expressed as pmol of 3H- or 14C-labeled substrate/mg of membrane protein. The vector pEGFP-C3, which expresses a cytoplasmic form of green fluorescent protein (GFP), was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The construction of the vector pEGFP-C3/rROAT1, which contains an in-frame fusion of rROAT1 (5Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) to the carboxyl terminus of GFP (rROAT1-GFP), has been described previously (26Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F864-F873PubMed Google Scholar). Individual pieces of choroid plexus tissue were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA for 1 h at 37 °C using SuperFect reagent (2 μl of SuperFect/μg of DNA; Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Transfections were done in a total volume of 360 μl of Eagle's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. The tissue was washed with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to 2 ml of fresh Eagle's modified essential medium containing serum and antibiotics in glass-bottomed confocal chambers (∼4.9 cm2), and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air for the remainder of the experiment. Choroid plexus pieces were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy approximately 24 and 48 h after transfection. Choroid plexus tissue was imaged using a Zeiss model 410 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with a 40× water immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.2). Fluorescent images were collected by illuminating samples with an Ar-Kr laser at 488 nm. A 510-nm dichroic filter was positioned in the light path, and a 515-nm long pass emission filter was positioned in front of the detector. Confocal images (512 × 512 × 8 bits) were acquired as single 8- or 16-s scans, saved to an optical or Jaz disc, and analyzed on a Power Macintosh 9600 computer using NIH Image 1.61 software. [3H]2,4-D (15 Ci/mmol) andl-[3H]proline (40 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [14C]Glutaric acid (15.6 mCi/mmol) was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). [3H]PAH was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled l-proline, 2,4-D, glutaric acid, and PAH were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were of the highest purity available. Uptake was measured in triplicate from two or three separate vesicle preparations. For tissue uptake studies, measurements were made separately in plexus tissue isolated from at least four animals. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Control and experimental means were compared by unpaired Student's ttest and were deemed to be significantly different when the probability value was <0.05. As shown in Fig.2, 10 μml-proline transport was markedly stimulated by an out > in sodium gradient, producing a substantial overshoot. Sodium-coupled proline uptake was reduced by the addition of unlabeled substrate (0.5 mm). Similar results were obtained for glucose transport, which could be abolished by phloridzin (not shown). Thus, our preparation was functionally active and, consistent with marker enzyme enrichment (see “Experimental Procedures”), behaved as apical membranes. Apical membrane vesicles from bovine choroid plexus also transported the dicarboxylic acid, glutarate (10 μm), very effectively in the presence of a sodium gradient (out > in), yielding a 4- to 5-fold overshoot (Fig. 3). As previously shown for renal basolateral membrane vesicle transport of dicarboxylates (27Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1984; 401: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), Na+/glutarate cotransport was markedly inhibited by both 5 mm lithium and 1 mmmethylsuccinate. BBMV uptake of the organic anion 2,4-D (10 μm) in the presence of an out > in sodium gradient alone, uptake quickly rose to equilibrium values (Fig. 4). The addition of 20 μm glutarate to the external medium markedly stimulated initial uptake and produced a 3- to 4-fold overshoot. Probenecid (500 μm) completely abolished Na+/glutarate stimulation. Uptake reached essentially identical equilibrium values under all conditions. Transport in the presence of glutarate was reduced to unstimulated levels by probenecid, bromcresol green, and chlorophenol red (Fig.5), each a potent inhibitor of the renal dicarboxylate/organic anion exchanger (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled PAH also inhibited, but was substantially less effective, again consistent with both renal (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar) and choroid plexus results (15Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 354-359PubMed Google Scholar). Methylsuccinate, an inhibitor of renal Na+/glutarate cotransport (28Ullrich K.J. Fasold H. Rumrich G. Kloss S. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1984; 400: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) also blocked glutarate stimulation, whereas tetraethylammonium, an organic cation, did not inhibit significantly.Figure 5Specificity of 2,4-D uptake into bovine plexus BBM vesicles. Vesicles were diluted 10-fold with transport buffer containing 10 μm [3H]2,4-D and either 100 mm NaCl (Control), 100 mm NaCl plus 20 μm glutarate (Glutarate), or 100 mm NaCl plus 20 μm glutarate and 1 mm concentrations of probenecid (Prob), PAH, tetraethylammonium bromide (TEA), methylsuccinate (MS), bromcresol green (BCG), and chlorophenol red (CPR). Values are the means ± S.E.,n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the apparent coupling between Na+/glutarate and 2,4-D uptake were mediated by glutarate/2,4-D exchange, it should be possible to bypass the Na+ requirement by preloading the bovine plexus vesicles with glutarate. As shown in Fig.6, preloading the BBMV with 1 mmglutarate and diluting 20-fold in glutarate-free buffer containing 10 μm [3H]2,4-D, produced a 4-fold acceleration in 2,4-D uptake. This was blocked by probenecid, which inhibits organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar), but not by methylsuccinate or lithium, which inhibit Na+/glutarate cotransport (Fig.3). When intact plexus tissue is incubated in vitro, the surface presented to the medium is the apical face of the epithelium. The basolateral face of the plexus epithelium is oriented toward the interior of the tissue fragment facing the blood vessels. As predicted by the vesicle data, apical 2,4-D uptake by plexus tissue was stimulated by the addition of 20 μm external glutarate, and this stimulation was inhibited by lithium (Fig. 7), which blocks Na+-coupled glutarate uptake (Fig. 3). Thus, when glutarate entry is prevented, it can not stimulate 2,4-D uptake. The significance of this observation with regard to the polar distribution of transport across the choroid plexus epithelium is rendered somewhat uncertain by the surprising report of Schmitt and Burckhardt (29Schmitt C. Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange (therefore, Na+/glutarate-coupled organic anion transport) is present in apical membranes isolated from bovine kidney. Thus, our findings in bovine plexus may simply reflect a similar bipolar distribution of dicarboxylate/organic anion exchange in the bovine plexus. To address this issue, we turned to the intact rat choroid plexus. It is firmly established that dicarboxylate/organic anion exchange is an exclusive property of the basolateral membrane of rat proximal tubular epithelium (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schmitt C. Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, identical results were obtained for 2,4-D uptake by rat plexus in vitro as described above for the bovine plexus. 2,4-D uptake was markedly stimulated by external glutarate, and Li+ could block this stimulation. Identical data were obtained for PAH (data not shown), but the maximal uptake was only ∼25% that seen for 2,4-D. Finally, the specificity of 2,4-D uptake was assessed in intact rat plexus tissue (Fig. 9). As shown above for bovine BBMV (Fig. 5), glutarate-stimulated 2,4-D uptake was inhibited by organic anions including PAH, probenecid, and methylsuccinate but not by the organic cation, tetraethylammonium. Thus, the apical face of the rat plexus shows Na+/glutarate-stimulated 2,4-D uptake that is inhibited by both Li+ and probenecid, hallmarks of indirect sodium-coupled organic anion transport (4Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 969-975PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 9Specificity of 2,4-D uptake into rat plexus tissue in vitro. Plexus tissue was incubated for 5 min in aCSF (Control) or aCSF with 20 μmglutarate (Glutarate). In addition, the buffer contained 1 mm concentrations of probenecid (Prob), PAH, tetraethylammonium bromide (TEA), methylsuccinate (MS), bromcresol green (BCG), and chlorophenol red (CPR). Data are means ± S.E., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is not yet known whether the functional activity of the choroid plexus described above is the product of the same protein responsible for this activity in the kidney, ROAT1/OAT1 (6Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 26Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F864-F873PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is known that the human form, hOAT1, is expressed in brain (10Cihlar T. Lin D. Pritchard J.B. Fuller M. Mendel D. Sweet D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Since brainper se does not transport organic anions, the choroid plexus is the likely site of this activity. We also have preliminary evidence based on Northern blot analysis using a full-length rROAT1 probe that message for rROAT1 is present in choroid plexus (data not shown). Its size was smaller than seen in kidney, and we are as yet unsure if this difference indicates the presence of a related form or of rROAT1 itself. Thus, given the strong physiological evidence presented above for the presence of organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange in choroid plexus and the molecular evidence that suggests the presence of rROAT1 or a very closely related transporter, we examined the distribution of the cloned renal form of the exchanger (rROAT1) in choroid plexus. To do so, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” a construct was prepared in which rROAT1 was ligated in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of GFP, yielding a plasmid that codes for the protein rROAT1-GFP. We have previously shown that rROAT1-GFP mediates organic anion transport when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or transiently transfected into isolated Fundulus proximal tubules. Additionally, rROAT1-GFP was localized at the basal and lateral membranes of renal cell lines and tubules. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 10, its localization is clearly apical in the rat CP, with no signal present in the basolateral portions of the cell or in the nucleus. Unlike rROAT1-GFP, the control cytoplasmic GFP shows a diffuse cellular distribution, including penetration into the nucleus, and lacks any membrane associated signal. The composition of the extracellular fluid of the brain (interstitial fluid plus CSF) is highly regulated and well insulated from changes in systemic blood. This is achieved through the blood-brain barrier (brain capillary endothelium) and the blood-CFS barrier (epithelia of the choroid plexus, arachnoid membrane, and circumventricular organs) (30Segal M.B. Partridge W.M. Introduction to the Blood-Brain Barrier: Methodology, Biology, and Pathology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1998: 251-258Google Scholar, 31Rapoport S.I. Blood-Brain Barrier in Physiology and Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1976Google Scholar). At each site, tight junctions between the cells limit penetration of solutes present in plasma. However, penetration of drugs and other foreign chemicals into the brain is only slowed, not prevented, by these barriers. In addition, neurotransmitters and their metabolites are continuously produced within the brain. Since the barrier systems also limit passive efflux from the brain, it is clear that specialized excretory systems are required to prevent buildup of such potentially toxic compounds. As first documented by Pappenheimer et al. (32Pappenheimer J.R. Heisy S.R. Jordan E.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1961; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in 1961, such active transport systems do mediate elimination of organic anions from the brain. Subsequent work showed that the choroid plexus is a major site of such transport and that the plexus is capable of transporting a wide variety of solutes including iodide, thiocyanate, amino acids, purines, and sugars, as well as both anionic and cationic drugs (15Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 354-359PubMed Google Scholar,20Villalobos A.R. Parmelee J.T. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 22Whittico M.T.

Acta Physiol. Scand. 1973; 88: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because transport by the plexus was similar to other epithelial tissues, particularly liver and kidney, the mechanisms mediating choroid plexus transport were thought to be similar, if not identical, to those characterized in these tissues (34Barany E.H. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1972; 86: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Barany E.H. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1973; 88: 412-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, for the drug transporting systems, particularly for the organic anion system, direct mechanistic information has remained sparse, owing in part to the small size and physical inaccessibility of the plexus and in part to gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms and driving forces mediating organic anion transport (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Because of its tertiary coupling to metabolic energy (Fig.1 A), basolateral renal organic anion transport can be inhibited by agents that block energy metabolism (e.g.cyanide), inhibit the Na+,K+-ATPase (e.g. ouabain), interfere with Na+-coupled dicarboxylate cotransport (e.g. lithium or methylsuccinate), or compete for transport by the exchanger (e.g. probenecid) (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 969-975PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these properties can be used to demonstrate operation of the indirect coupled system in vesicles or in whole tissue. As shown in Fig. 3, bovine choroid plexus BBMV demonstrate Na+-coupled glutarate transport that was blocked by lithium or methylsuccinate. Furthermore, 2,4-D was taken up by a Na+-dependent mechanism but only in the presence of the dicarboxylate, glutarate (Fig. 4). 2,4-D uptake was inhibited by agents that block 2,4-D/glutarate exchange (probenecid) or Na+/glutarate cotransport (lithium, methylsuccinate) (Fig.5). Finally, the sodium requirement could be bypassed in BBMV by preloading with glutarate and diluting to generate an in > out gradient (Fig. 6). These results are entirely comparable with those obtained for uptake of PAH by renal basolateral membrane vesicles (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar,3Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, in the intact plexus tissue of both cow and rat, 2,4-D uptake was again stimulated by external glutarate (Figs. 7, 8). This stimulation was completely blocked by lithium (Figs. 7, 8) and methylsuccinate (Fig. 9). These findings clearly indicate that the indirect sodium-coupled mechanism is responsible for 2,4-D accumulation by the choroid plexus. Indeed, in all respects except a somewhat lower transport rate for PAH, apical choroid plexus transport of organic anions is identical to basolateral transport of PAH and 2,4-D by the kidney (4Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 969-975PubMed Google Scholar, 23Villalobos A.R. Dunnick C.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 582-589PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent apical location of the uphill step in organic anion transport is consistent with its role in active removal of organic anions from the CSF in the intact animal (32Pappenheimer J.R. Heisy S.R. Jordan E.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1961; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and with their effective uptake across the apical face of isolated plexus tissue in vitro (15Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1980; 212: 354-359PubMed Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the reversal of the epithelial localization of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which is apical in choroid plexus and basolateral in most other epithelia (19Ernst S.A. Palacios J.R. Aas A.T. Siegel G.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Villalobos A.R. Parmelee J.T. Pritchard J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 21Quinton P.M. Wright E.M. Tormey J. McD J. Cell Biol. 1973; 58: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, at least for the bovine plexus, these finding are not totally conclusive, since Schmitt and Burckhardt (29Schmitt C. Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrate the presence of organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange (thus, of indirect sodium coupling of organic anion transport) in both luminal and basolateral membranes isolated from bovine kidney. Therefore, although the data presented above clearly established the presence of the indirect coupled mechanism at the apical membrane of the bovine choroid plexus (Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), it could have a bipolar (apical and basolateral) distribution in bovine plexus as it does in bovine kidney. Two additional lines of evidence are presented in support of the apical localization of organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange in choroid plexus. First, Na+/glutarate-coupled 2,4-D transport was also clearly evident at the apical membrane of rat plexus (Figs. 8, 9). In rat, there is abundant evidence of that this mechanism is exclusively basolateral in kidney (2Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shimada H. Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Second, when the rROAT1-GFP construct was expressed in rat plexus, it was exclusively present in the apical membrane (Fig. 10), in direct contrast to the basolateral localization of this same construct in rat proximal tubules (26Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F864-F873PubMed Google Scholar). Like the functional data, these findings argue that organic anion/dicarboxylate exchange and, therefore, indirect coupling of organic anion transport to sodium is an apical function in the choroid plexus (Fig.1 B). Thus, this system is poised both functionally and anatomically to rapidly remove anionic drugs and metabolites from the CSF.

Chromosomal translocations that relocate the subnuclear targeting sequences of transcription factors can potentially contribute to the altered nuclear organization and related changes in gene expression that are characteristic of cancer cells. It is important, therefore, to understand how subnuclear targeting signals localize transcription factors.The acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)1/core binding factor α (CBF-α/CBFA) transcription factors, as well as their homologs in mouse (polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2) αA, αB, and αC) and Xenopus (Xaml), are key transactivators of tissue-specific genes of the hematopoietic and bone lineages (1Miyoshi H.

These CBFA/AML transcription factors provide a paradigm for studying tissue restricted transcriptional control within the context of nuclear organization. There are three distinct genes (AML-1/PEBP2αB/CBFA2, AML-2/PEBP2αA/CBFA3, andAML-3/PEBP2αC/CBFA1) that each encode both transcriptionally active and inactive isoforms which result from alternative mRNA splicing. The inactive forms lack the homologous C-terminal region.The transcriptionally active form of the hematopoietic transcription factor AML-1 contains an unique C-terminal 31- amino acid nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS). This sequence directs AML-1 to nuclear matrix-associated subnuclear sites that support transcription. Furthermore, the NMTS of AML-1 can direct the heterologous GAL4 to the nuclear matrix (8Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Therefore, the NMTS represents an autonomous protein module with sufficient structural determinants to mediate subnuclear targeting. Domains analogous to the NMTS are conserved in the ubiquitous AML-2 and bone-related AML-3 regulatory proteins. Although subtle differences exist among the NMTS sequences of AML-1, AML-2, and AML-3, their NMTS segments may have similar targeting functions. The structure of the NMTS can, then, provide essential insight into properties of the AML factors that mediate trafficking to and/or binding to nuclear matrix-associated transcription sites. In this paper, we report the first crystal structure of the NMTS peptide, in this case fused with glutathione S-transferase, at 2.7-Å resolution. The spatial arrangement of the components of gene expression is important to their function. Chromosomal translocations that relocate the subnuclear targeting sequences of transcription factors can potentially contribute to the altered nuclear organization and related changes in gene expression that are characteristic of cancer cells. It is important, therefore, to understand how subnuclear targeting signals localize transcription factors. The acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)1/core binding factor α (CBF-α/CBFA) transcription factors, as well as their homologs in mouse (polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2) αA, αB, and αC) and Xenopus (Xaml), are key transactivators of tissue-specific genes of the hematopoietic and bone lineages (1Miyoshi H.

These CBFA/AML transcription factors provide a paradigm for studying tissue restricted transcriptional control within the context of nuclear organization. There are three distinct genes (AML-1/PEBP2αB/CBFA2, AML-2/PEBP2αA/CBFA3, andAML-3/PEBP2αC/CBFA1) that each encode both transcriptionally active and inactive isoforms which result from alternative mRNA splicing. The inactive forms lack the homologous C-terminal region. The transcriptionally active form of the hematopoietic transcription factor AML-1 contains an unique C-terminal 31- amino acid nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS). This sequence directs AML-1 to nuclear matrix-associated subnuclear sites that support transcription. Furthermore, the NMTS of AML-1 can direct the heterologous GAL4 to the nuclear matrix (8Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Therefore, the NMTS represents an autonomous protein module with sufficient structural determinants to mediate subnuclear targeting. Domains analogous to the NMTS are conserved in the ubiquitous AML-2 and bone-related AML-3 regulatory proteins. Although subtle differences exist among the NMTS sequences of AML-1, AML-2, and AML-3, their NMTS segments may have similar targeting functions. The structure of the NMTS can, then, provide essential insight into properties of the AML factors that mediate trafficking to and/or binding to nuclear matrix-associated transcription sites.

OA also induces a strong increase of phosphorylative activity toward the mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate myelin basic protein (MBP). Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) or anti-ERK2 antibodies followed by MBP kinase assays, and direct in-gel kinase assays for MBP, show that p44/ERK1 but not p42/ERK2 is stimulated in OA-treated spermatocytes. OA treatment stimulates phosphorylation of ERK1, but not of ERK2, on a tyrosine residue involved in activation of the enzyme. ERK1 immunoprecipitated from extracts of OA-stimulated spermatocytes induces a stimulation of H1 kinase activity in extracts from control pachytene spermatocytes, whereas immunoprecipitated ERK2 is uneffective.

Preincubation of cultured pachytene spermatocytes with PD98059 (a selective inhibitor of ERK-activating kinases MEK1/2) completely blocks the ability of OA to induce chromosome condensation and progression to meiotic metaphases.

The homologous chromosomes are segregated in the two daughter cells (secondary spermatocytes) during the first meiotic division, whereas the sister chromatids, through a process resembling mitosis, are segregated during the second division to generate haploid cells. The prophase of male first meiotic division is a lengthy process which ensures the correct pairing and the crossing over between homologous chromosomes. In the mouse, this process lasts approximately 10 days, during which the homologous chromosomes become partially condensed, anneal to each other, and are maintained in proximity by a structure called the synaptonemal complex. After genetic exchange (crossing over) has occurred, the synaptonemal complex disappears and chromosome condensation allows the sites of DNA exchange to become visible as chiasmata. As for mitotic division, the nuclear envelope breaks down and microtubules are assembled into a spindle. The chromosomes become aligned to the equator of the meiotic spindle and the two sets of homologous chromosomes are separated during the anaphase. While the meiotic prophase is considerably long, metaphase and anaphase transitions are rather short. Due to the difficulty of isolating homogenous populations of synchronized cells, and the length of meiosis I in spermatocytes, not much is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the different steps of mammalian male meiosis (for review, see Ref. 1Handel M.A. Eppig J.J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1998; 37: 333-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most of the information about cell cycle regulation during meiosis in metazoan cells has been obtained using Xenopus laevis oocytes naturally arrested in late G2 of the first meiotic division. Induction of G2/M progression by progesterone requires the expression of the proto-oncogenemos (2Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F.

Science. 1989; 245: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 cascade, and finally activation of the cyclin B·cdc2 complex, also known as mitosis-promoting factor, or maturation-promoting factor (MPF, for review, see Ref. 5Sagata N. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Microinjection of antibodies blocking MAPK kinase are able to block MAPK activation triggered by activated Mos, and to block Xenopus oocyte maturation (6Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and Mos cytostatic activity at metaphase (7Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28354-28358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dominant negative p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) is able to block Mos-induced MPF activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts (8Huang C.Y. Ferrell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2169-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that activation of MPF and meiotic progression by progesterone could be bypassed by injection of constitutively active forms of MAPKs (9Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Dell K. Shirakabe K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25898-25904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Haccard O. Lewellyn A. Hartley R.S. Erickson E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although these observations strongly suggest a role for MAPKs in meiotic progression and regulation of MPF activity in Xenopus oocytes, the mechanism of this regulation is still unknown. The activity of MPF is regulated at multiple steps, such as cyclin B synthesis, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events (11Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 12Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), and nuclear export (13Hasting A. Karlsson C. Clute P. Jackman M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4127-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Yang J. Bardes E.S. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). During G2, the cyclin B·cdc2 complex accumulates in the oocyte, but it is kept inactive through phosphorylation of Thr14 and/or Tyr15 by the wee1 kinase(s). Inactivation of wee1 kinases and/or activation of the activating phosphatase cdc25 trigger dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 and cause activation of MPF (11Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 15Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Recently, a possible link between activation of MAPKs and MPF has been proposed on the base of the finding that MAPK-activated p90 rsk binds to and phosphorylates the wee1 homologue Myt1 (16Palmer A. Gavin A-C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation inhibits Myt1 activity and interferes with inhibition of MPF activity in vitro. In the mouse oocytes, meiotic resumption is under the negative control of cAMP (1Handel M.A. Eppig J.J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1998; 37: 333-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When cAMP levels drop there is an increase in the activity of MPF and MAPKs resulting in the germinal vesicle breakdown and progression through the first meiotic division. On the contrary of what has been observed in Xenopus oocyte maturation, activity of Mos is dispensable for the G2/M transition after prophase I in both female and male mice (17Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Udy G.B. Evans M.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto N. Watanabe N. Furuta Y. Tamemoto H. Sagata N. Yokoyama M. Okazaki K. Nagayoshi M. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nature. 1994; 370: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), even though Mos might participate in some aspects of meiotic maturation in mouse oocytes (19Verlhac M.H. Kubiak J.Z. Weber M. Geraud G. Colledge W.H. Evans M.J. Maro B. Development. 1996; 122: 815-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Choi T. Rulong S. Resau J. Fukasawa K. Matten W. Kuriyama R. Mansour S. Ahn N. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4730-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The oocyte proceeds to the second meiotic division and arrests at metaphase II with the sister chromatids aligned on the spindle, due to the concerted action of Mos and MAPKs, which, at this stage, prevent cyclin destruction and consequent MPF inactivation (5Sagata N. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Indeed, Mos-knock out animals showed lack of MII arrest and high rate of parthenogenetic activation of ovulated oocytes (17Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Udy G.B. Evans M.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto N. Watanabe N. Furuta Y. Tamemoto H. Sagata N. Yokoyama M. Okazaki K. Nagayoshi M. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nature. 1994; 370: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A similar synchronization of events can be artificially reproduced in mouse spermatocytes by treatment with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) (21Handel M.A. Caldwell K.A. Wiltshire T. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Wiltshire T. Park C. Caldwell K.A. Handel M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Rhee K. Wolgemuth D. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OA overcomes the checkpoints that normally delay the progression of the meiotic cycle of mid- and late pachytene spermatocytes and induces nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation resembling that observed during G2/M transition after prophase I. The meiotic progression of mouse spermatocytes induced by OA is accompanied by an increase in H1 kinase activity, which is considered a sign of MPF activation (22Wiltshire T. Park C. Caldwell K.A. Handel M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The increase in H1 kinase activity during OA-induced G2/M transition in mouse spermatocytes is due to a concurrent activation of a cyclin/cdk activity detectable in precipitates using p13 suc1 -conjugated agarose (23Rhee K. Wolgemuth D. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of MPF actually occurs under these experimental conditions. It is not known whether, in addition to MPF, Mos and MAPKs are also required for G2/M progression during meiosis in mouse spermatocytes. Targeted gene disruption of Mos did not produce a clear phenotype in the male mice, and did not result in sterile animals. However, it cannot be ruled out that, in the absence of Mos, redundant mechanisms of MAPK activation, e.g. via Raf-1 and/or MEKKs (24Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar), substitute for its function. In this study we have examined the activity of MPF and MAPKs during meiotic progression artificially induced in mouse spermatocytes by OA treatment. We found that OA induces a sustained activation of both MAPKs and MPF with similar time courses. OA induces phosphorylation and activation of p44/ERK1, but not of p42/ERK2. Immunoprecipitated p44-ERK1 from OA-stimulated male meiotic germ cells was able to induce MPF activation in extracts from control spermatocytes in vitro. Preincubation of cultured pachytene spermatocytes with PD98059 (a selective inhibitor of ERK activating kinases MEK1/2) completely blocked the ability of OA to induce chromosome condensation and progression to meiotic metaphases. Our results suggest an important function for ERK1/MAPK in male mouse meiotic progression, as also indicated by changes in its subcellular distribution during naturally occurring G2/M transition. Testes of adult CD1 mice (Charles River Italia) were used to prepare germ cells. After dissection of the albuginea membrane, testes were digested for 15 min in 0.25% (w/v) collagenase (type IX, Sigma) at room temperature under constant shaking. Digestion was followed by two washes in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), hence seminiferous tubules were cut in pieces using a sterile blade and further digested in minimum essential medium containing 1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 30 °C. Digestion was stopped by adding 10% fetal calf serum and the released germ cells were collected after sedimentation (10 min at room temperature) of tissue debris. Germ cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 rpm at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended in 20 ml of elutriation medium (120.1 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 25.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4(7H2O), 1.3 mmCaCl2, 11 mm glucose, 1 × essential amino acid (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, streptomycin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Germ cells at pachytene spermatocyte, round spermatid, and elongated spermatid steps were obtained by elutriation of the unfractionated single cell suspension as described previously (25Meistrich M.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 15: 15-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Homogeneity of cell populations ranged between 80 and 85% (pachytene spermatocytes) and 95% (round spermatids), and was routinely monitored morphologically. Mature spermatozoa were obtained from mature mice as described previously (26Sette C. Bevilacqua A. Bianchini A. Mangia F. Geremia R. Rossi P. Development. 1997; 124: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spermatogonia (27Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Sertoli cells (27Rossi P. Dolci S. Albanesi C. Grimaldi P. Ricca R. Geremia R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,28Grimaldi P. Piscitelli D. Albanesi C. Blasi F. Geremia R. Rossi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1217-1225PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from prepuberal mice as previously described. After the elutriation, pachytene spermatocytes were cultured in minimum essential medium, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm sodium lactate, in 6-well dishes at a density of 106 cells/ml at 32 °C in a humified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. After 12 h, cells were treated with 0.5 μm OA, or 5 μm OA, or equal volumes of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, and culture was continued for up to 6 h. For time course experiments, aliquots were taken at different time points and processed as described below. In order to test the effect of inhibition of ERK-activating kinases, before OA treatments, cells were preincubated for 12 h with the specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinases PD98059 (Calbiochem, catalog number 513000) at the concentration of 50 μm, or equal volumes of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. For cytological and immunofluorescence analyses, and kinase assays, aliquots of the same samples were taken and processed accordingly. 106cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of KCl, 75 mm hypotonic solution and incubated for 15–20 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were fixed by adding 0.5 ml of methanol:acetic acid solution (3:1) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After a 10-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g, pellets were washed 4 times with 4 ml of methanol:acetic acid solution (3:1), with a 10-min incubation at room temperature between each wash. After the last wash, pellets were resuspended in 200–500 μl of methanol:acetic acid solution (3:1) and the solution was dropped from 10 to 15 cm onto glass slides to allow spreading of the nuclei. Slides were stained in 5% Giemsa dye dissolved in 0.15 mmNaH2PO4 containing 3% methanol. Slides were washed with 0.15 mm NaH2PO4containing 3% methanol, allowed to dry and mounted with coverslide. Nuclei were observed by light microscopy. Control or OA-treated spermatocytes were spotted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and fixed at room temperature for 15 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldheyde. Cells were then permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1% fetal calf serum in PBS. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-93-G) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Sigma, catalog number T4026), both at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, as primary antibodies. Following 5 washes (10 min in PBS), cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with cyanin 3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (Chemicon, catalog number AP132C, 1:400 dilution) and fluoresceinated anti-mouse IgGs (Sigma, catalog number T4026, 1:200 dilution) as secondary antibodies. To stain DNA, 0.1 mg/ml Hoechst dye (Sigma) was added to the solutions containing the secondary antibodies. Control experiments were performed using either rabbit or mouse non-immune IgGs in the first incubation, or the secondary antibodies alone. After 5 more washes in PBS, slides were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS and immediately examined by fluorescence microscopy. Approximately 2 × 105cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × gfor 10 min, resuspended in 10 μl of storage solution (10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Before the assay, cells were thawed on ice and lysed for 10 min on ice in 50 μl of hypotonic H1 kinase buffer (25 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 60 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C, and soluble extracts were collected and used for H1 kinase assays. Kinase reactions using 10–15 μl of soluble extracts were carried out for 60 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 25 μl in H1 kinase buffer containing 100 μg/ml H1 (type III-S; Sigma), 1 μg/ml cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), and 0.3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/μl). Reactions were stopped spotting 20 μl onto P81 paper squares (Whatman) and immediately immersing them into 0.1% phosphoric acid. Paper squares were washed 5 times for 10 min and air dried. Radioactivity incorporated into H1 was determined by scintillation counting. Values were normalized for protein content, determined according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Samples were collected and frozen as described for the H1 kinase assay. Cells were thawed on ice and lysed for 10 min on ice in 50 μl of MBP kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of MBP kinase buffer containing 0.3 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.2 μCi/μl) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.5 mm MBP-derived peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-3011) as a specific substrate for MAPKs. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and proteins were allowed to precipitate on ice for 10 min using 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as carrier. After centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, aliquots of the supernatant fractions were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and processed as described for the H1 kinase assay (26Sette C. Bevilacqua A. Bianchini A. Mangia F. Geremia R. Rossi P. Development. 1997; 124: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control or OA-treated spermatocytes (approximately 2 × 106cell/sample) were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 10 min, and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cells were homogenized in either H1 kinase buffer or MBP kinase buffer and cytosolic fractions were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 1 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-245) or rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-93-G) or anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-154-G) were preincubated for 60 min with a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) under constant shaking at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, the beads were washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl, twice with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, and then incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with the soluble spermatocyte cell extracts (0.5 mg of protein) under constant shaking. Sepharose bead-bound immunocomplexes were rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and twice with either H1 kinase buffer or MBP kinase buffer. Anti-cyclin B1 pellets were then incubated with 1 μg of H1, 1 μg of cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, and 0.3 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/μl) in H1 kinase buffer (total volume 30 μl) for 30 min at 30 °C. Anti-ERKs pellets were incubated with either 0.5 mm MBP-derived peptide or 1 μg of full-length MBP (Sigma, catalog number M1891) and 0.3 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/μl) in MBP kinase buffer (total volume 30 μl) for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples incubated with the MBP-derived peptide were processed as described in the paragraph describing the MBP kinase assay. As for the samples incubated with H1 or with the full-length MBP protein, at the end of the incubation, pellets were separated by centrifugation (3,000 × gfor 5 min) and the supernatants were diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Radioactivity incorporated into H1 or MBP was analyzed by autoradiography after separation of the proteins on SDS-PAGE gel. In some experiments, immunoprecipitation pellets were washed two additional times with PBS, immunocomplexes were then eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Control or OA-treated spermatocytes were collected as described above for MBP kinase assays. Soluble extracts were diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1 mg/ml full-length MBP. After the run, SDS was removed by washing the gel twice in 20% 2-propanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were then denatured by incubation of the gel in 6m guanidine HCl at room temperature for 1 h, and renatured overnight with five washes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.04% Tween 20 and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The gel was then preincubated for 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 2 mmdithiothreitol and 10 mm MgCl2. Phosphorylation of MBP was carried on for 1 h at 25 °C in 10 ml of preincubation buffer adding 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 μmcAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, 40 μm ATP, and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by immersing the gel in 5% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The gel was washed for 5–10 times in the same solution, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Spermatocyte cell extracts from control or OA-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-ERK1 antibody or anti-ERK2 antibody essentially as described for the MBP-immunokinase assay. After the washes with MBP kinase buffer, immunocomplexes were incubated for 30 min with a soluble cell extracts from untreated spermatocytes (approximately 0.2 mg/sample) at 30 °C under constant shaking. At the end of the incubation, soluble cell extracts and immunocomplexes were separated by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and H1 kinase activity was measured in the supernatant fractions as described above. Spermatocyte cell extracts were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-ERK1 (100 ng/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-93-G), anti-ERK2 (100 ng/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-154-G), or PanERK (300 ng/ml) (Transduction Laboratories, catalog number E17120) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, or the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-p-ERK (400 ng/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7383). The first antibody incubation was carried on for 90 min at room temperature. Second antibody incubation was carried out with either 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit-IgGs antibody, or with 1:5,000 dilution of anti-mouse IgGs antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunostained bands were detected by the ECL chemiluminescent method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-p-ERK monoclonal antibody specifically recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated active ERKs, and we tested its specificity by treatment of cell extracts with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, which completely suppressed recognition of the relative bands, unless calf intestine alkaline phosphatase treatment was performed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (data not shown). It has been previously reported that treatment of mouse spermatocytes with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor OA, in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum, is able to induce G2/M progression in approximately 90% of the cells within 4–6 h (21Handel M.A. Caldwell K.A. Wiltshire T. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Wiltshire T. Park C. Caldwell K.A. Handel M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). OA triggered nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation and this phenomenon was accompanied by a 2–4-fold increase in H1 kinase activity (22Wiltshire T. Park C. Caldwell K.A. Handel M.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Rhee K. Wolgemuth D. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was interpreted to reflect activation of MPF, since it was also detected in p13 suc1 -agarose precipitates (23Rhee K. Wolgemuth D. Development. 1997; 124: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions, treatment with 5 μmOA in the absence of fetal calf serum induced a dramatic chromatin condensation which was observed in about 90% of the cells (Fig.1 A, right side), suggesting that serum is not required for G2/M transition induced by OA treatment. Activation of H1 kinase activity was accompanied by a rapid (2-fold activation after 1 h) and sustained increase in H1 kinase activity that reached a maximum (5-fold) between 4 and 6 h (Fig. 1 B). To investigate whether the increase in H1 kinase activity was indeed due to activation of MPF, we immunoprecipitated MPF activity from control and treated cells using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes cyclin B1 (see “Materials and Methods”), the major cyclin component of MPF in these cells (30Chapman D.L. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates from control and OA-treated cells were incubated with purified H1 and [γ-32P]ATP, and the soluble fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography for phosphorylation of the H1 substrate (Fig. 1 C). Densitometric analysis indicates that 4-h treatment of spermatocytes with OA induced a 4-fold increase in cyclin B1/cdc2 kinase activity (Fig. 1 D), demonstrating that the increase in H1 kinase activity observed in the cytosolic extracts (Fig. 1 B) is actually due to activation of MPF. To investigate the role of MAPKs in the male meiosis, we analyzed the expression of ERK1 and ERK2 in germ cells and somatic cells of the testis by Western blot analysis. Spermatogonia were isolated from 8-day-old mice, Sertoli cells were isolated fro"

The PAK subfamily is characterized by an N-terminal p21-binding domain (also known as CRIB domain), a C-terminal kinase domain, and is regulated by the small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42Hs. The second group is represented by the GCK-like members, which contain an N-terminal catalytic domain and lack the p21-binding domain. Some of them have been demonstrated to induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) cascade, while others have been shown to be activated by a subset of stress conditions or apoptotic agents, although little is known about their specific function. Here, we have identified a novel human STE20-related serine/threonine kinase, belonging to the GCK-like subfamily. This kinase does not induce the JNK/SAPK pathway, but, instead, inhibits the basal activity of JNK/SAPK, and diminishes its activation in response to human epidermal growth factor (EGF). Therefore, we designated this molecule JIK forJNK/SAPK-inhibitory kinase. The inhibition of JNK/SAPK signaling pathway by JIK was found to occur between the EGF receptor and the small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42Hs. In contrast, JIK does not activate nor does it inhibit ERK2, ERK6, p38, or ERK5. Furthermore, JIK kinase activity is not modulated by any exogenous stimuli, but, interestingly, it is dramatically decreased upon EGF receptor activation. Thus, JIK might represent the first member of the STE20 kinase family whose activity can be negatively regulated by tyrosine kinase receptors, and whose downstream targets inhibit, rather than enhance, JNK/SAPK activation.

In this study, we describe the isolation of a novel human serine/threonine kinase, designatedJNK/SAPK-inhibitory kinase (JIK), whose kinase domain shares similarity to the GCK-like subfamily of STE20 kinases. Furthermore, its non-catalytic domain shares high homology to a Caenorhabditis elegans putative serine/threonine kinase, named SULU, of unknown function. Interestingly, we found that this protein does not induce JNK/SAPK pathway; rather, its overexpression in COS7 cells leads to the inhibition of JNK/SAPK activation. Furthermore, EGF negatively regulates JIK activity, and thus it may represent the first member of the STE20-like kinases whose activity is reduced upon stimulation of a cell surface receptor.RESULTSEps8 is an SH3 domain-containing protein identified as a substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and several other receptor tyrosine kinases (76Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castagnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The binding site of eps8 on the EGFR was mapped to the juxtamembrane region of this receptor (77Castagnino P. Biesova Z. Wong W.T. Fazioli F. Gill G.N. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 723-729PubMed Google Scholar). Although several observations suggest that eps8 plays a critical role in mitogenic signaling (76Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castagnino P.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3805-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), its cellular function is still not clearly understood.As an approach to identify proteins that can associate physically with eps8, we screened a human embryonic fibroblast M426 expression library using the GST SH3 domain of eps8 as a probe (70Biesova Z. Piccoli C. Wong W. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several overlapping cDNA clones were identified, the longest of which, designated clone 74–10, contained a cDNA insert of 2.978 kilobase pairs. The complete nucleotide sequence of the clone 74–10 (GenBank accession no.AF179867) predicted an 898-amino acid open reading frame (Fig.1 A) and a molecular mass of 106 kDa. Furthermore, the clone 74 contained a consensus Kozak sequence, GCCATC (79Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), immediately upstream from the putative initiation codon. GenBank and EMBL data base searches revealed that its N-terminal region (amino acids 19–284) encompasses a kinase domain including all 11 subdomains that are characteristic of serine/threonine kinases (80Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison with other protein kinases using the BLAST program (81Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overall protein exhibits 63% identity and 76% similarity with a C. elegans serine/threonine kinase of unknown function, designated SULU (Fig. 1 B). A dendrogram was created to examine the evolutionary relationship between clone 74, designated JIK for Jun kinase-inhibitorykinase (see below), and the other members of the STE20-like kinases. As shown in Fig. 1 C, JIK does not belong to any of the STE20-related branches but, together with its C. eleganshomolog, it defines an independent subfamily.Although JIK was initially isolated by virtue of its ability to bind to the bacterially expressed SH3 domain of eps8, no interaction between eps8 and JIK was observed when JIK was co-expressed in mammalian cells together with eps8, or when lysates from JIK-expressing cells were affinity-purified with bacterially expressed eps8 (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that JIK binds eps8 in vitro, but that this is likely to represent a low affinity interaction. The biological relevance of such an interaction, as well as whether JIK can physically associate in vivo to other eps8-related proteins, is under current investigation.Analysis of the cDNA and Expression of JIK mRNATo examine the tissue distribution of JIK, we performed Northern blot analysis to establish the level of JIK mRNA expression in several human tissues. As shown in Fig. 2, a major distinct transcript of 4.4 kilobase pairs was detected in most tissues. The levels of JIK mRNA are similar in the tissues analyzed, with the exception of low level expression in the skeletal muscle. Thus, JIK is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human tissues.Figure 2Expression of JIK mRNA in human tissues. A multiple tissue Northern blot was hybridized with JIK cDNA probe (upper panel), stripped, and re-hybridized with a human glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (lower panel). Each lane represents 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the indicated tissues. Molecular size markers are shown on the left in kilobase pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification and Characterization of the Human JIK ProductIn order to determine the expression of endogenous JIK protein, total cell lysates from NIH-3T3 and C33A cells were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with a specific anti-JIK serum, raised against the non-catalytic region of JIK. This anti-JIK serum recognized a major ∼110 k Da band (Fig.3, lanes 3 and 4) which was not detected when the same extracts were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). A faint band of higher molecular weight was also detected by the anti-JIK serum (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). However, when a variety of cell lines was tested, the intensity of this band did not correlate with that of the major JIK-immunoreactive species (not shown), nor we observed changes upon overexpression of the JIK cDNA (Fig. 3, lane 6), Thus, this band is likely not to represent lower mobility forms of JIK, but instead cross-reacting molecules that are yet to be characterized. To confirm that the JIK cDNA contained the entire coding region, we engineered an expression plasmid encoding the HA epitope (83Wilson I. Niman H. Houghten R. Cherenson A. Connolly M. Lerner R. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) in frame with the first codon of JIK open reading frame. Total cell lysates from transfected C33A cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA and then examined by immunoblot analysis using anti-JIK. As shown in Fig. 3, a 110-kDa protein, migrating at a similar position as the endogenous protein, was detected in HA-JIK transfected cells (lane 6). No bands were detected in the cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 3, lane 5). These results suggested that the longest JIK cDNA clone identified (74-10) contains the entire open reading frame of the JIK gene.Figure 3Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of JIK. 5 mg of cell lysates from asynchronously growing NIH-3T3 and C33A cells were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-JIK (lanes 3 and 4) and with preimmune rabbit serum (lanes 1 and 2). 5 mg of cell lysates from C33A cells transfected with vector alone (lane 5) or with HA-tagged JIK (lane 6) were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitants were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and, after transferring onto Immobilon P membrane, were immunoblotted with anti-JIK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because of the sequence similarity of the putative kinase region of JIK to other serine/threonine kinases, we sought to determine whether JIK exhibits intrinsic kinase activity. HA-tagged JIK was transiently transfected in COS7 cells, immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies and subjected to immune complex kinase assay, using myelin basic protein (MBP) as exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig.4, autophosphorylation of JIK, as well as MBP phosphorylation, were observed in HA-JIK transfected cells (lane 2), but not in cells transfected with the vector alone (lane 1). To further confirm that the phosphorylated band at 110 k Da was indeed HA-JIK, HA immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-JIK antibodies. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4 A, a 110 k Da band was detected in the HA-JIK transfected cells but not in the cells transfected with the vector alone.Figure 4JIK is an active protein kinase.

The large extracellular amino-terminal domains (ATDs) of mGluRs are homologous to the periplasmic binding proteins in bacteria. In this study, a region in the ATD of the mGluR4 subtype of mGluR postulated to contain the ligand-binding pocket was explored by site-directed mutagenesis using a molecular model of the tertiary structure of the ATD as a guiding tool. Although the conversion of Arg78, Ser159, or Thr182 to Ala did not affect the level of protein expression or cell-surface expression, all three mutations severely impaired the ability of the receptor to bind the agonist l-[3H]amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid. Mutation of other residues within or in close proximity to the proposed binding pocket produced either no effect (Ser157 and Ser160) or a relatively modest effect (Ser181) on ligand affinity compared with the Arg78, Ser159, and Thr182 mutations. Based on these experimental findings, together with information obtained from the model in which the glutamate analog l-serineO-phosphate (l-SOP) was “docked” into the binding pocket, we suggest that the hydroxyl groups on the side chains of Ser159 and Thr182 of mGluR4 form hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl and α-amino groups on l-SOP, respectively, whereas Arg78 forms an electrostatic interaction with the acidic side chains of l-SOP or glutamate. The conservation of Arg78, Ser159, and Thr182 in all members of the mGluR family indicates that these amino acids may be fundamental recognition motifs for the binding of agonists to this class of receptors.

The mGluR family has been divided into three subgroups based on sequence homology, pharmacology, and signal transduction properties; in cell lines, group I mGluRs couple to phosphoinositide turnover, whereas group II and III receptors couple to the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP via Gi/Go proteins (1Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 2Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol.

The group III mGluRs are important regulators of synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that activation of l-AP4-sensitive receptors causes a suppression of synaptic transmission by inhibiting neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals (3Macek T.A. Winder D.G. Gereau IV, R.W. Ladd L.O. Conn J.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 76: 3798-3806Google Scholar), and immunocytochemical studies have confirmed that group III mGluRs are localized presynaptically (4Risso Bradley S. Standaert D.G. Rhodes K.J. Rees H.D.

The characterization of mutant mice lacking the mGluR4 subtype of mGluR has provided additional insight into the function of this receptor in the nervous system. For example, observations from electrophysiological analyses demonstrating impaired presynaptic functions in the mutant mice led to the suggestion that this receptor may be required for sustaining synaptic transmission during periods of high-frequency neurotransmission (7Pekhletski R.

The basic structural domains of mGluRs include a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD), seven putative transmembrane domains, and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. The homology of the ATDs of mGluRs to the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP) and other bacterial periplasmic binding proteins that mediate the transport of amino acids in prokaryotes is fortuitous because the mGluRs appear to possess a similar three-dimensional fold and the crystal structures of the bacterial proteins are known (11O'Hara P.J.

Data obtained from experiments on chimeric constructs of the ATD of human mGluR4 with the transmembrane domains and carboxyl-terminal regions of mGluR1b (19Tones M.A. Bendali H. Flor P.J. Knopfel T.

More recent studies demonstrating that the ATDs of mGluR1 (21Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol.

In this study, we have employed molecular modeling in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis to probe the ligand-binding pocket of mGluR4. Our results indicate that three conserved amino acids present in the ATDs may be key determinants of ligand binding to all members of the mGluR family. The three-dimensional structure of the proposed ligand-binding domain of rat mGluR4 was formulated by homology modeling using the experimentally determined structure of the closed form of LIVBP from Escherichia coli and the strategy outlined by Blundell et al. (23Blundell T.L. Sibanda B.L. Sternberg M.J.E. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates for the closed form of LIVBP with leucine in the binding pocket were kindly provided by Dr. F. A. Quiocho (Baylor College of Medicine). The QUANTA program (Version 97, MSI Corp.) and the SYBYL program (Version 6.4, Tripos Associates) were used to view the model that encompassed the region from Gly47 to Lys490 in the ATD of mGluR4. The sequence alignment used in the mGluR4 model has been described previously (11O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Backbone atom coordinates were assigned the corresponding residue coordinates from the crystal structure of LIVBP, and side chain atom coordinates were based on maximal side chain atom fitting to the LIVBP structure. Regions with insertions or deletions were modeled using known substructures identified by loop-searching techniques; regions 1–46, 125–149, 353–401, and 426–439, which are absent in LIVBP, were not included in the model. The l-SOP molecule was docked into the binding site of mGluR4 in an orientation that corresponds to that observed for leucine binding to LIVBP. The model was energy-optimized using a restrained energy minimization with additional constraints applied to the backbone regions based on the x-ray structure of LIVBP using the CHARMm force field. A steepest descent followed by a conjugate gradient method were used for energy minimization until the energy change per cycle was <0.0001 kcal/mol.

For the construction of c-Myc-tagged mGluR4a, the mGluR4a-pcDNA3 plasmid was cut with XhoI, and the larger fragment containing pcDNA3 backbone was ligated to itself (the 5′-mGluR4a-pcDNA3 plasmid).

The 931-base pairNdeI-XhoI fragment from 5′-mGluR4a-c-Myc-pcDNA3 and a 3335-base pairXhoI-NotI fragment of mGluR4a-pcDNA3 were subcloned into pcDNA3 at NdeI-NotI sites using a three-piece ligation. The c-Myc-tagged mutants were also constructed in this manner using the corresponding mutants. For the generation of the S157A, S160A, and S181A mutants, the sequences flanking the point of mutation were amplified in two separate PCRs on the rat mGluR4a-pcDNA3 expression plasmid. For all other mutants, the mGluR4a cDNA in pBluescript SK−(Stratagene) was used as the template. One of four primers used in the generation of each mutant contained the desired mutation. An adjacent primer was phosphorylated prior to PCR, and the two PCR products were ligated to each other and reamplified using the two most distant primers (the 5′-primer from the first PCR and the 3′-primer from the second PCR). The resulting products were cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned in place of the corresponding wild-type fragment. All expression constructs were assembled in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector for transient transfection in HEK cells. In all cases, the orientation of the inserts and the integrity of subcloning sites were checked by restriction analysis where applicable, and the PCR-amplified regions were sequenced to confirm the mutations and to ensure that no other changes were introduced. A cassette mutagenesis method was used to construct the S159A mutation. A 1.79-kilobase KpnI fragment of mGluR4a containing Ser159 was subcloned into the pBluescript SK− vector and transformed into CJ236 bacteria. A mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-GGA GCT TCA GGG GCC TCC GTC TCG ATC A-3′) was annealed to the template and used to make double-stranded mutant DNA with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 ligase. The double-stranded mutant DNA was transformed into DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and rapid screening of the colonies was carried out using theSacI restriction enzyme; the DNA from a positive colony was sequenced to confirm the presence of the S159A mutation and the absence of any additional base pair changes. The mutated cassette was then excised from pBluescript SK− and ligated back in the correct orientation in the mGluR4a cDNA in pcDNA3. HEK cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium with 6% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Transient transfections were conducted using the protocol described previously (22Han G. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10008-10013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); all experiments were conducted on cells or membranes collected 48 h after transfection. The membrane preparation procedure and the l-[3H]AP4 binding assay were carried out as described by Eriksen and Thomsen (25Eriksen L. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3279-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), except that 300 μml-SOP was used to define nonspecific binding. Bound and free radioligands were separated by centrifugation. For competition experiments, 30 nml-[3H]AP4 was used. The data were analyzed using GraphPAD Prism software. l-[3H]AP4 (specific activity, 54 Ci/mmol), l-SOP, sodiuml-glutamate, (2S,3S,4S)-CCG/(2S,1′S,2′S)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (l-CCG-1), and (RS)-α-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine) (CPPG) were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom) The procedures for immunoblotting were carried out as described by Pickering et al.

Electrophoresis samples containing 100 mmdithiothreitol were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to gel electrophoresis. Antibodies raised in rabbits against the carboxyl terminus of mGluR4a were generated as described by Risso Bradleyet al. (4Risso Bradley S. Standaert D.G. Rhodes K.J. Rees H.D. Testa C.M. Levey A.I.

For immunocytochemical analyses, HEK cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 × 2 min at 48 h post-transfection and fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 10 min at 25 °C. The cells were air-dried for 15 min and then incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C. The cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with either the anti-mGluR4a antibody or with anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal IgG1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted to a final concentration of 0.15 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The primary antibody was then removed, and the cells were washed 5 × 5 min with PBS. After washing, the cells were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, B 0529) diluted to a final concentration of 2.75 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After incubation, the cells were washed 5 × 5 min with PBS and treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma, E 2761) diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark; the cells were washed 4 × 5 min with PBS, mounted with 50% glycerol solution in PBS, and photographed with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope equipped with a 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filter at a magnification of ×400. HEK cells were subcultured onto six-wells plates 1 day before transfection at 50% confluency. The cells were cotransfected with 4 μg of mGluR4a cDNA or mutant cDNAs and 4 μg of Gqi9 cDNA in the pcDNA1 vector (28Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes (Nunc) fitted with glass coverslips (Bellco Glass, Inc.) previously coated overnight at 37 °C with poly-l-ornithine (0.01%, M r 40,000; Sigma) to increase adhesion of the cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed 3 × 5 min at 37 °C in wash buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and then loaded for 45 min at 37 °C with 6 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.) dissolved in wash buffer. After loading, the cells were washed 3 × 10 min with wash buffer prior to recording. Fluorescence recordings were made on single cells using a dual excitation imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp.) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. The ATD of mGluR4 extends from the amino terminus to the first putative transmembrane domain and encompasses the initial 66 kDa of the receptor protein (Fig.1). The molecular model of the ATD of mGluR4 retains the salient characteristics of the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins. These include two domains of similar shape connected by a hinge region made up of three interdomain crossover segments (11O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar,29Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The large insertions at amino acids 1–46, 125–149, 353–401, and 426–439 that were not included in the model are all well separated from the proposed ligand-binding site located in a cavity formed between the two domains. This site is analogous to the leucine-binding site found in LIVBP. In this cavity, the agonist l-SOP is held in place by hydrogen bond interactions with both main chain and side chain atoms and complementary ionic interactions with charged residues. With the exception of hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the peptide backbone of the binding domain, these interactions can be disrupted by substituting the natural amino acids with alanine. Thus, a series of mutations were made at selected residues that were anticipated to interact directly with the ligand (Arg78, Ser159, and Thr182) and at amino acids that may be indirectly involved in binding (Ser157 and Ser181). The model predicted that Ser160 lies outside of the binding pocket, and therefore mutation of this residue to alanine was not likely to affect ligand binding. To determine whether any of the point mutations affected protein expression, immunoblots of cells transiently transfected with mGluR4a or with the R78A, S157A, S159A, S160A, S181A, or T182A mutant were probed with an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of mGluR4a. Labeled bands with relative molecular masses of ∼96 and 100 kDa, which likely correspond to the non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms of mGluR4, respectively, were observed in samples of wild-type and c-Myc-tagged mGluR4a and in all of the mutants (Fig. 2). Higher molecular mass dimers of mGluR4 were also present as previously reported in mouse cerebellum (7Pekhletski R. Gerlai R. Overstreet L. Huang X.-P. Agoypan N. Slater N.T. Roder J.C. Hampson D.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R78A mutant also showed an additional immunoreactive band at ∼90 kDa; the nature of this band is not known. Nevertheless, the intensity of the monomer bands at 96 and 100 kDa was similar to that of the wild-type receptor in all mutants including R78A, demonstrating that none of the point mutations produced any substantial alterations in the level of protein expression. The similarity in the expression levels of wild-type mGluR4a and the S157A, S160A, and S181A mutants was also indicated by the similarB max values in the radioligand binding experiments (see below). Saturation analyses ofl-[3H]AP4 binding to membranes prepared from HEK cells transfected with the wild-type mGluR4a expression plasmid showed a dissociation constant (K D ) and maximum number of binding sites (B max) of 504 nm and 8.6 pmol/mg, respectively (Fig.3 A and TableI). The dissociation constant for mGluR4a expressed in HEK cells was similar to that reported previously for mGluR4a expressed in hamster kidney cells (K D = 441 nm) (25Eriksen L. Thomsen C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3279-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in insect Sf9 cells (K D = 480 nm) (30Thomsen C. Pekhletski R. Haldeman B. Gilbert T.A. O'Hara P.J. Hampson D.R. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A modified expression vector was also constructed in which a c-Myc epitope tag was inserted immediately downstream of the proposed signal peptide (Fig.1). The insertion of the c-Myc tag at this position was done (a) to provide an extracellular antibody epitope to facilitate immunocytochemical labeling (see below) and (b) to ensure that the tag would not be cleaved by signal peptidases. c-Myc-tagged mGluR4a displayed K D andB max values of 404 nm and 8.7 pmol/mg, respectively (Fig. 3 B and Table I); neither value was significantly different (p > 0.05, one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's multiple comparison test) from that of the untagged receptor, indicating that the insertion of the epitope at this site did not affect ligand affinity or the level of expression of mGluR4a.Table IAffinity constants and maximal binding capacities from l-[ 3 H]AP4 saturation binding analyses conducted on wild-type mGluR4a, c-Myc-tagged mGluR4a, and mutant receptorsmGluR4aK DB maxnmpmol/mgWT1-aWild-type.504 ± 998.6 ± 2.9c-Myc-WT404 ± 648.7 ± 1.3S157A683 ± 526.3 ± 1.0S160A470 ± 725.0 ± 1.6S181A570 ± 524.2 ± 1.2Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three to four experiments conducted in triplicate.1-a Wild-type. Open table in a new tab Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three to four experiments conducted in triplicate. The molecular model of the ATD of mGluR4 suggests that Arg78, Ser159, and Thr182 interact directly with the glutamate ligand. When mutated to alanine, all three residues produced receptors that were nearly devoid of the ability to bind l-[3H]AP4 (Fig.4). The R78A, S159A, and T182A mutants displayed 2 ± 0.8, 5 ± 1, and 4 ± 2% (mean ± S.E. of three experiments) of control (wild-type mGluR4a) binding, respectively. Due to the very low level of binding of the radioligand, it was not possible to obtain estimates of affinities for these two mutants in saturation or competition experiments. To further probe the ligand-binding domain of mGluR4, several additional mutations were made at amino acid residues that were predicted to be in or very near the binding pocket, but not directly involved in ligand binding. Saturation experiments showed that neither the dissociation constants nor the maximum numbers of binding sites of the S157A, S160A, and S181A mutants were significantly different from those of the wild-type receptor (p > 0.05, one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's multiple comparison test) (Table I). To assess the pharmacological profile of these mutants, competition experiments were conducted using the agonists l-glutamate,l-SOP, and l-CCG-1 and the group III antagonist CPPG (31Toms N.J. Jane D.E. Kemp M.C. Bedingfield J.S. Roberts P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The rank order of potency in the S157A, S160A, and S181A mutants was similar to that observed in the wild-type receptor (l-SOP > l-CCG-1 >l-glutamate > CPPG) (Fig.5). The inhibition constants for these drugs with the S157A and S160A mutants were also similar to those seen with the wild-type receptor (Table II). However, the inhibition constants for the S181A mutant were ∼3–5 times higher than those for the wild-type receptor, indicating that this mutation produced a moderate decrease in affinity for the series of compounds tested.Table IIInhibition constants of various drugs forl-[ 3 H]AP4 binding to wild-type mGluR4a and the S157A, S160A, and S181A mutantsmGluR4aIC50l-SOPl-CCG-1l-GlutamateCPPG μmWild-type2.7 ± 0.54.0 ± 1.55.7 ± 0.524 ± 2.7S157A2.2 ± 0.52.3 ± 0.611 ± 3.610.3 ± 4.3S160A3.2 ± 0.53.8 ± 0.34.0 ± 2.621.3 ± 1.1S181A10 ± 216 ± 4.129 ± 5.369 ± 13The concentration of l-[3H]AP4 was 30 nm.

Although the results from the immunoblot experiments indicated that the R78A, S159A, and T182 mutant polypeptides were translated and expressed at levels comparable to those of the wild-type receptor, it is possible that the very low level of ligand binding of the mutants was caused by misfolding and/or lack of cell-surface expression. To investigate this possibility, an immunocytochemical analysis was carried out on the c-Myc-tagged wild-type receptor, the R78A and T182A mutant receptors, and the untagged S159A receptor. Cell-surface expression was assessed by labeling lightly fixed HEK cells (4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min) with the anti-mGluR4a or anti-c-Myc antibody, followed by a biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin conjugate. Cells expressing c-Myc-tagged wild-type mGluR4a labeled with the anti-mGluR4a antibody and treated with Triton X-100 to permeabilize the cells showed intense labeling in and particularly around the periphery of the cells, whereas similarly transfected cells not treated with Triton X-100 displayed only background labeling (Fig.6, A and B). The absence of specific immunostaining in unpermeabilized transfected cells indicates that the fixation protocol used (without Triton X-100 treatment) did not cause permeabilization of the cells.

Here, we report that the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα is phosphorylated at Ser609; this was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphopeptide antibody, anti-pS609, that specifically recognizes the GPIbα C-terminal sequence S606GHSL610 only when Ser609 is phosphorylated. Immunoabsorption with anti-pS609 removed almost all of the GPIbα from platelet lysates, indicating a high proportion of GPIbα phosphorylation. Anti-pS609 inhibited GPIb-IX binding to the intracellular signaling molecule, 14-3-3ζ. Dephosphorylation of GPIb-IX with potato acid phosphatase inhibited anti-pS609 binding and also 14-3-3ζ binding. A synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the GPIbα C-terminal sequence (SIRYSGHpSL), but not a nonphosphorylated identical peptide, abolished GPIb-IX binding to 14-3-3ζ. Thus, phosphorylation at Ser609 of GPIbα is important for 14-3-3ζ binding to GPIb-IX. In certain regions of spreading platelets, particularly at the periphery, there was a reduction in GPIbα staining by anti-pS609 as observed under a confocal microscope, indicating that a subpopulation of GPIbα molecules in these regions is dephosphorylated. These data suggest that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser609 of GPIbα regulates GPIb-IX interaction with 14-3-3 and may play important roles in the process of platelet adhesion and spreading.

Platelets in normal circulation are in a resting, nonadherent state. At sites of vascular injury, platelets adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether 14-3-3 binding is regulated by phosphorylation of these serine residues, as 14-3-3 can interact with synthetic nonphosphorylated peptides corresponding to GPIbα cytoplasmic domain (11Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Further, GPIbα has been thought to be a nonphosphorylated protein because previous studies failed to show phosphorylation of GPIbα (30Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we re-examined phosphorylation states of GPIbα using a phosphoserine-specific anti-GPIbα antibody. We report here that the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα is phosphorylated at Ser609 and that phosphorylation at this site is important for 14-3-3 binding to intact platelet GPIb-IX. Furthermore, we show that GPIbα dephosphorylation occurs at the edge of spreading platelets, suggesting that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser609 in the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα is involved in regulating GPIb-IX functions during platelet adhesion and spreading.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide the first evidence that GPIbα is phosphorylated and that a phosphorylation site is at Ser609. Previously, phosphorylation of platelet membrane proteins has been studied (30Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only serine/threonine-phosphorylated major membrane glycoprotein identified was GPIbβ (30Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GPIbβ is phosphorylated at Thr166 when platelets are stimulated with agents that enhance intracellular cAMP level (36Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wardell M.R. Reynolds C.C. Berndt M.C. Wallace R.W. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15656-15661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous studies used a 32P labeling technique to detect protein phosphorylation, which is dependent upon incorporation of exogenous 32P into the phosphorylated proteins and thus is not sensitive to phosphoproteins that are protected from dephosphorylation or rephosphorylation during the procedure. In this study, we used an anti-phosphopeptide antibody, anti-pS609, recognizing the SGHpSL sequence at the C terminus of GPIbα but not the nonphosphorylated peptide. The phosphorylation-dependent antibody can be used to detect protein phosphorylation whether or not phosphorylation is metabolically active and thus is capable of detecting GPIbα phosphorylation that has not been detected by the 32P labeling technique. Use of the phosphorylation-dependent antibody also enabled us to detect phosphorylation at a specific residue. Two serine residues (Ser606 and Ser609) are present at the C-terminal SGHSL region of GPIbα, which is important for 14-3-3 binding (29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We showed that the phosphoserine 609-specific antibody, anti-pS609, specifically bound to platelet GPIbα and that its binding was inhibited by dephosphorylation of GPIb-IX with potato acid phosphatase. In addition, an antibody raised against the phosphorylated Ser606-containing sequence (SIRYpSGH) did not react with GPIbα from resting platelets (data not shown). These data indicates that the C-terminal domain of GPIbα is phosphorylated at Ser609.Phosphorylation states of proteins are balanced by the actions of protein kinases and phosphatases. In platelet lysates, the percentage of phosphorylated GPIbα in the whole GPIb-IX population is high, as indicated by the removal of nearly all GPIb-IX by the anti-phosphopeptide antibody (Fig. 3 A); this suggests that balance under these conditions is tilted toward phosphorylation of GPIbα. Thus, it appears that, unlike many other phosphoproteins, the default state of GPIbα is a phosphorylated state. One possible mechanism for this default phosphorylation state is that 14-3-3 may play a protective role, since the phosphoserine 609 is located in the 14-3-3 binding site. 14-3-3 has previously been shown to protect 14-3-3 ligands from dephosphorylation (38Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of GPIbα remains to be identified. Several protein kinase inhibitors had no effect on GPIbα phosphorylation, including inhibitors of protein kinase A, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C (data not shown). It is thus possible that these kinases are not involved in GPIbα phosphorylation. However, as the default state of GPIbα appears to be a phosphorylated form, it is also possible that the ineffectiveness of these protein kinase inhibitors is due to the fact that GPIbα is already in a relatively stable phosphorylated state and thus immune to the effects of protein kinase inhibitors.Phosphorylation at Ser609 of GPIbα is important for GPIb-IX interaction with 14-3-3. This conclusion is supported by our finding that the Ser609-phosphorylated GPIbα C-terminal domain peptide (SIRYSGHpSL), but not the identical nonphosphorylated or Ser606-phosphorylated peptides, inhibited GPIb-IX interaction with 14-3-3 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6), suggesting that interaction between GPIb-IX and 14-3-3 involves a binding site in 14-3-3 that interacts with the Ser609-phosphorylated GPIbα C-terminal sequence. This result is consistent with the previous result of Andrews et al. (11Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showing that a nonphosphorylated GPIbα C-terminal peptide failed to abolish the binding between 14-3-3 and GPIb-IX. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of GPIb-IX by PAP or preincubation with anti-pS609 inhibited 14-3-3 binding (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, it is likely that high affinity interaction between the intact platelet GPIb-IX and 14-3-3 requires phosphorylation of Ser609 of GPIbα. It is interesting to note that the 14-3-3 binding site of GPIbα (RYSGHSL) shares similarities with the RSXpSXP-like motifs of other phosphorylated 14-3-3 ligands; they all contain an arginine and a serine at the N-terminal side of the phosphorylated serine (27Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar,28Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Most of the identified RSXpSXP motifs are present in the middle of the protein sequence, and the proline in the motif may possibly form a turn exposing the phosphoserine. Because the 14-3-3 binding site in GPIbα is already exposed at the C terminus, it may not require the presence of a proline residue. However, despite the similarities, there are striking differences between GPIbα and the RSXpSXP-like ligands. The prototype RSXpSXP-like ligand of 14-3-3, c-Raf, requires the helix G region of 14-3-3 (33Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure data suggest that phosphoserine in the RSXpSXP motif may interact with residues in the more N-terminal helix C and E region of 14-3-3 (28Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 39Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, GPIbα binds to the helix I region of 14-3-3 (33Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which forms an amphiphilic ligand contact surface (40Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, synthetic peptides corresponding to C-terminal 15 residues of GPIbα bound to 14-3-3 without requiring phosphorylation (11Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the recombinant GPIbα cytoplasmic domain, which is not phosphorylated at Ser609 (data not shown), also binds to 14-3-3 but with a much lower affinity than GPIb-IX from platelets (33Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction of 14-3-3 with GPIbα may involve both phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent binding mechanisms. However, in intact platelet GPIb-IX, Ser609 phosphorylation is required for the high affinity binding of 14-3-3.Phosphorylation of the Ser609 of GPIbα is likely to play important roles in GPIb-IX-mediated platelet adhesion and signaling. First, phosphorylation of Ser609 of GPIbα regulates 14-3-3 binding (Figs. 4 and 5), and we have evidence that 14-3-3 binding to GPIb-IX plays an important role in GPIb-IX signaling. 2M. Gu, R. J. Bodnar, Z. Li, G. D. Englund, and X. Du, unpublished data. Furthermore, our data indicate that a population of GPIbα becomes dephosphorylated at the periphery of platelets during platelet spreading on vWF or fibrinogen (Fig. 7), suggesting that the phosphorylation state of GPIbα can be dynamically regulated and that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of GPIbα may have a functional role during platelet spreading. Although further studies are required to understand how phosphorylation of GPIbα may play a role in GPIb-IX function, one possibility is that phosphorylation regulates GPIb-IX-associated membrane skeleton organization and thus regulates the movement of GPIb-IX. This possibility is supported by the finding of Dong et al. (41Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Sae T.G. Hyun W. Afshar K.V. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that a GPIb-IX mutant, lacking the C-terminal 4 amino acid residues including Ser609 is more likely to move laterally on the membrane. However, we show in Fig. 3 that Ser609-phosphorylated GPIbα is distributed in both cytoskeleton and non-cytoskeleton fractions, suggesting that Ser609 phosphorylation does not directly regulate association between GPIb-IX and the membrane skeleton. Consistent with this result, GPIb-IX association with the membrane skeleton has been shown to be mediated by filamin, which binds to the central region of the GPIbα cytoplasmic domain distinct from the C terminus (7Andrews R.K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant GPIb-IX that lacks the C-terminal domain of GPIbα is still associated with filamin and the membrane skeleton (42Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that GPIb-IX-associated cytoskeleton organization or movement of GPIb-IX may be indirectly regulated by phosphorylation of GPIbα and 14-3-3 binding via intracellular signaling pathways. Platelet adhesion plays a critical role in thrombosis and hemostasis. Platelets in normal circulation are in a resting, nonadherent state. At sites of vascular injury, platelets adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix. Under the high shear force of blood flow, platelet adhesion involves multiple steps. Initially, platelets adhere in a reversible manner (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the interaction between a platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor (vWF),1 the glycoprotein Ib-IX complex (GPIb-IX), and matrix-bound vWF (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 2Sakariassen K.S. Bolhuis P.A. Sixma J.J.

Haematol. 1986; 63: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). GPIb-IX interaction with vWF mediates signaling leading to activation of integrins that are responsible for platelet spreading and aggregation (1Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 4Weiss H.J. Turitto V.T. Baumgartner H.R. Blood. 1986; 67: 322-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPIb-IX consists of three subunits: GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX. GPIb-IX is loosely associated with glycoprotein V. The N-terminal domain of GPIbα contains binding sites for vWF and thrombin (for reviews see Refs. 5Ware J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 6Lopez J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα contains a binding site (residues 536–568 (7Andrews R.K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for filamin (also calledactin-binding protein or ABP-280), which links GPIb-IX to cross-linked actin filamental structures underlying the plasma membrane (the membrane skeleton) (8Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11970-11977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We found that an intracellular signaling molecule, 14-3-3ζ, is associated with GPIb-IX (10Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A binding site for 14-3-3ζ is located in a 15-amino acid residue serine-rich region (residues 595–610) at the C terminus of GPIbα (29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binding also involves an additional 14-3-3 binding site in GPIbβ (11Andrews R.K. Harris S.J.

Furthermore, dephosphorylation of GPIb-IX by PAP or preincubation with anti-pS609 inhibited 14-3-3 binding (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, it is likely that high affinity interaction between the intact platelet GPIb-IX and 14-3-3 requires phosphorylation of Ser609 of GPIbα. It is interesting to note that the 14-3-3 binding site of GPIbα (RYSGHSL) shares similarities with the RSXpSXP-like motifs of other phosphorylated 14-3-3 ligands; they all contain an arginine and a serine at the N-terminal side of the phosphorylated serine (27Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar,28Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Most of the identified RSXpSXP motifs are present in the middle of the protein sequence, and the proline in the motif may possibly form a turn exposing the phosphoserine. Because the 14-3-3 binding site in GPIbα is already exposed at the C terminus, it may not require the presence of a proline residue. However, despite the similarities, there are striking differences between GPIbα and the RSXpSXP-like ligands. The prototype RSXpSXP-like ligand of 14-3-3, c-Raf, requires the helix G region of 14-3-3 (33Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure data suggest that phosphoserine in the RSXpSXP motif may interact with residues in the more N-terminal helix C and E region of 14-3-3 (28Yaffe M.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which forms an amphiphilic ligand contact surface (40Petosa C. Masters S.C. Bankston L.A. Pohl J. Wang B. Fu H. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16305-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, synthetic peptides corresponding to C-terminal 15 residues of GPIbα bound to 14-3-3 without requiring phosphorylation (11Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the recombinant GPIbα cytoplasmic domain, which is not phosphorylated at Ser609 (data not shown), also binds to 14-3-3 but with a much lower affinity than GPIb-IX from platelets (33Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction of 14-3-3 with GPIbα may involve both phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent binding mechanisms. However, in intact platelet GPIb-IX, Ser609 phosphorylation is required for the high affinity binding of 14-3-3.Phosphorylation of the Ser609 of GPIbα is likely to play important roles in GPIb-IX-mediated platelet adhesion and signaling. First, phosphorylation of Ser609 of GPIbα regulates 14-3-3 binding (Figs. 4 and 5), and we have evidence that 14-3-3 binding to GPIb-IX plays an important role in GPIb-IX signaling. 2M. Gu, R. J. Bodnar, Z. Li, G. D. Englund, and X. Du, unpublished data. Furthermore, our data indicate that a population of GPIbα becomes dephosphorylated at the periphery of platelets during platelet spreading on vWF or fibrinogen (Fig. 7), suggesting that the phosphorylation state of GPIbα can be dynamically regulated and that phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of GPIbα may have a functional role during platelet spreading. Although further studies are required to understand how phosphorylation of GPIbα may play a role in GPIb-IX function, one possibility is that phosphorylation regulates GPIb-IX-associated membrane skeleton organization and thus regulates the movement of GPIb-IX. This possibility is supported by the finding of Dong et al. (41Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Sae T.G. Hyun W. Afshar K.V. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that a GPIb-IX mutant, lacking the C-terminal 4 amino acid residues including Ser609 is more likely to move laterally on the membrane. However, we show in Fig. 3 that Ser609-phosphorylated GPIbα is distributed in both cytoskeleton and non-cytoskeleton fractions, suggesting that Ser609 phosphorylation does not directly regulate association between GPIb-IX and the membrane skeleton. Consistent with this result, GPIb-IX association with the membrane skeleton has been shown to be mediated by filamin, which binds to the central region of the GPIbα cytoplasmic domain distinct from the C terminus (7Andrews R.K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18605-18611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant GPIb-IX that lacks the C-terminal domain of GPIbα is still associated with filamin and the membrane skeleton (42Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that GPIb-IX-associated cytoskeleton organization or movement of GPIb-IX may be indirectly regulated by phosphorylation of GPIbα and 14-3-3 binding via intracellular signaling pathways. In this study, we provide the first evidence that GPIbα is phosphorylated and that a phosphorylation site is at Ser609. Previously, phosphorylation of platelet membrane proteins has been studied (30Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only serine/threonine-phosphorylated major membrane glycoprotein identified was GPIbβ (30Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GPIbβ is phosphorylated at Thr166 when platelets are stimulated with agents that enhance intracellular cAMP level (36Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wardell M.R. Reynolds C.C. Berndt M.C. Wallace R.W. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15656-15661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous studies used a 32P labeling technique to detect protein phosphorylation, which is dependent upon incorporation of exogenous 32P into the phosphorylated proteins and thus is not sensitive to phosphoproteins that are protected from dephosphorylation or rephosphorylation during the procedure. In this study, we used an anti-phosphopeptide antibody, anti-pS609, recognizing the SGHpSL sequence at the C terminus of GPIbα but not the nonphosphorylated peptide. The phosphorylation-dependent antibody can be used to detect protein phosphorylation whether or not phosphorylation is metabolically active and thus is capable of detecting GPIbα phosphorylation that has not been detected by the 32P labeling technique. Use of the phosphorylation-dependent antibody also enabled us to detect phosphorylation at a specific residue. Two serine residues (Ser606 and Ser609) are present at the C-terminal SGHSL region of GPIbα, which is important for 14-3-3 binding (29Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We showed that the phosphoserine 609-specific antibody, anti-pS609, specifically bound to platelet GPIbα and that its binding was inhibited by dephosphorylation of GPIb-IX with potato acid phosphatase. In addition, an antibody raised against the phosphorylated Ser606-containing sequence (SIRYpSGH) did not react with GPIbα from resting platelets (data not shown). These data indicates that the C-terminal domain of GPIbα is phosphorylated at Ser609. Phosphorylation states of proteins are balanced by the actions of protein kinases and phosphatases. In platelet lysates, the percentage of phosphorylated GPIbα in the whole GPIb-IX population is high, as indicated by the removal of nearly all GPIb-IX by the anti-phosphopeptide antibody (Fig. 3 A); this suggests that balance under these conditions is tilted toward phosphorylation of GPIbα. Thus, it appears that, unlike many other phosphoproteins, the default state of GPIbα is a phosphorylated state. One possible mechanism for this default phosphorylation state is that 14-3-3 may play a protective role, since the phosphoserine 609 is located in the 14-3-3 binding site. 14-3-3 has previously been shown to protect 14-3-3 ligands from dephosphorylation (38Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of GPIbα remains to be identified. Several protein kinase inhibitors had no effect on GPIbα phosphorylation, including inhibitors of protein kinase A, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C (data not shown). It is thus possible that these kinases are not involved in GPIbα phosphorylation. However, as the default state of GPIbα appears to be a phosphorylated form, it is also possible that the ineffectiveness of these protein kinase inhibitors is due to the fact that GPIbα is already in a relatively stable phosphorylated state and thus immune to the effects of protein kinase inhibitors. Phosphorylation at Ser609 of GPIbα is important for GPIb-IX interaction with 14-3-3. This conclusion is supported by our finding that the Ser609-phosphorylated GPIbα C-terminal domain peptide (SIRYSGHpSL), but not the identical nonphosphorylated or Ser606-phosphorylated peptides, inhibited GPIb-IX interaction with 14-3-3 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6), suggesting that interaction between GPIb-IX and 14-3-3 involves a binding site in 14-3-3 that interacts with the Ser609-phosphorylated GPIbα C-terminal sequence. This result is consistent with the previous result of Andrews et al. (11Andrews R.K. Harris S.J. McNally T. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showing that a nonphosphorylated GPIbα C-terminal peptide failed to abolish the binding between 14-3-3 and GPIb-IX. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of GPIb-IX by PAP or preincubation with anti-pS609 inhibited 14-3-3 binding (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, it is likely that high affinity interaction between the intact platelet GPIb-IX and 14-3-3 requires phosphorylation of Ser609 of GPIbα. It is interesting to note that the 14-3-3 binding site of GPIbα (RYSGHSL) shares similarities with the RSXpSXP-like motifs of other phosphorylated 14-3-3 ligands; they all contain an arginine and a serine at the N-terminal side of the phosphorylated serine (27Muslin A.J.

Most of the identified RSXpSXP motifs are present in the middle of the protein sequence, and the proline in the motif may possibly form a turn exposing the phosphoserine. Because the 14-3-3 binding site in GPIbα is already exposed at the C terminus, it may not require the presence of a proline residue. However, despite the similarities, there are striking differences between GPIbα and the RSXpSXP-like ligands. The prototype RSXpSXP-like ligand of 14-3-3, c-Raf, requires the helix G region of 14-3-3 (33Gu M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure data suggest that phosphoserine in the RSXpSXP motif may interact with residues in the more N-terminal helix C and E region of 14-3-3 (28Yaffe M.B.

Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33465-33471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction of 14-3-3 with GPIbα may involve both phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent binding mechanisms.

Although much knowledge has accumulated on the mechanism of the heat shock response, the cold shock response of living cells was discovered only a decade ago (1Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 2Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol.

When the temperature is shifted from 37 to 10 °C, bacterial cells express a specific subset of proteins (2Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This subset in Escherichia coli consists of more than 14 different proteins involved in various cellular processes and includes NusA, IF2, polynucleotide phosphorylase, RecA, H-NS, GyrA, RbfA, and several other unidentified proteins (3Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 4Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The dominant fraction of this subset is the so-called major cold shock protein CspA, a protein of 70 amino acid residues (4Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Its induction level increases dramatically (5Brandi A. Spurio R. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L.

Using the cspA gene as a probe, several other homologous genes named cspC, cspD,cspE, cspF, cspG, cspH, andcspI have been identified; however, only some of these genes code for cold shock-inducible proteins (7Wang N.

The cold shock response in Bacillus subtilis is also accompanied by an increased levels in CspB, a small acidic protein highly homologous to CspA of E. coli (16Willimsky G. Bang H. Fischer G. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The biological function and induction mechanism of the CspB protein is not yet clear; however, preferential binding to particular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1 sequences has been demonstrated (17Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The structure of CspB has been determined both in crystal (18Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and in the solution (19Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and consists of five β-strands organized into an antiparallel β-barrel. Six aromatic residues (Phe15, Phe17, Phe27, Phe30, Phe38, and Trp8) and five positively charged amino acid residues (His29, Lys7, Lys13, Lys39, and Arg56) are located on the same side of the CspB molecule. Amino acid substitutions at these positions have pronounced effects on CspB binding to ssDNA as measured in gel retardation experiments (17Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ssDNA binding activity of CspB has been tested exclusively in gel retardation experiments. These results have established that there is preferential binding of the protein to the ssDNA containing Y-box sequence ATTGG (20Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments have shown that binding of CspB to ssDNA is not limited to ATTGG; however, no unique recognition sequences have been identified (17Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this paper we studied the interactions of the B. subtilismajor cold shock protein CspB with ssDNA templates addressing the question of whether these interactions depend on the base composition of the template. Using a combination of four different techniques (fluorescence spectroscopy, gel shift mobility assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, and analytical ultracentrifugation) we show that CspB has a preference for polypyrimidine ssDNA templates. CspB seems to bind both C- and T-based ssDNA templates; however, the underlying mechanisms of these interactions appear to be very different. Binding of CspB to C-based ssDNA is strongly salt-dependent, indicating the involvement of a large electrostatic component in the interactions. In contrast, interactions of CspB with T-based ssDNA templates are independent of salt concentration and are characterized by an apparent binding constant in the nanomolar range. Protein purification was modified from that described previously (21Schindelin H. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 14: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, CspB was purified from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (22Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), which contained the overexpression plasmid pCSPB3 carrying the gene of CspB under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Cells were grown to an optical density ∼0.8 optical units at 600 nm at 37 °C in 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. CspB production was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm) and incubated for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,500 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and passed twice through a French pressure cell. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of resuspension buffer and applied on Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column (2 × 10 cm). After washing, the bound protein was eluted in a linear salt gradient (0–0.5m NaCl). The CspB-containing fractions were eluted at ∼150 mm NaCl, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. Lyophilized protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl and applied on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 100 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted from the column. The CspB containing fractions were dialyzed extensively against water, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The purity of the protein was higher that 95% as judged from Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The concentration of CspB was measured spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient ε280 = 5690 m−1cm−1 (23Makhatadze G.I. Marahiel M.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2144-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Corrections for light scattering were taken into account as described (24Winder A.F. Gent W.L. Biopolymers. 1971; 10: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ssDNA oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX) and purified on a Mono-Q column (HR 10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% acetonitrile. The ssDNA bound to the column was eluted with a shallow salt gradient prepared from equilibration buffer and equilibration buffer containing 1m NaCl. The fractions of interest, eluted at ∼0.5m NaCl, were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. Lyophilized ssDNA was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, dialyzed against the same buffer, aliquoted in small volumes, and stored at −20 °C. The ssDNA concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm. The extinction coefficients for individual ssDNA were estimated using the following extinction coefficients for individual nucleotides (25Wallace R.B. Miyada C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar): 8,400m−1 cm−1 (dT), 12,010m−1 cm−1 (dG), 7,050m−1 cm−1 (dC), and 15,200m−1 cm−1 (dA). Because guanine-based oligodeoxynucleotides are known to form oligomers, only a limited number of experiments were performed using 23G and 23pG templates. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a FluoroMax spectrofluorometer with DM3000F software. Constant temperature during the experiments was maintained using a thermostated cell holder connected to a circulated water bath. The CspB concentration was 0.3 μm (equilibrium titrations) or 14 μm (stoichiometric titrations) in 50 mmTris-HCl pH 7.5 buffer, containing either 100 mm NaCl (normal experimental conditions) or 1 m NaCl (high salt buffer). Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 287 nm (under equilibrium conditions) or 300 nm (under stoichiometric conditions), and the emission was recorded at 349 nm. The experiments were performed at 25 °C (when not otherwise specified), and the initial volume in the cuvette was 1.1 ml. The solution was gently stirred during the titration, and the measured intensity values were corrected for sample dilution. Inner filter effects were taken into account, and blanks were subtracted. Because it is known that poly(dG) can form oligomers, the control experiments at lower concentrations of G-based templates have been performed, but no difference was found. 150 pmol of ssDNA were 5′ 32P end-labeled by incubating templates with T4 polynucleotide kinase (3 μl), T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (New England Biolabs), and 0.03 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) in a total volume of 60 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation (30 min at 65 °C). Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed with QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). The binding reaction was routinely performed by incubating 10 pmol of labeled ssDNA with different amounts of protein (total volume, 25 μl) at room temperature for 25 min in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2); however, incubation for shorter (10 min) or longer (60 min) periods of time did not produce appreciable changed in the retardation patterns. 5 μl of dye solution (20% glycerol, 0.034% bromphenol blue) were added to the samples prior to gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresis was performed in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) buffer through a 22.5% acrylamide gel at 75 volts until the samples had entered the gel and then at 100 volts overnight. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing gels to a Kodak MR-2 film for 0.5–2 h at room temperature. ITC experiments were performed using a titration microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northhampton, MA). Protein and ssDNA were dialyzed simultaneously in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl buffer. The protein concentration was 14 μm in a 1.34-ml cell volume, and 4 μl of ssDNA were sequentially injected into the protein solution until no further heat effects were observed. As a control, identical additions of ssDNA were injected into the buffer to measure the heat of dilution. The heat of the reaction was obtained by integrating the peak after each injection of ssDNA ligand using Origin software provided by the manufacturer. Because the CspB-ssDNA binding was stoichiometric under our experimental conditions, ΔH cal was calculated by summing individual heat increments and dividing by the total number of moles of CspB present in the solution. Thus ΔH cal is expressed per mole of CspB molecules. Analytical centrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-A centrifuge. For each run three cells were used: one containing ssDNA only (2 μm for 23pT or 2.5 μm 23pC), another with CspB only (20-fold higher protein concentration than ssDNA), and a third containing CspB-ssDNA complex with the same concentrations of CspB and ssDNA as in the other cells. The CspB-ssDNA complex was formed by incubating CspB and ssDNA at room temperature for 25 min prior to each run. The runs were performed at 4 °C under different speed (20,000 or 25,000 rpm) for 10 h. Absorbances were recorded simultaneously at 260 and 280 nm during the runs. The partial molar volumes for CspB, ssDNA (23pT and 23pC), CspB-23pT complex, and CspB-23pC complex were 0.74, 0.55, 0.69, and 0.65 cm3/g, respectively, calculated as described (26Cohen G. Eisenberg H. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1077-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Makhatadze G.I. Medvedkin V.N. Privalov P.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data was performed using the Beckman supplied script for Origin (MicroCal Inc.) software. The binding isotherms obtained by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence intensity upon titration of CspB with ssDNA template was analyzed according to the following classical binding equation (29Wyman G. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Book, Mill Village, CA1990Google Scholar). Q=QmaxA-A2-4·np·[CspB]Total·[ssDNA]Total2·[CspB]TotalEquation 1 where A = [CspB]Total +n p·[ssDNA]Total + 1/K aind, Q is the quenching effect of CspB Trp fluorescence intensity after each addition of ssDNA, Q max is the maximum quenching obtained upon complete saturation of the protein with ssDNA, [CspB]Total and [ssDNA]Total are the total concentrations of protein and ssDNA in solution, respectively,K aind is the equilibrium association constant for the CspB-ssDNA interactions, andn p is the number of molecules of CspB bound per molecule of ssDNA. One needs to keep in mind that for protein-DNA interactions when more than one molecule of protein binds to DNA, theK aind obtained from Equation1 represents an apparent equilibrium constant because this model does not consider the degeneracy of the binding site on nucleic acid. In the case of single binding site, this binding model is exact and has been successfully used for the analysis of protein-ssDNA interactions (30Ferrari M.E. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 106-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Data analysis was also performed according to the model originally introduced by Epstein (31Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This model is a particular case of the model of McGhee and von Hippel (32McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) for the short templates and takes into account the fact that for homogeneous template the binding site can be formed by any continuous segment with a given number of bases. According to Epstein (31Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the fractional saturation of the lattice (θ) is defined as follows. θ=n·k̄/MEquation 2 where n is the binding site size, M is the length of the ssDNA, and k̄ is the average number of bound ligands expressed as follows. k―=∑k=0g∑j=0k-1k·PM(k,j)·(KaEps·[CspB]Free)k·ωj1+∑k=0g∑j=0k-1PM·(k,j)·(KaEps·[CspB]Free)k·ωjEquation 3 where k, g, and j represent the number of ligands bound, the maximum number of ligands that can bind to the lattice, and the number of adjacencies, respectively.K aEps and ω are the equilibrium association constant and the cooperativity parameter for the interaction, respectively. Finally, P M is the number of distinct ways that k n-site ligands may bind to an M-site lattice with j adjacencies and is calculated as follows. PM(k,j)=(M−n·k+1)!(k−1)!(M−n·k−k+j+1)!(k−j)!j!(k−j−1)!Equation 4 θ is related to the binding density of the ligand on the lattice, ν (in mole of ligand per mole of nucleotide base), as shown in Equation 5 (33Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). θ=n·vEquation 5 where ν relates to the quenching as follows. υ=(QQmax)·([CspB]Total[ssDNA]Total)Equation 6 Combining Equations 2, 5, and 6 we obtain Q=Qmax·([ssDNA]Total[CspB]Total)·1M·k―Equation 7 where Q, [CspB]Total, and [ssDNA]Total are experimentally attainable parameters. Fit of the experimental data to Equation 7 was performed using a nonlinear least square software package NLREG. A number of aromatic (Trp8, Phe17, Phe17, Phe27, and Phe30) and basic (Lys7, Lys13, and His29) residues of CspB have been proposed to be involved in the interactions with the single-stranded DNA molecules (17Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Of these, Trp8 presents a useful probe to monitor ssDNA-CspB interactions by measuring the changes in the protein fluorescence intensity as a function of ssDNA concentration. Fig.1 presents changes in Trp fluorescence intensity of CspB at 25 °C upon titration with three different single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, 43YB+, 43YB−, and 43NS (Table I). These oligodeoxynucleotides represent shorter forms of the sequences used previously in gel shift experiments (18Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A.

Based on these gel shift mobility assays, it has been shown that CspB binds to ssDNA containing the Y-box motif, with higher preference to the (+)-strand-containing ATTGG core sequence than to the (-)-strand-containing CCAAT core sequence or the “nonspecific” sequence that contains neither the ATTGG nor the CCAAT sequence. The results presented in Fig. 1 agree with this conclusion, i.e.quenching CspB Trp fluorescence intensity occurs at lower concentrations of 43YB+ than for 43YB− or the control nonspecific 43NS template. Nevertheless, all three single-stranded templates quench the CspB Trp fluorescence, thus indicating that CspB interacts with all three of them. This is in agreement with the gel shift experiments in which just 2–3-fold higher concentration of CspB was needed to observe complete retardation of the YB− and NS templates as compared with the YB+template (18Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrler M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A.

The quenching effects on the CspB Trp fluorescence intensity upon titration with 23T, 23G, 23C, or 23A at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 2 A. Surprisingly, under our experimental solvent conditions (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) there is a significant difference in the titration profiles. Changes in the fluorescence quenching reach saturation at 0.2 μm of 23T template. In the case of 23C ssDNA template saturation is reached at >1 μm, whereas 23A and 23G templates do not produce changes in the fluorescence quenching of CspB (Fig. 2 A). In control experiments we measured the changes in the Trp fluorescence of CspB as a function of concentrations of A-, T-, G-, or C-based oligodeoxynucleotides that lacked the core ATTGG sequence,i.e. 23pA, 23pT, 23pG, and 23pC (Table I). We observe that, except for the 23C and 23pC, quenching of the protein Trp fluorescence is independent of the ATTGG core sequence (Fig. 2 A). Notably, the total quenching of CspB Trp fluorescence by 23T and 23pT is much larger than for the other oligodeoxynucleotides and takes place at very low ssDNA concentration. The lower quenching effect observed for 23pC could be due to the stacking interactions of the C-bases at the pH of our experiment (7.5) (35Inman R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 9: 624-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, fluorescence experiments performed at pH 8.1, where no stacking is expected, did not differ from the titration curve obtained at pH 7.5 (data not shown). The quenching of fluorescence intensity of Trp8 does occur because of the direct interactions of CspB with ssDNA templates. This can be demonstrated by measuring the changes in the fluorescence intensity ofN-acetyl-tryptophan-amide upon addition of different amounts of 23T, 23A, and 23C (up to 0.5, 0.9, and 1.4 μm, respectively). Under the same experimental conditions titrations with these ssDNA templates did not lead to appreciable quenching ofN-acetyl-tryptophan-amide fluorescence intensity (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that the quenching of the CspB intrinsic Trp fluorescence by ssDNA templates, as it was shown for other protein-DNA complexes (36Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is entirely due to direct interactions and does not have contribution from simple collision of these molecules. Additional evidence for this conclusion follows from the gel shift experiments. Fig. 3 presents the results of the mobility shift assay on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels for 23T, 23pT, and 23pC ssDNA templates. This assay allows separation of free ssDNA from the CspB bound ssDNA by retardation of electrophoretic mobility. CspB-ssDNA complexes were formed at varying concentrations of CspB incubated with invariant amounts of 5′32P-labeled ssDNA templates. Increase of the concentration of CspB leads to appearance of the distinctly migrating band corresponding to the CspB-ssDNA complex. It is evident that 23T and 23pT ssDNA templates behave almost identically (in agreement with the fluorescence experiments; Fig. 2), and complete retardation is observed at a CspB:ssDNA ratio of 8:1 (Fig. 3). On the other hand, when 23pC is used as much as 200:1 ratio of CspB to ssDNA is required for complete shift of the band corresponding to free ssDNA (Fig. 3). Similar experiments using 23A as the template showed no appreciable ssDNA retardation even at a 300:1 ratio (data not shown). Comparison of the gel retardation experiments with the results of the Trp fluorescence titration of CspB with ssDNA templates (Fig. 2) shows that there is a clear correlation between these two data sets. The degree of Trp quenching as a function of ssDNA concentrations correlates well with the CspB-ssDNA ratio required for the complete retardation in the gel shift assay, thus confirming that quenching of the CspB intrinsic Trp fluorescence by ssDNA results from the direct interactions of the ssDNA with the protein. It is also notable that the T-based ssDNA templates 23T and 23pT behave similarly and seem to have the highest affinity for CspB. Further characterization of the thermodynamics of formation CspB-ssDNA complexes was done using ITC. This technique measures directly the heat of the interactions at a given temperature. The change in the heat of the reaction as a function of ligand concentration contains all the information on the thermodynamic parameters of interactions in the system including the stoichiometry and binding constant (67Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Because in many cases the heat of the reaction is relatively small, ITC experiments are generally performed at relatively high concentrations of protein or ligand. Fig.4 A presents the typical ITC recording of 15 injections (4 μl each) of 23pT (220 μm) into the cell containing 14 μm CspB at 25 °C. The reaction is exothermic, and each addition of 23pT leads to a lower amount of heat released until the reaction is saturated. After integration of each peak and normalization for CspB concentration, the heat of the reaction is plotted versus the ligand (ssDNA) concentration (Fig. 4 B). It is notable that in the case of 23pT the titration profile shown on Fig. 4 B is very steep, indicating that under these concentrations of CspB and 23pT binding is stoichiometric (strong). This enables an estimate of the stoichiometry of binding as the ssDNA to CspB ratio at which the break point on the titration profile occurs. From the profile for 23pT-CspB shown on Fig.4 B, it appears that the break point occurs at the ration of 23pT to CspB of ∼0.3, i.e. the stoichiometry o"

Plasmids carrying the fusion proteins were transiently or stably introduced into COS7 cells, and the subcellular distribution of the fusion proteins was examined. GFP-tagged wild-type VDRs were located predominantly in nuclei but with a significant cytoplasmic presence, while GFP alone was equally distributed throughout the cells. 10<sup>−8</sup>m1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> promoted the nuclear import of VDR in a few hours. To identify the NLS, we constructed several mutated VDRs fused to GFP. Mutant VDRs that did not bind to DNA were also localized predominantly in nuclei, while the deletion of the hinge region resulted in the loss of preference for nucleus. A short segment of 20 amino acids in the hinge region enabled cytoplasmic GFP-tagged alkaline phosphatase to translocate to nuclei. These results indicate that 1) VDR is located predominantly in nuclei with a significant presence in cytoplasm without the ligand and 2) an NLS consisting of 20 amino acids in the hinge region facilitates the transfer of VDR to the nucleus."

The mechanism causing the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in direct proportion to the strength of stimulation is unresolved. We investigated the properties of quantal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release evoked by activation of RyR in PC12 cells, and in particular whether the sensitivity of RyR to the agonist caffeine was altered by lumenal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Quantal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was observed in cells stimulated with 1 to 40 mm caffeine, a range of caffeine concentrations giving a >10-fold change in lumenal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> load of the caffeine-sensitive stores was modulated by allowing them to refill for varying times after complete discharge with maximal caffeine, or by depolarizing the cells with K<sup>+</sup> to enhance their normal steady-state loading. The threshold for RyR activation was sensitized ∼10-fold as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> load increased from a minimal to a maximal loading. In addition, the fraction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released by low caffeine concentrations increased. Our data suggest that RyR are sensitive to lumenal Ca<sup>2+</sup> over the full range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads that can be achieved in an intact PC12 cell, and that changes in RyR sensitivity may be responsible for the termination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release underlying the quantal effect."
https://openalex.org/W2033298922,"Approximately 30% of the iron contained in a bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase preparation was removed by crystallization, giving a molecular extinction coefficient 1.25–1.4 times higher than those reported thus far. Six electron equivalents provided by dithionite were required for complete reduction of the crystalline cytochrome c oxidase preparation. The fully reduced enzyme was oxidized with 4 oxidation equivalents provided by molecular oxygen, giving an absorption spectrum slightly, but significantly, different from that of the original fully oxidized form. Four electron equivalents were required for complete reduction of the O2-oxidized enzyme. The O2-oxidized form, when exposed to excess amounts of O2, was converted to the original oxidized form which required 6 electrons for complete reduction. A slow reduction of the O2-oxidized form without any external reductant added indicates the existence of internal electron donors for heme irons in the enzyme. These results suggest that the 2 extra oxidation equivalents in the original oxidized form, compared with the O2-oxidized form, are due to a bound peroxide produced by O2 and electrons from the internal donors, consistently with a peroxide at the O2 reduction site in the crystal structure of the enzyme (Yoshikawa, S., Shinzawa-Itoh, K., Nakashima, R., Yaono, R., Yamashita, E., Inoue, N., Yao, M., Fei, M.

CH3(CH2)11(OCH2CH2)8OH CH3(CH2)11(OCH2CH2)23OH n-decyl-β-d-maltoside phenazine methosulfate Cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes the reduction of O2 to water as the terminal oxidase of cell respiration. The O2 reduction is coupled with proton pumping. The enzyme contains two redox active copper sites and two heme iron sites (1Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structure of the enzyme isolated from bovine heart has been determined at 2.3-Å resolution in the fully oxidized state and at 2.35-Å resolution in the fully reduced state (2Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Peters Libeu C. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure shows that one of the copper sites (CuA) is dinuclear but likely to be a 1-electron accepting site and that a peroxide is bridged between iron and copper in the O2reduction site in the fully oxidized state. The two heme A sites, the two copper sites, and the bridging peroxide may accept 6 electron equivalents in total. The prediction is not consistent with the widely accepted conclusion that 4 electron equivalents are required for complete reduction of the fully oxidized enzyme, based on metal analysis and redox titration experiments (1Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 3Malmström B.G. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1247-1260Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, difficulties in purification and incomplete removal of O2 from the membrane protein solution are likely to decrease the accuracy in the metal analysis and in the redox titration experiment. Thus, we reexamined the metal content of the enzyme using crystalline bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase and the electron equivalents required for complete reduction of the fully oxidized form and for complete oxidation of the dithionite reduced form. The results obtained here are consistent with the enzyme structure in the fully oxidized state containing 1 equivalent of peroxide and four metal sites, each receiving 1 electron equivalent. Cytochrome c oxidase was purified from bovine heart muscle by the method of Yoshikawa et al. (4Yoshikawa S. Choc M.G. O'Toole M.C. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5498-5508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detergent, Tween 20, was replaced with C12E8 1(Nikko Chemicals, Japan), C12E23 (Pierce), or DM (Anatrace). For crystallization, the enzyme solution was concentrated with an Amicon Diaflow apparatus. Metal content was analyzed with a model Z-6100 Hitachi polarized Zeeman atomic absorption analyzer. The enzyme samples were first wet-ashed with nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and perchloric acid. About 20 mg of the enzyme sample was used for a single determination. Thus, at least 80 mg of the enzyme sample was required for a single set of analyses for four metals (iron, copper, magnesium, and zinc). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined by following the aerobic oxidation of 15 μm ferrocytochrome c at pH 6.0. The redox titration of cytochrome c oxidase was performed under anaerobic conditions, using sodium dithionite or NADH-PMS system for reductive titration and O2 for oxidative titration, using a modified anaerobic titration system of Burleigh et al. (5Burleigh Jr., B.D. Foust G.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The system included a Thumberg type cuvette (Fig. 1,A and B), a vacuum system for exchanging the gas phase in the cuvette with O2-free N2 (Fig.1 C), and a flask for dithionite solution (data not shown). The Thumberg type cuvette was made of Pyrex glass (Fig. 1, Aand B) with three ports. The port for titrant consisted of a male joint stoppered with a rubber septum (Fig. 1 A,b). A female joint, fused to a male joint (Fig.1 A, c) stoppered with a silicon rubber septum (Fig. 1 A, d), was attached to the male joint of the titrant port (Fig. 1 A, a). A female joint mounted with a gas-tight syringe (fitted with a needle) was attached to the male joint stoppered with the silicon rubber septum (Fig. 1,A, d, and B). The brim of the silicon rubber septum was trimmed for effective sealing between the two joints. The space inside the male-female joint attached to the titrant port was filled with N2-saturated water. The rubber septum for sealing the titrant-port (Fig. 1 A, b) had been degassed by keeping it under vacuum overnight. The port for connecting the cuvette to the vacuum system was a two-way stopcock with a male joint at the end (Fig. 1 A, g). The stopper of the two-way stopcock was especially ground for close fitting and had its connecting channel running from the bottom through the center in order to minimize leakage. A fairly large space was provided between the optical cuvette and the port for connection to the vacuum line to allow for foaming from the protein solution in the cuvette during evacuation. The last port (Fig. 1 A, e) was used for introducing the enzyme solution and was sealed with a glass stopper. All of the tapered ground joints were sealed with Apiezon L high vacuum grease, whereas Apiezon N was used for the two-way stopcock. A gas-tight syringe with a screw-driven piston (Hamilton, no. 1750) was used to add titrant to the enzyme preparation in the Thumberg type cuvette (Fig. 1 B). The syringe had a long stainless steel needle fixed permanently for gas-tightness with epoxy resin. A sketch of the cuvette mounted with the titrant syringe is given in Fig.1 B. The vacuum system (Fig. 1 C) consisted of three stainless steel tubing lines (3 mm in diameter; Takahama, Himeji), for connecting the Thumberg type cuvette, for supplying O2-free N2, and for evacuation with a vacuum pump. The three stainless steel tubes were connected with a T-shaped stainless steel tube (Fig. 1 C, c), and swage locks were used for all steel tube-steel tube connections. A female glass joint for connecting the cuvette was fixed with epoxy resin on the end of the steel tubing line (Fig. 1 C, a), which had an adjacent spiral steel tubing (Fig. 1 C, b) for mechanical flexibility. The second branch was connected by rubber vacuum tubing (Fig. 1 C, i) to a vacuum pump (Fig.1 C, h) with a liquid nitrogen trap (Fig.1 C, g) in between. The third branch was connected in tandem to a tube containing a catalyst (Oxytrap, Alltech) (Fig.1 C, e) for complete removal of trace amounts of O2 in N2 gas, and to a N2 tank containing ultrapure N2 (99.9999%; Takahama, Himeji) (Fig.1 C, f). The second and third branches were equipped with high vacuum two-way metal stopcocks (Nupro, SS-2H) (Fig.1 C, d) for switching the connections to the Thumberg type cuvette. Dithionite solution was prepared in, and withdrawn from, a 130-ml flask having a port at the side similar in construction to the titrant port of the Thumberg type cuvette (data not shown), with the method of Burleigh et al. (5Burleigh Jr., B.D. Foust G.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The flask was filled with 90 ml of 0.1m pyrophosphate buffer, pH 9.0, and after placing a magnetic stirring bar coated with glass, the flask was sealed with a glass stopper equipped with a two-way stopcock. The stopcock was connected to the vacuum system with a rubber vacuum tube, and the buffer solution in the flask was deaerated by five cycles of evacuation-equilibration with N2. After adding 40 mg of solid sodium dithionite to the buffer solution through the top with a small funnel, the flask was again stoppered and deaerated with three cycles of evacuation-N2 saturation. The reducing equivalent contained in the dithionite solution was calibrated using potassium ferricyanide as the standard and the Thumberg type cuvette. The dithionite solution remained stable for at least 7 days without any detectable change in concentration of the reducing equivalent. The air-saturated water was prepared in a flask open to the air at 20 °C with gentle overnight stirring. The O2 concentration was obtained from a standard table (6.Google Scholar). For reductive titration of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase with dithionite, the Thumberg type cuvette, containing 3 ml of 7.5 μm cytochrome c oxidase in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 ml of deionized water to compensate for water loss during evacuation, was connected to the vacuum system and deaerated through three cycles of the evacuation-N2 equilibration. Precaution was taken to minimize foaming in the enzyme solution during the evacuation. Each evacuation took 20–30 min, and at the end of the final evacuation, the volume of the enzyme solution was adjusted to 3.0 ml by estimating the height of the solution in the cuvette. The amount of the enzyme was determined from the extinction coefficient of the fully reduced enzyme after reductive titration. Comparison of amount of enzyme before and after deaeration revealed that about 0.6% of the protein was removed by each evacuation-N2 saturation procedure. After securing the syringe within the port (Fig. 1 B), the dithionite solution was dispensed onto the L-shaped arm of the Thumberg type cuvette (Fig. 1 A, a) and mixed with the enzyme solution by gently tilting the cuvette. For the oxidative titration, the air-saturated water was dispensed directly into the enzyme solution, which was placed in the L-shaped arm in order to avoid release of O2 to the gas phase in the cuvette. Anaerobiosis produced inside the Thumberg type cuvette was examined by oxidation of ferrocytochrome c on addition of a catalytic amount of the fully oxidized enzyme (0.02–0.2 μm). The amount of ferrocytochrome c oxidation was less than half the oxidation equivalents carried by the enzyme added and essentially proportional to the amount of the enzyme added. It has been shown that this enzyme quickly receives 2 electron equivalents per enzyme molecule from ferrocytochrome c under anaerobic conditions (1Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Thus, the above result indicates essentially complete anaerobiosis inside the cuvette. For the reductive titration with NADH-PMS system, NADH (Sigma, preweighed vial) and PMS solutions in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were added using a 10-μl Hamilton gas-tight syringe to the enzyme solution deaerated in the Thumberg type cuvette, as described above. Both solutions were prepared daily. O2in both solution was not removed, since the oxidation equivalents carried by O2 introduced into the Thumberg type cuvette with these solutions are negligible compared with the oxidation equivalents in the enzyme to be titrated. The calculated amount of O2 introduced by the NADH solution for complete reduction of 4.6 oxidation equivalents in the enzyme contains 0.3 oxidation equivalents. However, as described below, the present work showed that O2 in small volume of the air-saturated water placed inside the cuvette was readily diffused into the gas phase in the cuvette if the water was not directly added into the solution containing enough amount of reactant to trap O2. The diffused O2at extremely low level in the gas phase did not readily reacts with cytochrome c oxidase. Thus, most of O2 in the NADH solution are likely to be diffused into the gas phase when the NADH solution is dispensed on the bottom of the titrant arm (Fig.1 A, a), before mixing the NADH solution with the enzyme solution. And the volume of the NADH solution introduced indicates that the possible level of O2 due to the diffused O2 from the NADH solution is too low for the enzyme to react readily with. Therefore, the titration results were not corrected for O2 introduced by the NADH solution. The maximal amount of O2 carried by PMS solution corresponds to 0.01 oxidation equivalent to the enzyme in the cuvette. The method for the reductive titration of highly concentrated enzyme solution was described previously (7Yoshikawa S. Mochizuki M. Zhao X-J. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4270-4279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The effect of repeated crystallization on the metal content of cytochrome c oxidase was examined. The purified preparation, stabilized with C12E8before crystallization, was washed with 2 mm EDTA in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using an Amicon Diaflow apparatus five times and wet-ashed for the determination of iron, copper, magnesium, and zinc atoms by atomic absorption spectrometry. The amount of enzyme in the sample was evaluated by the α-band absorption of the dithionite reduced form. The contents of copper, magnesium, and zinc were not significantly affected by the crystallization, whereas the iron content decreased significantly on repeated crystallization (Table I). The atomic ratio of iron to copper, which was 1.0 before crystallization, decreased to 0.69 after the second crystallization. Further crystallization did not affect the iron content, indicating absence of contaminant iron. In Table I, the sample crystallized three times is presumed to be free from contaminant iron and contains 2 iron atoms per enzyme molecule. Closely similar results were obtained for the preparation stabilized with C12E23. Averaged metal composition for seven different preparations of twice crystallized enzyme, stabilized with C12E8 or C12E23 (Table I), indicates the atomic ratio of Fe:Cu:Mg:Zn in the enzyme preparation to be 2:3:1:1. The iron content gives a molecular extinction coefficient (per two hemes) for the absorption of the α-band region of the fully reduced form (Δε604–630 nmred) of 46.6 mm−1 cm−1, with a standard error of 1.16 mm−1 cm−1 (Table I). The wet-ashing and the large quantity of the sample (20 mg of protein for each determination) are critical for the metal analysis at this high accuracy. The spectra of the fully oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme free from contaminant metal are given in Fig.2.Table IEffect of crystallization on the metal content of bovine heart cytochrome-c oxidasePreparationAtoms/enzyme moleculeε604–630 nmredIronCopperMagnesiumZincmm −1 cm −1Before crystallization1-aEnzyme stabilized with C12E8 was used.2.902.901.040.9732.2Once-crystallized1-aEnzyme stabilized with C12E8 was used.2.213.041.071.0142.2Twice-crystallized1-aEnzyme stabilized with C12E8 was used.2.063.001.061.0045.6Three times-crystallized1-aEnzyme stabilized with C12E8 was used.2.002.951.041.0446.6Twice-crystallized, averaged1-bAveraged values with (S.D.) for 3 and 4 enzyme preparations stabilized with C12E8 and C12E23, respectively.2.00 (0.07)2.95 (0.12)1.02 (0.08)1.04 (0.04)46.6 (1.16)All of the values were determined assuming that the three times-crystallized sample contains 2 iron atoms per molecule of enzyme.1-a Enzyme stabilized with C12E8 was used.1-b Averaged values with (S.D.) for 3 and 4 enzyme preparations stabilized with C12E8 and C12E23, respectively. Open table in a new tab All of the values were determined assuming that the three times-crystallized sample contains 2 iron atoms per molecule of enzyme. A preparation stabilized with DM allows for more effective purification by crystallization. The metal content of the once-crystallized preparation was about the same as that for the twice-crystallized sample stabilized with C12E8 or C12E23. The iron contaminant is likely to be associated with a contaminant protein, since repeated crystallization effectively removes contaminant peptide bands found in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns (data not shown). The spectral difference between a noncrystallized preparation and a once-crystallized preparation stabilized with C12E8 reveals that about 40% of the contaminant iron removed by the initial crystallization is due to contamination by cytochrome bc 1 complex. On the other hand, the contaminant iron left in the once-crystallized sample does not have strong absorption in the visible region. The enzyme preparations described herein were highly active (250 s−1 in terms of molecular activity), and no significant effect on the enzymic activity was detectable by the crystallization. The once crystallized preparation stabilized with C12E8 was titrated with dithionite under the anaerobic conditions as described above. The absorbance change was completed within 20 min. The spectrum was also taken at 30 min to confirm that no further change had taken place. Fig. 3 shows the spectral changes in the Soret, α-band, and near infrared regions during reductive titration using the once crystallized enzyme solution stabilized with C12E8. The fractional changes in absorption spectra due to reduction are essentially constant regardless of the wavelength region as indicated by the titration curves (Fig. 3,insets) and show that 6.2 electron equivalents are required for complete reduction of the enzyme. The slope of each titration curve in the initial 1–2 electron equivalents is about 1/3 of that in the latter part of the titration curve. As given in TableII, the average of the end point values for eight determinations is 6.3 electron equivalents, with a standard error of 0.27. The smaller absorbance changes in the initial part of the reductive titration are not due to incomplete anaerobiosis of the titration system, since the titration curves were independent of the number of evacuation-N2 saturation cycles between 3 and 10 times. On the other hand, when the cycle of evacuation and N2 saturation was applied only once or twice, both slopes of the biphasic titration curve decreased to give higher end point value.Table IIRedox titration of bovine heart cytochrome-c oxidaseEnzyme formConcentrationTitrantEnd point (S.D.)No. of determinationelectron or oxidation eq/enzyme moleculeFully oxidized as prepared7.5 μmDithionite6.3 (0.27)8Fully reduced7.5 μmO24.5 (0.12)7O2-oxidized7.5 μmDithionite5.22O2-oxidized, exposed to air7.5 μmDithionite6.42Fully oxidized as prepared7.5 μmNADH-PMS4.6 (0.20)6Fully oxidized as prepared0.7 mmDithionite6.01Fully oxidized as prepared2-aThe enzyme preparation was stabilized with DM.

Open table in a new tab After the reductive titration, the fully reduced enzyme was reoxidized with air-saturated water (Fig.4 A). The oxidative titration curve showed an initial lag phase where no oxidation of the enzyme was detectable. The oxidation equivalent consumed for the lag phase corresponded to the excess dithionite in the initial reductive titration. The oxidation proceeded monophasically with increasing amounts of O2 added, in contrast to reductive titration. Compared with the spectrum before the reductive titration, the final reoxidized spectrum had a slightly weaker Soret band with a slightly higher absorbance in the region from 440 nm to 460 nm and a slightly higher α-band, giving peaks at 605 nm and 444 nm and a trough at 420 nm in the difference spectrum (Fig. 4 C). The O2-oxidized enzyme was fully reduced monophasically with 5.2 electron equivalents of dithionite (Fig. 4 B, Table II). The end point value was significantly smaller (about 1 electron equivalent) than that of the initial reductive titration. Titration curves for the Soret region (ΔA 444–480 nm) and near infrared region (ΔA 750–805 nm) coincided with that of the α-band spectrum given in Fig. 4, within the experimental accuracy. The O2-oxidized form as well as partially reduced form during the oxidative titration showed a slow and small spectral change indicating reduction of the enzyme, which corresponded to about a 3% reduction in 1 h under anaerobic conditions. The slow reduction proceeded further, up to a 15% reduction in 24 h. The spectral change on addition of O2 in the oxidative titration was significantly faster than that on addition of dithionite in the reductive titration. A stable spectrum was obtained within 10 min after each addition of O2-saturated water, so that it took about 1 h to obtain the whole oxidative titration curve. Thus, the “autoreduction” was negligible in the oxidative titration. When the O2-oxidized sample was equilibrated with air by opening the port used to introduce the enzyme solution (Fig.1 A, e), the spectrum gradually moved toward the original spectrum preceding the initial reductive titration. The spectral change was essentially completed within 30 min after addition of excess O2. The resulting spectrum in the visible-Soret region closely resembled that of the enzyme before the initial reductive titration. The O2-oxidized enzyme, exposed to air for 2 h, provided a reductive titration curve with dithionite identical with that in the reductive titration of the fully oxidized form as prepared. As is well known, bovine heart cytochromec oxidase as prepared is in the fully oxidized form, which shows significantly lower reactivities to ferrocytochrome cand cyanide compared with the fully oxidized form under turnover conditions. This fully oxidized form is alternatively called “resting oxidized form,” and the oxidized form under turnover conditions is called “oxygen-pulsed form” (8Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Greenwood C. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3128-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this paper, the fully oxidized orm as prepared denotes the resting oxidized form. The difference spectrum between the O2-oxidized form and the oxidized form as prepared (Fig. 4 C) is similar to the redox difference spectrum of heme a, which is characterized by a stronger α band versus Soret band compared with that for heme a 3 (9Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the O2-oxidized form is also in a fully oxidized state since the form does not react with O2 in the time scale for the enzymic turnover. Thus, this spectral difference must be due to a difference in the coordination structure of the O2reduction site. Quantitative addition of O2 to the fully reduced enzyme was possible only when the air-saturated water was added directly to the reduced enzyme solution without exposure to the gas phase. When the air-saturated water was dispensed on the L-shaped arm of the titrant port, followed by the addition of reduced enzyme solution to the titrant solution (about 10 μl), the reproducibility and the spectral change due to oxidation of the enzyme were definitely more reduced than when the titrant was added directly. This result indicates that a significant part of the O2 in the air-saturated water dispensed to solution of the enzyme in the O2-oxidized state on the titrant arm diffuses to the gas phase in the Thumberg type cuvette. The residual O2 in the gas phase would react slowly with any reducing equivalent introduced as in the case of the reductive titration under incomplete anaerobiosis. Thus, the second reductive titration has no initial phase for consuming the excess O2 (Fig. 4, A and B) and the residual O2 in the gas phase may interfere with progress of the reduction with dithionite. Some part of the extra O2 could react with O2-oxidized form to form the fully oxidized form, equivalent to that before initial reductive titration. These two factors are likely to yield a slightly higher end point value as opposed to the true end point value for the reductive titration of the O2-oxidized form. The number of electron equivalents required for complete reduction of the O2-oxidized form therefore should be identical with the number of oxidation equivalents required for producing the O2-oxidized form from the fully reduced form. The apparatus for highly concentrated protein solutions in which no evacuation is required (7Yoshikawa S. Mochizuki M. Zhao X-J. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4270-4279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used for anaerobic titration of the preparation stabilized with DM, since extra DM added to the medium (0.2%) for stabilizing the micelles including the enzyme molecules interferes with complete removal of O2 by the above procedure. Enzyme preparations stabilized with C12E8 and C12E23require no extra detergent in the medium, because the critical micelle concentration is low enough. The reductive titration results are fully consistent with those for the preparation stabilized with C12E8 obtained by the system including the Thumberg type cuvette (Table II). The preparation solubilized with C12E8 at 0.7 mm gave titration results identical to those at 7.5 μm. These results indicate that the redox properties of bovine heart cytochromec oxidase are independent of the detergent species and of the protein concentration (Table II). As shown in Fig. 3, changes in the difference in the absorbance between 444 and 480 nm during reductive titration with dithionite parallels quite well the increase in absorption of the α-band and the decrease in the near infrared region. However, the fractional decrease in the absorbance at 416 nm is slightly, but significantly, larger than the fractional increase in absorbance at 604 nm at any electron equivalent added, except for the initial segment of the titration curve (Fig.5 A). The fractional increase in absorbance at 444 nm is significantly smaller than that at 605 nm in the initial half portion of the titration curve (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the fractional changes at these wavelengths coincide well with each other in the oxidative titration with O2(Fig. 5 B) and in the rereductive titration of the O2-oxidized form (data not shown). The fractional absorbance changes in the near infrared region paralleled well that at 604 nm in all the above cases. The shape of the spectral change, induced by the initial 1 electron equivalent in the reductive titration of the fully oxidized form as prepared, was significantly different from that induced by the last 1 electron equivalent before the end point was reached (Fig. 5,C and D). The most obvious difference was in the ratio of the maximum intensity at 444 nm to the minimum intensity at 420 nm. The ratios were approximately unity for the absorbance change in the initial 1 electron equivalent and 0.4 for the absorbance change in the final 1 electron equivalent. The difference was consistent with the absence of an isosbestic point in the regions near 432 and 560 nm, where the spectra in different oxidation states intersect. The spectral changes induced by the addition of various amounts of O2 to the ful"

Type I astrocytes were differentiated to stellate process-bearing cells by a 100-min exposure to cAMP. Differentiation of cortical astrocytes increased the magnitude and duration of calcium transients elicited by phospholipase C-activating agents as measured by single cell Fura-2-based imaging. Calcium imaging showed differences in the spatial pattern of the response. In both differentiated and the control cells, the response originated in the periphery and gradually extended into the center of the cell. However, the elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) was particularly evident within the processes and adjacent to the inner cell membrane of the differentiated astrocytes. In addition, differentiation significantly prolonged the duration of the [Ca2+] i elevation. Potentiation of the calcium transients was mimicked by forskolin-induced differentiation and abolished by a specific protein kinase-A blocker. Conversely, the enhancement of the calcium transients was not mimicked by brief exposure to cAMP not causing morphological differentiation, and in PC12 cells that did not undergo morphological changes after 100 min of cAMP treatment. Impairing cAMP-induced cytoskeleton re-organization, by means of cytochalasin D and nocodazole, prevented the potentiation of the calcium transients in cAMP-treated astrocytes. Phospholipase C activity and sensitivity to inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate were not involved in the enhancement of the calcium responses. Also, potentiation of the calcium transients was dependent on extracellular calcium. Calcium storage and thapsigargin-depletable intracellular calcium reservoirs were analogously not increased in differentiated astrocytes. Rearrangement of the cell shape also caused a condensation of the endoplasmic reticulum and altered the spatial relationship between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane.

A common means of inducing morphological changes in type I astrocytes has been prolonged application of long lasting cAMP analogues. Astrocytes, which differentiate after prolonged exposure to cAMP analogues, changed from a flat polygonal form to a stellate process-bearing appearance (1Goldman J.E. Chiu F.C.

J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 12Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 13Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 14Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the stores can refill by promptly capturing cytosolic calcium, admitted in the cells after the opening of the SOC/CRAC (16Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Calcium entry through the SOC/CRAC, activated by the depletion of the intracellular calcium stores, is also known as capacitative calcium entry (CCE). Disorganization of the cell shape induced by disrupting cytoskeleton organization was previously found to differentially affect calcium transients and CCE in different cell types (17Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that active and rapid rearrangement of astrocyte morphology induced by activation of the protein kinase A (PKA), is responsible for enhancement of InsP3-induced cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) elevation via an enhanced CCE. Enhanced CCE, in turn, is associated with reorganization of the spatial relationship between the outer cell membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Embryonic type I astrocyte cultures were obtained from E-17 fetuses (19Grimaldi M. Cavallaro S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected cortex from 17-day-old fetuses, cut into small fragments, were exposed to Papain (Worthington) and mechanically dissociated. The cell suspension was centrifuged and plated onto noncoated 25-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) (10−6 cells/flask)(Corning-Costar, NJ). After 6–8 h, unattached cells, mainly neurons, were washed away. This protocol yielded at least 95% pure type I astrocytes as characterized by glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). Post-natal type I astrocytes were prepared as described previously (20Grimaldi M. Pozzoli G. Navarra P. Preziosi P. Schettini G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Dissected cortex from 2-day-old Wistar rats were digested with trypsin (ICN Biomedical Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) (0.125% in calcium-free PBS), and then mechanically dissociated to single cells. Astrocytes were exposed to 1 mmBt2cAMP for 30 min before Fura-2 loading. Successively, the cells were loaded with Fura-2 always in the presence of the agent. In all the other experiments, substances were added 10 min before Bt2cAMP, and present throughout all the loading and washing phases. All experiments were conducted in a saline solution (KRB) containing in mm: NaCl, 125; KCl, 5; Na2HPO4, 1; MgSO4, 1; CaCl2, 1; glucose, 5.5; HEPES, 20; calcium-free KRB contained in mm: NaCl, 125; KCl, 5; Na2HPO4, 1; MgSO4, 1; glucose, 5.5; HEPES, 20; ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-tetraacetic acid, 0.1 pH was set at 7.2. Astrocytes plated on glass coverslips were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After a washing in PBS containing glycine, the cells were permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100). Nonspecific sites were saturated with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The preparations were exposed to anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody 1:400 dilution (Sigma) raised in mouse. After two washes in PBS-bovine serum albumin, the preparations were exposed for 20 min to the secondary antibody 1:200 (anti-mouse IgG conjugated with rhodamine). After two washes in PBS-bovine serum albumin the coverslips were mounted on a glass slide with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The preparations were observed with a conventional fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a 63× magnification oil immersion objective (Zeiss). Astrocytes were incubated for 15 min with 1 μm ER-Tracker (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed for an additional 15 min, and then kept in saline solution until observed. When ready, the coverslips were mounted in saline solution on a glass slide and observed with a Zeiss confocal microscope. We acquired a differential interference contrast image and a series of fluorescence images at 0.5 μm intervals in thez axis using 364 nm excitation and collecting with a 395 nm long pass emission filter. A 63× lens, coupled to a software zooming capability, was used to produce single cell images. InsP1 accumulation was performed as described previously (19Grimaldi M. Cavallaro S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Near-confluent astrocytes were switched to serum-free, myoinositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 (3 for InsP3 assay) μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H]inositol (30 Ci/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO), and labeled for 36 h. After labeling, cells were washed in KRB containing in mm: NaCl, 125; KCl, 5; Na2HPO4, 1; MgSO4, 1; CaCl2, 1; glucose, 5.5; HEPES, 20 mm. pH was set at 7.2 at 22 °C. Cells were equilibrated in KRB containing 10 mm LiCl for 20 min and exposed to ATP for 90 min or 15 s (no lithium was included for InsP3 assay). The reaction was terminated with 6% ice-cold perchloric acid and the acidity neutralized. An anionic exchange chromatography was performed to separate InsP1 (Dowex AG 1X-8, 100–200 mesh, mixed 1:3 in water) (Bio-Rad). Water was used to elute the unbound. Total InsP1 were eluted with 500 μl of a solution containing 1.2 m ammonium formate (AF) 0.1 m formic acid. Alternatively, InsP1, InsP2, and InsP3 were individually recovered from the resin with a serial elution with increasing concentration of AF in 0.1 mformic acid (0.4 m AF for InsP1, 0.8m AF for InsP2, 1.2 m AF for InsP3). Finally, collected samples were mixed with appropriate volumes of scintillation mixture and counted for 4 min. Nearly confluent astrocyte cultures seeded on glass coverslips (Assistent, Germany) were washed once in KRB. After washing, cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 22 min at room temperature to minimize dye compartmentalization in subcellular compartment, under continuous gentle agitation. After loading, the cells were washed once with fresh KRB and then kept for an additional 22 min in Fura-2/AM-free KRB (19Grimaldi M. Cavallaro S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ratio measurements were acquired every 2 s. The experimental data were analyzed with the software MetaFluor (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Briefly, an area corresponding to the entire cell surface was delimited by using the editing capability of the software. The experimental ratio values, derived from the entire cytosolic area, obtained by delimiting the profile of the cells and averaging the signals within the delimited area, were converted in cytosolic calcium concentration using a titration calibration curve obtained in living cells exposed to known extracellular calcium concentration in the presence of 5 μm ionomycin (containing 5.2% calcium). The following are the ratio values measured in astrocytes: 760 nmCaext R340/380 = 18; 1,260 μm Caext R340/380 = 32. R340/380 at 0 Caext = 0.29; R340/380 at 10 mm Caext = 60. All substances were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Experiments were performed at least three times on different cell preparations. The plots were created by using the average ± S.E. of all the cells studied. The values were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by t test. Differences were considered significant for p ≤ 0.05. Flat polygonal type I astrocytes (Fig. 1 a) exposed to 1 mm Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1 b) or 100 μm forskolin (not shown) for 100 min, exhibited a process-bearing cell phenotype, as shown by imaging of GFAP immunoreactivity. ATP- and BK-induced statistically significant responses in astrocytes (Fig.2 a and b,insets I, respectively). [Ca2+] i elevation induced by 10 μm ATP (Fig. 2 a,main and inset I), 100 nm BK (Fig.2 b, main and inset I), norephinephrine or carbamylcholine (not shown) was greatly enhanced in differentiated astrocytes. As previously reported, ATP responses were elicited in virtually all astrocytes studied (7Shao Y. McCarthy K.D. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 991-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4, panels rand s for typical experimental traces of ATP responses), whereas about 75% of the astrocytes responded to BK (Fig. 2,panel b, inset II) (9Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In differentiated astrocytes, we observed a potentiation of ATP responses at all concentrations tested (Fig. 2,panel a, open circles versus closed circles). Both the initial, “spike-like”, phase and the sustained phase of intracellular calcium elevation were increased in differentiated cells, as compared with undifferentiated cells (Fig. 3,panels a and b, closed circles versus open circles). The spatial development of ATP response was also analyzed. In control astrocytes, the responses began in the periphery of the cell body and extended into the perinuclear area (Fig.4, panels a–d). The decay of the responses began from the perinuclear area and subsequently extended into the periphery of the cell. The entire response was very fast (8 s in toto). In differentiated astrocytes [Ca2+] i increased initially in the astrocyte prolongment and in the periphery of the cells and extended to the soma (panels e–n). Astrocyte processes and the regions immediately adjacent to the inner cell membrane showed a more marked [Ca2+] i elevation. In addition, differentiation significantly prolonged the duration of the [Ca2+] i elevation. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4, the response lasted 4 frames (panels a–d) in control, and 8 frames (panels e–n) in differentiated astrocytes (given the 2 s interval between each frame acquisition, the response lasted 8 s in controls and 16 s in differentiated astrocytes (Fig. 4)).Figure 4Space- and time-resolved imaging of ATP response. Fura-2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 was imaged using a 40× lens every 2 s, ratioed and converted into [Ca2+] i. [Ca2+] i was expressed as pseudocolor ranging from blue to redas shown by the color bar in the top right corner of the figure. The arrowheads in panels a ande indicate the direction of perfusion flow. Panels a–d show the responses to 10 μm ATP in undifferentiated astrocytes. ATP reached the cells at the imagea. The successive ratio images display the development of the [Ca2+] i elevation. Panels e–n show responses to 10 μm ATP in differentiated astrocytes. ATP reached the cells in image e. The arrows in panel f indicate the early and high increase of [Ca2+] i in the processes (orange) and in the periphery (white) of the cell, respectively. The white arrow in panel hindicates the initial increase of [Ca2+] i in the cell soma.

Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells responding to BK was not affected by differentiation (Fig. 2 b, inset II). ATP responses were also increased when differentiation of astrocytes was achieved by exposure to 100 μm forskolin for 100 min ([Ca2+] i peak in undifferentiated astrocytes was 620 ± 35 nm versus 1.650 ± 120 μm in forskolin differentiated astrocytes,n = 76, p ≤ 0.05). A few minutes exposure to Bt2cAMP, which was unable to induce morphological changes, did not increase ATP responses ([Ca2+] i = 580 ± 50 nm,n = 46). In the absence of extracellular calcium, however, both undifferentiated and differentiated astrocytes displayed similar [Ca2+] i elevation in response to ATP ([Ca2+] i in undifferentiated astrocytes in absence of extracellular calcium and 100 μm EGTA = 420 ± 70, n = 65; [Ca2+] i in differentiated astrocytes in absence of extracellular calcium and 100 μm EGTA 480 ± 100 nm,n = 66). Blockade of PKA with 300 nmKT-5720 (for review see Refs. 20Grimaldi M. Pozzoli G. Navarra P. Preziosi P. Schettini G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 21Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) (a gift from Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA), although did not decrease calcium transients evoked by ATP (Fig. 5), prevented the morphological changes induced by cAMP (Fig. 1 c) and the enhancement of the [Ca2+] i elevation in response to ATP (Fig. 5). ATP-induced InsP1 accumulation was similar in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells (Fig.6 a). However, in differentiated astrocytes the stimulation reached a plateau at a lower concentration of ATP than in undifferentiated cells. Although there were no significant changes in the accumulation of InsP1, we also tested whether the production of InsP3 was changed in the two cell types. InsP3 production after a 15 s stimulation with ATP was unaffected by differentiation (Fig. 6,inset to panel a). Because it has been reported that long term treatment with cAMP analogues can affect both BK- and α1-adrenergic-induced InsP1 production in post-natal astrocytes (2Fahrig T. Sommermeyer H. Brain Res. 1993; 602: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 3Chen C.C. Chang J. Chen W.C. Glia. 1996; 16: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we also studied InsP1production in post-natal astrocytes (Fig. 6 b). In post-natal astrocytes, the treatment with Bt2cAMP for 100 min caused cell differentiation (not shown) and potentiated ATP-induced [Ca2+] i elevation ([Ca2+] i after ATP stimulation in undifferentiated astrocytes = 654 ± 22 nm, n = 58; [Ca2+] i after ATP stimulation in differentiated astrocytes = 1,753 ± 200 nm, n = 77; p ≤ 0.05). As was observed in embryonic astrocytes, InsP1 generation was not affected by differentiation in post-natal astrocytes either (Fig.6 b). In the absence of extracellular calcium, the release of calcium from intracellular stores induced by 20 μmthapsigargin (an irreversible inhibitor of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; for review see Ref. 22Thastrup O. Cullen P. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar) was identical in both undifferentiated and differentiated astrocytes (Fig.7 a). However, in the presence of extracellular calcium, the increase of [Ca2+] i caused by 20 μm thapsigargin was significantly larger (see Fig. 7 c) in differentiated astrocytes than in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 7 b). Treatment of astrocytes with 10 μmcytochalasin D (CytD) did not significantly affect morphology (not shown) and slightly increased ATP responses in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 8 a). Treatment with 10 μm CytD, however, prevented the morphological changes induced by Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1 d), and the potentiation of ATP-induced [Ca2+] i elevation (Fig. 8 a). Thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation in undifferentiated cells was decreased by 10 μm CytD (Fig. 8 b). In differentiated cells the potentiation of thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation was abolished by actin depolymerization (Fig. 8 b). Treatment of astrocytes with the anti-tubulin drug nocodazole, at 10 μm, prevented cAMP-induced morphological differentiation of type I astrocytes (Fig.1 e). Nocodazole treatment increased ATP-induced [Ca2+] i elevation in control cells (Fig.9 a). However, Bt2cAMP-treated astrocytes exposed to nocodazole showed a reduction of the calcium transient evoked by ATP as compared with differentiated astrocytes not treated with nocodazole (Fig.9 a). In control cells, thapsigargin-induced calcium mobilization was not affected by nocodazole (Fig. 9 b). In differentiated cells the treatment with nocodazole eliminated the potentiation of [Ca2+] i elevation observed after exposure to thapsigargin (Fig. 9 b). In flat polygonal type I astrocytes, the internal membrane-delimited compartments are well visible in the periphery of the cell, whereas in the perinuclear space ER structures are grouped with other intracellular membrane delimited compartments such as the Golgi apparatus (Fig.10, a and b). Isolated and rare single tubular structures, reaching out of the cell membrane border, were present in the periphery of the cell (arrowheads, Fig. 10, a and b). Fully differentiated astrocytes were smaller, thicker, and rounder and had extended large processes (Fig. 10 c). In this reconfigured morphology, the cells showed a marked condensation of the internal membrane-delimited compartments all across the cell (Fig.10 d). Capacitative calcium entry is a mechanism whereby intracellular calcium stores are refilled (9Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 12Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 13Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 14Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The maintenance of the filled state of intracellular stores is involved in cell survival as the prolonged depletion of calcium reservoirs causes cell death and apoptosis (23Zhou Y.P. Teng D. Dralyuk F. Ostrega D. Roe M.W. Philipson L. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that the fast occurring morphological rearrangement of type I astrocytes from a flat polygonal appearance to a stellate process-bearing one, induced by exposure to Bt2cAMP or forskolin, was associated with larger and longer calcium transients in response to neurotransmitters activating PLC, particularly within the newly created processes and in regions immediately adjacent to the cell membrane. Potentiation of the response to InsP3-generating agents affected both the spike and the plateau phase of the agonist-induced calcium mobilization. Our data indicated that even if the cAMP-PKA system is activated with exogenous cAMP, in the absence of morphological changes, calcium transients are unaffected. In fact, a brief exposure to Bt2cAMP, was not able to induce morphological changes, and did not change the intensity of calcium transients. This view is supported by the fact that PC12 cells treated for 100 min with Bt2cAMP did not change their morphology or their response to ATP (data not shown). The blockade of PKA, with KT-5720, a fairly specific inhibitor of the cAMP-activated protein kinase (20Grimaldi M. Pozzoli G. Navarra P. Preziosi P. Schettini G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), prevented the morphological changes and returned the calcium responses to the values of the undifferentiated cells. Thus, activity of PKA was required to induce potentiation of the calcium transients, although intermediate steps may have occurred between activation of the kinase and the enhancement of the calcium transient. Therefore, we hypothesized that PKA activation might have an effect on intermediate targets, the modification of which, in turn, potentiated both agonist- and thapsigargin-induced calcium transients. Involvement of the membrane receptor-G protein-PLC system, as a target of PKA action, was ruled out as a consequence of the fact that agonist-induced InsP1 accumulation and InsP3-production were both unaffected by differentiation. Although PLC activity was not changed by differentiation, differences in InsP3-receptor sensitivity, and direct modulation of the InsP3-activated calcium channel on the ER could have played a role in the enhancement of calcium transients in differentiated cells. However, the fact that thapsigargin-induced calcium transients, which do not rely upon InsP3 receptor activation, were also enhanced by astrocyte differentiation, supports the involvement of a mechanism downstream to InsP3 receptor activation. To further characterize the mechanism underlying enhancement of the calcium transients in differentiated cells, we analyzed the contribution of extracellular calcium to the potentiation of calcium transients in differentiated astrocytes. In the absence of extracellular calcium, ATP- and thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation were similar in control and differentiated cells. This finding strongly suggests that the sensitivity to InsP3, the amount of calcium stored in the intracellular compartments, and the amount of calcium stored in other intracellular calcium reservoirs (that were not sensitive to InsP3 but could have been released by calcium itself) were not involved in the enhancement of the calcium transients in differentiated cells. On the other hand, the absolute dependence on extracellular calcium for the enhancement of calcium transients, observed in differentiated astrocytes, indicates that an increase of calcium entry was clearly involved in the potentiation of calcium responses in differentiated cells. Thus, our data suggests that calcium entrance from the extracellular space was increased in Bt2cAMP-treated astrocytes, only if they had undergone shape changes. Cell morphology has been shown to play a role in agonist-induced calcium mobilization in fibroblasts (17Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), in thapsigargin-induced store depletion, and in the associated CCE in endothelial cells (18Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because cAMP-induced differentiation causes the rearrangement of the actin-formed stress fiber (1Goldman J.E. Chiu F.C. Brain Res. 1984; 306: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we induced actin to depolymerize with CytD before exposing the cells to Bt2cAMP. As expected, in the presence of CytD, the cells did not reshape and maintained their flat polygonal appearance, although PKA was being activated by cAMP. The prevention of the shape changes in Bt2cAMP-treated cells, by CytD, avoided the potentiation of ATP- and thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation. Both PKA activity in the cell cytosol and PKA localization at level of the cell membrane, where CRAC channels are localized, have been reported not to be affected by CytD pretreatment (24Iwasaki H. Eguchi S. Shichiri M. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 352: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Kovbasnjuk O.N. Szmulowicz U. Spring K.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that morphological changes involving the rearrangement of stress fibers play a critical role in the potentiation of the CCE. CytD was reported to decrease CCE in endothelial cells without affecting agonist-induced calcium transients (18Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that CytD was able to induce shape changes in fibroblasts that were associated with the loss of the sensitivity to ATP in the presence of preserved thapsigargin and CCE responses (17Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We did observe both a slight potentiation of ATP response and a more pronounced inhibition of thapsigargin-induced calcium mobilization, following CytD treatment in undifferentiated cells, the morphology of which did not undergo appreciable changes after CytD pretreatment (not shown), although actin filaments were disassembled by the drug (not shown). This suggests that, in type I astrocytes, disrupting stress fibers with CytD is not sufficient to abolish calcium transients, unless a dramatic change of the shape of the cells is achieved. However, the specific inhibition of the stress fiber reorganization was able to block the cAMP-induced differentiation and the associated potentiation of the calcium transients. To confirm this interpretation, we tested the effect of nocodazole, an agent that impairs tubulin cytoskeleton organization. Nocodazole pre-exposure blocked the differentiation of the astrocytes obtained with cAMP. Noticeably, nocodazole itself caused a consistent increase of the calcium transients elicited by ATP in control astrocytes, although it did not affect thapsigargin-induced calcium mobilization. This unexpected and selective increase in ATP response by nocodazole, without affecting thapsigargin action, may be due to an interference of the drug with the ATP system, unrelated to its activity as a tubulin depolymerizer. However, nocodazole-treated cells in the absence or in the presence of Bt2cAMP showed similar responses, suggesting that although the response to ATP was increased by nocodazole itself, nocodazole treatment was able to prevent calcium signaling changes due to shape changes. In addition, the ability of nocodazole to block the potentiation of thapsigargin-induced calcium mobilization, without affecting thapsigargin effect, in cAMP-treated astrocytes showed clearly the dependence of the calcium transient enhancement on the acquisition of the new morphology. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain how calcium flowing through the SOC/CRAC during CCE can be captured and stored in the ER compartments and thus contribute to the spike or the plateau phase of the single calcium transient. Calcium, according to the preferential pathway hypotheses, could be directly sequestered within intracellular stores because of a physical association between the SOC/CRAC and the SERCA-ER complex (9Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 12Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 13Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 14Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, calcium ions, once admitted into the cytosol by SOC/CRAC opening, might be quickly removed from the cytosol and accumulated in the ER by the SERCA (diffuse pathway) (16Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Regardless of which of the two mechanisms is operating in type I astrocytes, it is likely that the reorganization of the spatial relationship between ER structures and cell membrane may cause a change in the efficiency of calcium mobilization as results of the improved refilling of the intracellular calcium stores. This would, in turn, result in larger calcium transients. We assessed the arrangement of the ER in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In undifferentiated astrocytes, ER structures were largely evident in the periphery of the cells where a tubular network of membrane delimited structures were identifiable. In addition, grouped in the perinuclear region of the astrocytes, ER structures and the Golgi complex were identified. In differentiated cells, at least as a consequence of the marked reorganization of the cell shape, the ER was so condensed that areas of the cytoplasm free of ER structures were virtually absent. Such a marked rearrangement may, in turn, increase the availability of calcium flowing from the extracellular space to provide for refilling of the stores during CCE, through a closer association of the outer cell membrane and ER structures. In conclusion, our data indicates that an active and rapid remodeling of type I astrocyte morphology from an expanded epithelial-like to a condensed process-bearing shape is induced by the activation of the cAMP-PKA system. This remodeling appears to cause a cytoskeleton-driven spatial reorganization of the relationship between the plasma membrane and ER structures, thereby increasing calcium flow into the cells during CCE, that, in turn, enhances agonist-induced [Ca2+] i elevation.

https://openalex.org/W2163259507,"The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel subunits are both intracellular. There is increasing evidence that both of these domains are required for the regulation of Kir channels by agents such as G-proteins and nucleotides. Kir6.2 is the pore-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ (K ATP) channel. Using an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, we demonstrate that the two intracellular domains of Kir6.2 physically interact with each other, and we map a region within the N terminus that is responsible for this interaction. “Cross-talk” through this interaction may explain how mutations in either the N or C terminus can influence the intrinsic ATP-sensitivity of Kir6.2. Interestingly, the “interaction domain” is highly conserved throughout the superfamily of Kir channels. The N-terminal interaction domain of Kir6.2 can also interact with the C terminus of both Kir6.1 and Kir2.1. Furthermore, a mutation within the conserved region of the N-terminal interaction domain, which disrupts its interaction with the C terminus, severely compromised the ability of both Kir6.2 and Kir2.1 to form functional channels, suggesting that this interaction may be a feature common to all members of the Kir family of potassium channels.

Since the cloning of the first Kir channel in 1993, several important subfamilies with differing physiological roles have been identified. For example, Kir3.1 and Kir3.4, members of the G-protein-gated subfamily, coassemble to formI KACh, the current which slows the heart rate in response to vagal nerve stimulation (3Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic β-cell, the ATP-sensitive (K ATP) channel is formed by coassembly of Kir6.2 and the sulfonylurea receptor, SUR1, which is a member of the ABC-transporter superfamily (4Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 5Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).K ATP channels are sensitive to the levels of intracellular adenine nucleotides and thereby couple the metabolic status of the cell to its electrical activity. This provides the link between changes in blood glucose and insulin secretion by the β-cell. Like other K+ channels, Kir subunits have been shown to form a tetrameric K+-selective pore, and they exhibit significant sequence homology to other K+-channels within the pore-forming region (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 3Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Doyle D.A.

However, in contrast to the six-transmembrane domain (TM) structure of the voltage-gated K+ and related cation channels, Kir channel subunits have only two transmembrane domains (1Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Kir channels also appear to differ in the structural elements which define subunit assembly and the specificity of subunit heteromultimerization. For voltage-gated K+ channels these properties are largely defined by the first TM and an N-terminal “tetramerization” domain (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 3Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). By contrast, the domains that determine the subunit assembly of Kir subunits are less well understood. Different studies have implicated multiple regions in both the N and the C termini, as well as in the TMs, which are involved in subunit assembly and processing (7Fink M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C.

A direct physical interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the G-protein-gated Kir3.0 subunits has been shown to enhance Gβγ binding, supporting the now accepted view that Gβγ subunits gate the channel by interacting with a complex binding site formed by both the N and C termini (11Woodward R.

Similarly, the ability of Kir1.1 to respond to changes in intracellular pH involves conformational changes in both the N and C termini (16Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There are also reports that both the N and C termini of Kir6.2 participate in regulating KATP channel function (12Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,14Proks P. Gribble F.M. Adhikari R. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J.

In this study we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the N and C termini of Kir6.2. More importantly, we map a highly conserved region within the N terminus which is responsible for this interaction. We also show that this highly conserved “interaction domain” is capable of interacting with the C termini of other Kir subunits and that disruption of this interaction severely compromises the ability of both Kir6.2 and Kir2.1 to form functional channels. Relevant N-terminal fragments with in-frame restriction sites were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned between the EcoRI and SalI sites of the GST-fusion expression vector, pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All N-terminal constructs included a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus. Relevant C-terminal fragments representing amino acids 170–391 for Kir6.2 and equivalent regions for Kir6.1 (amino acids 180–424) and Kir 2.1 (amino acids 182–428) were also generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in-frame between theEcoRI and SalI sites of the pET-28a vector (Novagen). This vector directs protein expression under the control of the T7 promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by subcloning appropriate fragments into the pALTER-1 vector and using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Constructs for the Shaker N termini (22Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Science. 1997; 278: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr W. N. Zagotta (University of Washington, WA). N-terminal GST-(HIS6) fusion constructs were transformed into the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain, proteins were induced with 0.25 mm IPTG, and cultures were grown for 3–4 h at 20 °C. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer S (150 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1% NDSB-256, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.2% Tween 20), lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material precipitated by centrifugation at 10000 × gfor 15 min. N-terminal fusion proteins were then purified from the supernatant on a Ni2+-agarose column and eluted with 100 mm EDTA. [35S]methionine-labeled C-terminal constructs were synthesized using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription Translation system (Promega), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After synthesis, the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of buffer S per 50 μl of reaction volume, and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min before use in the binding assay. In vitro binding assays were carried out in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube by adding 20 μl of GST-fusion protein (15 μg), 10 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), 15 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (60% slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 200 μl of buffer S, and 250 μl of the relevant radiolabeled C terminus (prepared as above). Tubes were then mixed by constant rotation for 40 min at room temperature, and the beads then washed three times for 15 min in 1 ml of buffer S at room temperature. After the final wash, all supernatant was removed and the beads were resuspended in 15 μl of 2× protein sample buffer. A 10-μl aliquot was then subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Oocytes were prepared and whole-cell currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (23Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Mean steady-state whole-cell currents were recorded at −110 mV during a 250-ms pulse from a holding potential of −10 mV. The recording solution contained (in mm): 90 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with KOH). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Sequences for the N termini were aligned and homology indicated using the GCG PILEUP and PRETTYPLOT programs. Full-length sequences for the relevant Kir subunits were submitted to the Predict Protein server (available on the WWW) for secondary structure prediction (PHDsec) using the programs default settings (24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 25Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar). To assess whether the intracellular domains of Kir6.2 interact, we used an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay that exploits the ability of recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins to interact with [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins. If the two proteins interact, then the radiolabeled protein can be purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (see “Materials and Methods”). To assess the specificity of such a potential interaction, we have used the N-terminal “tetramerization” domain of theShaker K+ channel as both a positive and negative control (22Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Science. 1997; 278: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as well as the GST protein by itself. Fig. 1 shows that neither GST alone, nor the N terminus of Kir6.2 (residues 1–53), nor the very distal C terminus of Kir6.2 (residues 349–391) exhibited association with the radiolabeled Shaker N terminus. However, as expected, theShaker N-terminal GST-fusion protein did associate with the radiolabeled Shaker N terminus. By contrast, when these same GST-fusion proteins were screened against the radiolabeled Kir6.2 C terminus (residues 170–391), only the Kir6.2 N terminus was found to interact; the Shaker-N terminus did not bind, and neither did residues 349–391 of Kir6.2 nor GST alone. Together these results provide strong evidence that the N- and C-terminal domains of Kir6.2 specifically associate with one another. To identify the region within the N terminus of Kir6.2 which is responsible for interaction with the C terminus of the channel, we made serial truncations of the N terminus, and tested the ability of the truncated proteins to bind to the C terminus. Fig.2 shows that the N terminus of Kir6.2 still retained the ability to interact with the C terminus when either residues 1–29, or residues 47–53, were deleted. Further deletions resulted in a loss of binding. This implicates the region encompassing residues 30–46 (highlighted in Fig. 3) as critical for the ability of the N terminus of Kir6.2 to associate with the C terminus. These results are summarized in Fig. 3, where the individual constructs are displayed against a sequence alignment of the N termini of several different Kir subunits. Above the alignment in Fig. 3 is shown a secondary structure prediction for Kir6.2 calculated using the PHDsec program (see “Materials and Methods”).Figure 3The interaction domain is highly conserved among Kir channels. Top, a sequence alignment of the N termini of several different Kir channels showing the predicted secondary structure for the N terminus of Kir6.2 (β, predicted β-strand; α, predicted α-helix). The numbering refers to Kir6.2. The boxed regions indicate areas of sequence conservation across subfamilies. Bottom, a schematic representation of the data presented in Fig. 2. The ability to interact is indicated with either (+) for a positive result or (−) for a negative result. These data indicate that the regionhighlighted in the sequence alignment is critical for this interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The region of greatest sequence conservation between different Kir subfamilies (highlighted in Fig. 3) is predicted to contain two β-strand structures. The proximal N terminus is predicted to be α-helical. The PHDsec program does not predict any other regions of significant secondary structure within the N terminus of Kir6.2. Similar predictions for the secondary structure of the N terminus of Kir6.1, Kir2.1, and Kir3.4 were also obtained using thePHDsec program (not shown). The sequence homology and secondary structure conservation within the region highlighted in Fig.3 suggests that this interaction may be common to all Kir subunits. We tested whether the GST-fusion protein containing residues 25–53 of Kir6.2, which encompasses this interaction domain, was capable of interacting with the C termini of other Kir subunits. Fig.4 shows the N terminus of Kir6.2 was able to bind to the C terminus of Kir6.1, as well as to the C terminus of the more distantly related Kir2.1. Likewise, the equivalent regions of the N terminus of both Kir6.1 and Kir2.1 were also able to interact with the C termini of Kir6.2, Kir6.1, and Kir2.1 (not shown). We assayed the effect of mutation of a highly conserved glycine residue (Gly-40) within the interaction domain of Kir6.2. Fig.5 shows that substitution of this residue with aspartate (G40D) severely disrupted the ability of the N-terminal interaction domain to bind to the C terminus of Kir6.2. To address the functional consequences of disrupting this interaction, we examined the effect of the G40D mutation on Kir6.2 function. K ATP currents were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes coinjected with Kir6.2 + SUR1 mRNA. It is necessary to coinject SUR1 with Kir6.2 as this subunit does not properly traffic to the plasma membrane except in association with a sulfonylurea receptor (26Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 27Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In control recording solution, K ATP currents were extremely small because of block by intracellular nucleotides. We therefore used the metabolic inhibitor sodium azide to activate the channel (23Gribble F.M. Ashfield R. Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows that, after perfusion for 10 min with 3 mm sodium azide, large inward currents can be recorded (28.1 ± 2.9 μA, n = 8) from oocytes injected with wild-type Kir6.2 + SUR1 mRNA. By contrast, only background level currents were recorded from oocytes injected with equivalent amounts of mRNAs encoding Kir6.2-G40D + SUR1, even in the presence of sodium azide (297 ± 102 nA, n = 8). The equivalent mutation in Kir2.1 (G52D) also severely compromised the ability of this subunit to form functional channels. UnlikeK ATP currents, it is not necessary to metabolically inhibit the oocyte to record Kir2.1 currents. Fig. 6 shows that robust inward currents could be recorded from oocytes injected with mRNA encoding wild-type Kir2.1 (20.96 ± 4.9 μA, n = 8). However, for oocytes injected with an equivalent amount of Kir2.1-G52D mRNA, the currents were reduced to almost background levels (460 ± 110 nA, n = 8). The results we present here define a highly conserved domain within the N terminus of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir6.2 which determines physical association with the C terminus of the channel. We also demonstrate that this interaction is likely to be common to all members of the Kir channel family and that its disruption severely compromises the ability of the Kir subunit to form functional channels. The N-terminal interaction domain (NID) that we have identified in Kir6.2 appears to be highly conserved across different Kir subfamilies (see Fig. 3), whereas the more distal regions of the N terminus show little sequence conservation. In addition, thePHDsec program predicts a similar β-strand secondary structure for this region in Kir6.1, Kir6.2, Kir3.4, and Kir2.1. This suggests that the NID domain of a given Kir channel may be able to substitute for that of another. In support of this idea is the ability of the NID of Kir6.2 to interact with the C-terminal domains of both Kir6.1 and Kir2.1, and vice versa. Kir subunits associate as tetramer, and whereas heteromerization of different subunits may occur within subfamilies, it does not usually occur between different subfamilies. Therefore, although the NID may contribute to subunit assembly, because Kir6.0 and Kir2.1 do not heteromerize to form functional channels (9Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the NID is unlikely to be a major determinant of the specificity of heteromeric Kir channel assembly. Furthermore, deletion of this region from Kir2.1, or Kir1.1, does not affect the ability of these subunits to tetramerize (8Koster J.C. Bentle K.A. Nichols C.G. Ho K. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1821-1829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A key question is whether the NID is involved in a purely structural association between the N and C termini or if it has a role in Kir channel function. It is not possible to answer this question from our data nor to distinguish between an intra- orinter-subunit association. However, there is evidence that the NID is required for the formation of functional Kir channels. Truncation of up to 30 amino acids from the N terminus of Kir6.2 can be made without compromising channel activity (15Reimann F. Tucker S.J. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but larger deletions which remove the NID result in a loss of Kir6.2 currents (21Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 2S. J. Tucker, unpublished observations. Deletion of 71 residues from the N terminus of Kir2.1 also results in a nonfunctional channel (9Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Similar studies with Kir1.1a reveal that deletion of residues 3–38 from the N terminus (which leaves the predicted interaction domain intact) does not affect channel function (8Koster J.C. Bentle K.A. Nichols C.G. Ho K. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1821-1829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, deletion of residues 39–68 (which remove the interaction domain) results in a nonfunctional phenotype. Taken together, these data demonstrate that deletion of the NID results in the loss of functional Kir channels. Our demonstration of a direct physical association between the N- and C-terminal domains of Kir6.2 may elucidate the mechanism by which ATP interacts with Kir6.2. Previous studies have implicated both N and C termini in ATP inhibition. First, mutations that affect ATP-sensitivity (without altering the channel gating) are found in both intracellular domains of Kir6.2 (20Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Second, mutations in both domains, e.g. R50G and K185Q, have also been shown to reduce the photoaffinity labeling of Kir6.2 by 8-azido-ATP (29Tanabe K. Tucker S.J. Matsuo M. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. Seino S. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3931-3933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, when a mutation in the N terminus of Kir6.2 is combined with one in the C terminus of Kir6.2, there is an additive reduction in ATP sensitivity (14Proks P. Gribble F.M. Adhikari R. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 514: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Koster J.C. Sha Q. Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the ATP-binding site is either formed by residues contributed by both N and C termini or that the binding site on one of these domains can be allosterically regulated by the other. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that these allosteric effects are mediated via the TMs, the simplest mechanism would be through a direct physical interaction between the N and C termini, such as that we describe. There is also evidence that implicates the NID in other aspects ofK ATP channel gating. A region of Kir6.2 (residues 37–45), which comprises part of the NID of Kir6.2, has been shown to be partly responsible for the ability ofK ATP channels to open spontaneously when ATP is removed (30Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Satoh E. Yamada M. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Pott L. Kurachi Y. Recept. Channel. 1998; 6: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a cysteine residue (Cys-42) within the NID of Kir6.2 has been identified as the target for sulfydryl-reactive reagents: modification of Cys-42 by pCMPS causes an irreversible inhibition of channel activity (31Trapp S. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The effect of pCMPS was also state-dependent, indicating that this residue is only accessible in the closed state. Similarly, the equivalent cysteine in Kir1.1 (Cys-49) can also be modified by the sulfydryl reagent DTNB, which causes irreversible channel inhibition. Access to this residue is also state-dependent (16Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the interaction of the NID with the C terminus is not static but that it moves during channel gating It is therefore tempting to speculate that a dynamic interaction between the N and C termini of Kir6.2 is also involved in channel gating and that the NID may play an important role in this interaction. Such a speculation would be consistent with the reported involvement of both intracellular domains of Kir3.0 in the gating of channel activity by Gβγ subunits (11Woodward R. Stevens E.B.

However, further work is required to determine which regions within the C terminus are involved in this interaction and how association of the N and C termini contribute to the various aspects of Kir6.2 channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2160702055,"We have previously demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibits calcium-dependent chloride secretion via a mechanism involving stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). The muscarinic agonist of chloride secretion, carbachol (CCh), also stimulates an antisecretory pathway that involves transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) but does not involve PI3-K. Here, we have examined if ErbB receptors, other than the EGFR, have a role in regulation of colonic secretion and if differential effects on ErbB receptor activation may explain the ability of the EGFR to propagate diverse signaling pathways in response to EGFversus CCh. Basolateral, but not apical, addition of the ErbB3/ErbB4 ligand α-heregulin (HRG; 1–100 ng/ml) inhibited secretory responses to CCh (100 μm) across voltage-clamped T84 epithelial cells. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies revealed that HRG (100 ng/ml) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization of ErbB3 and ErbB2, but had no effect on phosphorylation of the EGFR. HRG also stimulated recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3-K to ErbB3/ErbB2 receptor dimers, while the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin (50 nm), completely reversed the inhibitory effect of HRG on CCh-stimulated secretion. Further studies revealed that, while both EGF (100 ng/ml) and CCh (100 μm) stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFR, only EGF stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB2, and neither stimulated ErbB3 phosphorylation. EGF, but not CCh, stimulated the formation of EGFR/ErbB2 receptor dimers and the recruitment of p85 to ErbB2. We conclude that ErbB2 and ErbB3 are expressed in T84 cells and are functionally coupled to inhibition of calcium-dependent chloride secretion. Differential dimerization with other ErbB family members may underlie the ability of the EGFR to propagate diverse inhibitory signals in response to activation by EGF or transactivation by CCh.

Under normal circumstances sodium and chloride are actively absorbed from the intestine, creating an osmotic gradient favorable for fluid absorption. However, several pathological conditions are characterized by alterations in intestinal ion transport processes, consequently resulting in abnormalities of fluid transport (1Keely S.J. Montrose M.M. Barrett K.E. Yamada T. Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia1999: 326-361Google Scholar). In such conditions, it is thought that the absorptive capacity of the intestine is overwhelmed by excessive fluid secretion, leading to the clinical manifestation of secretory diarrhea. Conversion of the epithelium from a net absorptive to a secretory state can occur through the actions of neuronal, hormonal, and immunologically derived substances that are released, for example, during conditions of bowel inflammation. Typically, such agents promote chloride secretion by binding to specific receptors on the surface of epithelial cells, thereby increasing levels of intracellular second messengers, such as cyclic nucleotides and calcium. This, in turn, activates prosecretory signaling pathways, which ultimately interact with, and activate, the transport proteins that comprise the chloride secretory mechanism (1Keely S.J. Montrose M.M. Barrett K.E. Yamada T. Gastroenterology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia1999: 326-361Google Scholar,2Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C859-C868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to prosecretory signaling pathways, it is becoming evident that mechanisms also exist within epithelial cells that result in down-regulation of chloride secretion (3Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1069-C1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, treatment of epithelial cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 results in inhibition of subsequent chloride secretory responses to calcium-dependent agonists, such as carbachol (CCh) (4Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of EGF is mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that, in addition to stimulating secretion, agonists such as CCh also stimulate tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways that limit the extent of ongoing secretory responses (6Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These pathways involve transactivation of the EGFR and subsequent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase. However, CCh-induced activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR), unlike that induced by EGF itself, does not result in an increase in the lipid kinase activity of PI3-K (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this apparent differential propagation of signaling pathways by the EGFR in response to activation by EGF, or transactivation by CCh, respectively, may lie in the complex nature of molecular interactions between the EGFR and its related growth factor receptors, which together constitute the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EGF receptor (EGFR; ErbB1) is the prototypic member of the ErbB family. To date, three other members of this family have been identified: ErbB2 (p185 erbB2/neu ), ErbB3 (p180 erbB3 ), and ErbB4 (p180 erbB4 ) (7Carraway K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 8Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Despite the large degree of structural homology between them, ErbB family members differ from each other in their patterns of expression, ligand specificity, and intracellular substrates. Ligands that bind to and activate ErbB receptors can broadly be divided into two classes, those that bind the EGFR, such as EGF and transforming growth factor-α, and those which bind to ErbB3 and ErbB4, the heregulins (HRG). ErbB2 has been classified as an orphan receptor due to the lack of a known ligand that binds this receptor. ErbB receptors also differ in their kinase activity; whereas ErbB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, ErbB2 is the most catalytically active member of the ErbB family. The transduction of extracellular signals via ErbB receptors is a complex process, involving what can be considered as both lateral and vertical signaling pathways. Generally, upon ligand binding, ErbB receptors undergo autophosphorylation and dimerization to form catalytically active homo- or heterodimers, with ErbB2 being the preferred partner for the other three activated receptors (10Tzahar E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Depending on the type of dimer formed, specific sets of SH2-containing proteins interact with the dimer complex, ultimately resulting in the activation of different intracellular effector proteins, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3-K, and phospholipase C-γ. The multiplicity of ErbB receptor ligands, possible combinations of ligand-stimulated receptor dimers, and the existence of multiple downstream effector proteins, confers this family of receptors with an enormous potential for regulation and diversification of intracellular signaling pathways (9Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar,11Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E.

Although overexpression of ErbB receptors, particularly ErbB2, has been correlated with the development of epithelial tumors (15Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M25-M37PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pinkas-Kramarski R. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Mammary Gland Biol. 1997; 2: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-561PubMed Google Scholar), there is little information regarding potential roles for ErbB receptors in acute regulation of epithelial function. Therefore, in the present study, we have employed the T84 colonic epithelial cell line to examine a possible role for ErbB family members, other than the EGFR, in regulation of intestinal chloride secretion and to examine the possibility that differential formation of receptor dimer complexes may underlie the ability of the EGFR to propagate diverse inhibitory signals in response to activation of the receptor by EGF itself, or in response to transactivation by CCh. Recombinant human α-HRG (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), carbachol (Sigma), epidermal growth factor (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal anti-human EGF receptor, mouse anti-recombinant rat ErbB3 rabbit polyclonal anti-human p85, and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus (1169–1186) of human ErbB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and Tris-glycine electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) were obtained from the sources indicated. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained commercially. Methods for maintenance of T84cells in culture were as described previously (19Weymer A. Huott P. Liu W. McRoberts J.A. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, T84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (JRH, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. Cells were passaged by trypsinization. For Ussing chamber/voltage clamp experiments, approximately 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 12-mm Millicell transwell polycarbonate filters. For Western blotting/immunoprecipitation experiments, approximately 106 cells were seeded onto 30-mm Millicell transwell polycarbonate filters. Cells seeded onto filters were cultured for 10–15 days prior to use. Monolayers of T84cells were mounted in Ussing chambers (window area = 0.6 cm2) and bathed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Ringer's solution at 37 °C. The composition of the Ringer's solution was (in mm): 140 Na+, 5.2 K+, 1.2 Ca2+, 0.8 Mg2+, 120 Cl−, 25 HCO3−, 2.4 H2PO4−, 0.4 HPO42−, and 10 glucose. Monolayers were voltage-clamped to zero potential difference by the application of short-circuit current (Isc). Under these conditions, changes in Isc (ΔIsc) in response to agonists are wholly reflective of electrogenic chloride secretion (20Mandel K.G. McRoberts J.A. Beuerlein G. Foster E.S. Dharmsathaphorn K. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C486-C494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T84cell monolayers grown on filters were washed (twice) with Ringers' solution, allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated with agonists for the times indicated. The reaction was stopped by washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa+-vanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mmEDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 45 min. Cells were then scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. Samples were assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) and adjusted so that each sample contained an equal amount of protein. For immunoprecipitation studies, lysates were incubated with the appropriate dilution of immunoprecipitating antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by another 1-h incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose. Lysates were then centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were then washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in phosphate-buffered saline and were then resuspended in 2× gel loading buffer (50 mmTris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 3 min and then loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred overnight at 4 °C onto a polyvinylidene membrane (NEN Life Science Products). After transfer the membrane was preblocked with a 1% solution of blocking buffer (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min, followed by a 1-h incubation with the appropriate concentration of primary antibody in 1% blocking buffer. After washing (three times for 10 min each) in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween (TBST), membranes were then incubated for 30 min in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in 1% blocking buffer. This was followed by three 10-min washes in TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Densitometric analysis was carried out using NIH Image software. All data are expressed as means±S.E. for a series of n experiments. Student's t tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Student-Newman-Keulspost hoc test were used to compare mean values as appropriate. p values <0.05 were considered to represent significant differences. First, we set out to determine if ErbB receptors, other than the EGFR, are functionally expressed in colonic epithelial cells. To do this, we examined the effects of the ErbB3/ErbB4 ligand, α-HRG, on Isc responses to CCh across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells. Pretreatment of T84 cells with basolateral HRG (100 ng/ml; 20 min) resulted in significant attenuation of subsequent Isc responses to basolateral CCh (100 μm) (Fig.1 A). Maximal responses to CCh were 45.7 ± 4.7 μA/cm2 and 24.8 ± 2.8 μA/cm2 in the absence and presence of HRG, respectively (p < 0.001; n = 9). The effects of basolateral HRG were concentration-dependent, with a maximal effect occurring at approximately 100 ng/ml (Fig.1 B). Of note, a residual response to CCh persisted that was insensitive to even the highest concentration of HRG tested. These data are reminiscent of those previously reported for EGF (4Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HRG was without effect on CCh-stimulated Isc when added to the apical side of the monolayer. Responses to CCh (100 μm) were 48.3 ± 4.8 μA/cm2 and 44.7 ± 6.2 μA/cm2 in the absence and presence of apical HRG (100 ng/ml), respectively (n = 6). HRG alone had no effect on basal Isc. We next examined the effects of the growth factor on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T84 cells. Basolateral HRG (100 ng/ml) induced a time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of high molecular mass (∼180 kDa) proteins (Fig.2), with a maximal effect occurring at approximately 15 min. In order to determine if these proteins correspond to ErbB receptors activated in response to HRG, experiments were next carried out in which cells were stimulated with HRG (100 ng/ml); lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3; and Western blots were analyzed with anti-phosphotyrosine. HRG was found to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3, but had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig.3). Expression of ErbB4 in T84 cells was not detected (data not shown). Further experiments were carried out in which cells were stimulated with HRG (100 ng/ml), lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ErbB3, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-ErbB2. These experiments revealed that, in addition to stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and ErbB2, HRG also stimulates the formation of ErbB3/ErbB2 receptor dimers (Fig.4).Figure 3Heregulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3, but not EGFR, in T84 cells. Cells were stimulated with HRG (100 ng/ml) for the times indicated in the figure and were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies to EGFR (A), ErbB2 (B), or ErbB3 (C). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Densitometric analysis of the data is represented in panel D (n = 3–4 for each experiment). We found that, while HRG had no effect on phosphorylation of EGFR, it did stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 (p < 0.001 by ANOVA in each case). Control experiments (panel A) revealed that phosphorylation of EGFR was detected readily in lysates of cells treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 1 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Heregulin stimulates dimerization of ErbB2 and ErbB3 in T84 cells.

HRG significantly increased the co-immunoprecipitation of ErbB2 with ErbB3 (p < 0.05 by ANOVA, n = 3) with a time course similar to that seen for HRG-stimulated ErbB3 and ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation (cf. Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next went on to determine the signaling pathway mediating the effects of HRG on CCh-stimulated secretion. First, in voltage clamp experiments we found that the inhibitory effects of maximally effective concentrations of EGF (100 ng/ml) and HRG (100 ng/ml) on CCh-stimulated chloride secretion were not additive, implying EGF and HRG exert their antisecretory effects via a common signaling pathway (Fig. 5 A). Since previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that PI3-K mediates the inhibitory effects of EGF on CCh-stimulated secretion, we therefore examined a possible role for PI3-K in also mediating the inhibitory effects of HRG. Cells were stimulated with HRG (100 ng/ml), cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ErbB3 or with anti-ErbB2, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI3-K. The data demonstrate that HRG increased co-immunoprecipitation of p85 with both ErbB2 and ErbB3 (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating HRG likely stimulates activation of PI3-K. Thus, we examined the effects of the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, on HRG-mediated inhibition of CCh-stimulated chloride secretion. Pretreatment of voltage-clamped T84 cells with wortmannin (50 nm) completely reversed the inhibitory effect of HRG on CCh-stimulated Isc(Fig. 5 D). Of note, and as previously reported (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), wortmannin (50 nm) did not significantly alter responses to CCh alone. While both EGF and CCh stimulate activation of the EGFR in T84 cells, only EGF stimulates increases in PI3-K activity (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to determine if differential stimulation of ErbB receptors might underlie the ability of the EGFR to propagate diverse signals in response to stimulation by EGF versus CCh. Cells were stimulated with either CCh (100 μm) or EGF (100 ng/ml), and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. As previously reported (6Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), both CCh and EGF stimulated EGFR phosphorylation (Fig.6 A). However, only EGF stimulated an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 (Fig.6 B) and neither agonist appeared to have an effect on ErbB3 phosphorylation, although ErbB3 phosphorylation could readily be detected in HRG-stimulated cells (Fig. 6 C). In similar experiments, EGF- and CCh-stimulated T84 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR, followed by Western blotting with anti-ErbB2. Data from these studies revealed that only EGF, and not CCh, stimulated the formation of EGFR/ErbB2 receptor dimers (Fig. 7 A). Finally, experiments were carried out to determine if the apparent difference in the ability of EGF and CCh to stimulate activation of ErbB2 might underlie the difference in their ability to stimulate PI3-K. T84 cell monolayers were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) or CCh (100 μm), and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to EGFR or ErbB2. Western blots were then probed with antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI3-K. We found that, although both EGF and CCh stimulated recruitment of p85 to the EGFR (Fig.7 B), only EGF stimulated the recruitment of p85 to ErbB2 (Fig. 7 C). In the present study we provide further evidence that the ErbB family of growth factor receptors plays an important role in regulation of intestinal epithelial ion transport. In addition to the EGFR, we have shown that colonic epithelial cells also express ErbB3 and ErbB2 and that activation of these receptors with HRG, a growth factor that is expressed in the intestinal mucosa (21Kataoka H. Joh T. Kasugai K. Okayama N. Moriyama A. Asai K. Kato T. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), results in inhibition of calcium-dependent chloride secretory responses. In vivo, such an effect on chloride secretion would be accompanied by a reduction in net fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen. The effects of HRG appear to be mediated by the formation of ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor dimers, since HRG increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both these receptor types and increased co-immunoprecipitation of ErbB2 with ErbB3. Since no known ligands bind directly to ErbB2, the formation of ErbB2/ErbB3 dimers is likely brought about by HRG first binding to ErbB3 followed by recruitment of ErbB2 to form the receptor dimer complex. This particular dimer combination has been shown to mediate the effects of HRG in many other cell types and is believed to be the most catalytically active of ErbB dimer complexes (7Carraway K.L.

It is also noteworthy that, in T84 cells, HRG did not stimulate phosphorylation of the EGFR, indicating that there is a similar selectivity and specificity of growth factor/ErbB receptor interactions in the intestinal epithelium to that seen in other tissues (9Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 14Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the effects of HRG in inhibiting CCh-stimulated chloride secretion appear to be mediated via stimulation of PI3-K activity, an enzyme that mediates the effects of HRG in several other cell types (18Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-561PubMed Google Scholar, 23Carraway III, K.L. Soltoff S.P. Diamonti A.J. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

This conclusion is based on the observations that (i) the inhibitory effects of HRG and EGF on CCh-stimulated secretion were not additive, implying a common mechanism of action, (ii) HRG stimulated the recruitment of PI3-K to the ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor complex, and (iii) an inhibitor of PI3-K activity, wortmannin (26Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazaki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), completely reversed the inhibitory effects of HRG on CCh-stimulated secretion. Although wortmannin has been demonstrated to alter the activities of other enzymes, such as phospholipase D and phospholipase A2 (33Reinhold S.L. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that either of these enzymes are involved in mediating the effects of HRG on chloride secretion since both phospholipase A2 and phospholipase D potentiate, rather than inhibit, calcium-dependent secretory responses (35Barrett K.E. Bigby T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C446-C452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Vajanaphanich M. Kachintorn U. Barrett K.E. Cohn J.A. Dharmsathaphorn K. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Am J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1210-C1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How PI3-K might exert an inhibitory effect on chloride secretion is currently unknown, but studies from our laboratory indicate that EGF-stimulated PI3-K activity may target basolateral K+ channels to inhibit the extrusion of K+ across the basolateral membrane, a step that is essential for epithelial chloride secretion to occur (3Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1069-C1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that this effect of PI3-K may, in turn, be mediated by protein kinase C since this enzyme also appears to have a role in negative regulation of epithelial secretion and has been shown to function downstream of PI3-K in other cell types (27Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 28Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Hishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Studies are currently under way in our laboratory to more fully elucidate possible interactions between PI3-K, protein kinase C, and epithelial transport processes in T84 cells. The present studies demonstrate that, depending on the activating agonist, stimulation of the EGFR results in the formation of different receptor dimer complexes. Activation of the EGFR by its cognate ligand, EGF, not only leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, but also results in increased phosphorylation of ErbB2, accompanied by the formation of EGFR/ErbB2 receptor dimer complexes. The formation of this complex is rapid, occurring within 1 min, is stable for prolonged periods of time, and thus mirrors the time course of the inhibitory effects of EGF on calcium-stimulated chloride secretion (4Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, transactivation of the EGFR by CCh is not accompanied by appreciable stimulation of ErbB2 phosphorylation nor does it bring about the formation of EGFR/ErbB2 receptor dimers. This is in contrast to previous studies in rat fibroblasts where G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, such as lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin, were found to stimulate both EGFR and ErbB2 phosphorylation (30Daub H. Weiss U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). This apparent difference in the responsiveness of ErbB2 receptors to G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts and colonic epithelial cells underlines the inherently heterogenous nature of signaling within the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. It is not yet clear how activation of the EGFR by EGF itself, or transactivation by CCh, leads to differential phosphorylation of ErbB2 and recruitment to the EGFR. However, it is likely that this may be due to differential phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the EGFR (13Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Whereas the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR mediates autophosphorylation of the receptor in response to EGF, a different mechanism exists for EGFR phosphorylation in response to G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, which may involve Src family tyrosine kinases as signaling intermediates (31van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 32Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These two different mechanisms for EGFR activation presumably result in different patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation, which, in turn, may dictate the nature of receptor dimers formed, and/or signaling proteins recruited, in response to stimulation by different agonists (13Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since only EGF, and not CCh, stimulated recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3-K to ErbB2, our current data suggest that it is this difference in ErbB2 activation and recruitment to the EGFR that likely underlies the ability of the EGFR to differentially signal to PI3-K in response to EGF and CCh in T84 cells (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting to note that, even though it does not stimulate the lipid kinase activity of the enzyme, CCh does induce association of PI3-K with the EGFR. This is in agreement with our previous data, which showed that CCh increases the amount of both the p85 and p110 subunits of PI3-K in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from T84 cells (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, even though CCh stimulates PI3-K recruitment to the EGFR, it is unclear what the physiological significance of this effect may be since, as mentioned above, it does not appear to stimulate the lipid kinase activity of the enzyme (5Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that, in addition to the EGFR, T84 colonic epithelial cells also express the ErbB2 and ErbB3 members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Similar to EGF, treatment of T84 cells with the ErbB3 ligand, HRG, results in inhibition of subsequent calcium-dependent chloride secretory responses. The effects of HRG appear to be mediated by the recruitment of PI3-K to ErbB3/ErbB2 receptor dimers. As depicted in Fig. 8, we propose that ErbB receptor expression in the intestinal epithelium may provide a means by which diversification, and integration, of antisecretory signaling pathways can be achieved in response to different growth factors and hormones. These studies, along with emerging evidence to suggest a potential role for growth factors, such as EGF, in healing mucosal ulcers associated with intestinal inflammation (37Ribbons K.A. Howarth G.S.

https://openalex.org/W2007295854,"Purification and characterization of enzymes metabolizing retinaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and octanaldehyde from four human livers and three kidneys were done to identify enzymes metabolizing retinaldehyde and their relationship to enzymes metabolizing other aldehydes. The tissue fractionation patterns from human liver and kidney were the same, indicating presence of the same enzymes in human liver and kidney. Moreover, in both organs the major NAD(+)-dependent retinaldehyde activity copurified with the propionaldehyde and octanaldehyde activities; in both organs the major NAD(+)-dependent retinaldehyde activity was associated with the E1 isozyme (coded for by aldh1 gene) of human aldehyde dehydrogenase. A small amount of NAD(+)-dependent retinaldehyde activity was associated with the E2 isozyme (product of aldh2 gene) of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Some NAD(+)-independent retinaldehyde activity in both organs was associated with aldehyde oxidase, which could be easily separated from dehydrogenases. Employing cellular retinoid-binding protein (CRBP), purified from human liver, demonstrated that E1 isozyme (but not E2 isozyme) could utilize CRBP-bound retinaldehyde as substrate, a feature thought to be specific to retinaldehyde dehydrogenases. This is the first report of CRBP-bound retinaldehyde functioning as substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase of broad substrate specificity. Thus, it is concluded that in the human organism, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (coded for by raldH1 gene) and broad substrate specificity E1 (a member of EC 1. 2.1.3 aldehyde dehydrogenase family) are the same enzyme. These results suggest that the E1 isozyme may be more important to alcoholism than the acetaldehyde-metabolizing enzyme, E2, because competition between acetaldehyde and retinaldehyde could result in abnormalities associated with vitamin A metabolism and alcoholism."

Wright E.G. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1997; 78: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been hampered by the numerous technical difficulties associated with primary adult stem cells such as the near impossibility of homogeneously purifying the stem cell for molecular analysis. To facilitate such studies, we have attempted to adapt the murine embryonal stem (ES)1 cell system (2Robertson E.J. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRC Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar) as an in vitro model of hemopoietic stem cell generation and function. ES cells are derived from the day 3.5 murine blastocyst and are totipotent, having the full capacity to generate all tissue of a mature mouse (3Nagy A. Gocza E. Diaz E.M. Prideaux V.R. Ivanya E. Rossant J. Development. 1990; 110: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haematol. 1997; 10: 467-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition to allowing development in utero, ES cells will also differentiate in vitro and will commit to a range of embryological lineages, notably the hemopoietic and cardiac lineages (6Doetschman T.C. Eisetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar, 7Burkert U. Von Ruden T. Wagner E.F.

We have now mapped out the time course of generation of hemopoietic stem cells in the differentiating ES cell system and have reported that while up to 3 days after initiation of differentiation there are no stem cells detected in the developing ES cell population, by 5 days there are a number of primitive and committed stem cells detectable in the in vitro populations (11Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This in vitro system therefore allows a temporal separation of hemopoietic stem cells from their immediate precursors, and we have now used techniques of subtractive hybridization (12Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) to attempt to investigate alterations in gene expression that are concomitant with the onset of hemopoiesis in this model. 2J. W. Baird and G. J. Graham, manuscript in preparation. 2J. W. Baird and G. J. Graham, manuscript in preparation. During our analysis of the subtracted library, we identified a cDNA fragment that had homology with members of the chemokine family of proinflammatory mediators. This is a large family of related proteins that is defined on the basis of sequence homology and on the presence of positionally conserved cysteine residues (13Rollins B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). The chemokine superfamily is subdivided into four smaller subfamilies (α, β, γ, δ), with the α and β families being by far the most populous. These two subfamilies are defined by the specific cysteine motif that they bear: the α-chemokine family bears a … CXC … C … C … motif, while the β-chemokine family has a … CC … C … C … motif. Typically, members of the chemokine family are active as inflammatory mediators; however, numerous other functions such as proliferative control and regulation of angiogenesis have been demonstrated. The chemokines articulate their functions through members of the seven transmembrane-spanning family of G protein-coupled receptors. Numerous receptors have been characterized for members of these families, and most of these receptors display a marked promiscuity (15Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The novel chemokine identified in the ES cell subtracted library is a member of the β-chemokine family and shows weak homology to the chemokines LARC and TECK. This novel chemokine, which we have labeled ESkine, is structurally unique among known chemokines, has a highly divergent sequence, and overlaps at its 3′-end with a murine interleukin 11 receptor α (IL11Rα) homologue on murine chromosome 4. ESkine is generated as two alternatively spliced, differentially expressed variants. One of these variants carries a classical signal peptide, which presumably allows for release from mammalian cells and which targets ESkine to the Golgi as determined by GFP fusion protein analysis. However, the alternative form, which we refer to as PESKY, lacks the signal peptide, encoding in its place a charged domain, making it unlikely that this variant is secreted via classical endocytic pathways from mammalian cells. In fact, studies using a PESKY/GFP fusion construct indicate that PESKY translocates to the nucleus, which is maintained as its major domain of expression. These two alternatively spliced variants are expressed at discrete tissue loci, with the secretable ESkine being predominantly expressed in the placenta and PESKY being predominantly expressed in the testes and brain. Bioassays indicate the mature ESkine protein to be active in inducing polarization and locomotion of activated CD4+ T cells. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized from the EST sequences for the isolation of full-length clones of both ESkine and PESKY: 5′ ESkine, 5′-CTCTAGGCTGAGTGAGCATG-3′; 5′ PESKY, 5′-GGAAAGACGGTAGAATTTG-3′; 3′ ESkine and PESKY, 5′-TTGGAGATTGTCGTCTAATG-3′. Total RNA for the PCR was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. Day 12.5 murine placental RNA was used to isolate the ESkine cDNA, whereas murine testes RNA was used to isolate the PESKY cDNA. The RNA was DNase I-treated as described previously (16Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang M.L-S. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S.

The reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using the RNA PCR core kit (Perkin-Elmer). PCR was carried out usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and proceeded for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were cloned into pCRscript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced in both directions using the ABI 373A sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All RNA samples were generated using TRIZOL (Life Technologies Inc.). For tissue blots, tissues were removed from 6-week-old C57/Bl mice and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction. For embryo and placental RNA generation, timed matings were initiated, and pregnant mice were sacrificed at the required time points. Placenta and embryos were separated, and RNA was generated from both at each time point. For Northern blotting, the cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Ready-to-go kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using NICK columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probes were denatured at 100 °C for 3 min prior to hybridization. For specific detection of ESkine or PESKY sequences, the alternative 5′ exons were subcloned into pCRscript and subsequently radiolabeled as cDNA fragments using the Ready-to-go kit. For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA, isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) was fractionated on a 1.2% denaturing gel and subsequently blotted by capillary action onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). Blotted membranes were UV-cross-linked using a Stratalinker. Prehybridization and hybridization were both carried out in Express-Hyb (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and the blots were washed, following hybridization, as recommended by the suppliers. Membranes were exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film and stripped in 0.1% SDS at 100 °C prior to reprobing. Genomic localization of the murine ESkine sequence was carried out using a mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel supplied by the UK HGMP resource center. This approach involves attempts to detect the murine gene in a range of murine/hamster somatic cell hybrids using PCR. For the PCR, the following primers were used: 5′ primer, 5′-CTCTAGGCTGAGTGAGCATG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TTGGAGATTGTCGTCTAATG-3′. PCR was performed using 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each dNTP from the PCR core kit (Perkin-Elmer), and 0.15 μm of the 5′ and 3′ primers. Reactions were incubated for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Products from the PCRs were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel. The genomic fragment encoding ESkine and PESKY was generated by PCR. This approach assumed the PESKY cDNA sequence to contain the most 5′ sequence stretches within the genomic locus, and thus the 5′ genomic primer was designed using the 5′ noncoding sequences of PESKY. Since both PESKY and ESkine have identical 3′ sequences, a common 3′ primer was generated based on the 3′ noncoding sequences at this position. These primers were used in a PCR utilizing Pfu polymerase and genomic DNA from C3H mice. The generated fragment (approximately 2 kilobase pairs) was sequenced in both orientations, and a representative genomic map of the ESkine/PESKY locus was created. For analysis of the subcellular fates of ESkine and PESKY, the full-length coding sequences were cloned in frame into the pEGFP-N1 expression vector (CLONTECH), which places the GFP at the carboxyl terminus of the translated proteins. For transient transfections, HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 mm glutamine. 5 × 104 cells were plated onto single well chambered slides in 3 ml of culture medium and left overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 6 μl of Fugene was added dropwise on to 94 μl of serum-free media and left for 5 min at room temperature. This Fugene mix was then added to 1.5 μg of DNA (for transfection) and allowed to stand for 15 min. This was then added to the cells in the chambered slides. Transfection was allowed to proceed for 24 h. After 24 h, the cells were washed in PBS twice and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. They were washed again in PBS and treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then mounted in Vectastain containing propidium iodide (1.5 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories). Preparations were examined on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal attached to a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Images were taken with a × 60 oil immersion lens. This assay measures the change from a spherical shape to the shape characterized by head-tail polarity, typical of locomotive cells (18Haston W.S. Shields J.M. J. Immunol.

PBMCs were isolated using density gradient separation (Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Birmingham, UK) and washed in RPMI 1640 (ICN, Flow, High Wycombe, UK). Cells were used either directly or cultured overnight (3–4 × 106cells/ml in a round bottom polystyrene tube, 17 × 100 mm) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in medium containing staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, 1 μg/ml; Sigma; Ref. 21Newman I. Wilkinson P.C. Immunology. 1996; 87: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Medium was made up of RPMI supplemented with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) (all from Life Technologies). For the polarization assay, freshly isolated or overnight cultured PBMCs (2 × 105 cells/0.2 ml) in conical base plastic tubes (110 × 16 mm) were exposed for 30 min at 37 °C to graded concentrations of ESkine, interleukin 8, or medium alone. The cells were then fixed by adding an equal volume of 2.5% gluteraldehyde (Sigma), and the proportions of cells showing the head-tail polarization typical of locomotive cells were determined. The proportion of cells scored as either spherical (nonmotile) or polarized (motile) was counted directly using a × 40 phase-contrast objective. 250–300 cells were counted blind, and polarized cells were expressed as a percentage of viable cells. For phenotyping, fixed cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD19, -CD14, or -CD45 (Sigma) and scored under a fluorescent phase contrast microscope (× 40). The percentages of total PMBC expressing each of the phenotypic stains were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Rat tail collagen (type I) was prepared in solution from freshly obtained rat tail tendons by established methods (22Haston W.S. Shields J.M. Wilkinson P.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 92: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Komai-Koma M. Liew F.Y. Wilkinson P.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1110-1116PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were formed by bringing soluble collagen (1.5 mg/ml) in dilute acetic acid solution back to physiologic pH and osmolarity, and ESkine (to 1 ng/ml) or human serum albumin in culture medium were added prior to gelatinization. PBMCs were prepared and activated with SEB as described above. They were washed and overlaid on the gel in 24-well dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h to allow the cells to invade the gel. The proportion of invading cells was determined by scoring the number of cells remaining on top of the gel and the number of cells that had penetrated the gel, counting a minimum of 200 cells with an inverted microscope. The proportion of locomotor cells was calculated from the ratio between the numbers of invasive and noninvasive cells. Initial data base searching with one of the clones (JB438) from the ES cell subtracted library identified numerous homologous ESTs in the murine data base. These ESTs have high homology (82%) to the extreme 3′-end of exon 13 in the untranslated region of the murine interleukin 11 receptor α-chain (24Bilinski P. Hall M.A. Neuhaus H. Gissel C. Heath J.K. Ghossler A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Robb L. Hilton D.J. Wilson T.A. Begley C.G. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and it was initially assumed that JB438 represented a novel, highly conserved, member of this receptor family. Surprisingly, closer analysis of JB438 and the related ESTs indicated that while the homology with the IL11Rα gene was identifiable in one reading orientation, conceptual translation of the cDNAs in the reverse orientation indicated that JB438 and the homologous ESTs encode a novel member of the β-chemokine family. We have labeled this chemokine ESkine. The murine IL11Rα family are known to reside on chromosome 4 in the mouse (27Mock B.A. Hirano M.C. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 8: S68-S90Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and using mouse/hamster cell hybrids we have demonstrated specific detection of ESkine on murine chromosome 4. Thus, ESkine and the IL11Rα homologue lie within the same locus in the murine genome and appear to be transcribed in different directions along chromosome 4, with ESkine overlapping with the extreme 3′-end of the IL11Rα homologue (Fig. 1). The overlap with the homologous regions of the published murine IL11Rα gene encompasses 149 bases of the 3′-untranslated region of the receptor gene. The complementary 149 bases of ESkine include 126 bases of sequence encoding the region of the mature protein from CVH … to … QQQN (see Fig. 2 a). Thus, a substantial portion of the 3′ ESkine coding sequence overlaps with the 3′-untranslated region of the putative novel receptor.Figure 2Sequences of ESkine and PESKY. a, the full-length cDNA and protein sequence for ESkine.

The predicted protein has a 24-amino acid leader sequence with cleavage being predicted between alanine 24 and leucine 25. The predicted mature ESkine is 95 amino acids in length, is highly basic with a net charge of +8, and possesses a putative N-linked glycosylation site beyond the fourth cysteine residue in the mature protein. The CC motif confirms ESkine as a β-chemokine, and data base searching reveals weak homologies (33–36%) to the β-chemokines LARC (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H.

Hedrick J.A. Foster J.S. Singh K.P. Menon S. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Bacon K.B. Zlotnik A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 291-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Additional similarities to TECK include the fact that the sequence between cysteines 2 and 3 is slightly longer than that seen in other β-chemokines (27 amino acids compared with 24 or fewer). Additionally, ESkine shares with TECK an elongated C-terminal tail. Signal peptidase cleavage at the predicted site reveals two sequential recognition sites for cleavage by the protease CD26 (LPLP … ), which cleaves at the amino terminus of proteins in which the second amino acid residue is a proline. Chemokines with proline residues at this position are known substrates for this enzyme and indeed cleavage by CD26 can markedly alter chemokine function (30Oravecz T. Pall M. Rodriquez G.

Intriguingly, JB438 also detects other ESTs within the murine data bases, and one of these (AA271042) encodes the full sequence of a variant of ESkine (Fig. 2 b). This variant encodes the full-length of the mature protein but has lost the signal peptide, replacing it with an alternative stretch of 32 amino acids. This novel amino-terminal stretch has not been seen in any other chemokines, has no homologies in any data bases, and is not predicted to act as a signal peptide. Furthermore, no other subcellular targeting signatures were detected in this alternative amino-terminal sequence. We have labeled this alternative, presumably nonsecretable (see below), isoform of ESkine PESKY. Analysis of nonmurine ESTs reveals the existence of a close rat homologue (GenBankTM accession number AI058901), which, as shown, is 87% identical and 88% similar to the mature murine protein (Fig. 2 c). Sequences 5′ to the sequences shown in Fig.2 c indicate that this EST encodes the rat homologue of PESKY, and thus far the direct rat ESkine homologue has not been reported. Like its murine counterpart, the rat homologue is highly basic with an overall charge of +11. Additionally, the rat protein has maintained the two potential CD26 cleavage sites and the putativeN-linked glycosylation site. In addition to this rat orthologue, conceptual translation of the reverse orientation of the 3′-untranslated region of the human IL11Rα genomic sequence (accession number HSU32323) reveals the presence of an ESkine homologue at this position also. The sequence of the presumed protein encoded by this genomic sequence is shown in Fig. 2 c and, as can be seen, displays 62% identity and 73% similarity with murine ESkine over the deduced sequence. Intriguingly, the putative glycosylation site conserved in murine and rat ESkine is altered from NRS to NPS in the human protein. The presence of a proline residue in this motif makes it unlikely that it will be used as a glycosylation site in the human protein (33Shakin-Eshelman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Insufficient N-terminal sequence information is available to confirm the maintenance of the double CD26 cleavage site in this protein. The presence of two alternative isoforms of murine ESkine suggests differential splicing, and to attempt to understand this process we have sequenced approximately 2 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence incorporating the ESkine/PESKY gene. As shown in Fig.3, the exon-intron structure predicts the PESKY-specific 5′ exon (exon Ia) to be the most 5′ within the genomic locus. This is then followed by the ESkine alternative exon (exon Ib) and subsequently by the common exons encoding the mature chemokine. ESkine/PESKY is therefore unprecedented, since this is the first example of differential splicing of this nature and of the inclusion of PESKY-like amino-terminal sequences within the chemokine family. Preliminary analysis of the expression of ESkine and PESKY using the JB438 sequence, which encodes the third and fourth exons, common to both ESkine and PESKY, as a probe on murine tissue dot blots, indicated expression of ESkine/PESKY in murine embryos as early as day 7.5 and additionally in testes and weakly at other body sites (Fig.4 a). The small number of cells associated with a day 7.5 murine embryo prompted us to look more closely at the site of expression here, and we have now demonstrated, again using the common cDNA portion as a probe, that the expression is predominantly in the placental tissue and is seen only weakly in the embryo (data not shown). It is of interest to note that murine IL11Rα is also expressed in the placenta (34Bilinski P. Roopenian D. Gossler A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2234-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); however, we have ensured specific detection of ESkine by using probes capable of discriminating between ESkine and the murine IL11Rα homologue on blots. Repeated attempts to RACE the full-length ESkine/PESKY cDNAs from the placenta and the testes revealed that consistently, ESkine was detected in the placenta but not the testes, while PESKY was detected in the testes but not the placenta. This suggested differential expression of these two isoforms and indicates that the expression detected in the placenta using ESkine/PESKY common sequences is a consequence of ESkine expression at this site. We have now confirmed this, and analysis of expression in the embryo and the placenta using probes specific for the alternative 5′ exons of PESKY and ESkine revealed ESkine to be undetectable in the embryo but to be expressed at high levels in the placenta (Fig. 4 b). Curiously, analysis of PESKY expression indicates absence in the placenta but its expression, albeit weak, in the embryo (Fig. 4 b). Further tissue analysis using Northern blotting has failed to detect expression of ESkine-specific sequences in other tissues (data not shown). However, PESKY-specific sequences are readily detectable in the brain and testes and are weakly expressed in kidney and liver (Fig. 4 c). It thus appears that ESkine and PESKY are produced through alternative splicing mechanisms and that these splice variants are predominantly expressed at distinct tissue loci. More sensitive techniques of PCR have revealed low level expression of PESKY in heart and muscle tissue, and, while PCR has not revealed additional sites for ESkine expression, numerous ESkine like ESTs have been reported as being derived from epidermal tissues; thus, the skin is a likely source for ESkine expression. To attempt to examine the impact of the alternative first exon usage on ESkine/PESKY subcellular targeting, we have generated fusion cDNAs in which the coding sequence for the GFP is positioned in frame with the C terminus of ESkine or PESKY. Transfection of these fusion constructs into HEK cells revealed discrete subcellular destinations for the ESkine/GFP and PESKY/GFP protein products. As shown in Fig.5 a, ESkine targets the GFP protein to a perinuclear location that has been revealed as the Golgi apparatus by co-staining with the Golgi-specific BODIPY-TR stain (data not shown). Additionally, weak fluorescence is detected throughout the cytoplasm concomitant with the processing of this secreted chemokine through the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, PESKY is seen to target the fluorescence specifically to the nucleus (Fig.5 b) as shown by both phase contrast microscopy and co-localization with propidium iodide staining. Little PESKY-directed fluorescence is detected in other subcellular positions (Fig.5 b). A control GFP-expressing construct failed to target the GFP to any specific loci, and fluorescence is seen throughout the control transfected cells (Fig. 5 c). Identical results have been obtained using both COS and CHO cell transfectants, confirming that these subcellular targeting differences are not exclusive to HEK cells (data not shown). Thus, the differential splicing outlined in Fig. 3 yields two variants of the same chemokine that are different"

The mechanisms involved in regulating monocyte/macrophage TNFα production are not yet fully understood but are thought to involve both soluble factors and cell/cell contact with other cell types. Ligation of certain cell surface receptors, namely CD45, CD44, and CD58, can induce the production of TNFα in monocytes. In this paper, we investigate further the signaling pathways utilized by cell surface receptors (specifically CD45) to induce monocyte TNFα and compare the common/unique pathways involved with that of lipopolysaccharide. The results indicate that monocyte TNFα induced upon CD45 ligation or lipopolysaccharide stimulation is differentially modulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and nuclear factor-κB but similarly regulated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results demonstrate that both common and unique signaling pathways are utilized by different stimuli for the induction of TNFα. These observations may have a major bearing on approaches to inhibiting TNFα production in disease where the cytokine has a pathogenic role.

While ligation of CD45 on monocytes has been shown to induce synthesis of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) (18Webb D.S.A. Shimizu Y.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 1354-1361PubMed Google Scholar), the signaling mechanisms involved and the functional relevance of CD45 on monocyte/macrophages remain unclear.We have investigated the signaling pathways utilized upon CD45 ligation on monocytes leading to TNFα production and compared this with the conventional stimulus, LPS. We demonstrate that CD45 ligation (but not LPS) activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and that inhibitors of PI3K activation block CD45- but not LPS-induced TNFα synthesis. The differences in signaling also extended to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which, unlike LPS, was not required by CD45-induced TNFα synthesis. In contrast, CD45, like LPS, activated p38 MAPK.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we investigated the signaling pathway(s) involved in monocyte TNFα production following ligation of the cell surface receptor CD45 or LPS. Our results reveal the unexpected finding that CD45 ligation results in TNFα production that is dependent upon the activation of PI3 kinase but independent of the transcription factor NF-κB. In contrast, LPS-induced TNFα production was dependent upon NF-κB activation as previously reported (37Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. de Martin C. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) while PI3K-independent. These observations indicate that, while NF-κB has previously been shown to be important in TNFα production, it is not always necessary/required.The importance of the cell surface receptor, CD45 in the activation of T and B cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathways and subsequent cellular responses has been well documented.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 1354-1361PubMed Google Scholar); however, the signaling pathways utilized upon CD45 ligation in monocytes have received little attention.Ligation of monocyte CD45 results in activation of PI3K and the known downstream effectors PKB and p70 S6K. We have shown the anti-CD45-induced monocyte TNFα production is inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002. However the inhibitor of p70 S6K activation, rapamycin, did not inhibit anti-CD45-induced TNFα production. These findings suggest that TNFα production is p70 S6K-independent and other, as yet unidentified, downstream components of PI3K pathway are involved.In contrast, wortmannin but not LY294002 enhanced LPS-induced monocyte TNFα production, suggesting that the effects observed with wortmannin are not specific to PI3K activation. Wortmannin has other targets including PLA2 (47Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and we have shown that the PLA2 inhibitor, AKTA, also enhances LPS-induced TNFα production in monocytes,3 suggesting that the effect of wortmannin on LPS-induced TNFα production may be due to PLA2 inhibition. How PLA2 negatively regulates TNFα production is unclear, but this enzyme is required for synthesis of PGE2, an inhibitor of TNFα production (48Rola-Pleszczynski M. Thivierge M. Gagnon N. Lacasse C. Stankova J. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 6: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin is known to stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase pathway (49Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y. Taneja N. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Woodgett J. Avruch T. Kyriakis J. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18871-18874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and this may also have a positive effect on TNFα production. Furthermore, we observed only a weak increase in PI3K and p70 S6K activity following LPS stimulation, suggesting that neither of these pathways play a major role in LPS-mediated events in monocytes. These findings contradict with those performed by Herrera et al.(38Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1157-1165PubMed Google Scholar), in which LPS was demonstrated to induce PI3K activity in monocytes, using similar methods to those described here. The reason for these apparently contradicting findings remain unclear. These studies have focused upon class 1A PI3Ks, specifically those involving the p85α subunit and the involvement of other PI3K subclasses including those regulated by G-proteins and those which are wortmannin-insensitive have not been investigated.p70 S6K and PKB are known downstream effectors of PI3K (39Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 40Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

Calvo V. Wood M. Bierer B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, our studies indicate that CD45-induced TNFα production in monocytes is p70 S6K-independent. Furthermore, while ligation of CD45 induces phosphorylation of PKB, the involvement of PKB in monocyte TNFα production at this stage cannot be verified due to the lack of specific PKB inhibitors. These findings indicate that there must be a bifurcation of the signaling pathways downstream of PI3K that regulate TNFα production. Several signaling molecules have been shown to directly and/or indirectly regulate PI3K, leading to the activation of transcription factors, e.g. atypical PKCζ and PKCλ. (52Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, inhibitors of PKC were found to be toxic to monocytes and as such the involvement of PKC in anti-CD45-induced TNFα production has not been assessed. Other potential downstream effectors include Rac, Rab5 (53Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. et al.Curr.

The involvement of these molecules in PI3K-dependent TNFα production still remains to be determined.Several studies have suggested that LPS-induced TNFα production in monocytes/macrophages is NF-κB-dependent. Protease inhibitors, gliotoxin, and free radical scavengers have all been used to block NF-κB activity; however, the lack of specificity of these reagents remains a constant problem. More recently, the over expression of IκBα following adenoviral infection (AdvIκBα) has been demonstrated to inhibit LPS-induced TNFα production in monocytes (37Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. de Martin C. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Curiously, we demonstrated that ligation of CD45 induced IκBα degradation (results not shown) but only a weak NF-κB binding activity; the reasons for this remain unclear, although it suggests further complexity of the NF-κB system. Overexpression of AdvIκBα did not inhibit anti-CD45-induced TNFα production. These findings indicate that other, as yet unidentified, transcription factors are involved in anti-CD45-induced TNFα production monocytes.In T cells, induction of TNFα gene expression is regulated by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), not NF-κB (59Goldfeld A.E. Strominger J.L. Doyle C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 60Goldfeld A.E. Tsai E. Kincaid R. Belshaw P.J. Schrieber S.L. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp.

NFAT binds to the κ3 element of the TNFα gene (located −97 and −88 nucleotides relative to the TNFα start site), in association with ATF-2 and c-Jun proteins, which bind to the cyclic AMP response element site (62Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). NFAT DNA binding activity in activated T cells is prevented by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA), and FK506 (63Mattila P.S. Ullman K.S. Fiering S. Emmel E.A. McCutcheon M. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 64Brabletz T. Pietrowski I. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 61Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CsA and FK506 form complexes with their intracellular receptors (immunophilins), and inhibit the activity of calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B), a ubiquitous calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase (reviewed in Ref. 65Liu J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 290-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Induction of TNFα mRNA gene transcription in T cells can be blocked by CsA and FK506 (62Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and expression of calcineurin is sufficient to activate a reporter gene whose transcription is driven by the TNFα promoter (60Goldfeld A.E. Tsai E. Kincaid R. Belshaw P.J. Schrieber S.L. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The involvement of NFAT in monocyte TNFα production remains to be confirmed. However, CsA and FK506 failed to inhibit anti-CD45-induced TNFα production in monocytes (results not shown), but this does not discount the involvement of CsA-insensitive NFAT in the regulation of monocyte TNFα production. These findings suggest that NFAT, like NF-κB, is not required for anti-CD45-induced TNFα production.LPS has previously been shown to activate the three major mammalian MAPK pathways, p42/44 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2), p38, and p54 MAPK (stress-activated protein kinase), in monocyte/macrophages (9Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J.

However, the relationship between the activation of these signaling molecules cytokine expression remains to be clarified. p38 MAPK is the only kinase that has been shown to play a pivotal role in the production of TNFα (66Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the post-transcriptional regulation of TNFα is mediated through adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich elements present within the 3′-untranslated region of the TNFα mRNA (67Kruys V. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Deletion of this region leads to the constitutive synthesis of TNFα in cell lines (68Kruys V. Kemmer K. Shakhov A. Jongeneel V. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and transgenic animals (69Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). TNFα reporter gene constructs that do not contain the 3′-AU-rich element regions lose their sensitivity to inhibition by the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and it has been suggested that the p38 MAPK cascade is mediating the release of translational repression of TNFα (66Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar). The pyridinyl imidazole compound, SB203580, has been used to determine the involvement of p38 MAPK in the regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα (9Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Recently, SB203580 has been shown to inhibit TNFα protein and mRNA induced by LPS, suggesting that TNFα is being inhibited at the pre-translational level (70Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 71Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that monocyte TNFα production is regulated by distinct transcriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that both LPS- and anti-CD45-induced TNFα production is regulated by p38 MAPK suggesting that both stimuli utilize similar translational mechanisms to regulate TNFα production. We observed that ligation of CD45 resulted in activation of the MAPKs p38 and p42/p44 (results not shown) with similar kinetics to that observed with LPS. Furthermore, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) and p42/44 MAPK (PD98059) (results not shown) were shown to block both anti-CD45 and LPS-induced TNFα production. At higher concentrations SB203580 is known to inhibit the activity of JNK2 and JNK3 (72Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar); however, the IC50 values observed for SB203580 inhibition of anti-CD45- and LPS-induced monocyte TNFα synthesis are consistent with its effects on p38 MAPK and not JNK, although the nonspecific actions of this drugs cannot be disregarded. These findings indicate that TNFα production is regulated by distinct transcriptional signaling mechanisms, while the translational mechanisms appear to be identical.In summary, this study demonstrates that TNFα production in monocytes is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. The initiating signals for TNFα production in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. However, these findings suggest that engagement of specific cell surface receptors may be important in regulating TNFα production via distinct signaling pathways and investigation of these mechanisms in both physiological and pathological systems is currently being investigated. 4F.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is one of the most potent activators of monocytes/macrophages, resulting in the triggering of a range of cellular responses and the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 (1Cavaillon J.M.

A variety of T cell-associated cell surface receptors/ligands including CD69, CD40L, CD11b, and CD2 are thought to be important in modulating this monocyte cytokine production (13Manie S. Kubar J.

The reactivity of mutants toward the membrane-anchored complex photosystem I was analyzed by laser flash absorption spectroscopy. The experimental results indicate that cytochrome c 6 possesses two areas involved in the redox interaction with photosystem I: 1) a positively charged patch that may drive its electrostatic attractive movement toward photosystem I to form a transient complex and 2) a hydrophobic region at the edge of the heme pocket that may provide the contact surface for the transfer of electrons to P700.

According to our laser flash-induced kinetic studies, the reaction mechanism of PSI reduction follows three different models: type I, which involves an oriented collision between the two redox partners; type II, which proceeds through the formation of a transient complex prior to electron transfer; and type III, which requires an additional rearrangement step so as to make the redox centers orientate properly within the complex (9Hervás M.

Aspartates 70 and 72 appear to be located in a negatively charged region of Cyt c 6that may be isofunctional with the well known “south-east” acidic patch of plastocyanin. In addition, Phe-64 (which is close to the heme group and could be the counterpart of Tyr-83 in plastocyanin (19Ullmann G.M. Hauswald M. Jensen A. Kostic N.M. Knapp E.-W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16187-16196Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) does not appear to be involved in the electron transfer to PSI. In contrast, Arg-67, which is located at the edge of the Cytc 6 acidic area, seems to be crucial. This paper reports the kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of PSI reduction by a set of site-directed mutants of AnabaenaCyt c 6. The results demonstrate that a single mutation of specific residues in the hydrophobic or positively charged area of Cyt c 6 can promote drastic changes in the reaction mechanism. The two functional areas of Cytc 6 involved in PSI photoreduction have been identified. The hemeprotein from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 was purified as described previously (11Medina M. Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Gómez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but with slight modifications. Cytc 6 samples were applied to a CM-cellulose column after oxidation with potassium ferricyanide. Elution of the adsorbed proteins was performed with a 50 μm potassium ferricyanide solution in a linear gradient of 2–30 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The fractions containing pure Cytc 6 were pooled, concentrated on an Amicon pressure-dialysis cell fitted with a YM-10 membrane, and stored at −80 °C. Cyt c 6 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorption coefficient of 26.2 mm−1 cm−1 at 553 nm for the reduced protein (20Medina M. Louro R.O. Gagnon J. Peleato M.L. Mendes J. Gómez-Moreno C. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 225-234Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutant petJ genes were constructed by polymerase chain reaction with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) using oligonucleotides of 32 base pairs, 15 ng of DNA templates, and 12 min of extension time. The previously described expression construction for the petJ gene fromAnabaena (21Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The DNA sequencing service MediGenomix carried out the nucleotide sequence analysis. Other molecular biology protocols were standard (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli MC1061-transformed cells were grown in M9 medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 g/liter Tryptone, 6 mg/liter Fe(III) ammonium citrate, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells from 10-liter microaerobic cultures were collected, and the periplasmic fraction was extracted according to the method of Hoshino and Kageyama (23Hoshino T. Kageyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Eftekhar and Schiller (24Eftekhar F. Schiller N.L. Curr. Microbiol. 1994; 29: 37-42Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting suspension was extensively dialyzed against 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. From this point, the purification procedure was that for native Cyt c 6 (see above), with the exception of mutants K66E and D72K, which were eluted with buffer gradients ranging from 1 to 10 mm and from 2 to 120 mm, respectively. In all cases, 50 μmpotassium ferricyanide was added to the gradient solutions to keep Cytc 6 oxidized. Protein concentration was determined as described previously (21Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The redox potential value for the heme group in each Cyt c 6 mutant was determined as reported previously (21Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Ortega J.M. Hervás M. Losada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 199: 239-243Google Scholar), for which the differential absorbance changes at 553 minus 570 nm were followed. Errors in the experimental determinations were less than ±5 mV. PSI particles were isolated from Anabaena cells by β-dodecyl maltoside solubilization (26Hervás M. Ortega J.M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Bottin H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 235-241Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Dinner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chlorophyll/P700 ratio of the resulting PSI preparations was 140:1. The P700 content in PSI samples was calculated from the photoinduced absorbance changes at 820 nm using the absorption coefficient of 6.5 mm−1cm−1 determined by Mathis and Sétif (28Mathis P. Sétif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined according to Arnon (29Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of flash-induced absorbance changes in PSI were followed at 820 nm as described previously (9Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A.

Experimental conditions and the standard reaction mixture were also as reported previously (17De la Cerda B. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10125-10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); the buffer used throughout this work was 20 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 7.5. Unless otherwise indicated, low and high ionic strengths refer to the absence and addition of 10 mm MgCl2, respectively. Data collection and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses were carried out as reported by Hervás et al. (9Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Apparent thermodynamic parameters were estimated as described Dı́azet al. (6Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by fitting the experimental data to the Watkins equation (30Watkins J.A. Cusanovich M.A. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The values for the rate constant for electron transfer and K A (see below) were determined according to the formalism by Meyer et al. (31Meyer T.E. Zhao Z.G. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4552-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structures of WT and mutant Cytc 6 were modeled using the SYBYL program (Tripos Associates) in an SGI RC10000 workstation. The three-dimensional crystal structure of Cyt c 6 from the green algaMonoraphidium braunii (12Frazão C. Soares C.M. Carrondo M.A. Pohl E. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Sheldrick G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was used as a template. Sequence alignment and subsequent amino acid substitution were performed with the BIOPOLYMER module of SYBYL Version 6.4. Force field parameters for the heme moiety were those in the AMBER package (32Giammona D.A. An Examination of Conformational Flexibility in Porphyrins and Bulky-ligand Binding in Myoglobin. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Davis, CA1984Google Scholar). The resulting file was first submitted to energy minimization in vacuo up to a root mean square energy gradient of 0.41 kJ mol−1Å−1 using the SANDER module of AMBER Version 4.1 (33Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Cadwell G.C. Siebel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P. Kollman P.A. AMBER Version 4.1. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar). During these calculations, the backbone heavy atoms of α-helix regions were restrained at their position by a harmonic force of 62.7 kJ mol−1 Å−1. Then, the whole system was solvated with three-point water molecules using the BLOB option of the EDIT module. Solvent was energy-minimized and submitted to a 9-ps molecular dynamics calculation. The whole system was again energy-minimized and submitted to a 1250-ps molecular dynamics run at 300 K. A total of 10 samples from the last 400 ps of trajectory were quenched by freezing the system in six steps of 1.5 ps. The qualities of the resulting structures were tested using the PROCHECK program (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Surface electrostatic potentials were estimated using the algorithm of Nicholls and Honig (35Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), as indicated in the MOLMOL program (36Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of specific residues of AnabaenaCyt c 6 in the reaction mechanism of PSI reduction, six amino acids (two near the heme group and four in the positively charged east face) were chosen for mutations (Fig.1). At the edge of the heme crevice, modifications were made at residues 25 and 29: Val-25, which is located near the heme β-meso-position, was substituted by alanine and glutamate; and Lys-29, which exhibits its side chain lying close to propionate 7, was replaced with histidine. Val-25 is located in the middle of the hydrophobic patch, but Lys-29 is not. However, mutation of the latter to histidine was considered to be interesting because the residue at position 29 is lysine in all Cyts c 6with the exception of that from Monoraphidium, in which it is histidine (actually, the EPR spectra of Monoraphidium Cytc 6 suggested an unusual histidine-histidine axial coordination for the heme iron, a ligand system that is not possible in the rest of Cyts c 6 with just one histidine residue (37Campos A.P. Aguiar A.P. Hervás M. Regalla M. Navarro J.A. Ortega J.M. Xavier A.V. De la Rosa M.A. Teixeira M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). In addition, basic residues at positions 28–30 in type I cytochromes have been proposed to control the redox potential of the heme group through stabilization of propionate 7 (38Moore G. Harris D.E. Leitch F.A. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 331-342Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the east face, modifications included the replacement of Lys-62 and Lys-66 by glutamates; Asp-72, which is also located in the middle of the east patch, was changed to lysine. Finally, Arg-64, which is at the edge of the east patch and has been shown to be crucial inSynechocystis Cyt c 6 (18De la Cerda B. Dı́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was replaced with glutamate. The EPR and electronic absorption spectra of Anabaena Cytc 6 were not changed by the mutations (data not shown), but its midpoint redox potential (E m ) could be significantly affected (Table I). TheE m value was unchanged when the residue mutated was at the east face, including Arg-64, but it was ∼50 mV lower when the mutations were located near the heme group. Only minor differences were observed in the 1H NMR spectra and nuclear Overhauser effect intensities of heme resonances with protons from other residues. 2A. Dı́az-Quintana, M. Hervás, J. A.

Open table in a new tab The kinetics of PSI reduction by WT Cyt c 6 are biphasic, but those with the mutants (with the exception of D72K) are monoexponential, lacking the fast phase typically observed with the WT species. As shown in Fig. 2, the kinetics corresponding to D72K and WT Cyt c 6 exhibited a sharp initial fast phase (with a rate constant that was independent of donor protein concentration) followed by a slower decay. In contrast, the oscilloscope traces with mutants V25A and V25E fit to single exponential curves. Fig. 3 shows that the observed pseudo first-order rate constant (k obs) of PSI reduction by any mutant (with the exception of D72K) varied linearly with Cyt c 6 concentration. This can be interpreted by assuming that there is no formation of any stable complex between PSI and Cyt c 6, and the reaction thus follows a collisional kinetic mechanism (type I). With mutant D72K, however, the protein concentration dependence ofk obs exhibited a saturation profile, which indicates the formation of a bimolecular Cytc 6·PSI complex prior to electron transfer. The extrapolated rate constant at infinite D72K concentration is similar to its electron transfer rate constant, which is obtained directly from the fast kinetic phase, thus suggesting a type II mechanism. Such a saturation profile with D72K was even more evident at lower ionic strengths, which increase attractive electrostatic interactions. As shown in Fig. 4, the D72K mutant showed efficient complex formation, with an equilibrium constant (K A ) of 1.06 × 105m−1 at low ionic strength. Extrapolation of the observed rate constant to infinite D72K concentration yielded a value that approached one-half the experimental electron transfer rate constant, which indicates that this mutant may follow a type III mechanism at low ionic strength. This finding also suggests that the rearrangement step (see above) is not limiting at high ionic strength. Fig. 4 also shows that the V25A mutant was likewise able to form a transient complex with PSI at low ionic strength, even though its kinetic profiles of PSI reduction were monophasic at any ionic strength. The K A value for complex formation between V25A and PSI is 1.07 × 104m−1, which is 10 times lower than that with D72K. These data indicate that V25A follows a type II mechanism in the absence of MgCl2 and a type I mechanism when 10 mm MgCl2 is added. The bimolecular rate constant for the overall reaction (k bim) of PSI reduction, which can be calculated from the linear plots in Fig. 3, is smaller with any mutant than with WT Cyt c 6 (Table I). In the hydrophobic patch, replacement of Val-25 with alanine or glutamate promoted a decrease ink bim of ∼2 and 60 times, respectively, whereas mutation of Lys-29 to histidine involved a parallel decrease of ∼50% as compared with WT Cyt c 6. Substitution of Arg-64, in its turn, by glutamate induced the rate constant to decrease by a factor of 5. In the east face, replacement of Lys-62 and Lys-66 with glutamate made the k bim value decrease to half that of WT Cyt c 6. In the case of D72K, it should be noted that the bimolecular rate constant in Table I refers to its association constant, which is kinetically different from the otherk bim values in the table. Its electron transfer rate constant, calculated directly from the fast phase, compares well with that of WT Cyt c 6, as does the maximum percentage of fast phase (Table I). Taking into account the electrostatic nature of the interaction of Cytc 6 with PSI, a detailed analysis of the effect of ionic strength on k bim was performed. Fig.5 shows that thek bim values with WT Cytc 6 monotonically diminished with increasing NaCl concentration, thereby indicating the existence of attractive electrostatic interactions between the reaction partners as described previously (10Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Medina M. Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Gómez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A similar effect of ionic strength onk bim was observed with all mutants, but some differences could be found among them. Actually, thek bim values with mutants V25A and D72K are significantly higher than that with WT Cyt c 6 at low ionic strength, but they decreased drastically upon small additions of NaCl. Mutant K29H showed an ionic strength dependence similar to that of WT Cyt c 6, although its electron transfer efficiency was lower in the whole range analyzed. Thek bim values with all the other mutants are lower than that with WT Cyt c 6, indicating that the changes in net electrostatic charge alter the attractive interactions between PSI and mutant proteins. Using the Watkins equation (30Watkins J.A. Cusanovich M.A. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the bimolecular rate constant extrapolated to infinite ionic strength (k inf) (which facilitates the analysis of the intrinsic reactivity of redox partners in the absence of electrostatic interactions) can be calculated from the experimental data. As shown in Table I, thek inf values with Cyt c 6mutated at the positively charged patch are very similar to that with WT Cyt c 6, a fact that can be explained by assuming that the changes in reactivity induced by these mutations are mainly due to electrostatic, and not structural, effects. The only exception is R64E, for which the k inf value is 4–5 times lower than that with WT Cyt c 6, a finding suggesting that the change in electrostatic charge is not the only factor affecting its reactivity toward PSI, as reported previously for Synechocystis Cyt c 6 (18De la Cerda B. Dı́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The effect of the K29H mutation seems to be merely electrostatic in nature, as k inf is similar to that with WT Cytc 6. The two mutations at position 25 involve modifications that make k inf lower (the V25E mutant, in particular, exhibits a k inf value that is 70 times lower than that with WT Cytc 6). To gain further insights into the nature of the interactions between PSI and Cyt c 6, a thermodynamic analysis of PSI reduction by the Cyt c 6 mutants was performed. In all cases, the temperature dependence of the observed rate constant (k obs) yielded linear Eyring plots with no breakpoints, from which the values for the apparent activation enthalpy (ΔH ‡), entropy (ΔS ‡) and free energy (ΔG ‡) of the overall reaction could be calculated. For comparative purposes, TableII shows the differences in such activation parameters between WT Cyt c 6 and every mutant. The greatest difference was observed with V25E, whose free energy change is 9.41 kJ mol−1 higher than that of WT Cyt c 6, as expected from its inefficient interaction with PSI. This difference is due mainly to a decrease in the entropic term by ∼28 J mol−1 K−1. Also interesting is mutant R64E, whose free energy change is 4.15 kJ mol−1 higher than that of WT Cytc 6, a fact that is due to changes in both the enthalpic and entropic terms. Mutant V25A behaved differently than any other mutant; in fact, the free energy term of its reaction is similar to that of WT Cyt c 6 despite the fact that both entropy and enthalpy show dramatic changes as compared with the thermodynamic parameters of WT Cyt c 6.Table IIDifferences in the thermodynamic activation parameters of PSI reduction by the mutants of cytochrome c 6 compared with the wild-type molecule under standard conditionsCytochromec 6ΔΔG ‡ΔΔH ‡ΔΔS ‡kJ mol −1kJ mol −1J mol −1 K −1V25A1.11−9.14−34.57V25E9.411.08−27.93K29H1.482.453.26K62E2.102.160.21R64E4.15−1.72−19.69K66E1.692.041.20D72K1.332-aThis value stands for ΔΔG ‡ at infinite ionic strength.2-a This value stands for ΔΔG ‡ at infinite ionic strength. Open table in a new tab To check whether the differences in ΔG ‡between WT and mutant Cyt c 6(ΔΔG ‡) were due to electrostatic interactions, the experimental data were fitted to the Watkins equation (30Watkins J.A. Cusanovich M.A. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the ΔΔG ‡ values with D72K and V25A perfectly fit the Watkins equation, and those of K29H, K62E, and K66E roughly fit it. Mutants V25E and R64E showed a linear NaCl dependence of ΔΔG ‡ at high ionic strength that caused the data to deviate from the Watkins equation. Up to now, the only site-directed mutational analysis of any Cytc 6 was recently reported by De la Cerda et al. (18De la Cerda B. Dı́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. This hemeprotein, which is almost neutral, reacts with PSI according to a simple collisional model (type I). On the contrary,Anabaena Cyt c 6 is a positively charged protein that exhibits strong electrostatic attractions toward PSI (9Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Medina M. Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Gómez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and that reacts with the photosystem following a more complex three-step mechanism (type III). The goal of this study was to elucidate the role played by some specific amino acids ofAnabaena Cyt c 6 in such an attractive interaction with PSI and to investigate the possible involvement of its hydrophobic north area in the type III reaction mechanism. Mutations of Val-25 indicate that this residue may contribute to the specific topology of the north hydrophobic area of Cytc 6 in its interaction with PSI. Similar conclusions were inferred from mutants at the north pole of eukaryotic plastocyanin (5Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson Ö. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Haehnel W. Jansen T. Gause K. Klösgen R.B. Stahl B. Michl D. Huvermann B. Karas M. Herrmann R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1028-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), in which the fast phase of electron transfer to PSI cannot be detected. This suggests that the mutant proteins (both Cyt c 6 and plastocyanin) are unable to reach the optimal orientation required for their redox centers to transfer electrons to PSI. It is interesting to compare the drastic effect induced by mutation of Val-25 to glutamate with mutation to alanine; the severe kinetic phenotype of V25E can be attributed to the presence of a negative charge in the middle of a normally hydrophobic region. The K29H mutant possesses a redox potential value that is 65 mV more negative than that of WT Cyt c 6. This is probably due to the proximity of Lys-29 to heme propionate 7, in agreement with previous reports (38Moore G. Harris D.E. Leitch F.A. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 331-342Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Even though the driving force of electron transfer from K29H to PSI is higher, the kinetic profile of PSI reduction by the mutant loses the first fast phase, and itsk bim value is about half that of WT Cytc 6. This can be ascribed in part to electrostatic effects, as the dependence of ΔΔG ‡ on ionic strength fits the Watkins equation (30Watkins J.A. Cusanovich M.A. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the value for k inf compares well with that of WT Cyt c 6. The change in redox potential induced by the mutation clearly does not affect reactivity with PSI, suggesting that complex formation is the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction. Mutations of Lys-62 and Lys-66 at the positively charged patch of Cytc 6 demonstrate that this region is responsible for the attractive electrostatic interactions with PSI. InAnabaena, the PsaF subunit does not seem to be directly involved in the interaction of PSI with its donor proteins, as is the case in Synechocystis (16Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 39Xu Q. Yu V.P. Chitnis L. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

Hence, the positive charges of Anabaena Cyt c 6 may interact with certain negatively charged areas in the PsaA/PsaB heterodimer of PSI to form a transient electrostatic complex. The surface electrostatic potential of WT and mutant Cyt c 6 was then calculated. Fig. 7 shows that the WT molecule has an extensive area of positive potential at its west face,i.e. close to the hydrophobic patch at the edge of the heme cleft. Mutants K66E, K62E, and R64E present a reduction in charge of the positive patch, although the change in the orientation of the dipole moment is <10°. This is consistent with the kinetic behavior exhibited by these three mutants, in which the ionic strength dependence of the interaction with PSI is not so much evident. It is noteworthy that the effect of such mutations on the reaction rates can be closely correlated to changes in the positive electrostatic potential at the edge of the hydrophobic area. In fact, replacement of Arg-64 (which is located in the basic patch, adjacent to the hydrophobic region) by an acidic residue promotes a drastic reduction in size of the positive patch. Mutation of Lys-66 to glutamate likewise induces a diminution of the basic patch, but it does not alter the electrostatic surface potential at the edge of the hydrophobic area. Mutant D72K is of special relevance as it clearly supports our proposal that the positively charged patch of Cyt c 6 is responsible for the interaction with PSI. Replacement of Asp-72 by a positive residue like lysine makes the positive potential region spread out (Fig. 7), thus favoring the attractive interactions with any negatively charged area of PSI. Like WT Cyt c 6, D72K is the only mutant that exhibits the fast kinetic phase of PSI reduction. The thermodynamic analysis of PSI reduction by the mutants of Cytc 6 revealed that all mutations induce changes in ΔH ‡ and ΔS ‡, but only some of them (V25A, V25E, and R64E) are significant. The large entropic changes of such mutants suggest that the solvent molecules are tuning the reactivity of the donor proteins toward PSI. The kinetic behavior of V25A indicates that the electrostatic interactions are predominant over hydrophobic forces. To conclude, the experimental data reported here reveal that inAnabaena Cyt c 6, there are at least two interaction sites (which would be isofunctional with two similar areas in plastocyanin) for electron transfer to PSI: (i) a positively charged area, responsible for the electrostatic interactions forming the transient complex with the photosystem; and (ii) a hydrophobic region surrounding the heme pocket, responsible for the formation of the contact interphase with PSI allowing electrons to go from the heme iron to P700+. The main difference with respect to Synechocystis Cyt c 6 (18De la Cerda B. Dı́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol.

Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence reveals homologies with several putative functional domains, including a pair of α-actinin-like actin binding domains; regions of homology to plakins at either end of the giant polypeptide; 29 copies of a spectrin-like motif in the central region of the protein; two potential Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs; and a Ser-rich region containing a repeated GSRX motif. With similarities to both plakins and spectrins, trabeculin-α appears to have evolved as a hybrid of these two families of proteins. The functionality of the actin binding domains located near the N terminus was confirmed with an F-actin binding assay using glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins comprising amino acids 9–486 of the deduced peptide. Northern and Western blotting and immunofluorescence studies suggest that trabeculin is ubiquitously expressed and is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, though the protein was found to be greatly up-regulated upon differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Finally, the presence of cDNAs similar to, yet distinct from, trabeculin-α in both human and mouse suggests that trabeculins may form a new subfamily of giant actin-binding/cytoskeletal cross-linking proteins.

A large number of support proteins are associated with these filaments, which together define cell size and shape, both during development and once cells have attained their terminally differentiated state. The cytoskeleton is both static and adaptive, providing a dynamic cellular architecture that is capable of receiving and responding to information from the environment. This adaptability is determined by the ability of cytoskeletal proteins that form the supramolecular arrays, such as plakins, spectrins, and many others, to act as targets or intermediates in signal transduction pathways (1Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar). Although the complexity of the cytoskeleton is not fully described and novel components certainly remain to be identified, a detailed understanding of the architecture of supramolecular complexes and the structure-function relationships of the component molecules has been achieved in some cases. For example, the organization of the muscle sarcomere, with each unit comprised of over 30 individual polypeptides, has been elucidated (4Squire J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). More variant structures such as focal contacts are also well understood, both at the level of their basic molecular components and their recruitment of signaling and structural proteins, which varies depending on the status of the cell (5Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 6Lo S.H. Chen L.B.

The regulation and assembly of actin filament bundles during growth, development, and adaptive responses to extracellular stimuli (e.g. stress fiber formation) has also been studied extensively (8Lamarche N.

Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar). Plakins are a family of large cytoskeletal proteins (>200 kDa) that serve as cross-linkers between cytoskeletal filaments and in some cases as filament attachment points with the plasma membrane (12Ruhrberg C. Watt F.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The family currently comprises four principal members: desmoplakin, plectin, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG1), and envoplakin. All plakins share general structural features, with globular N- and C-terminal regions separated by a central rod domain. There is also extensive conservation of sequence and function between the members of the family. The C terminus of all plakins binds intermediate filaments and has conserved “helix/β-turn” motifs. The N terminus is responsible for the localization to plasma membrane sites and/or mediates interaction with other cytoskeletal filaments. All plakins share a N-terminal microtubule binding domain (though not all plakins have been observed to associate with microtubules) (12Ruhrberg C. Watt F.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Yang Y. Bauer C. Strasser G. Wollman R. Julien J.P. Fuchs E. Cell. 1999; 98: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and plectin and BPAG1 have an actin-binding domain in this region (12Ruhrberg C. Watt F.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The central rod domain, finally, mediates homodimerization by forming an antiparallel α-helical coiled-coil structure with two plakin molecules (14Green K.J. Virata M.L. Elgart G.W. Stanley J.R. Parry D.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1992; 14: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, plakins appear to be asymmetric cross-linking proteins but may be able to achieve functional symmetry through dimerization. In addition, at least plectin and desmoplakin are phosphorylated, and in the latter case this seems to affect keratin binding (15Foisner R. Malecz N. Dressel N. Stadler C. Wiche G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Stappenbeck T.S. Lamb J.A. Corcoran C.M. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29351-29354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrin family, which also includes fodrin, dystrophin, utrophin, and protein 4.1, is a group of actin-binding proteins that appear to have evolved from an α-actinin ancestral gene through a series of elongation and duplication events on the basic repeat (17Pascual J. Castresana J. Saraste M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Hartwig J.H. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 706-778PubMed Google Scholar). As such, the presence of an actin binding domain (calponin homology) at the N terminus and of a calmodulin-like Ca2+-binding site near the C terminus, both present on α-actinin, is a hallmark of this protein family. The spectrin repeat motif folds into a triple-helix coiled-coil forming a flexible rod (19Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which allows spectrin and fodrin (non-erythroid spectrin) to provide the plasma membrane with support and elasticity (20Svoboda K.

In this paper, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human cytoplasmic giant protein, trabeculin-α. This protein binds F-actin, is ubiquitously expressed, and is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. It also shows strong similarities to both plakins and spectrins and appears to have evolved as a hybrid from the two families. Furthermore, the presence of similar yet distinct cDNAs in both humans and mice suggests that trabeculins may form a new subfamily of giant actin-binding/cytoskeletal cross-linking proteins. The MRC-5 (human lung fibroblast), CCL-105 (human adrenal cortex carcinoma), and BSC-1 (African green monkey kidney epithelium) cell lines were purchased from ATCC, and the FS-2 (human foreskin fibroblasts) and JMN (human mesothelioma) cells were kindly provided by the late Dr. Ruth Sager (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) and Dr. Jim Rheinwald (Brigham and Women's Hospital), respectively. These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM)1supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The C2C12 (murine myoblast) line was from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Preparation of myoblasts and differentiation into myotubes was carried out as described (23Lo S.H. An Q. Bao S. Wong W.K. Liu Y. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); to induce myoblast fusion, the medium was changed to DMEM with 2% horse serum (differentiation medium, DM). Multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from primary myoblasts and differentiated myotubes was prepared using RNazol. Northern blots were prepared and probed as described previously (23Lo S.H. An Q. Bao S. Wong W.K. Liu Y. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22310-22319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The trabeculin probe used was about 3 kilobase pairs in length and spanned the region from 996 to 4082 bp of the trabeculin-α cDNA, corresponding to amino acids 9–1036. GST fusion proteins of trabeculin fragments 4HP6 (amino acids 2933–3558) and 4HP12 (amino acids 1868–2230) were generated by subcloning of the relevant fragment into vector pGEX3T (CLONTECH). Purification of GST fusion proteins from Escherichia coliwas carried out as described previously (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transformed bacterial cell culture (DH5α) was grown overnight in L broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp), diluted 1:10 in fresh LB-Amp, and further grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Protein production was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected and resuspended in PBS before sonication and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads to capture fusion proteins. The glutathione-agarose beads were washed with PBS, and fusion proteins were eluted with free glutathione (5 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Cleavage of trabeculin fragments from GST was carried out using either thrombin or factor Xa, and the purified fragments were mixed and used to raise an antiserum in rabbits (polyclonal B13 antiserum). Post-nuclear lysates were prepared from cell lines or mouse brain homogenates, as follows. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 1% Triton X-100, and the “complete” protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and either total supernatant proteins were precipitated using acetone or immunoprecipitation was performed. In the latter case cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min before immunoprecipitation of specific proteins with immune serum. Immunoprecipitates made with preimmune serum were used as control. Proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% BSA before probing with the relevant antibody. The secondary sheep anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used at 1:25,000 dilution, and the blots were developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in −20 °C methanol for 5 min before washing in PBS. Staining with rabbit anti-trabeculin antiserum (polyclonal B13) was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The secondary rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used at 100 ng/ml and applied for 30 min at 37 °C, before washing and mounting in glycerol/gelatin (Sigma). For actin staining, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, followed by washing in PBS and 10 min incubation in sucrose buffer (10 mm Hepes, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100). Actin fibers were then labeled with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 20 min. For microtubule visualization, cells were incubated with the cross-linking agent, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) at 0.2 mg/ml for 5 min at room temperature, and washed in PBS and microtubule stabilizing buffer (MTSB: 100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 4% polyethylene glycol 8000). Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5 min. The anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was applied at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation with secondary rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 100 ng/ml for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washing and mounting in glycerol/gelatin (Sigma). Cells were examined using an LSM410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an external argon-krypton laser (568 nm). Optical sections of 512 × 512 pixels were digitally recorded in the 2× line-averaging mode. Images were processed for reproduction using the Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Mountainview, CA). An actin binding assay system (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was used to examine the ability of GST-TrABD, a GST fusion protein comprising trabeculin's α-actinin-like actin binding domains (amino acids 9–486), to bind to F-actin. The GST-TrABD fusion protein was generated as described above. α-Actinin and BSA (supplied with the assay kit) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, and the assay was carried out essentially as described (24Lo S.H. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were centrifuged (20 min, 28 pounds/square inch; ∼100,000 × g) in a Beckman Airfuge to remove aggregates. F-actin was prepared by resuspension in General Actin Buffer (supplied with the kit) and polymerization at room temperature for 1 h. The test proteins (>20 μm) were mixed with F-actin (23 μm) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Filaments were pelleted by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h at 24 °C. Supernatants and pellets were separated, and the proteins present in each were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Actin-binding proteins and F-actin were present in the pellet, whereas proteins that did not associate with actin remained in the supernatant. Disruption of microtubules was induced in CCL-105 cells, with 2 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) applied for 2 h at 37 °C, and disruption of actin fibers with 1 μm cytochalasin D (Sigma) under the same conditions. Cells were then washed, fixed, and labeled as described before. Human trabeculin-α was cloned from the HL1131b human prostate cDNA library (23Lo S.H. An Q. Bao S. Wong W.K. Liu Y. Janmey P.A.

Science. 1991; 252: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Sixteen contiguous partial cDNAs were identified that enabled assembly of the full-length trabeculin-α cDNA structure (Fig.1 A); the composite trabeculin-α cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF141968). The total sequence identified in our screening was 17,749 bp, including a 16,122-bp open reading frame, a 973-bp 5′-untranslated region, and a 654-bp 3′-untranslated region. The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame reveals a protein of 5373 amino acids, with a predictedM r of 614,000. Fig. 1 B shows the predicted amino acid sequence of human trabeculin-α. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to map the human chromosomal location of the trabeculin-α gene. A 6112-bp fragment of trabeculin-α (bp 8161–14272, amino acids 2397–4433) hybridized to a single locus, on chromosome 1 region p33-p34.2 (not shown). Since trabeculin is a novel protein, we performed a Northern blot analysis to determine the tissue distribution of its transcripts in humans. Fig. 1 C shows the Northern blot for several human tissues. The probe used in this analysis was a 3-kilobase pair fragment of the trabeculin-α cDNA (from 996 to 4082 bp). All tissues shown had detectable levels of trabeculin mRNAs, with the highest expression in muscle (heart and skeletal), prostate, gastrointestinal tract (intestine and colon), and gonads, and lowest expression in brain, spleen, thymus, liver, placenta, and lung. Our analysis of the structural motifs present in trabeculin-α revealed several interesting features, summarized in Fig.2 A. Near the N terminus of the protein (amino acids 45–257) are tandem regions with marked sequence homology to the α-actinin-like actin binding domain of spectrins and some plakins. Proceeding toward the C terminus, trabeculin-α displays a region of approximately 900 amino acids that strongly resembles a region common to all plakins and found to be the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) of BPAG1 (13Yang Y. Bauer C. Strasser G. Wollman R. Julien J.P. Fuchs E. Cell. 1999; 98: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); and the C-terminal region of trabeculin-α contains a 76 amino acid region with strong homology (52% identity, 69% homology) to another plakin, GAR22 (27Zucman-Rossi J. Legoix P. Thomas G. Genomics. 1996; 38: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These two plakin-like motifs, together with the presence of an actin binding domain, suggest that trabeculin-α may interact with various cytoskeletal proteins. Perhaps the most striking feature of trabeculin-α resides in its central region: a 29-fold repeat of a 110–120 amino acid stretch, bearing considerable identity to the spectrin-like repeats found in human dystrophin and other spectrins (17Pascual J. Castresana J. Saraste M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Koenig M. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4560-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Secondary structure prediction based on the sequence information suggest that each repeat is made up of three α-helices, as for the spectrin-type repeat. Similarities with the spectrin-like repeat also include a very conserved tryptophan residue at position 18 in the alignment followed by a hydrophobic residue, conservation of positively and negatively charged residues (Fig. 2 B, in redand purple) at given positions throughout the alignment, a leucine at the end of each repeat, and abundant prolines and glycines (Fig. 2 B, in yellow) in the loop regions. There are also multiple regions in trabeculin-α that may be able to transduce information for intracellular signaling pathways as follows: two tandem calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (amino acids 5000–5100), similar in sequence and relative position to those in the C terminus of dystrophin and other spectrins (17Pascual J. Castresana J. Saraste M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 297-490PubMed Google Scholar); and several tyrosine residues that have surrounding sequences consistent with their being tyrosine kinase substrates. Finally, the extreme C terminus of trabeculin-α contains a serine-rich region (amino acids 5350–5500 are 28% serine), including a GSRX repeat motif also present in the same relative position (40–50 amino acids to the C terminus) in plectin and desmoplakin. Several structural homologues of human trabeculin-α have been reported, including, notably, Kakapo from Drosophila melanogaster (30Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); and the mouse ACF7 gene (GenBankTM accession numberAF150755), 2C. Leung, D. Sun, M. Zheng, D. Knowles, and R. K. H. Liem, EMBL accession number AF150755. which shares 88% overall identity with the human trabeculin-α clone reported here. Alignments of the deduced protein sequences for two of the best conserved regions, the putative actin binding domains and the GAR22 homology, are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. A 1157-bp partial human ACF7 cDNA has also been reported (33Byers T.J. Beggs A.H. McNally E.M. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) which ends with an 886-bp stretch identical to a region near the N terminus of our trabeculin-α cDNA, starting right around the beginning of the putative actin binding domain. Another partial human cDNA clone was reported recently (34Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that displays 77% identity with a region near the C terminus of trabeculin-α, over its 1054 deduced amino acid sequence. This region includes conserved EF-hand motifs, GAR22 homology region, and GSRX repeats (Fig. 3). Correspondingly, we also found over a dozen mouse ESTs with strong similarities to mouse ACF7, although clearly of non-identical sequence. For example, the longest of these ESTs (GenBankTM accession number AA014416) encodes the last 134 amino acids of a mouse trabeculin homologue with 75% overall identity with mouse ACF7. It is notable that these clones display a conserved GSRX repeat but not the general serine-rich C terminus (Fig. 3 for human; not shown for mouse). These clones would seem to correspond to a separate trabeculin gene in human and mouse which, along with trabeculin-α/ACF7, would define a new protein family. We raised an antibody (B13) to the spectrin homology region of trabeculin to perform immunofluorescence studies of the subcellular localization of the protein. Since this region of trabeculin reveals close homology to many other proteins, it was critical to establish the specificity of this antibody, before the subsequent analyses. Fig.4 A shows that in Western analysis, the B13 anti-trabeculin antibody recognizes the trabeculin portions of the bacterially expressed GST-trabeculin fusion proteins to which it was raised. The B13 antiserum recognizes two high molecular weight proteins on Western blots of cultured CCL-105 or MRC-5 cells (Fig. 4 B) or of mouse brain lysate (not shown). Moreover, B13 immunoprecipitates these proteins specifically from cell lysates. These data suggest that the high molecular weight proteins are in fact trabeculins and that the B13 anti-trabeculin antibody does not significantly cross-react with other proteins. We performed an immunofluorescence analysis of various cell types using the B13 anti-trabeculin antibody. A representative selection of these data are shown in Fig. 4, C—F. These figures show the staining pattern of anti-trabeculin in the CCL-105, BSC-1, JMN, and FS-2 cell lines. As a negative control, staining with the preimmune serum was performed, and only minimal background staining was observed (data not shown). In these and the more than 20 other cell types we examined (not shown), the subcellular distribution of anti-trabeculin staining had the following salient features: 1) distribution throughout the cytoplasm, 2) exclusion from the nucleus, and 3) appearance as a filamentous network, in some cells displaying a fiber-like staining pattern reminiscent of actin stress fibers. Occasionally, we observed a punctate or globular staining that might be associated with localization to vesicular structures like the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum (not shown). Since the N terminus of trabeculin-α contains a domain that has significant homology to the α-actinin-like actin binding domain, we constructed a GST fusion protein of the putative N-terminal actin binding domain (ABD) of trabeculin-α (amino acids 9–486), GST-TrABD (82 kDa by SDS-PAGE). We then tested the ability of GST-TrABD to bind F-actin in a sedimentation binding assay (24Lo S.H. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows that GST-TrABD efficiently binds F-actin filaments. In this experiment, GST-TrABD, positive (α-actinin) or negative (BSA) control proteins were incubated with F-actin, and the reactions were centrifuged to separate binding from non-binding proteins. Both GST-TrABD and α-actinin, but not BSA, co-precipitated with F-actin. We verified separately that GST does not bind actin (not shown). We also tested whether an association of GST-TrABD with actin could be detected in a cellular context. Due to the large size and modular nature of trabeculin, an approach where association is detected by co-immunoprecipitation was not feasible. Therefore, we examined the pattern of trabeculin distribution in the absence and presence of drugs that disrupt the cytoskeleton. We stained for actin, tubulin, and trabeculin in CCL-105 cells treated with either cytochalasin D, which disrupts microfilaments (35Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar), or nocodazole, a disrupter of microtubules (36Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows that cytochalasin D effectively disrupts actin-containing microfilaments, causing a transition from prominently filamentous to punctate actin staining, with no remaining evidence of linear structures. Cytochalasin D has no effect on the organization of microtubules, as observed with tubulin staining. In contrast, nocodazole disrupts tubulin-containing microtubules but does not change actin filament organization. We stained cells for trabeculin in the absence or presence of either of these drugs. In untreated cells, the ubiquitous, fine filament structure of trabeculin was evident. In cells treated with nocodazole, no change in the distribution of trabeculin staining was observed. However, cytochalasin D treatment resulted in a marked (although not complete) disruption of trabeculin fine filament structures and the appearance of punctate aggregates of trabeculin. These results suggest that trabeculin is at least in part associated with actin filaments. Since trabeculin appears to be an actin-binding protein and myogenesis involves a major increase in actin expression, we examined the levels of trabeculin in myoblasts undergoing differentiation to myotubes. C2C12 cells were placed in differentiation medium (DM) and monitored over a 6-day period for morphology (not shown) and trab"

The catalytic mechanism of this three-substrate reaction was investigated at 7 °C by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy. Various individual steps associated with catalysis were readily observed at pH 7.5, the optimum pH for enzyme turnover. Anaerobic reduction of the free enzyme by NADH is a biphasic process, most likely reflecting the presence of two distinct enzyme forms. Binding of 2-hydroxybiphenyl stimulated the rate of enzyme reduction by NADH by 2 orders of magnitude. The anaerobic reduction of the enzyme-substrate complex involved the formation of a transient charge-transfer complex between the reduced flavin and NAD+. A similar transient intermediate was formed when the enzyme was complexed with the substrate analog 2-sec-butylphenol or with the non-substrate effector 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. Excess NAD+ strongly stabilized the charge-transfer complexes but did not give rise to the appearance of any intermediate during the reduction of uncomplexed enzyme. Free reduced 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase reacted rapidly with oxygen to form oxidized enzyme with no appearance of intermediates during this reaction. In the presence of 2-hydroxybiphenyl, two consecutive spectral intermediates were observed which were assigned to the flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide and the flavin C(4a)-hydroxide, respectively. No oxygenated flavin intermediates were observed when the enzyme was in complex with 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. Monovalent anions retarded the dehydration of the flavin C(4a)-hydroxide without stabilization of additional intermediates. The kinetic data for 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase are consistent with a ternary complex mechanism in which the aromatic substrate has strict control in both the reductive and oxidative half-reaction in a way that reactions leading to substrate hydroxylation are favored over those leading to the futile formation of hydrogen peroxide.

The microbial degradation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl proceeds through an oxidative meta-cleavage pathway. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase catalyzes the first step of this pathway, i.e. the ortho-hydroxylation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl in the presence of NADH and oxygen as shown in Scheme FS1. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase is a homotetramer, and each 60-kDa subunit contains a noncovalently bound FAD (2Suske W.A.

The enzyme has a unique substrate specificity as it hydroxylates also 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl, 2,5-dihydroxybiphenyl, and a number of 2-alkylphenols to the corresponding 3-substituted catechols (3Kohler H.P.E.

Fundamental Studies and Biotechnological Applications. Ph.D. thesis. Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany1997Google Scholar). Because of its catalytic properties the enzyme has successfully been applied as a biocatalyst for the production of various 3-substituted catechols on the gram scale (5Held M. Schmid A. Kohler H.P.E.

Partial uncoupling of flavin reduction from hydroxylation by certain effectors and even the reaction product is a rather common feature among flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases (6Massey V.

Besides two fingerprints for the FAD binding, these enzymes share a conserved sequence motif with a putative dual function in FAD/NAD(P)H binding (10Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases has extensively been studied by rapid-reaction techniques. The reaction cycle (Scheme FS2) that was developed forp-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Husain M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6657-6666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Entsch B. Ballou D.P.

One of the most characteristic features of the flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases is the control function of the aromatic substrate over the reduction of the flavin by NAD(P)H (6Massey V. Hemmerich P. Enzymes. 1975; 12: 191-252Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Katagiri M. Maeno H. Yamamoto S. Hayashi O. Kitao T. Oae S. J. Biol.

Once a ternary complex of the enzyme-bound flavin with substrate and NAD(P)H has formed either in a random or in an ordered sequential manner, the enzyme-bound flavin is readily reduced by NAD(P)H within this complex. The reduced enzyme in complex with substrate and NAD(P)+ is kinetically evident from a transient long wavelength absorbance characteristic of a charge-transfer complex (21Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10634-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Howell L.G. Spector T. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4340-4350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of NAD(P)+leads to a decay of the charge-transfer complex and completes the reductive half-reaction. The reduced enzyme-substrate complex subsequently reacts with oxygen in a second-order reaction yielding the flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide, often referred to as intermediate I (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Schopfer L.M. Wessiak A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13080-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the substrate is essential to stabilize this oxygenated flavin species, which, in the absence of substrate, instantly decays to hydrogen peroxide and the oxidized enzyme. The distal oxygen of the flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide is assumed to attack the substrate carbon ortho or para to the existing hydroxyl group by an electrophilic mechanism. Concomitant with substrate hydroxylation, the formation of the so-called intermediate II can be observed. This intermediate is seen only withp-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5998-6005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of certain substrate analogs. Several models for the structure of intermediate II have been postulated (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Anderson F.A. Patel K.B. Stratford M.R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but all the evidence presently available suggests that intermediate II is a complex between the flavin C(4a)-hydroxide and the quinoid form of the aromatic product (19Maeda-Yorita K. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4134-4144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schopfer L.M. Wessiak A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13080-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flavin C(4a)-hydroxide (intermediate III) is formed during the catalytic cycle after the oxygen transfer onto the substrate has occurred (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of H2O from this species leads to reoxidized enzyme thus completing the catalytic cycle. Our studies were aimed at elucidating the catalytic mechanism of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase. To that end, we investigated the influence of various enzyme ligands on individual steps of the reductive and of the oxidative half-reaction. The kinetic properties of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase allowed for the first time a rapid scan analysis of all reaction steps. In the oxidative half-reaction, the flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide and the C(4a)-hydroxyflavin were easily detected at pH 7.5, the pH optimum of overall catalysis. However, no formation of intermediate II was observed under any conditions. Glucose oxidase and NADH were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Aromatic substrates for 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase have been described elsewhere (2Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All other compounds were obtained from Aldrich. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase was purified from Escherichia coli JM101 harboring thehbpA gene, which encodes 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase from P. azelaica HBP1, as reported earlier (2Suske W.A.

The purified enzyme was stored at a concentration of 23 mg ml−1 in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at −70 °C. Prior to use, an appropriate amount of enzyme was incubated with an FAD solution (1 mm). Excess FAD was removed by means of size exclusion chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-6DG column (Bio-Rad). The enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically on the basis of FAD content using a molar absorption coefficient of 9.7 mm–1 cm−1 at 452 nm (see “Results”). Dissociation constants of enzyme-ligand complexes were determined fluorimetrically with an Aminco SPF-500C spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY) or spectrophotometrically with an Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (28van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase activity was routinely assayed with an Hewlett-Packard HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) at 30 °C. The assay mixture contained air-saturated 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm 2-hydroxybiphenyl, and 0.15 mmNADH. Buffers used for binding studies and kinetic experiments were 50 mm MES1 (pH 6.0–6.6), 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0–8.0), and 50 mmTAPS (pH 8.5–9.0). Steady-state kinetics were performed in air-saturated 50 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.5), using a DW-2000 double beam spectrophotometer. The instrument was equipped with thermostated cell holders and interfaced to a minicomputer for data acquisition and data handling. Stopped-flow kinetic traces were recorded at 7 or 30 °C by means of a Hi-Tech SF-51 stopped-flow apparatus (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) with a dead time of 1.3 ms. Spectral scans were recorded with a Hi-Tech M300 monochromator diode array detector (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) that had a dead time of 5.6 ms. A total number of 96 scans could be collected in each single experiment with a minimum length of 0.96 s. Deconvolution analysis of spectral data was done with the Specfit Global Analysis program, version 2.10 (Spectrum Software Association, Chapel Hill, NC). Concentration values in stopped-flow experiments always refer to the final concentration obtained after mixing equal volumes of enzyme and reagents. The anaerobic reduction of protein-bound FAD was monitored at 450 nm either in the absence or in the presence of saturating amounts of substrate, effector, and varying concentrations of NADH. Experiments were performed in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. Second-order rate constants and dissociation constants were determined by non-linear curve-fitting routines. The kinetics of enzyme reduction were also measured at longer wavelengths (>600 nm) in order to detect the formation of flavin charge-transfer complexes (23Howell L.G. Spector T. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4340-4350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To ensure anaerobic conditions, 10 mmglucose and catalytic amounts of glucose oxidase were added to argon-flushed buffer and enzyme solutions. Moreover, the reaction syringes were immersed in a thermostated water bath where nitrogen was continuously bubbled to avoid contamination with oxygen through Teflon valves and stoppers. In experiments with diode array detection, reduction of protein-bound flavin was monitored between 400 and 760 nm. For investigations of the oxidative half-reaction, anaerobic enzyme solutions were reduced by a small excess of sodium dithionite and mixed with air-saturated buffer (11.76 mg of O2liter−1 at 7 °C, corresponding to 0.37 mmO2). Reoxidation of the flavin was measured by following the increase in absorption at 450 nm. Alternatively, in the diode array mode, reoxidation of protein-bound FAD was followed over the wavelength range between 320 and 620 nm. Unfolding of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase by SDS allowed the accurate determination of the molar absorption coefficient of protein-bound FAD. Fig.1 A shows the absorption spectrum of uncomplexed 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase before and after incubation for 10 min in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Spectrum 2 represents the absorbance of free FAD that was released upon unfolding of the protein. From the spectral data it is clear that the enzyme-bound oxidized flavin absorbs to a small but significant extent above 520 nm (spectrum 1). Although rather unusual among flavoenzymes, a similar long wavelength absorbance was observed for melilotate hydroxylase (30Strickland S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2944-2952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pentachlorophenol hydroxylase (31Xun L. Orser C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4447-4453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the absorbance difference between free and protein-bound flavin (Fig.1 A), a value of 9.7 mm−1cm−1 was estimated for the molar absorption coefficient (ε452) of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase at a pH of 7.5. This value is in the same range as that reported for 4p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (28van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results from steady-state kinetics revealed that 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase has a rather low Michaelis constant (K m ) for 2-hydroxybiphenyl (apparent K m = 2.8 μm), a fact which indicates a high affinity toward the aromatic substrate (2Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, the interaction between the oxidized enzyme and aromatic ligands was investigated by static titration experiments. Binding of 2-hydroxybiphenyl led to marked perturbations in the absorbance of protein-bound FAD. The flavin atypical absorbance at wavelengths higher than 520 nm (cf. Fig. 1 A, spectrum 1) disappeared upon binding of 2-hydroxybiphenyl. A possible explanation is that binding of 2-hydroxybiphenyl disrupts a charge-transfer interaction between the oxidized flavin and an active site residue. Fig.1 B shows the absorption difference spectra recorded upon titration of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase with 2-hydroxybiphenyl. From plotting the absorption changes at 502 nm as a function of substrate concentration and assuming simple 1:1 binding (inset of Fig. 1 B), a dissociation constant for the enzyme-substrate complex of about 10 μm was estimated. As can be seen from Table I, the dissociation constant of the enzyme-2-hydroxybiphenyl complex did not strongly vary between pH 6 and pH 9.Table IDissociation constants of complexes between 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase and aromatic ligands as determined by fluorimetric and spectral perturbation titration experimentsSubstratepHDissociation constantFluorescence spectroscopyAbsorption spectroscopy μm2-Hydroxybiphenyl6.010.0 ± 0.616.5 ± 2.07.56.2 ± 0.49.9 ± 0.79.0ND1-aND, not determined.9.9 ± 0.82-sec-Butylphenol6.022.3 ± 1.4ND7.515.3 ± 1.021.0 ± 2.82-Propylphenol6.030.4 ± 2.0ND7.512.1 ± 0.8ND2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl6.0112.4 ± 5.8ND7.537.4 ± 2.460.0 ± 5.0The experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm MES at a pH of 6.0, 50 mm HEPES at a pH of 7.5, and 50 mm TAPS at a pH of 9.0.1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm MES at a pH of 6.0, 50 mm HEPES at a pH of 7.5, and 50 mm TAPS at a pH of 9.0. Qualitatively similar absorption difference spectra as shown in Fig.1 B were observed when the oxidized enzyme was titrated with 2-sec-butylphenol. From treating the data according to simple 1:1 binding, a dissociation constant for the enzyme-2-sec-butylphenol of about 21 μm was estimated (Table I). Titration of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase with 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl led to somewhat different spectral perturbations (not shown). Again, the long wavelength absorbance above 500 nm disappeared, but the increase in absorbance around 370 and 440 nm (cf. Fig. 1 B) was far less intense than with 2-hydroxybiphenyl. Nevertheless, stoichiometric binding was observed, yielding a dissociation constant for the enzyme-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl complex of about 60 μm (Table I). Upon binding of FAD to the apoprotein, the flavin fluorescence is usually quenched. With 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase, the relative fluorescence quantum yield of protein-bound FAD was about 1% that of free FAD. Since the flavin fluorescence emission at 535 nm of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase showed marked changes upon the binding of aromatic ligands, this feature was used to determine dissociation constants of the enzyme-ligand complexes. Binding of 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase at pH 7.5 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the fluorescence of protein-bound FAD. The binding data could be described by simple 1:1 binding. A dissociation constant for the oxidized enzyme-2-hydroxybiphenyl complex of about 6 μm was calculated from the data (Table I). This value is in agreement with the value of the dissociation constant derived from absorption spectroscopy. Similar fluorescence titration experiments revealed that 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase tightly interacts with the substrate analogs 2-sec-butylphenol and 2-propylphenol (Table I). However, a somewhat weaker binding, especially at a pH of 6.0, was observed for the non-substrate effector 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (Table I). The specific activity of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at 30 °C was 5.8 ± 0.2 units mg−1. This value, based on flavin content analysis and a subunit molecular mass of 63.8 kDa (10Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), is considerably higher than the value originally derived from colorimetric protein determinations (2Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase was determined using the standard assay procedure at pH 7.5. A plot of lnk versus 1/T in the range 7–30 °C yielded a straight line, from which an activation energy of 49.2 ± 0.3 kJ mol−1 was estimated (not shown). At 7 °C, an apparent V max value of 1.3 ± 0.1 units mg−1 and apparent K m values,K m ′ NADH = 9.7 ± 1.8 μm andK m ′ 2-hydroxybiphenyl = 1.9 ± 0.4 μm, were estimated. TheV max at 7 °C corresponds to a turnover rate,k cat = 1.4 ± 0.1 s−1. It should be noted here that this value for the turnover rate refers to the enzyme monomer and not to the tetramer as was done in Ref. 2Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. No effort was made to determine the Michaelis constant for oxygen at 7 °C. However, from earlier kinetic data (2Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A. Fleischmann T. Wubbolts M.G. Kohler H.P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the high solubility of oxygen at low temperature, it is assumed that the estimated turnover rate approaches maximal rate conditions. The mechanism of interaction between 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase and NADH was studied at pH 7.5 (30 °C) by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy. Anaerobic reduction of uncomplexed 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase by NADH (monitored at 450 nm) was rather slow, taking seconds to complete (Fig.2 A). No transient absorbance changes above 500 nm, which would indicate the formation of flavin semiquinones or charge-transfer complexes, were observed. Reduction of the free enzyme by NADH was clearly not a monophasic process. Fitting the data to a two-exponential function showed that the reaction was biphasic. The amplitudes of the two phases remained constant at a ratio of 50:50 when the reaction was performed with NADH at concentrations between 25 μm and 5 mm. A possible explanation for the biphasic kinetics is the presence of two distinct enzyme populations in the absence of substrate (15Arunachalam U. Massey V. Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4611-4618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From treating the data according to such a model, a maximum first-order rate constant at an infinite NADH concentration of 5.5 s−1 and a dissociation constant, K d NADH = 5.8 mm, were estimated for the fast process, whereas a maximum rate constant at infinite NADH concentration of 1.8 s−1and a dissociation constant, K d NADH = 7.3 mm NADH, were calculated for the slow process (inset Fig. 2 A, TableII). The values for the reduction rate of the free enzyme are similar to those for the turnover rate of the NADH oxidase activity of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (2Suske W.A. Held M. Schmid A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24257-24265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which confirms that flavin reduction is rate-limiting in this process.Table IIKinetic parameters for the reductive half-reaction of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenaseLigand-enzyme complexK d NADHk 2mms −1Free enzyme2-aAssuming two enzyme species with different reduction kinetics.5.85.57.31.82-Hydroxybiphenyl-enzyme complex1.62622-sec-Butylphenol-enzyme complex2-aAssuming two enzyme species with different reduction kinetics.1.81373.6362,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl-enzyme complex2-aAssuming two enzyme species with different reduction kinetics.8.61636.826The anaerobic reduction experiments were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES at a pH of 7.5.

Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-204Google Scholar). To accomplish integration, integrase, a viral enzyme, catalyzes two chemical reactions. In the first reaction, end processing, integrase cleaves the terminal dinucleotide from each 3′ end of the double-stranded viral DNA (Fig.1 A). In the second chemical reaction, integration or DNA joining, integrase joins the recessed 3′ ends of the viral DNA to target DNA (Fig. 1 B). Integrase and short sequences at each end of the viral DNA are required for these two reactions. After the viral DNA 3′ ends are joined to host DNA, the 5′ ends of the viral DNA are trimmed and joined to host DNA by a mechanism that remains to be defined (3Acel A. Udashkin B.E. Wainberg M.A. Faust E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2062-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro assays, using duplex oligonucleotides that mimic viral DNA ends and highly purified, recombinant integrase, have been developed to allow detailed analysis of the end-processing and integration reactions (4Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Both the end-processing and integration reactions carried out by HIV-11 integrase produce (S p)-phosphorothioate products from model substrates containing an (R p)-phosphorothioate at the reaction center, implying that both reactions occur by a one-step transesterification mechanism (5Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The available evidence supports a model in which a single active site is responsible for both reactions (6Bujacz G. Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M.

A. 1992; 89: 9598-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The orientation and alteration of the DNA substrates for these two different reactions thus presents an interesting puzzle, as elaborated below. End processing and integration are both polynucleotidyl transfer reactions, but the identity and organization of the reactants relative to the attacking hydroxyl nucleophile and the leaving group are different. In end processing (Fig. 1 A), a specific phosphodiester bond in the viral DNA is attacked by a hydroxyl derived from water (HOH) and the leaving group is the 3′ hydroxyl of the conserved, subterminal adenosine; in integration (Fig. 1 B), this newly formed 3′ hydroxyl is the attacking nucleophile. Moreover, in end processing, the phosphate group undergoing substitution is initially part of the viral DNA end and is released as part of a dinucleotide product after cleavage, while in integration, the phosphate that is attacked is initially part of a separate target DNA substrate that then becomes covalently joined to the viral DNA end. The differences between end processing and integration make it difficult to envision how the DNA substrates in the two reactions could retain a normal double-helical structure and still be accommodated by the same active site. Experimental evidence suggests that the terminal 3 nucleotides of model viral DNA substrates are indeed unpaired prior to end processing (14Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Highly bent sites in DNA are preferred targets for integration, a finding consistent with a need for distortion of the DNA duplex to accommodate the reacting phosphate group in the active site (15Bor Y.C.

Integrase can catalyze a third reaction in vitro, termed “disintegration” (Fig. 1 C; Refs. 10Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 20Chow S.A.

The substrate for this reaction mimics one end of viral DNA joined to target DNA. Disintegration is the macroscopic reverse of the integration reaction: the adjacent 3′ hydroxyl of the target DNA attacks the phosphodiester bond joining viral and target DNA, releasing the model viral DNA end and concomitantly restoring the continuity of the target DNA. In order to interpret results of experiments using disintegration substrates, it is important to determine whether the arrangement of viral and target DNA near the active site is the same for the disintegration and integration reactions. We used phosphorothioate-containing substrates to investigate the orientation of the reacting phosphodiester and the attacking nucleophile in end processing, integration, and disintegration. We found that substrates with an (R p)-phosphorothioate at the reaction center were preferred by HIV-1 integrase as substrates for end processing and integration. In contrast, HIV-1 integrase preferentially catalyzed disintegration of substrates with an (S p)-phosphorothioate at the reaction center. The stereospecificity of integrase in the three reactions provides information regarding the likely arrangement of the key substrate features in the active site and the relationship between viral and target DNA bound to the enzyme. Integrase was purified as described previously (26Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Emeryville, CA) and purified by electrophoresis on a 15% or 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel prior to use. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and exonuclease-free Klenow were purchased from New England Biolabs; modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0) was from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; snake venom phosphodiesterase (SV) and P1 phosphodiesterase (P1), [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]TTP, and [α-32P]dGTP (specific activity of 3,000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the C-18 HPLC column from Rainin; and nucleotides and deoxynucleotides from Life Technologies, Inc.

A “dumbbell” disintegration substrate is composed of a single oligonucleotide that folds into a structure resembling the product of an oligonucleotide integration reaction (Fig. 2 A).The sequence of the dumbbell disintegration substrate (DB1) and preparation of this substrate were as described previously (22Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain a nearly pure population of the less preferred stereoisomer for disintegration, duplicate 500-μl reactions, each containing 300 nm integrase and 1 μm unlabeled dumbbell substrate with a racemic phosphorothioate at the reaction center (DB2), were incubated overnight at 37 °C, in a standard reaction mixture (see below) to convert most of the preferred stereoisomer substrate to product. The reaction products were extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform, then ethanol-precipitated. After resuspension in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (TE), an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 50 mmEDTA) was added and the sample was heated to 90 °C for 3 min before loading onto a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, and the band corresponding to residual substrate was excised, eluted, and precipitated with ethanol. This DNA was 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The disintegration substrate used to determine the stereochemistry of disintegration was radiolabeled at the 3′ end of the target DNA 5′ to the site of joining using exonuclease-free Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dGTP (Fig. 3 A), as follows: 25 μm amounts of the complementary strands TT1 and TB1 were annealed in 20 μl of TEN (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl). Next, 25 μl of a 3.3 μm solution of radiolabeled nucleotide, 5 μl of 10× Klenow buffer (New England Biolabs), and 1 μl (10 units) of exonuclease-free Klenow enzyme were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The oligonucleotides were then separated from unincorporated radionucleotides by passing the reaction mixture over two sequential Sephadex G-15 (Sigma) spin columns and concentrated in a Microcon-3 ultrafiltration device (Amicon). The disintegration substrate has a branched or “Y-shaped” structure that is formed by annealing four oligonucleotides together. For preparation of this “Y-mer” disintegration substrate, a 5-fold molar excess of each of the three unlabeled strands (TT2, TT3, and TB2) was annealed to the strand labeled at its 3′ end (TT1). The disintegration substrate was annealed by heating to 90 °C for 2 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. The correctly annealed product was gel-purified as described previously (20Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of the viral DNA substrate that was used to determine the stereochemistry of integration was annealed (VT2 and a 2-fold molar excess of VB1) and prepared as described above except that [α-32P]dATP was used in the end-labeling reaction (see Fig. 4 A). The target DNA was a 21-mer duplex that contained all phosphodiesters in one version (TT4 annealed to TB3) or phosphorothioates 5′ to all C and G nucleotides in a second version (TT5 annealed to TB4). For preparation of the substrate used to analyze end processing, an oligonucleotide (VT3) was synthesized with a single (racemic) phosphorothioate (see “Oligonucleotides”). The stereoisomers were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a C-18 column (5-μm particle size, 25 × 0.45 cm) using a gradient of 3–13% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid/imidazole, pH 6.5. The peak fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in TE. Reapplying aliquots from each peak fraction to the C-18 column gave the expected single peak. To determine the stereochemistry of the phosphorothioate in each of the two major peak fractions, an aliquot of each was digested with either 200 μg/ml SV at 44 °C for 100 min, or 100 μg/ml P1 at room temperature for 60 min, and analyzed by HPLC. These samples were chromatographed using a gradient consisting of 3–16% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid/triethylamine, pH 6.5. The dinucleotide AG was chromatographed under the same conditions for use as a standard. The early eluting peak contained a P1-resistant AG dinucleotide but was completely digested to mononucleotides by SV, while the late-eluting peak had a SV-resistant AG dinucleotide, but was completely digested to mononucleotides by P1, indicating that the early peak contained an oligonucleotide with an (R p)-phosphorothioate and the late peak contained an oligonucleotide with an (S p)-phosphorothioate (27Burgers P.M.J. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Potter B.V.L. Connelly B.A. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To make the end-processing substrate, each oligonucleotide containing a homogeneous stereoisomer was phosphorylated at its 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and cold ATP. After heat inactivation of T4 polynucleotide kinase, the phosphorothioate-containing oligonucleotide was annealed to VT4 and VB2. Ligase buffer and ligase were added to the annealed oligonucleotides, and the reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 16 °C. Sequenase 2.0 and [α-32P]TTP were then used to fill in the 3′ nucleotide of the VT4 strand ligated to the VT3 strand (see Fig. 5 A). The phosphodiester substrate was made by annealing VT5 to VB1 and radiolabeling the 3′ end of VT5 in the same manner. EDTA (25 mm) was added to stop the reaction, and the reaction products were passed over a Sephadex G-15 column to remove unincorporated [α-32P]TTP. The 21-mer product was purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis, quantitated, and annealed to VB1. The reaction buffer for kinetic experiments performed with a dumbbell disintegration substrate (Fig. 2 A) contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm NaCl. Reactions were performed in duplicate and with 1 μm disintegration substrate and 200 nm integrase and were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at specified times, quenched with formamide-containing gel-loading buffer, and substrates and products were separated by denaturing electrophoresis and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Results from duplicate experiments were averaged. The disintegration reactions from which product was isolated for stereochemical analysis were carried out with 200 nmintegrase and 100 nm substrate using the above buffer and conditions. Products were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis, eluted in 0.5 m ammonium acetate plus 10 mm magnesium acetate, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in TE for digestion by the stereospecific phosphodiesterases. Integration reactions were performed for stereochemical analysis in the same buffer used for the disintegration reaction by preincubating 20 nm radiolabeled viral end DNA and 300 nm integrase in 100 μl for 5 min at 37 °C and then adding 1 μm target DNA (either TT4 annealed to TB3 or TT5 annealed to TB4). After incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, reactions were quenched with formamide loading buffer, and the products purified by electrophoresis as described above for the disintegration product analysis. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 7.5 mm of either MgCl2 or MnCl2, and 300 nmdithiothreitol and 2.75 nm substrate (all phosphodiester, (R p)-phosphorothioate at the reaction center, or (S p)-phosphorothioate at the reaction center, see “End-processing Substrates”). In reactions containing 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5% polyethylene glycol and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide were included (29Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5908-5911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerol (10% v/v) was added in one of the two sets of reactions performed with 7.5 mmMnCl2. Aliquots were removed at specified times and quenched. Samples were loaded onto a 24% polyacrylamide plus 8m urea denaturing gel in 1× TTE (89 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 29 mm taurine, and 0.5 mm EDTA) with 0.5× TTE gel running buffer. Duplicate reactions were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and averaged. P1 phosphodiesterase (P1) was resuspended at 1 mg/ml in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.2. Digestions with P1 were performed in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at room temperature with 17 μg/ml P1 for the disintegration products and at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml P1 for the integration products. SV was resuspended at 2 mg/ml in 110 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 110 mmNaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, and 50% glycerol. Digestions with SV (200 μg/ml) were performed in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 15 mmMgCl2 at 37 °C for the integration reaction products and 44 °C for the disintegration product. The samples were electrophoresed as described for 3′ end processing. A dumbbell disintegration substrate, composed of a single oligonucleotide that folds on itself to form a structure mimicking one viral DNA end joined to target DNA (Fig.2 A; Ref. 22Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was chemically synthesized with either a standard phosphodiester or a racemic phosphorothioate at the junction between viral and target DNA. The kinetics of disintegration of these two substrates were compared (Fig.2 B). Approximately 85% of the substrate with the standard phosphodiester bond at the junction was converted to product by 90 min, but only 45% of the substrate with the racemic phosphorothioate at the junction was converted to product even after 300 min. As chemically synthesized phosphorothioates are typically composed of a roughly 1:1 mixture of the two stereoisomers (along with a small amount of contaminating phosphodiester material) (30Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the leveling-off of product formation at approximately 50% suggested that integrase preferentially disintegrated one of the two stereoisomers. To test and quantitate this preference for one stereoisomer, we purified the putative less preferred stereoisomer by isolating the residual substrate following overnight reaction of the dumbbell disintegration substrate with integrase. This material was then radiolabeled and used as a substrate in a second disintegration reaction (Fig. 2 C). Parallel reactions were carried out with otherwise identical substrates containing a standard phosphodiester bond or a racemic phosphorothioate at the reaction center. The rate of disintegration of the phosphodiester substrate was at least 50-fold greater than that of the less preferred phosphorothioate stereoisomer. This value is a lower limit because of potential contamination of the less preferred stereoisomer substrate with either the phosphodiester substrate or the preferred phosphorothioate stereoisomer. If the substrate containing the racemic phosphorothioate was not substantially contaminated with phosphodiester substrate, and the stereoisomers were present initially at a ratio near 1:1, then the disintegration rate of the preferred phosphorothioate stereoisomer was about 2-fold lower than that of the phosphodiester substrate. Two stereospecific phosphodiesterases were used to determine the stereochemistry of products of the integration and disintegration reactions. P1 has a high stereospecificity for (S p)-phosphorothioates (28Potter B.V.L. Connelly B.A. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas SV has a high stereospecificity for (R p)-phosphorothioates (27Burgers P.M.J. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A Y-mer disintegration substrate was constructed to determine the stereochemistry of the product of the disintegration reaction (Fig.3 A, see also “Y-mer Disintegration Substrates” under “Experimental Procedures”). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, approximately 65% of the phosphodiester substrate and 15% of the phosphorothioate substrate had been converted to product (data not shown). The ligated target DNA strands from these disintegration reactions were isolated by gel electrophoresis and analyzed by digestion with P1 and SV. With the racemic phosphorothioate substrate, the ligated target DNA strand resulting from the disintegration reaction (Fig. 3 B,lane 10) contained a dinucleotide that was resistant to digestion with P1 (lanes 11–14), but was completely digested to mononucleotides by SV (lanes 15–18). This cleavage pattern is expected for the (R p)-phosphorothioate isomer. The product originating from the phosphodiester substrate (Fig. 3 B,lane 1) was completely digested by both P1 (lanes 2–5) and SV (lanes 6–9), under conditions identical to those used to digest the phosphorothioate-containing product. Control reactions with purified phosphorothioate stereoisomers validated the stereospecificity of these preparations of P1 and SV (see “Experimental Procedures”). Assuming that disintegration, like 3′ end processing and integration (5Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), proceeds with inversion about the reactive phosphoryl group, integrase preferentially catalyzed disintegration of the substrate containing the S p stereoisomer at the reaction center. Densitometry of the dinucleotide remaining in the final time point of the SV digestion (Fig. 3 B, lane 18) gave a ratio of ∼50 for the mononucleotide relative to the dinucleotide digestion product, suggesting a strong preference for the (S p)-phosphorothioate substrate over the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate. Phosphorothioate substrates were designed to monitor the stereochemistry of the products of the integration reaction (Fig.4 A). The phosphodiester bond immediately 3′ to the terminal adenosine residue of the viral DNA substrate was radiolabeled. The purified products from integration into either all-phosphodiester target DNA (Fig. 4 B,lane 8) or the phosphorothioate-containing target DNA (lane 1) were digested separately with P1 or SV. The products of integration into the all-phosphodiester target DNA were completely digested to mononucleotides by both SV (lanes 9–11) and P1 (lanes 12–14). After extensive digestion of the products of integration into the phosphorothioate-containing target DNA with SV, residual AC and AG dinucleotides persisted (lanes 2–4), suggesting that these dinucleotides had theS p stereochemistry expected from attack of the viral 3′ hydroxyl on (R p)-phosphorothioates 5′ to a C or G. The mononucleotides were the products expected from SV digestion of integration products in which the viral ends had joined 5′ to an A or T, residues without phosphorothioate substitution. Because the target oligonucleotide contained runs of up to six consecutive G and C nucleotides, each containing phosphorothioate linkages, SV digestion would also be expected to yield smaller quantities of products larger than a dinucleotide, as was observed (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the absence of an accumulation of dinucleotide and longer products with P1 digestion suggests that there was no significant integration reaction with the (S p)-phosphorothioates. Phosphorothioate-containing oligonucleotides mimicking a viral DNA end were designed to monitor the stereochemistry of the products of the end-processing reaction (Fig. 5 A). To determine integrase's stereospecificity for end processing, we compared the rates of end processing of stereochemically pure viral DNA end substrates containing either an (S p)- or (R p)-phosphorothioate at the reaction center. (R p)-Phosphorothioate, (S p)-phosphorothioate, and phosphodiester substrates were tested in parallel end-processing reactions. The end-processing rate for the R p stereoisomer substrate was at least 50-fold greater than the rate for theS p stereoisomer substrate, when Mn2+was used as the metal ion cofactor (Fig. 5 B). The rate of end processing for the phosphodiester substrate was only slightly higher than the rate observed for the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate. The same stereospecificity was observed with Mg2+ as the metal ion cofactor (Fig. 5 C); the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate was processed at a rate 40-fold higher than that observed with the (S p)-phosphorothioate substrate, and the phosphodiester substrate was processed slightly faster than the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate. Integrase also preferred the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate for end processing in reactions carried out in the presence of 7.5 mm MnCl2 and 10% glycerol (data not shown). It has been previously shown that end processing can give three chemically distinct dinucleotide products, depending on the nucleophile used (5Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar,31Vink C. Yeheskiely E. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 199: 6691-6698Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When Mg2+ is included as the divalent cation, water is the primary nucleophile, and the main product is the hydrolysis product, a linear GT dinucleotide. However, in the presence of Mn2+, a variety of nucleophiles can be used, including glycerol, generating the dinucleotide (GT) product linked at its 5′ end to glycerol, or the terminal 3′ hydroxyl of the viral DNA, producing a 3′-5′ cyclic dinucleotide. Furthermore, the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate and the phosphodiester substrate yielded similar proportions of cyclic product (data not shown). Thus, the substitution of sulfur for a non-bridging oxygen did not appear to alter the propensity of the terminal 3′ hydroxyl to reach and attack the reactive subterminal viral phosphodiester relative to attack by water. In contrast, the proportion of product formed from the use of glycerol as a nucleophile was 4-fold lower for the (R p)-phosphorothioate substrate than for the phosphodiester substrate (Fig. 5 D). Since sulfur is a much poorer hydrogen bond acceptor than oxygen, this result suggests that hydrogen bonding between the cis-hydroxyl of the glycerol and the oxygen of the reactive phosphate helps to position the glycerol for nucleophilic attack. Such an interaction could account for the preference for cis-diols relative to simple alcohols as nucleophiles in the end-processing reaction (31Vink C. Yeheskiely E. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 199: 6691-6698Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The observed stereospecificity of HIV-1 integrase in catalyzing end processing, integration, or disintegration of model substrates with phosphorothioates at the reaction center places new constraints on models for the orientation of reactants in the enzyme's active site. A model for the arrangement of substrate features in the active site of HIV integrase, based on these results and previous observations, is illustrated in Fig. 6. This model begins with three assumptions. 1) The transition state is a trigonal bipyramid, with the nucleophile and leaving groups occupying the apical positions for an in-line attack and the other three, equatorial substituents coplanar with the central phosphorus, as expected from chemical and enzymological precedents (32Dennis E.A. Westheimer F.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3432-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 877-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). 2) Integrase uses a single active site to catalyze end processing, integration, and disintegration, as suggested by mutational and structural results (6Bujacz G.

A. 1992; 89: 9598-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 3) Certain specific interactions in the active site are the same for all three reactions (see below). In developing this model, we first consider groups occupying the apical positions of the trigonal bipyramid transition state, basing our discussion on previous results. We then turn to results from the present study that pertain to the placement of groups in the equatorial positions of the transition state. Both in vivo and in vitro results suggest that the phylogenetically conserved CA/TG dinucleotide pair adjacent to the cleavage site at the viral DNA end is a crucial feature for recognition of viral DNA by integrase. In vitro, changing the phylogenetically conserved CA/TG dinucleotide pair adjacent to the cleavage site in a model substrate results in up to a 100-fold reduction in end processing or disintegration activity (4Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 14Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O.

In vivo, integration of viral genomes in which the conserved CA/TG dinucleotide pair has been altered by mutation is impaired by a factor of 105. Since the CA/TG dinucleotide pair is critical for all three reactions, it is reasonable to assume that this substrate feature is bound in the same specific site for end processing, integration, and disintegration. This site is depicted inyellow in Fig. 6. In the transition state for phosphoryl transfer, the nucleophile and the leaving group typically occupy the apical positions. As noted above, previous results have strongly suggested that the phylogenetically conserved adenosine of the viral DNA end is bound in the same specific site for all three reactions. Because the 3′ hydroxyl of this adenosine is either the attacking or leaving group in each of the integrase-catalyzed reactions, the model places the fixed binding site for this 3′ hydroxyl in an apical position, highlighted inyellow in the illustration (Fig. 6). The other attacking or leaving group in each reaction, the identity of which depends upon the reaction, occupies the opposite apical position, highlighted inblue (Fig. 6). According to the proposed model, the “blue” apical position would then be occupied by water or an alcohol hydroxyl acting as the nucleophile in end processing, or a target DNA 3′-hydroxyl acting as the nucleophile or the leaving group in disintegration and integration, respectively. We now consider the groups that occupy the equatorial positions. The stereospecificity observed for phosphorothioate stereoisomers in the end-processing, integration, and disintegration reactions suggest that, in each of these reactions, the active site interacts with one of the non-esterified phosphoryl oxygen atoms in manner that discriminates against a substituted sulfur atom. Fig. 6 presents the simplest model to account for these observations, in which a single site, depicted inpink, interacts with a non-esterified oxygen atom, but cannot readily accommodate a sulfur atom. Once the occupants of the two apical positions and one of the three equatorial positions in the transition state are specified, the observed stereospecificities of the three integrase-catalyzed reactions dictate the arrangements of the remaining substituents. Somewhat surprisingly, the results strongly imply that the site occupied by the target DNA extending 3′ from the reaction center (indicated in purple in Fig. 6) is not the same as the site that accommodates the 3′ terminal dinucleotide of the viral DNA end in the end-processing reaction (indicated ingreen in Fig. 6). The basis for this specific arrangement is not known. One possibility is that the site that binds the 3′-terminal dinucleotide in the end-processing reaction (green) interacts favorably with a single strand of DNA in a configuration that it can only adopt when not base paired. If double-helical DNA cannot be accommodated in this (green) site, but can be accommodated in the other equatorial site (purple), then the target DNA extending 3′ from the reaction center would be constrained to occupy this (purple) position. DNA targets can vary widely with respect to the size and structure of the features 3′ to the reaction center (22Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this (purple) site may better be viewed as a space that can accommodate this portion of the target DNA rather than a site that provides crucial specific binding interactions. Although results of previous photo-cross-linking studies of the integrase-DNA complex were not explicitly used in developing the model shown in Fig. 6, the resulting model is entirely consistent with the architecture of the integrase-DNA complex inferred from those cross-linking studies (43Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Macroscopically, disintegration is the reverse of the integration reaction. Moreover, the substrate specificity of the reactions is homologous (22Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O.

Integrase's preference for opposite phosphorothioate stereoisomers for integration and disintegration provides further support for a reciprocal relationship between the two reactions and for a model in which the local arrangement of viral and target DNA in the active site is the same for the two reactions. Enzymes in the integrase/transposase family of polynucleotidyl transferases all apparently catalyze cleavage and joining of the transposable element DNA by similar mechanisms (5Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 45Mizuuchi K. Adzuma K.

Many of these enzymes, including the VDJ recombinase, the bacteriophage Mu transposase, HIV-1 integrase, and murine leukemia virus integrase, appear to disrupt base pairing in the vicinity of the reaction center in their otherwise double-helical substrates, and these enzyme-induced disruptions of the double-helical structure of their substrates can facilitate catalysis in vitro (14Scottoline B.P.

This local disruption of DNA structure appears to be a common means by which these enzymes manage to use the same active site for donor cleavage and joining. It will now be interesting to investigate whether the evolutionary conservation of structural and mechanistic features of the enzymes in this family will extend to the arrangement of the analogous DNA substrates in their active sites.

Chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls (Bchls)1have a chelated magnesium atom and function in light harvesting and energy-generating charge separation. Very recently, however, an exception was reported that a purple bacterium, Acidiphilium rubrum, possesses zinc-containing Bchl a (zinc-Bchla) as its major chlorophyll (1Wakao N. Yokoi N. Isoyama N.

This finding modifies our common understanding that naturally occurring chlorophylls and Bchls ubiquitously have a chelated magnesium atom at the center of macrocyclic ring. In the biosynthetic pathway of chlorophylls and Bchls, magnesium chelation into protoporphyrin IX (Proto) is catalyzed by magnesium chelatase to successively form magnesium-Proto monomethyl ester, and the magnesium atom is retained in the subsequent synthesis of chlorophylls. Magnesium chelatase genes have been cloned from higher plants, cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria, and they are composed of three cognate genes, chlI (bchI),chlD (bchD), and chlH(bchH) (2Papenbrock J.

Considering many investigations on metal chelation of tetrapyrrolesin vivo and in vitro, the following three possible mechanisms can be proposed for the formation of zinc-Bchla in A. rubrum: 1) The zinc atom is directly inserted into Proto by the catalysis of a novel “zinc chelatase.” 2) The zinc atom is directly inserted into Proto by a presently existing metal chelatase such as magnesium chelatase or ferrochelatase. 3) After magnesium is inserted into Proto by magnesium chelatase, a zinc atom is substituted for the magnesium atom enzymatically or non-enzymatically. In all cases, the zinc atom is thought to be retained throughout the rest of the biosynthesis, since it is known that enzymes involved in the steps after magnesium insertion in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, such as NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (6Griffiths W.T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and chlorophyll synthetase (7Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1992; 47: 231-238Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), can use both magnesium and zinc chlorophyll derivatives as substrates. Besides these possibilities, formation of zinc-Proto has been reported in several biological materials. Ferrochelatase is known to catalyze in vitro chelation of divalent metals including zinc, and may form zinc-Proto in vivo in erythrocytes of patients affected with lead poisoning and iron deficiency anemia (8Lamola A.A. Yamane T. Science. 1974; 186: 936-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In photosynthetic organisms, formation of zinc-Proto has been demonstrated with cell-free systems of such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides (9Neuberger A. Tait G.H. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and greening cucumber cotyledons (10Fuesler T.P. Wright Jr., L.A. Castelfranco P.A. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 246-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it may be formed nonenzymatically. Furthermore, it is well known that among chlorophyll derivatives containing metals other than magnesium, only zinc-containing chlorophylls have chemical features comparable to those of magnesium-chlorophylls (11Watanabe T. Kobayashi M. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar), and have been widely used in studies of artificial photosynthesis by virtue of good stability of zinc-porphyrin derivatives (12Wasielewski M.R. Niemczyk M.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 5043-5045Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that inA. rubrum zinc-Bchl is synthesized from such nonspecifically formed zinc-Proto, although no in vivo formation of zinc-complexed chlorophyll has been reported in these organisms, All known species of the genus Acidiphilium are chemoheterotrophic aerobes and extremely acidophilic bacteria showing optimum pH for growth at around 3.0. They belong to the α-subclass ofProteobacteria that includes many typical Bchl-utilizing photosynthetic bacteria (13Kishimoto N. Kosaka Y. Wakao N. Tano T. Hiraishi A. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 85-91Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that theAcidiphilium species utilize zinc-Bchl instead of acid-labile Bchl in order to adapt themselves to the acidic environment. In fact, our previous study (14Masuda T. Nagayama M. Inoue K. Ohta H. Shimda H. Takamiya K. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. IV. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1998: 3233-3236Google Scholar) showed that the ratio of zinc-Bchl/Bchl in A. rubrum cells increases as the pH of the growth medium decreases to pH 3.5, suggesting that zinc-Bchl accumulation may be correlated with the acidic environment of A. rubrum. In this study, we demonstrate that in A. rubrum magnesium is initially inserted into Proto by a magnesium chelatase homolog to form magnesium-Proto monomethyl ester and it is most likely that in a later step the magnesium atom is substituted by zinc atom. A. rubrum(ATCC35905) was grown aerobically in darkness by shaking at 60 strokes per min at 30 °C in 5 × BYG medium (pH 3.5) containing mineral salts, 0.05% yeast extract, and 0.5% fructose in L-shaped tubes (1Wakao N. Yokoi N. Isoyama N. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Kobayashi M. Kise H. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Takaichi S. Sakurai Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 889-893Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The photosynthetic bacterium Rba. sphaeroides strain 2.4.1 was cultured photosynthetically as described previously (15Shimada H. Wada T. Handa H. Ohta H. Mizoguchi H. Nishimura K. Masuda T. Shioi Y. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The insertional mutants of bchI (strain DB350), bchD(strain DB561), and bchH (strain ZY6) of Rhodobacter capsulatus (16Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Yang Z.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 126: 619-629Google Scholar) were grown chemoheterotrophically or phototrophically in PYS or RCV 2/3 PCV medium as described (18Young D.A. Bauer C.E. Williams J.C. Marrs B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two sets of degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions of the BchI/ChlI and the BchH/ChlH protein sequences. ForbchI, an upstream primer (DG-UI) 5′-GG(C/G)GA(A/G)AAGGC(C/G)TTCGA(A/G)CC(C/G)GG(C/G)CT(C/G)CT(C/G)GC-3′ and a downstream primer (DG-DI) 5′-TGCGG(C/G)CG(C/G)AG(A/G)TC(C/G)CC(C/T)TC(C/T)TC(C/G)GGGTT(C/G)CC-3′ were made from the invariant amino acid motifs of GEKAFEPGLLA and GNPEEG(D/E)LRPQ, respectively. Likewise, for BchH, an upstream primer (DG-UH) 5′-GC(C/G)TTCGG(C/G)TA(C/T)GA(A/G)GG(C/G)GA(C/T)CC(C/G)ATGCG-3′ and a downstream primer (DG-UH) 5′-GT(C/G)GC(C/T)TC(C/G)GA(C/G)GGGTTGTT(C/G)GC(C/G)GC(A/G)TA-3′ were designed from the amino acid motifs (T/V) FGYEGDPMR and YAANNPSEAT, respectively. These primers were applied by PCR to amplify DNA from the A. rubrum genome. LA Taq polymerase (Takara Shuzo) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction. Temperature regime used was as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 0.5 min and 68 °C for 2 min. Fragments of 221 and 257 base pairs were PCR amplified and cloned by standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strul K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). For isolation of the A. rubrum bchI gene, approximately 10 μg of A. rubrum genomic DNA was digested withBamHI and StuI, and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Since the radiolabeled bchI PCR product hybridized to ≈5 kilobases of BamHI- and ≈4 kilobases ofStuI-digested genomic DNA, DNA fragments around these sizes were recovered from gels and cloned into pZErO-2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The two obtained mini-genomic plasmid libraries were screened with the bchI probe. For isolation of the A. rubrum bchH gene, a genomic clone of A. rubrum, designated pAr2, which functionally complementedbchN-disrupted mutant of Rba. capsulatus,appeared to contain A. rubrum bchH gene (see “Results”). The cosmid pAr2 was digested with BamHI and StuI, and the digested fragments were cloned into pZErO-2.1 vector. Obtained plasmid clones were screened with the radiolabeledbchH PCR fragment. Library screening, DNA manipulations, and hybridizations were performed according to standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strul K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Double-stranded plasmids containing cloned gene fragments were sequenced with LI-COR Model 4000L sequencer and the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Results were analyzed by the GENETYX program (Software Development). Genomic DNA was prepared from A. rubrum cells according to standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strul K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). After digestion by restriction enzymes, 10 μg of each digested DNA was separated on a 0.7% agarose gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane. This blot was hybridized with the respective32P-labeled PCR product for 16 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the blot was washed twice with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. To construct pET24a (Novagen) derivatives containing thebchI, -D, and -H genes, specific oligonucleotides including the stop and start codons from the respective gene sequences were designed with preceding NdeI site containing a start codon of each gene. These oligonucleotides were used to amplify DNA by PCR and to introduce NdeI and relevant restriction sites for cloning the PCR fragments into pET24a vector. After sequence confirmation, these constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novogen) strain. Expression of recombinant proteins were induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 mm at 37 °C. After 3 h, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min and the resultant supernatants were subjected for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and used for magnesium chelatase activity assay as described by Kannangara et al. (21Kannangara C.G. Vothknecht U.C. Hansson M. von Wettstein D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For assay of zinc chelatase activity, zinc chloride was added to the reaction mixture instead of magnesium chloride. For in vitro transcription and translation of recombinant proteins, DNA templates of the pET24a derivatives were reacted with [35S]methionine (ICN) and PROTEINscript kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Each gene fragment of the pET24a derivatives was introduced into NdeI and blunt ended PstI sites of pZJ102 vector (gifted from Z.-Y. Jiang and C. E. Bauer), yielding pZJ-bchI, pZJ-bchD, and pZJ-bchH. Plasmid pZJ102 is a derivative of pBBR1MCS5 (accession number U25061), which containsRba. capsulatus puc promoter for high level of expression inRba. capsulatus, and the ATG in NdeI site of this vector is positioned as the start codon of pucB gene. The plasmids of pET-bch constructs were also digested withXbaI and relevant restriction enzymes, and resulting fragments containing each gene with a ribosome-binding site originated from pET24a were introduced just downstream of bch genes of the relevant pZJ-bch plasmids. All 6 combinations of genes, which were doubly ligated at the same transcriptional direction underpuc promoter of pZJ102, were constructed, and designated pZJ-bchI-D, -I-H, -D-I,-D-H, -H-I, and -H-D. Likewise, all 6 combinations of triple ligated pZJ-bch plasmids were constructed by preparing 6 combinations of the double ligated fragments containing a ribosome-binding site and each gene in pBluescript II SK-, followed by introduction of these cassettes into relevant pZJ-bch plasmids, yielding pZJ-bchI-D-H,-I-H-D, -D-I-H, -D-H-I,-H-I-D, and -H-D-I. The above 15 pZJ-bch constructs and pZJ102 vector were transformed intoE. coli strain S17-1 (22Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar), permitting conjugative transfer of each of the plasmids into the insertional mutants of Rba. capsulatus (16Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Yang Z.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 126: 619-629Google Scholar). Complementation of mutants of Rba. capsulatus strains was performed by conjugation, followed by selection for photosynthetic growth in RCV medium. A 4-day grown 50-ml culture of cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and pigments were extracted as described by Belanger and Rebeiz (23Belanger F.C. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of Bchls, the resulting hexane fractions which contain esterified Bchls and carotenoids were subjected for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Separation of various esterified forms of Bchls was achieved using the method of Shioi et al.(24Shioi Y. Watanabe K. Takamiya K. Garrido J.L. Zapata M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Sample was loaded onto a Asahipak ODP-50 column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, Showa Denko, Tokyo) and eluted using a linear mobile-phase gradient from methanol, 1 m ammonium acetate (8:2, v/v) to acetonitrile/acetone (7:3, v/v) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 27 °C. The duration of the gradient was 28 min and the final composition was maintained isocratic for 10 min. The elution of pigments was monitored fluorimetrically using wavelength of excitation at 370 nm and emission at 780 nm. For analysis of polar porphyrins, the resulting diethyl ether fraction, which contains pigments free of carotenoids and esterified Bchls, was subjected to spectral analysis and HPLC. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with an excitation wavelength at 415 nm with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Model 850). Porphyrins were separated by HPLC on a Zorbax ODS (Du Pont) column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Pigments were eluted with linear gradient of solvent B (90% methanol, 0.1 m ammonium acetate) in solvent A (0.1 m ammonium acetate) as follows: 20–100% over 10 min and 100% solvent B for 20 min (25Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The elution of pigments was monitored fluorimetrically using excitation wavelength at 418 nm and emission at 595 nm. For identification of magnesium-porphyrins, the extract from 2,2′-dipyridyl-treated cucumber cotyledons was used as an origin containing the standards of magnesium-Proto and its monomethyl ester (26Duggan J. Gassman M. Plant Physiol. 1974; 53: 206-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For identification of zinc-porphyrins, commercially available zinc-Proto (Sigma) and chemically zinc-substituted porphyrins from magnesium-porphyrins were used as standard of zinc-Proto and its monomethyl ester, respectively. Zinc substitution was carried out directly into porphyrins in the extract of Rba. sphaeroides by the metal acetate method (27Buchler J.W. The Porphyins. Academic Press, New York1978Google Scholar). For PCR amplification, we used two sets of degenerate primer pairs, designed from conserved regions of the BchI/ChlI and the BchH/ChlH protein sequences and subsequently cloned two fragments of A. rubrumgenomic DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that the two fragments were highly identical to the Rba. capsulatus bchI (90.5%) andbchH (87%) genes, respectively. These fragments were used to screen a genomic library of A. rubrum. For isolation of the bchI gene, we obtained two overlapping plasmid clones designated pIGBB4z and pIGSS3z. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis revealed that these two clones comprised 4,965 bp of theA. rubrum genome which includes the genesbchP-orf168-bchI-bchD-orf320-crtI, showing that genes for Bchl biosynthesis in A. rubrum were clustered likeRba. capsulatus (Fig. 1). For isolation of the bchH gene, by PCR amplification and Southern hybridization analyses, we found that a genomic clone ofA. rubrum in cosmid pJRD215, designated pAr2, which functionally complemented bchN-disrupted mutant ofRba. capsulatus, 2K. Inoue, unpublished result. contained the A. rubrum bchH gene. From pAr2 cosmid DNA, we cloned two overlapping plasmid subclones, designated pHCEN9z and pHCSS7z. These two clones comprised 7,482 base pairs of the A. rubrum genome which includes the genes bchF-N-B-H-L, the gene organization of which was identical to that of Rba. capsulatus (Fig. 1). The involvement of the bchN gene in this region coincides with the fact that pAr2 complemented thebchN mutant of Rba. capsulatus. The A. rubrum bchI gene encoded a protein of 345 amino acids with a calculated mass of 37.4 kDa and 59.8 and 49.4% amino acid identity to BchI of Rba. capsulatus and ChlI ofSynechocystis PCC6803, respectively. A phosphate-binding motif (GX 4GKS) which is commonly conserved in other BchI homologs was also conserved in the A. rubrum BchI sequence, located about 35 amino acids from the NH2-terminal end of the protein. The A. rubrum bchD gene encoded a protein of 558 amino acids with a calculated mass of 57.9 kDa and 40.5 and 28.5% amino acid identity to BchD ofRba. capsulatus and Synechocystis PCC6803, respectively. The primary structure of A. rubrum BchD conserved some common features to those of other BchD homologs. The NH2-terminal half (260 residues) of the A. rubrum BchD significantly resembled the entire BchI sequences (30.4 and 28.8% amino acid identity to BchI of A. rubrumand Rba. sphaeroides, respectively). Like Rba. capsulatus, the NH2 terminus phosphate-binding motif conserved in BchI was lost in A. rubrum BchD. Immediately after the BchI homologous region, a proline-rich sequence at the center, followed by highly charged stretch of amino acids was observed in the A. rubrum BchD like other BchD homologs. The A. rubrum bchH gene encoded a protein of 1,200 amino acids with a calculated mass of 129.3 kDa and 50.7% amino acid identity to BchH ofRba. capsulatus. Three completely conserved His residues in other BchH homologs, which are considered to be associated with binding of substrates and catalysis of magnesium chelatase (28Walker C.J. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), were also conserved in the A. rubrum BchH (positions at 589, 593, and 734). Comparison of hydropathy profiles of A. rubrum BchI, -D, and -H with those of Rba. capsulatus showed no significant difference between the two species (data not shown). Genomic Southern hybridizations with the radiolabeled fragments described in the previous section showed a single band, indicating that each gene is encoded by a respective single gene in A. rubrum (Fig. 2). DNA fragments containing the A. rubrum bchI,-D, and -H genes were separately cloned into pET24a, and the E. coli cultures containing these constructs were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.In vivo expression in E. coli induced recombinant BchI and BchH proteins in the predicted molecular weight sizes on SDS-PAGE gel, whereas the BchD protein was not detected as in the case of Rba. sphaeroides (4Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), probably because of very low abundance (Fig. 3 A). However, an in vitro transcription and translation experiment showed that all three proteins were expressed at the predicted molecular weight sizes (Fig. 3 B). We tried to reconstitute metal chelatase activity by combination of all these in vivo andin vitro expressed proteins. However, unlike the case ofRba. sphaeroides (4Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), magnesium chelatase activity was hardly detected in various buffer systems and at the pH value tested (data not shown). In addition, when zinc was added to the reaction mixture instead of magnesium, a substantial quantity of zinc-Proto was always formed even without recombinant protein(s), indicating that zinc-Proto can be easily formed non-enzymatically in vitro. Therefore, we concluded that in the in vitro reconstitution experiment it was difficult to distinguish whether the A. rubrum chelatase catalyzes only the insertion of magnesium or both magnesium and zinc. In addition to the reconstitution experiments, we examined the metal chelating activity of the A. rubrum bchI,-D, and -H gene products by complementation ofRba. capsulatus bchI, -D, and -Hmutants (16Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Yang Z.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 126: 619-629Google Scholar). The A. rubrum bchI, -D, and-H genes were inserted under puc promoter of pZJ102, and introduced into the Rba. capsulatus mutants by conjugation. To examine the interaction among A. rubrum andRba. capsulatus subunits in the complementation, we also introduced double and triple ligated A. rubrum bch genes into Rba. capsulatus mutant strains. In this case, we constructed all possible combinations of genes, in case the order of genes may affect the expression or the complex formation of the enzyme (Table I). Initially, we evaluated the ability to complement by appearance of colonies during 7 days of photosynthetic growth. In this test, pZJ-bchI-D, pZJ-bchI-H-D, pZJ-bchH-I-D, and pZJ-bchH-D-I were effective for complementation ofbchI and -D mutants of Rba. capsulatus(evaluated as ++ in Table I), and no complementation of bchHmutant was observed. However, when the incubation period was prolonged, tiny colonies frequently or always appeared from all bchI,-D, and -H mutants strains. Although the frequency and the time required for colony formation varied, theRba. capsulatus bchI mutant was essentially complemented by pZJ derivatives that contained the A. rubrum bchI gene in constructs (evaluated + or ± in Table I). With thebchD mutant, occasional or frequent complementaion by pZJ-bchD-I and pZJ-bchI-D-H was observed. The complementation of the bchH mutant was observed in conjugants with pZJ-bchH, pZJ-bchH-D, pZJ-bchI-H-D, pZJ-bchH-I-D, and pZJ-bchH-D-I. We should note that even in low frequency and weak complementations such as observed with pZJ-bchI-H for the bchI mutant, and with pZJ-bchH and pZJ-bchH-D-I for the bchH mutant, such complementations were clearly distinguishable from reversion of the mutants, which recovered the ability of photosynthetic growth, because complemented colonies were formed from most of the conjugation spots and these were able to grow in the presence of selection antibiotics for pZJ102, while the revertants occasionally formed a few colonies from conjugation spots, but these were sensitive to antibiotic.Table IComplementation analysis of bchI, -D, and -H mutants of Rba. capsulatusPlasmidMutant (strain)1-a++, complemented colonies were always observed within 7 days of photosynthetic growth; +, the complementation was always or frequently (more than 60%) observed after more than 7 days of incubation; ±, the complementation was occasionally (less than 60%) observed after more than 7 days of incubation; −, no complementation was observed.bchI (DB350)bchD(DB561)bchH (ZY6)pZJ102−−−pZJ-bchI+−−pZJ-bchD−−−pZJ-bchH−−±pZJ-bchI-D++++−pZJ-bchI-H±−−pZJ-bchD-I+±−pZJ-bchD-H−−−pZJ-bchH-I+−−pZJ-bchH-D−−+pZJ-bchI-D-H+++−pZJ-bchI-H-D+++++pZJ-bchD-I-H+−−pZJ-bchD-H-I+−−pZJ-bchH-I-D++++±pZJ-bchH-D-I++++±Complementation of the Rba. capsulatus mutant strains was performed by conjugation with E. coli strain S17–1 harboring pZJ102 plasmid derivatives, followed by selection for photosynthetic growth in RCV medium.

https://openalex.org/W1990961407,"Reactivities of the two essential cysteine residues in the heavy metal binding motif, MTC14AAC17, of the periplasmic Hg2+-binding protein, MerP, have been examined. While Cys-14 and Cys-17 have previously been shown to be Hg2+-binding residues, MerP is readily isolated in an inactive Cys-14–Cys-17 disulfide form. In vivo results demonstrated that these cysteine residues are reduced in the periplasm of Hg2+-resistant Escherichia coli. Denaturation and redox equilibrium studies revealed that reduced MerP is thermodynamically favored over the oxidized form. The relative stability of reduced MerP appears to be related to the lowered thiol pK a (5.5) of the Cys-17 side chain. Despite its much lower pK a, the Cys-17 thiol is far less accessible than Cys-14, reacting 45 times more slowly with iodoacetamide at pH 7.5. This is reminiscent of proteins such as thioredoxin and DsbA, which contain a similar C-X-X-C motif, except in those cases the more exposed thiol has the lowered pK a. In terms of MerP function, electrostatic attraction between Hg2+ and the buried Cys-17 thiolate may be important for triggering the structural change that MerP has been reported to undergo upon Hg2+binding.

Control of cysteine residue reactivity in heavy metal binding motifs may generally be important in influencing specific metal-binding properties of proteins containing them. dithiothreitol oxidized MerP (disulfide form) reduced MerP (dithiol form) 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine high performance liquid chromatography Bacterial resistance to mercuric ion is mediated by the polypeptides encoded by mer operons. Although the specific number of required polypeptides varies according to species, all operons appear to encode: one or more regulatory proteins (MerR, MerD); a periplasmic mercuric ion-binding protein (MerP); one or more integral membrane proteins thought to be required for mercuric ion transport (MerT, MerC); and a cytoplasmic mercuric ion reductase (MerA), which reduces intracellular Hg2+ ion to a volatile form, Hgo (reviewed in Refs. 1Summers A.O. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar and 2Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The mer operon-encoded periplasmic protein, MerP, from the transposon Tn21 has a molecular mass of 7500 Da after removal of a periplasmic signal sequence (1Summers A.O. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 3Barrineau P. Gilbert P. Jackson W.J. Jones C.S. Summers A.O. Wisdom S. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1984; 2: 601-619PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There are no tryptophan or histidine residues in the mature protein and only two cysteine residues, at positions 14 and 17. MerP has previously been shown to specifically bind Hg2+ in the presence of external thiols via these two cysteine residues (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sahlman L. Skärfstad E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recently published structure of MerP revealed that Cys-14 is surface-exposed and Cys-17 is buried inside the protein; once Hg2+ is bound to the thiols, they are both surface-exposed (6Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The structural change that accompanies Hg2+ binding has been proposed to be important for the interaction of Hg2+-loaded MerP with the inner membrane transport protein(s). Although it has been postulated that the function of MerP is to transfer Hg2+ to the meroperon-encoded integral membrane proteins for passage across the inner membrane (7Brown N.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 400-403Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar), current evidence suggests that MerP is dispensable for transport. Instead, it may function as a mercuric ion “sponge” to protect components of the periplasm from the toxic effects of this heavy metal (8Morby A.P. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Sahlman L. Wong W. Powlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29518-29526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MerP has been shown to exist in vitro in oxidized (disulfide) and reduced (dithiol) forms, but the redox state of the protein in the bacterial periplasm has never been reported. In order to bind Hg2+ via its thiols, MerP should be present in the reduced form. However, it is generally accepted that the periplasm is an oxidizing environment, with proteins such as DsbA and DsbB catalyzing disulfide bond formation in many bacterial periplasmic proteins (reviewed in Ref. 10Raina S. Missiakis D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this investigation, the redox statein vivo and the reactivity of the thiol groups of MerP have been investigated. All chemicals were of the highest purity available. 203HgCl2 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Stockholm, Sweden). The gene,merP from transposon Tn21, was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) (11Rosenburg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui S. Lin S. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) from the T7 promoter of pCA (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or using the plasmid pDU1003, which contains the complete Hg2+-inducible mer operon (12Ni'Bhriain N. Silver S. Foster T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 690-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the MerP variants C14A, C14S, C17A, and C17S was as described previously (5Sahlman L. Skärfstad E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C17D variant was constructed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The template was pCAmerP, and the mutagenic primers were 5′-GACTTGCGCCGCGGACCCGATCACAGTC-3′ and its complement, obtained from Biocorp Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the complete gene was performed at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center (Montreal, Canada), and confirmed the presence of the desired mutation. In all cases, cultures were grown in LB medium, plus the appropriate antibiotic, to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0 before induction. Induction from T7-based plasmids was achieved by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.5 mm, followed by further growth for 3 h at 37 °C. For induction from pDU1003, HgCl2 was added to an initial concentration of 20 μm, and a second aliquot (20 μm) was added after an additional 1 h of growth at 37 °C. Release of periplasmic proteins was achieved either using chloroform (13Ames G.F.-L. Prody C. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or lysozyme-EDTA (14Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In order to examine the redox state of MerP, iodoacetate was included to trap free thiols at all stages of the release procedure (14Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cultures were processed by precipitation of cellular proteins using trichloroacetic acid, followed by dissolution of the precipitated proteins in 6 m urea, containing iodoacetic acid, essentially as described (15Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MerP and all of the variants were purified in the absence of added cysteine, as described previously; chromatography on hydroxylapatite was usually included as a final step (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sahlman L. Skärfstad E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since all of these proteins were from recombinant sources never exposed to mercuric ion, residual bound Hg2+is not a concern in any experiments done with purified MerP or variants. When required, wild-type MerP was reduced either using dithiothreitol (DTT)1 or tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), under conditions described in the text. Modification of MerP by iodoacetate was accomplished at room temperature in the presence of sodium iodoacetate (0.1 m) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. The modification reactions were generally run in the dark for 10–30 min, and then placed on ice before analysis. In some cases, urea was included during the modification reaction. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The pK a values of cysteine thiol groups were monitored by the change in absorbance at 240 nm accompanying ionization (17Polgár L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 187-190Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Over the pH range tested, the oxidized form of MerP exhibited no absorbance change at 240 nm, indicating that the changes observed during pH titration were due to thiol group ionization. In preparation for these experiments, samples were reduced at room temperature for 1–1.5 h with a 10-fold excess of TCEP. Excess reductant was removed by gel filtration on Econo-Pac10DG columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.2 mm EDTA. Samples were then concentrated using Centricon-3 (Amicon) ultrafiltration. Absorbance measurements were made by diluting a 30–50-fold concentrated solution of protein into 0.1 m acetate-MES-Tris buffers of varying pH (18Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) containing 0.1 m KCl. Water was added to give final buffer and KCl concentrations of 0.05 m each, and protein concentrations in the range of 50–120 μm. Spectra for each sample, contained in a microcell, were scanned immediately in the region 220–400 nm. A separate base line was recorded for each buffer prior to scanning the protein solution. Thiol pK a values were estimated by non-linear least-squares fitting of plots of extinction (240 nm) versuspH using equations for 1 or 2 pK a values as supplied with Grafit 3 (Erithacus Software, Middlesex, United Kingdom). The redox equilibrium constant of MerP with glutathione, K ox, is shown in Equation 1. Kox=[MerPox][GSH]2/[MerPred][GSSG]Equation 1 GSH and GSSG are the oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione, respectively. K ox was estimated after incubation of MerP with various ratios of oxidized and reduced glutathione, essentially as described elsewhere (19Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Briefly, MerPox(90 μm) was incubated anaerobically for 24 h in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing EDTA (1 mm), KCl (0.1 m), GSH (10.4 mm), and various concentrations of GSSG. Oxidized and reduced forms of MerP were quantitated by HPLC (see below) after quenching to pH 2 with HCl. Data were fitted to Equation 2 (19Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 20Hawkins H.C. de Nardi M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fraction reduced=R[GSH]/(R[GSH]+Kmix[GSH]+Kox)Equation 2 where R = [GSH]/[GSSG], andK mix is the equilibrium constant between glutathione and the MerP-glutathione mixed disulfide. Only small quantities (≤10%) of mixed disulfide accumulated, and aK mix of 0.56 was estimated from a plot of [MerP-SSG]/MerPred versus [GSSG]/[GSH], as described in Ref. 21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar. The standard redox potential was calculated using the Nernst equation and a standard redox potential of +0.24 V (22Rost J. Rapoport S. Nature. 1964; 201: 185Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) for the glutathione redox pair. Different forms of MerP were quantitated using HPLC. The reduced, oxidized, and modified forms of the protein were separated on a Vydac C-18 Protein and Peptide column (catalog no. 218TP54) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Samples were acidified to a pH of approximately 2 with HCl, and injected onto the column, which was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water (68%):0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (32%). After 2 min a linear gradient was run over 20 min to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water (63%):0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (37%), and then the column was washed for 3 min with this solvent. Quantitation was achieved by calculating peak areas after detection at 215 nm. MerP was denatured with different concentrations of guanidine HCl in 0.1 mTris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5, for 18 h at room temperature. The protein concentration was approximately 15 μm;guanidine hydrochloride stock solution concentrations were determined by refractometry (23Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). For denaturation of MerPred, 2 mm DTT was added to reduce a stock solution of protein. Samples were transferred to a glove box, whereupon the protein was diluted in 0.1 m Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1–2 mm DTT and different concentrations of guanidine HCl. The samples were left for 18 h under anaerobic conditions. Samples of single cysteine variants of MerP were prepared similarly, but were not anaerobic. CD spectra were recorded at 23 °C using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. Each spectrum was an average of five accumulations, with step size 0.2 nm and bandwidth 1 nm. Data analysis was carried out by non-linear fitting, using Sigmaplot 4 (SPSS Scientific, Chicago, IL), of measured ellipticities at different guanidine HCl concentrations as described (24Santoro M.M. Bolen B.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 25Pace C.N. Shirley B.R. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach.

Fraction folded was calculated using the fitted parameters (25Pace C.N. Shirley B.R. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1990: 311-330Google Scholar). Reactions between iodoacetamide and MerP were carried out anaerobically at 25 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 m KCl. MerP or variants (75–160 μm), prepared as described for the pH titration experiments, were incubated with various concentrations of iodoacetamide. At different times, reactions were quenched by acidification with HCl to a pH of approximately 2, and analyzed immediately by HPLC as described above. Data were analyzed using non-linear least-squares fitting to a single exponential using Sigmaplot 4. In the case of wild-type MerPred, the pseudo-first order rate constants obtained at 3 and 30 mm iodoacetamide were divided by iodoacetamide concentration to estimate second order rate constants; data for the variants were obtained at several iodoacetamide concentrations. The pH-independent rate constant, k S-, for reactivity of a thiolate with iodoacetamide was estimated using Equation 3. kS−=kobs(1+10(pKa−pH))Equation 3 Quantitation of protein thiol groups was performed using Ellman's reagent (27Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorbance spectra were acquired using a Philips 8715 spectrophotometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a Finnigan SSQ 7000 single quadrupole mass spectrometer interfaced to a liquid chromatograph. Samples were introduced via a C-18 (5 μm) column (1 × 10 mm) at flow rate of 80 μl/min. Samples were loaded in 15% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and after washing the column for 3 min after injection, proteins were eluted with 70% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Data were analyzed using software supplied with the instrument. Native gels were run in the absence of SDS, as described previously (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Hamlett N.V. Landale E.C. Davis B.H. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since MerP is positively charged at pH 7.5, current flow was reversed, so the samples were run from the anode toward the cathode. The purity of purified MerP samples was checked using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Binding of Hg2+ to MerP (9 μm) was measured as described previously (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except the buffer used was 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Briefly, this binding assay is based on incubation of MerP with203HgCl2 solutions of varying concentration with a 4:1 ratio of cysteine:Hg to minimize nonspecific binding. Ultrafiltration in microconcentrators (Microsep) followed by liquid scintillation counting of 203Hg in the upper and lower chambers allowed the concentration of MerP-bound Hg2+ to be determined; corrections for nonspecific binding to the concentrator were determined for each HgCl2 concentration by identical ultrafiltration experiments carried out in the absence of MerP (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Data from two separate experiments were analyzed using Grafit with non-linear least-squares fitting to the following equation to estimate the capacity for binding Hg2+ (C), and the apparent dissociation constant (K d ). y=(Kd+t+C)−[(Kd+t+C)2−(4×t×C)]0.52Equation 4 y is the concentration of bound Hg2+, andt the total concentration of added Hg2+. This equation uses total added Hg2+, rather than the amount of free versus bound, since the presence of cysteine in the assay makes it difficult to estimate the concentration of free Hg2+. The in vivo oxidation state of MerP has never been reported, although only the reduced form can bind Hg2+via Cys-14 and Cys-17 (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Sahlman L. Skärfstad E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These cysteine residues can form a disulfide bond since reduced (MerPred) and oxidized (MerPox) forms have been obtained by isolation of the protein in the presence or absence of cysteine in purification buffers (4Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 1, purified MerPred (lane 1) and MerPox (lane 4) have different mobilities on a native gel; the reduced form migrates more slowly toward the cathode (bottom) in this gel system, possibly because of thiol group ionization at neutral pH (see below). However, in order to preserve and identify MerPred in periplasmic extracts, it is necessary to derivatize the free thiols prior to electrophoresis. Reaction with iodoacetate or iodoacetamide to trap reduced thiols and produce proteins with altered electrophoretic mobility has been used for a number of other thiol-containing redox proteins (see,e.g., Refs. 15Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and 21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Reaction of MerPred with iodoacetamide resulted in the conversion of the reduced form to a species that migrated at the position of the oxidized protein, as would be expected by blockage of an ionized thiol group(s) with the uncharged acetamide group (data not shown). On the other hand, reaction of reduced MerP with iodoacetate resulted in production of two slower migrating forms (Fig. 1, lane 3). Only the most slowly migrating form was observed over longer periods of reaction time (data not shown), or when MerP was reacted with iodoacetate in the presence of urea (Fig. 1, lane 2). Therefore, it appears that the two thiols on the protein are modified at quite different rates. The observed change in mobility is consistent with the expected addition of negative charge to MerP upon carboxymethylation. No change in the mobility of oxidized MerP was observed in the presence of iodoacetate, as would be expected if only the protein thiols were reacting (data not shown). The identities of the faster and slower migrating carboxymethylated forms were examined using electrospray mass spectrometry. A sample prepared in the presence of urea and showing only the upper band on a native gel exhibited a single major peak with a molecular mass of 7,590; this molecular mass corresponds to that of doubly carboxymethylated MerP (7,472 (observed) + (59 × 2)). In a sample containing mostly the faster migrating carboxymethylated form a species corresponding to singly carboxymethylated MerP (M r = 7531) was the major product, and the doubly carboxymethylated form was the minor product. In the next section, results are described using iodoacetate to trap and identify the reduced form of MerP from the periplasm of whole cells. The initial observations suggesting differing accessibility and pK a values of the two thiols will be addressed further in later sections. In these experiments, cultures were exposed to iodoacetate to trap the reduced form of MerP, which was then released from the periplasm in the presence of iodoacetate and analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Similar methods have been used for other periplasmic thiol-containing proteins (see,e.g., Refs. 14Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 30Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). When MerP was expressed alone from the T7 promoter, samples taken at various times throughout the induction period were all mostly in the oxidized form (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained when HgCl2 (20 μm) was added together with the inducer (data not shown), indicating that the presence of Hg2+ is not sufficient to maintain the reduced form. However, MerP was mainly in the reduced form in periplasmic extracts from Hg2+-resistant cells harboring the complete operon (Fig. 2 B, far left lane). In this strain, MerP remained reduced for up to 90 min after Hg2+ had been removed from the culture (Fig.2 B). Similar results for each strain were obtained using an alternative method (15Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in which cellular proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to prevent possible nonspecific redox reactions after cell disruption (results not shown). It should be noted that the levels of MerP expression in the strains used for the experiments shown in Fig. 2 are comparable, despite the differences in the plasmid constructs. From these experiments it can be concluded that MerP is in the reduced form in the periplasm of Hg2+resistant cells, and that one or more of the meroperon-encoded proteins may be involved in keeping its thiols reduced. The apparent stability of the reduced form of MerP in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm prompted us to examine the redox potential of the protein. Oxidized MerP was incubated anaerobically with various ratios of oxidized and reduced glutathione, and the ratios of oxidized and reduced MerP were estimated using reverse-phase HPLC after acid quench (Fig.3). The equilibrium constant (K ox) with glutathione was estimated to be 27 mm, which corresponds to a redox potential of −190 mV. This value is approximately midway between the redox potentials of oxidizing proteins such as DsbA (approximately −100 mV) (21Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and reductants such as thioredoxin (−270 mV) (32Moore E.C. Reichard P. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactivities of the two thiol groups in MerP should be governed by their respective pK a values, since the ionized thiol is more reactive than the protonated form (33Lindley H. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis results (see above) suggested that at least one of the two thiol groups is ionized at neutral pH. The mobilities of single cysteine variants of MerP were thus examined using the native gel electrophoresis system, both before and after reaction with iodoacetate (Fig.4) or iodoacetamide (data not shown). Since mass spectrometry indicated modification of some variants by cysteine, or dimerization (data not shown), all samples were reduced using DTT or TCEP prior to electrophoresis or modification. The majority of the reduced C14S sample ran at the position of the reduced wild-type sample (Fig. 4, lane 1), while reduced C17S mostly ran at the position of the oxidized native MerP (Fig. 4,lane 2). Thus, it appears that it is Cys-17 which is ionized at the pH of the gel (gel buffer pH = 7.0). Consistent with this, C17D, unlike C17S, migrates at the position of reduced MerP (Fig. 4, lane 3). The electrophoretic mobilities of unmodified proteins can be compared with the mobilities of carboxymethylated samples (Fig. 4,lanes 4–6). The carboxymethylated and non-carboxymethylated forms of C14S have the same mobilities (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 4), as would be expected if Cys-17 is already ionized. Carboxymethylation of Cys-14 in C17S results in a complete shift to the position of reduced MerP (Fig.4, lane 5), as would be expected for the conversion of an unionized thiol to the negatively charged carboxymethylated derivative. Finally, carboxymethylated C17D migrates at the same position as dicarboxymethylated MerPred (Fig.4, lane 6). These observations add support for the conclusion that Cys-17 is ionized at neutral pH, whereas Cys-14 is not. Since MerP has only two thiol groups, estimation of the pK a values is possible by pH titration and monitoring the appearance of the thiolate forms at 240 nm (ε ≈ 4,000 m−1 cm−1) (17Polgár L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 187-190Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Controls using oxidized MerP and variants in which each thiol had been replaced by alanine or serine allowed specific contributions of each thiol group to the absorbance changes to be assessed. Representative results of these titrations are shown in Fig. 5, and pK a values are summarized in TableI. The native reduced protein showed two ionizations with pK a values of 5.5 and 9.16 (Fig.5 A); oxidized MerP showed no appreciable change in absorbance over this pH range, indicating that ionization of the single tyrosine residue does not contribute to the observed absorbance changes (data not shown). The C14A and C14S variants showed single absorbance changes titrating with pK a values of 6.08 and 5.8, respectively, while the C17A and C17S variants also revealed single thiol ionizations with pK a values of 7.7 and 7.4, respectively (Table I and Fig. 5 B). Thus, it appears that the thiol with a pK a of 5.5 in native MerP is Cys-17, while that with a pK a of 9.2 is Cys-14, although the pK a of this thiol appears to be considerably perturbed in the C17A and C17S variants.Table ISummary of pK a and denaturation data for MerP and variantsProtein1-aAll denaturation samples except MerPoxcontained approximately 1 mm DTT.pK am-value[GdmHCl]1/2ΔΔG u50% 1-bΔΔG u50% = 0.5(m variant +m Pred)([GdmHCl]1/2,MerPred− [GdmHCl]1/2,variant).kcal/mol · mGdmHClmkcal/molMerPred9."

In this study we pursue the identification of the element and the trans-acting factors responsible. Gel shift analyses show that bFGF increases protein binding to a sequence located at −564 to −558 base pairs (bp), which possesses homology to both AP1 and cAMP-response consensus elements yet displays a unique affinity for heterodimer binding. Site-directed mutation of the −564- to −558-bp sequence results in an increase in promoter activity and abrogates the effect of bFGF. Western blot analysis shows that bFGF induces a sustained increase in the steady-state levels of Fra 1, and co-transfection of a Fra 1 expression vector with an elastin promoter reporter construct results in an inhibition of elastin promoter activity. Overall the results suggest that bFGF represses elastin gene transcription by increasing the amount of the Fra 1 that subsequently binds to the −564- to −558-bp as a heterodimer with c-Jun to form an inhibitory complex. We propose that the identified bFGF response element can serve to down-regulate elastin transcription in elastogenic cells and, conversely, can serve to up-regulate elastogenesis in cells where endogenous bFGF signaling is attenuated or altered.

Our laboratory has focused on the transcriptional regulation of the elastin gene in avian lung embryogenesis (1James M.F. Rich C.B. Trinkhaus-Randall V. Rosenbloom J. Foster J.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and on a cell model mimicking elastase injury to mammalian lungs (4Foster J.A. Rich C.B. Miller M.F. J. Biol.

This latter model, consisting of primary cultures of rat pulmonary fibroblasts, showed that brief exposure to elastase results in the release of bFGF1 bound within the extracellular matrix. The model further demonstrated that exogenous bFGF down-regulates elastin transcription in these cell cultures (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of bFGF blocking antibody to cell medium resulted in increased elastin promoter activity suggesting that this matrix-sequestered growth factor is an endogenous inhibitor of elastin transcription. This latter possibility is supported by the studies of Weinstein et al. (14Weinstein M. Xu X. Ohyama K. Deng C. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that implicated the FGFR-3 and FGFR-4 receptors in regulating elastin deposition in postnatal mouse lung. A number of studies have focused on the ability of bFGF to up-regulate gene transcription via cis-acting elements that bind various members of the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors including AP1, CRE, and ETS cognates (15Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ability of bFGF to down-regulate transcription has not been that well documented. The overall goal of the present study was to determine the specific cis-acting element and trans-acting factor(s) responsible for bFGF repression of elastin gene transcription. We find that bFGF down-regulates elastin transcription by promoting increased protein binding to an AP1/CRE-like sequence located at −564 to −558 bp of the elastin promoter. We further present evidence that the increased binding is due to the formation of a Fra 1/c-Jun heterodimer that forms because of sustained induction of Fra 1 by bFGF. Furthermore, our results suggest that the bFGF element of the elastin promoter regulates elastin transcription via the availability and integrity of the bFGF signaling pathway. Human recombinant bFGF (18 kDa) was obtained from Scios-Nova (Mountain View, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-bovine bFGF, type I IgG (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), was used to neutralize bFGF activity. Fra 1 (SC-183X), c-Jun (SC-45X), SP1 (SC-59X), and AP2 (SC-184X) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (SC-2004) and anti-mouse IgG (SC-2005) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Duplex oligomers were prepared as described previously (21Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpestra A. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol.

Neonatal rat pulmonary fibroblast cells were isolated from lungs of 3-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and seeded in first passage as described previously (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P.

For preparation of nuclear extract and isolation of RNA, cells plated at 2 × 104cells/cm2 in 75-cm2 flasks were maintained for 2 weeks. Prior to the addition of bFGF (10 ng/ml) the medium was changed to 0.5% serum for 24 h and then incubated with bFGF for various times as indicated. For transfection experiments, cells were seeded 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in 100-mm plates and grown overnight in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 5% FBS, and the medium was changed and the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate added. After 20–22 h, the cells were glycerol-shocked and the medium changed to 0.5% FBS as described previously (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 24 h in 0.5% FBS, bFGF (10 ng/ml) was added for an additional 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously by Wolfe et al. (22Wolfe L.B. Rich C.B. Goud H.D. Terpstra A.J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Sonenshein G.E. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12418-12426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoretic transfer of the gel, hybridization with rat tropoelastin cDNA was performed as described previously (23Foster J.A. Rich C.B. Horrigan S. Miller M. Dadd C. Baule B. Keene D.R. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 667-673PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei from untreated and bFGF-treated cell cultures were isolated by the procedures previously reported (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Total protein for each sample was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The extracts were stored at −80 °C in extraction buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.35m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1.0 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 100 μm sodium fluoride. Two large restriction fragments spanning the entire −900- to −472-bp region of the elastin promoter were generated. The −900 to +2 elastin promoter construct (22Wolfe L.B. Rich C.B. Goud H.D. Terpstra A.J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Sonenshein G.E. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12418-12426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was restricted with PpuMI, the resultant fragments labeled with Klenow and then restricted with SalI to generate the −900- to −721-bp fragment. Restricting the Klenow-labeled PpuMI fragment with ApaI generated a −721- to −472-bp fragment. Restriction fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis and isolated from the agarose with the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The duplex oligomers described above were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and separated from free [32P]ATP by a Sephadex G-50 column procedure (24Sambrook J. Fritsche E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, Cold Springs Habor, NY1989: 1.42-1.43Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled DNA fragments (0.1–2.5 ng, 40–200 fmol, 20,000–100,000 cpm), nuclear extract (10 μg of protein), or recombinant c-Jun (as specified) and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) were brought to a volume of 17.5 μl with 3.5 μl of 5× binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton, and 2.5% glycerol), 3.5 μl of extraction buffer (including the volume of nuclear extract), and the appropriate volume of H2O. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 90 mm Tris borate, 2.0 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.3). Electrophoresis and resultant autoradiography was performed as described previously (21Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpestra A. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6555-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, 20–100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled, competitor DNA was preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at 25 °C before the addition of32P-labeled DNA. For supershift experiments, 2 μl of antibody was incubated with the 10 μg of nuclear extract overnight at 4 °C prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Reactions were allowed to incubate an additional 30 min at 25 °C before running the gel. To perform this analysis, a gel shift was run as described above, and complex II was cut from the gel and cross-linked with UV (254 nm) in the gel slice for 30 min. The gel slice was then incubated in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 30 min and placed into the sample well of a 10% SDS gel that had been prepared using a 3.0-mm comb and spacers. The samples were sealed with 1% agarose, and the cross-linked complexes were resolved by electrophoresis. The complexes were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extracts (40 μg) were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose as we have described (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After transfer the nitrocellulose membrane was cut such that a duplicate set of samples were stained with Amido Black for detection of protein loading. The other was probed with Fra 1 (1:1000), c-Jun (1:1000), or PCNA (2.5:1000) antibody. The secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) for the Fra 1 and c-Jun antibodies and anti-mouse IgG-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for PCNA. Immunodetection of proteins was visualized by the ECL method according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel shift and Western blot analyses were coupled to identify c-Jun as a component of the heterodimer binding to the elastin sequence. Gel shift analyses were performed using the AP1 consensus oligomer incubated with recombinant c-Jun and the elastin promoter −573- to −546-oligomer incubated with nuclear extract isolated from bFGF-treated fibroblasts. The gel was exposed to x-ray film at room temperature overnight to establish the position of complex formation. By using the film as a guide, the complexes formed between the AP1 consensus oligomer and c-Jun (see Fig. 4 B) and complex II formed between the elastin oligomer and the nuclear extract (see Fig. 2) were cut out of the gel and incubated for 30 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. As a control the same area as complex II was cut out of gel shift reaction lane that contained all the reaction components except DNA. The equivalent of four excised gel slices for each complex was loaded into the well of a 3-mm preparative 10% SDS gel and electrophoresed as usual. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and treated as described above.Figure 2Competition gel shift analyses of wild type and mutated elastin oligonucleotides. A competition gel shift using 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and 10 μg of nuclear proteins isolated from bFGF-treated and untreated cultures and32P-labeled wild type elastin promoter −573- to −546-bp probe is shown.

Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were assessed by co-transfection with 5 μg of pCMV β-galactosidase (CLONTECH). Three to five separate sets of pulmonary fibroblasts and two different preparations of plasmid DNAs were used for these analyses. Determinations of CAT and β-galactosidase activities were performed as described previously (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses were performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager or Densitometer. Elastin promoter reporter CAT constructs used include the −900 to +2 bp (22Wolfe L.B. Rich C.B. Goud H.D. Terpstra A.J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Sonenshein G.E. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12418-12426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a mutated form that involves changes of the 5 bp between −564 to −558 bp. This mutation was engineered by first using PCR to amplify the −750- to −527-bp region with an antisense primer (5′ CCAGACTCCCCAACACCCCCAGGTCTGGCTTTTGCGAGCTTCTGCCC 3′) containing the mutation (underlined) and a unique HinfI restriction site downstream of the mutated site and a sense primer (5′ GGCCCCTGCAGAATGCAGCCCT 3′) representing a region of the elastin promoter upstream of a unique PpuMI restriction site located at −719 bp. The PCR-amplified fragment was purified with a Wizard PCR preps DNA purification system (Promega). Once isolated, the PCR fragment was double-digested with PpuMI and HinfI and purified by gel electrophoresis. Separately an aliquot of −900 to +2 construct was double-digested with HindIII andSalI to release the −900- to +2-bp elastin sequence from the CAT reporter vector. This HindIII and SalI restriction fragment was further digested with HinfI andSfiI and purified by gel electrophoresis. ThePpuMI and HinfI PCR fragment and theHinfI and SfiI wild type fragment were ligated together. This piece was then ligated into −900- to +2-construct that had been double-digested with PpuMI and SfiI. Competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transformed, subclones isolated, and plasmid mini-preps were performed. The sequence of the mutated plasmid was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the DNA-protein core facility at Boston University Medical Center. Expression vectors for Fra 1 and 2 were generously supplied by Dr. P. R. Dobner (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Woscester). Dr. M. Karin (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego) generously supplied the c-Jun expression vector. The elastin promoter deletion construct −900- to +2-bp construct (30 μg) was co-transfected with the expression vectors (0–20 μg) and 5 μg of pRSV β-galactosidase (a gift of Dr. N. Rosenthal, Harvard University). The amount of DNA in each reaction was adjusted to 55 μg with Bluescript vector DNA (Stratagene). Deletion analysis of the elastin gene promoter showed that the major bFGF response element resides between −900 to −500 bp (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to identify the specific sequence conveying bFGF responsiveness, two large restriction fragments were generated that span the entire −900- to −500-bp region, and these were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and bFGF-treated pulmonary fibroblasts. Only the fragment comprising −721 to −472 bp exhibited a change in complex formation upon bFGF treatment, and the change seen is an increase in protein binding (Fig.1). Since the −721- to −472-bp region contains several putative AP2 and an AP1 elements (25Kahari V.-M. Fazio M.J. Chen Y.Q. Bashir M.M. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9485-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gel shift analyses were performed with these consensus sequences (Fig. 1). The results show that only the AP1 oligomer displays differential complex formation upon bFGF treatment, and this difference involves an increase in complex formation similar to that observed with the elastin −721- to −472-bp fragment. To examine the response of the actual AP1-like sequence within the elastin promoter to bFGF treatment, gel shift analyses were performed with an oligomer including this sequence (−573 to −546 bp). Complex formation induced by bFGF treatment was then competed with the unlabeled, wild type oligomer (wt) and the unlabeled, mutated form of this sequence (mut.) (Fig.2). The mutation introduced was designed to cause total disruption of protein binding as opposed to defining the role of specific bases. Consequently, five out of the seven bases that form the core of the AP1-like binding site as defined by Ryseck and Bravo (26Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar) were changed (see Fig. 2 legend). The results demonstrate that the wt elastin sequence exhibits an increase in complex formation with bFGF treatment, and this increase is competed by the wt oligomer and only partially by the mut. oligomer. The major band remaining after competition with the mut. oligomer is a component of Complex II referred to as Complex IIb. It is interesting to point out that the pattern of complex formation displayed by the −573- to −546-bp elastin oligomer differs from that of the consensus AP1 oligomer in two respects. First, the elastin promoter sequence exhibits greater binding to a faster migrating complex (referred to as Complex II in Fig. 2), and second, the bFGF-induced increase in protein binding involves this latter complex rather than a slower migrating complex exhibited by the AP1 oligomer (see Fig. 1). This latter observation suggests that the elastin promoter AP1-like sequence possesses a protein affinity that differs from classical AP1 sites. Before proceeding to any further characterization of DNA-protein interactions we tested the functionality of the targeted elastin promoter sequence within the environment of the pulmonary fibroblast cells. A mutation was introduced into the −564- to −558-bp sequence of −900- to +2-bp elastin reporter construct (see “Materials and Methods”). This mutation consisted of the same 5-bp change used in the mut. elastin oligomer described above (Fig. 2). Transient transfections of rat pulmonary fibroblasts were performed using the wild type and the mutated elastin promoter constructs (Fig.3). The results show that the activity driven by the mut. elastin promoter construct is not down-regulated by bFGF suggesting that the targeted sequence is the major bFGF response element within the elastin promoter. Further evidence for the functional role of the −564- to −558-bp sequence derives from the fact that the mutated elastin promoter drives a higher level of reporter activity than the wild type sequence, suggesting that this sequence serves to repress elastin gene transcription. We have previously suggested that endogenous bFGF acts as a repressor of elastin gene transcription (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based on the observation that the addition of bFGF blocking antibody to pulmonary fibroblasts results in an up-regulation of elastin mRNA levels. The effect of the mutation introduced into the elastin gene promoter on reporter activity parallels the effect of bFGF blocking antibody on mRNA thereby linking bFGF down-regulation to a specific site in the elastin promoter. Furthermore, the increase exhibited by the mutated elastin gene promoter is comparable to the activity driven by the −500- to +2-bp elastin reporter construct in these same cells (10Rich C.B. Nugent M.A. Stone P. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23043-23048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggesting that the −564- to −558-bp sequence is the major repressor sequence in the −900- to −500-bp region of the elastin gene. Since the results obtained by transient transfections demonstrate that the −564- to −558-bp sequence confers bFGF responsiveness, we directed our attention to identifying the proteins binding to this element. This sequence was previously categorized as a putative AP1 site (25Kahari V.-M. Fazio M.J. Chen Y.Q. Bashir M.M. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9485-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kahari V.-M. Chen Y.Q. Bashir M.M. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26134-2614128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent computer homology search of this sequence reveals that it also exhibits homology to a consensus CRE. As a first step in identifying the protein(s) binding to the elastin sequence, we performed a competition gel shift analysis using the radiolabeled elastin promoter oligomer spanning −573 to −546 bp incubated with nuclear extract isolated from bFGF-treated fibroblasts. Complex formation was competed with the unlabeled elastin promoter oligomer and AP1 and CRE consensus oligomers (Fig. 4 A). The results show that neither consensus oligomer competes for specific protein binding even at a 100-fold excess. To explore further the differences between the protein binding affinity of the elastin promoter sequence and the CRE and AP1 consensus sequences, gel shift analysis was performed using radiolabeled oligomers that were incubated with recombinant c-Jun. The rationale for this experiment was predicated on the report of Kovary and Bravo (28Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) who have shown that c-Jun can bind to AP1 and CRE sequences as a homodimer, although the affinity differs between the sequences. Fig. 4 B provides a gel shift analysis showing that the CRE and AP1 oligomers bind c-Jun as a homodimer, whereas the elastin promoter oligomer does not exhibit any binding, even after a long exposure of the film. The possibility that the elastin promoter site might dictate heterodimer binding was explored. Gel shift analyses were performed where the radiolabeled elastin promoter oligomer was incubated with a fixed, sub-saturating amount of fibroblast nuclear extract isolated from bFGF-treated cultures (0.1 μg) and increasing amounts of c-Jun recombinant protein (Fig. 5 A). As a control to test whether complex formation with c-Jun is a result of specific protein-DNA interaction rather than a nonspecific result of protein concentration (21Jensen D.E. Rich C.B. Terpestra A. Farmer S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6555-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), samples containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 μg) and the same amounts of recombinant c-Jun protein were included (Fig. 5 B). The results show that addition of increasing amounts of recombinant c-Jun to the nuclear extract results in a dose-dependent formation of complexes, one of which possesses a similar mobility to that exhibited by the bFGF-sensitive complex II.

We then examined their effects on ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release activities of the sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from skeletal and cardiac muscle. Peptides 1–2s, 1–2c, and 1 enhanced ryanodine binding to cardiac RyR and induced a rapid Ca2+ release from cardiac SR in a dose-dependent manner. The order of the potency for the activation of the Ca2+ release channel was 1–2c > 1 > 1–2s. Interestingly, these peptides produced significant activation of the cardiac RyR at near zero or subactivating [Ca2+], indicating that the peptides enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel. Peptides 1–2c, 1–2s, and 1 had virtually no effect on skeletal RyR, although occasional and variable extents of activation were observed in ryanodine binding assays performed at 36 °C. Peptide 3 affected neither cardiac nor skeletal RyR.

Thus, there must be an intricate communication network within the receptor molecule to send the signal from various cytoplasmic effector/regulator binding domains to the Ca2+ release channel domain. However, only very limited information is available regarding the actual mechanism for channel regulation. Several pieces of information suggest the hypothesis that the near NH2-terminal region of the RyR may be involved in its channel regulation. First, this is one of the two regions where most mutations have been found in patients with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease (19Quane K.A. Healy J.M.S. Keating K.E. Manning B.M.

Chemical modification of the NH2-terminal region of the RyR affected intramolecular cross-linking under conditions that would produce oxidation-induced activation of the Ca2+ channel (33Aghdasi B.

The goal of the present study is to test the above hypothesis. For this purpose, we synthesized peptides corresponding to two selected domains of the near NH2-terminal region, designated as domain 1–2 and 3 (see Table I). We then investigated the effects of these synthetic peptides on ryanodine binding and SR Ca2+ release using SR vesicles isolated from both skeletal and cardiac muscles. The peptides corresponding to domain 1–2 activated the RyR2 and induced a rapid Ca2+ release from cardiac SR. These peptides produced no activation of the RyR1 as long as the temperature during the assay does not exceed a certain level. The other peptide corresponding to domain 3 affected neither RyR2 nor RyR1. As shown in the [Ca2+] dependence of activation, the peptides corresponding to domain 1–2 activate the RyR2 in zero or near zero [Ca2+]. Furthermore, they serve as an amplifier of Ca2+-dependent activation of the RyR2. The present results suggest that the domain corresponding to these peptides, namely domain 1–2, is involved in the mechanism of activating the SR Ca2+ channel by mediation of intramolecular domain-domain interaction.Table ISubdomains of RyR selected and the amino acid sequence of the synthetic peptides corresponding to these domainsSequencePeptide/domain nameDomainDTAPKRDVEGMGPPEIKYGESLCFVQHV3sAsp324–Val351LDKHGRNHKVLDVLCSLCVCNGVAVRSNQDLITENLLPG1–2sLeu590–Gly628LDKHGRNHKVLDVLCSLCVCHGVAVRSNQHLICDNLLPG1–2cLeu601–Gly639LDKHGRNHKVLDVLCSLCVC1s: Leu590–Cys609; c: Leu601–Cys620s, skeletal muscle-type sequence (rabbit RyR1, Ref. 37MacLennan D.H.

The use of synthetic peptides corresponding to key domains of the RyR to examine their effects on RyR function would be a useful approach to characterize putative functions of these domains. Since several pieces of evidence suggest that the NH2-terminal region of the RyR may serve as an important regulatory domain of channel function (see Introduction), we selected some subdomains from this region of the RyR1 and RyR2 as illustrated in Table I. Domain 1–2s and its cardiac counterpart, domain 1–2c, consist of two subdomains: domain 1, which is composed of an identical sequence for both RyR1 and RyR2; and domain 2, where there is some difference between both isoforms (cf. underlined residues). The synthesized peptides will be identified by names identical to their corresponding in situ domains just defined. Dog ventricular cardiac muscle was homogenized in four volumes of 0.3 m sucrose, 40 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, in a Warning blender at high speed. During the homogenization the pH was adjusted to 6.8. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant filtered through Whatman filter paper. The filtrate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was discarded and supernatant filtered through Whatman filter paper. The filtrate was centrifuged at 143,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose, 0.15m potassium gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.8 μg/ml antipain, 2.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), 20 mm MES, pH 6.8 (PI buffer), with a glass/glass homogenizer, and centrifuged again at 143,000 × g for 45 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in PI buffer to a final concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −78 °C. Triad-enriched microsomal fractions were prepared from the rabbit back paraspinous and hind leg skeletal muscle by a method of differential centrifugation as described previously (39Ikemoto N. Kim D.H. Antoniu B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Microsomes from the final centrifugation were homogenized in PI buffer to a final concentration of 20–30 mg/ml, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −78 °C. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431 A synthesizer employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) as the α-amino protecting group. The peptides were cleaved and deprotected with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Dog cardiac (1.5 mg/ml) or rabbit skeletal (0.5 mg/ml) microsomes were incubated in 0.1 ml of a reaction solution containing 10 nm (dog cardiac) or 8 nm (rabbit skeletal) [3H]ryanodine (68.4 Ci/ml, NEN Life Science Products), 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and various amounts of CaCl2 to create various levels of [Ca2+], 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 36 °C, 16 h at 22 °C, or 72 h at 4 °C in the presence of various concentrations of peptides and/or modulators. Samples were filtered onto glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B) and washed twice with 5 ml of distilled water. Filters were then placed in scintillation vials containing 10 ml of the scintillation mixture Ecoscint A and counted in a Beckman LS 3801 counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the binding in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μmnon-radioactive ryanodine. Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and each datum point was obtained by averaging the duplicates (40El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Dog cardiac microsomes (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing 0.15 m potassium gluconate, 1 mmMgATP, an ATP-regenerating system, 20 mm MES, pH 6.8 (Solution A) for 5 min to load the SR moiety with Ca2+. Then one volume of Solution A was mixed with one volume of Solution B containing 0.15 m potassium gluconate, 20 mmMES, pH 6.8, and various concentrations of peptides. The Ca2+ concentration in both solutions was ∼0.25 μm. The time course of SR Ca2+ release was monitored in a stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM-4) using 2.5 μm fluo-3 as a Ca2+ indicator as described previously (41El-Hayek R. Yano M. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15634-15638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fifteen to 20 traces (each representing 1,000 data points) of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each experiment. Statistical analysis for the comparison of mean values was performed using an unpaired Student's t test.p ≤ 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. We examined two groups of synthetic peptides corresponding to the two domains of the RyR1, domain 1–2 and domain 3 (cf. TableI) for their effects on ryanodine binding to the RyR1 and RyR2. Fig. 1 depicts the results of the ryanodine binding assay carried out at 36 °C. As seen in Fig. 1, peptide 1–2s produced a significant enhancement of ryanodine binding to the RyR2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In many experiments, peptide 1–2s produced no appreciable enhancement of ryanodine binding to the RyR1 in the same concentration range. In some other experiments carried out at 36 °C, however, peptide 1–2s produced various extents of enhancement of ryanodine binding in RyR1. Fig. 2 A is a histogram illustrating the relationship between the frequency of occurrence and the extent of enhancement of ryanodine binding to the RyR2 and RyR1 produced by the maximally activating concentration of peptide 1–2s (200 μm) at 36 °C. As shown, a significant amount of enhancement (151–210%) occurred in all experiments in case of the RyR2. In case of the RyR1, however, the level of enhancement varied over a wide range, from no effect to levels comparable to the RyR2. We carried out the same type of ryanodine binding assay at 22 °C (the temperature at which all stopped-flow experiments described below were carried out), and the effects on the RyR2 and the RyR1 were compared. As shown, peptide 1–2s produced a significant and consistent activation of the RyR2 (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the peptide produced no appreciable effect on the RyR1 in all experiments. Furthermore, peptide 1–2s produced significant activation of ryanodine binding to RyR2, even in ryanodine binding experiments performed at 4 °C assay (data not shown). These results indicate that the domain peptide 1–2s activates the RyR in a RyR2-specific manner. However, RyR1 also becomes responsive to peptide activation above a transitional temperature, which appears to be in the vicinity of 36 °C. Another domain peptide, peptide 3s, did not produce any appreciable effect on either the RyR1 or the RyR2, as determined by the ryanodine binding assay at 36 °C (Fig.3), providing a negative control for the above experiments.Figure 2Effects of peptide 1–2s on [3H]ryanodine binding to the RyR2 and the RyR1 at two assay temperatures: A, 36 °C; B, 22 °C. Histograms show the frequency of occurrences of different extents of enhancement of ryanodine binding to the RyR2 and the RyR1 induced by 200 μm peptide 1–2s. The assay solutions consisted of 0.3 m KCl, 10 μmCaCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, with 10 nm or 8 nm [3H]ryanodine for dog cardiac muscle microsomes and rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Lack of effect of peptide 3s on [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac SR vesicles (RyR2) and skeletal triads (RyR1).

Table I). We compared the effects of both isoforms of peptide 1–2 on ryanodine binding to the RyR2 at 36 °C and at different Ca2+ concentrations in the assay solution. The synthetic peptide corresponding to the domain 1–2c, namely peptide 1–2c, enhanced ryanodine binding to the RyR2 (Fig.4). The concentration dependence of activation was indistinguishable between peptides 1–2s and 1–2c at 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4) This suggests that the activating function of these peptides may be localized within their subdomain 1 where both peptides have a common amino acid sequence. As shown in Fig. 4, peptide 1 corresponding to subdomain 1 in fact activated RyR2 with the same concentration dependence of activation as the longer peptides 1–2s and 1–2c. We have carried out the same type of experiment at lower concentrations of Ca2+; at 0.2 μm and nominal zero Ca2+. Table II depicts the AC50 values for each peptide at three different [Ca2+] values including 10 μm described above. Interestingly, at lower Ca2+ concentrations, some differences in the potency of activation among these domain peptides became visible, i.e. the extent of activation by peptide 1–2s is much smaller than the extents of activation by peptide 1–2c and peptide 1. This indicates that, at this submaximally activating concentration of Ca2+, the apparent affinity of peptide 1–2s to the RyR2 is somewhat lower than peptides 1–2c and peptide 1. It also appears that peptide 1–2c produces a slightly larger magnitude of activation than peptide 1 at high peptide concentrations (data not shown). Thus, the order of the strength of activation of these peptides at 0.2 μm and nominal zero Ca2+ is 1–2c ≥ 1 > 1–2s.Table IIThe concentrations for half-maximal activation (AC 50 ) of ryanodine binding to the RyR2 by three isoforms of domain peptide 1–2[Ca2+]AC501–2s1–2c1μm μm1023.0 ± 7.225.3 ± 7.822.7 ± 7.00.2251.7 ± 57*134.0 ± 47.6176.9 ± 28.9∼0179.3 ± 30**117.8 ± 26.5102.9 ± 19.5Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three or more experiments carried out in duplicate. *, p ≤ 0.05 (1–2cversus 1–2s). **, p ≤ 0.05 (1–2sversus 1).

It should be noted that, at nominal zero Ca2+, all of these three peptides produced a small but significant increase in the ryanodine binding to the RyR2. This suggests that there is a unique feature of Ca2+-independent activation, which is not usually seen with many known activating reagents. As seen from the comparison of the AC50 values at three different [Ca2+] values (Table II), the AC50 values are significantly larger for all peptides at lower [Ca2+] values. These results indicate that the domain peptides bind preferentially to the calcium-bound RyR2, although the presence of Ca2+ is not an essential requirement for the activation by these peptides. Fig. 5 depicts the time courses of Ca2+ release from cardiac SR induced by various concentrations of peptides 1–2s, 1–2c, and 1. In these experiments, a solution containing cardiac microsomes that had been loaded with calcium by MgATP-dependent Ca2+ transport (Solution A) was mixed with a solution containing various concentrations of peptides (Solution B). Then, the time course of the changes in the Ca2+ concentration was monitored using fluo-3 at a starting [Ca2+] of 0.25 μm. As seen, these peptides produced a rapid Ca2+ release in a dose-dependent manner mirroring the effect of these peptides on ryanodine binding experiments with the RyR2. In Fig.6, the initial rates of Ca2+release are plotted as a function of the concentration of these three peptides added. The order of the strength of inducing Ca2+release estimated from this plot is 1–2c > 1 > 1–2s, consistent with ryanodine binding assays carried out at equivalent [Ca2+].Figure 6The initial rate of SR Ca2+release induced by various concentrations of peptides 1–2s, 1–2c, and 1. The Ca2+ release traces shown in Fig. 5 were fitted by a model {y = y 0 +A 1(1 −e −k1t ) −A 2(1 −e −k2t )}:A 1 , the amount of Ca2+release; k 1, the rate constant of Ca2+ release; A 2, the amount of Ca2+ uptake; k 2 , the rate constant of Ca2+ uptake. The initial rate of Ca2+ release {(dy/dt) t→0} was calculated as the product of A 1 andk 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An interesting feature revealed in these Ca2+ release experiments is the biphasic change in the Ca2+ signal. As seen in Fig. 5, the rapid Ca2+ release produced by higher concentrations of peptide 1–2c (≥40 μm) is followed by a decrease of the fluo-3 signal. Both the magnitude and the rate of this descending phase increased with the increase in peptide concentration. As seen from the comparison among the three peptides at the equivalent concentration (e.g. see 160 μm), the order of the ability of producing the descending phase is 1–2c > 1 > 1–2s. Interestingly, this is the same as the order of the ability of inducing Ca2+ release (see above). The descending phase presumably represents re-uptake of the released Ca2+ via the SR Ca2+ pump. Thus, it appears that a faster and larger Ca2+ release results in a faster and larger uptake of the released Ca2+ in a coordinated manner. As seen in the release/uptake curve produced by 160 μm peptide 1–2c (Fig. 5), the Ca2+ level often became even lower than the starting level. This indicates that the Ca2+ pumping rate became considerably larger than the steady-state pumping rate (the rate prior to the induction of Ca2+ release) after peptide-induced Ca2+release. None of these peptides induced Ca2+ release from skeletal muscle SR even at high concentrations, in agreement with the ryanodine binding data obtained at the equivalent temperature, 22 °C. Furthermore, peptide 3s, which had no effect on ryanodine binding to the RyR1 or the RyR2, did not produce any Ca2+ release from either cardiac or skeletal muscle SR. Fig. 7 shows the Ca2+ dependence of ryanodine binding to the RyR2 in the absence or presence of 100 μm peptide 1. As seen, peptide 1 produces significant enhancement of ryanodine binding to RyR2 not only in the activating [Ca2+] range, but also in the zero to subactivating [Ca2+] range. The extent of activation by the peptide is about 200% of control at maximally activating [Ca2+], while it increases considerably at submaximally activating [Ca2+]. This indicates that these domain peptides not only serve as an amplifier of the Ca2+-dependent activation of the RyR2, but also as a Ca2+-independent activator. As shown in Fig. 8, at zero [Ca2+] peptide 1 produced a significant enhancement of ryanodine binding to the RyR2 (p < 0.001), but had no effect on the RyR1. Conversely, calmodulin, which is known to activate the RyR1 at a very low [Ca2+] (15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), produced a significant activation of the RyR1 (p = 0.001), but had no effect on the RyR2. Thus, it appears that these domain peptides produce a calmodulin-like function for the RyR2. One of the important unsolved questions in the E-C coupling is how various stimuli received in the cytoplasmic domains of the RyR are transmitted to the trans-membrane Ca2+ channel domain to regulate the channel functions. Several pieces of indirect evidence in the literature suggest the hypothesis that the NH2-terminal ∼700-amino acid region of the RyR may represent one of the putative regulatory domains of channel function. This is the region with frequent occurrence of human malignant hyperthermia mutations and in the porcine animal model of this disease (19Quane K.A. Healy J.M.S. Keating K.E. Manning B.M. Couch F.J.

Thiol alkylation of the 170 kDa NH2-terminal region affected intramolecular S-S formation, suggesting that this region may be involved in intramolecular domain-domain interactions (33Aghdasi B.

Furthermore, the NH2-terminal region of the RyR is highly homologous to the corresponding region of the IP3 receptor, which contains the IP3 binding site and which plays an important role in the regulation of the IP3 receptor channel function (35Furuichi T.

We initiated this study to identify the putative regulatory domain(s) located in the NH2-terminal region of the RyR and to characterize its (their) function utilizing synthetic peptides as probes. This strategy is based upon the following principle. If any subdomain of this region interacts with the target domain of functional importance, the extrinsically added peptide corresponding to that NH2 domain would bind to its target domain. Then, this peptide-to-target domain interaction would produce some effects on the RyR function that are similar to those obtained by the in vivo NH2 domain-to-target domain interaction. This would not only permit us to identify the putative regulatory domain, but would also allow us to characterize its mode of regulation. One of the most important findings of the present study is that the synthetic peptides (peptide 1–2s and 1–2c), which correspond to the domain 1–2 encompassing the Leu590–Gly628(RyR1) and Leu601–Gly639 (RyR2) regions, respectively (see Table I), produced significant activation of the RyR2 and induced Ca2+ release from cardiac SR. Domain 1–2 of the RyR1 and its counterpart of the RyR2 share the same sequence in the region of subdomain 1. The corresponding peptide 1 produced about the same effects as peptide 1–2c, indicating that the essential activating function is localized in subdomain 1. Interestingly, these peptides were virtually incapable of inducing Ca2+ release from skeletal SR. Generally, they produced no effect on ryanodine binding to the RyR1 either, as long as the assay temperature was kept below 36 °C. This indicates that the activation is specific to the cardiac isoform of the RyR under such limited conditions. At 36 °C, however, the domain peptide 1–2 became capable of activating the RyR1. The extents of activation varied over a broad range, from no activation to a full activation comparable with that of the RyR2. This would indicate that there is a common mechanism between both RyR isoforms by which the RyR channel is regulated by mediation of an intramolecular domain-domain interaction, but in the RyR1 the peptide probe revealed such a mechanism only at a high temperature. A large variation in the extent of activation seen at 36 °C suggests that in the vicinity of this temperature there is a conformational transition from a “tighter” domain-domain interaction to a somewhat “loose” interaction, permitting the added peptides to exert an additional or complimentary activation. Another important aspect of this study is the finding that peptide 3 corresponding to the other domain encompassing the Asp324–Val351 segment affected neither the RyR1 nor the RyR2. Thus, it appears that the ability to activate the RyR2 is specifically localized in the domain 1, although further screening studies might reveal more regulatory regions/domains with similar or different functions. As shown in the present ryanodine binding assays, these peptides are capable of activating the RyR2 at zero or nearly zero [Ca2+]. It is particularly interesting to note that the mode of activation by these domain peptides at nominal zero Ca2+ is similar to that of the effect of calmodulin on the RyR1. Since calmodulin has no effect on the RyR2 and domain peptides have no effects on the RyR1, it is tempting to speculate that the domain peptides (hence, the corresponding in situ domain, domain 1–2) have a calmodulin-like function on the RyR2 at very low Ca2+ concentrations. As shown in this study, at a threshold level of [Ca2+] for the activation of cardiac muscle,i.e. 0.2 μm (43Stern M.D. Lakatta E.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 44Fabiato A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C1-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these peptides produced a significant activation of the RyR2 and induced a rapid Ca2+ release from cardiac SR. This suggests that the corresponding domain (i.e. domain 1–2) may be involved in the enhancement of cardiac contractility in the vicinity of the threshold [Ca2+] required for activation. At maximally activating or even higher [Ca2+] values, these peptides still produced a significant enhancement of the Ca2+-dependent activation of the RyR2. Thus, the domain corresponding to these peptides (i.e. domain 1–2) seems to play several important functions, e.g.(a) activation of the RyR2 at nearly zero Ca2+, and (b) amplification of the Ca2+-dependent activation of the RyR2 and opening of the Ca2+ channel at near threshold or subthreshold [Ca2+] values. The amino acid sequence of peptide 1–2s represents the common sequence of domain 1–2s of the RyR1 of several animal species. Similarly, peptide 1–2c represents the common sequence of the RyR2 of several animal species. Thus, the difference in four amino acid residues between the two peptides (cf. underlined residues in TableI) represents definitive characteristics distinguishing between the RyR1 and the RyR2. As shown in the present studies, the AC50 of peptide 1–2c was significantly lower than that of peptide 1–2s. This indicates that the affinity of binding to the putative regulatory domain described above is higher for the cardiac sequence than the skeletal sequence. The extent of activation by peptide 1–2c appears to be significantly larger than that of peptide 1. These results suggest that the skeletal-type sequence that is present in subdomain 2 may function as a suppressor of the activating function localized in subdomain 1, whereas the cardiac-type sequence of subdomain 2 may function as an enhancer. Interestingly, the differences in the apparent affinity among these peptides became evident only at lower [Ca2+] values (0 or 0.2 μm), and such differences were abolished at higher [Ca2+] values (10 μm), suggesting that the affinity of these peptides increases with [Ca2+]. Thus, the cardiac sequence of domain 1–2 may be important for the regulation at low [Ca2+] values, but the common sequence in domain 1 may be sufficient at higher [Ca2+] values. The remaining important questions concern the general mechanism by which the RyR is regulated in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and more specifically the mechanism by which the Ca2+-dependent activation of the RyR2 is amplified by domain peptide 1–2. Since this domain peptide is a copy of domain 1–2 and it has discrete effects on the RyR, it is conceivable that within the RyR molecule this domain is interacting with its target domain to regulate the Ca2+ channel. We tentatively locate the target domain in the postulated modulatory domain containing the putative high affinity Ca2+ binding site (45Chen S.R.W. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13414-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the mode of channel regulation, there are at least two alternative possibilities as follows. First, the interdomain interaction may facilitate the Ca2+-dependent channel opening. Conversely, it is also possible that the interdomain interaction serves as a channel blocking mechanism. Then, why did the added domain peptide activate the RyR channel in a RyR2-specific manner? In the case of the first possibility (namely the interdomain interaction produces channel activation), the interaction between domain 1–2 and the Ca2+-modulatory domain (see above) would be much tighter in the RyR1 than in the RyR2. In other words, the domain-mediated regulatory mechanism is fully functional in the RyR1, but its function is only partial in the RyR2. Therefore, the interaction of the domain peptide with the target domain will exert additional or supplementary effects in the RyR2. At higher temperatures, the interdomain interactions would become less tight, and the activating effects of peptides would become pronounced even in the RyR1. In the case of the second possibility (i.e. the interdomain interaction produces channel closing), the isoform-dependent differences in the tightness of interdomain interaction and its temperature dependence would be entirely opposite to the above. For instance, the interdomain interaction would be much tighter in the RyR2 than in the RyR1, producing more prominent de-blocking effects of the added peptides in the RyR2. Clearly more work is required to elucidate the detailed mechanism(s) of the channel regulation mediated by domain-domain and peptide-domain interactions. Our recent study on polylysine-induced Ca2+ release from the skeletal muscle SR (46Saiki Y. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggested the presence of a tight coordination between Ca2+ release and the subsequent re-uptake of the released Ca2+. As shown in the present study, there appears to be a similar release/uptake coordination mechanism also in the cardiac SR. Assuming that the domain peptides used here are simulating the exact features of the in vivochannel regulation mechanism, we would propose that the mechanism discussed above is involved not only in the potentiation of channel opening, but also in the acceleration of Ca2+re-uptake. In conclusion, the synthetic peptides corresponding to one of the conserved NH2-terminal domains of the RyR1 and the RyR2 (designated as domain 1–2) activated the RyR2. These peptides activated the RyR2 at nearly zero [Ca2+], and also amplified Ca2+-dependent activation of the RyR2. They also induced a rapid Ca2+ release from the cardiac SR. Thus, it appears that the domain corresponding to these peptides, namely domain 1–2, is capable of performing these functionsin situ, by interacting with the putative regulatory domain(s). We thank Dr. Renne C. Lu, Dr. Paul Leavis, Gina Pagani, and Elizabeth Gowell for help in the synthesis and purification of the peptides."

Recently, another subunit of TFIIIC, τ60, was found to participate in TFIIIB recruitment via its interaction with TBP (17Deprez E. Arrebola R. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase (Pol) III is a multisubunit complex comprising 17 polypeptides ranging from 162 to 7.7 kDa (18Chédin S. Ferri M.L.

A labile triad of subunits, C34, C31, and C82, has been implicated in the recruitment of Pol III and in transcription initiation (19Werner M. Chaussivert N. Willis I.A. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20721-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutation in C31 subunit was found to specifically affect transcription initiation but not the catalytic properties of the enzyme (20Thuillier V. Stettler S. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Werner M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). C34 was found to be localized the furthest upstream on tDNA in initiation complexes (21Bartholomew B. Durkovich D. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Persinger J. Bartholomew G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33039-33046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and analysis of mutant Pol III showed that mutations in C34 that decreased its interaction with TFIIIB70/BRF1 affected Pol III recruitment and open complex formation (23Brun I. Sentenac A. Werner M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5730-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This triad of subunits has its counterpart in human Pol III. These subunits form a subcomplex that is required for transcription initiation (24Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One (hRPC39) of these subunits, homologous to yC34, interacts physically with two components of hTFIIIB (hTBP and hTFIIIB90). More recently, a new essential subunit of yeast Pol III, C17, was also found to interact with C31 and TFIIIB70/BRF1 thus adding a new linkage to the TFIIIB·Pol III connection. 2M. L. Ferri, G.

These findings suggest that the recruitment, correct positioning, and activation of Pol III is mediated by multiple contacts between the enzyme and TFIIIB components.In this work we report genetic and biochemical evidence in favor of a direct contact between yeast Pol III and the assembly factor TFIIIC, namely between the common subunit ABC10α and the TFIIIB-assembling subunit of TFIIIC, τ131. Supporting initial two-hybrid experiments, recombinant ABC10α was found to interact in vitro with τ131. A thermosensitive mutation in the conserved C-terminal region of ABC10α, that weakens this interaction, can be rescued by overexpression of a variant form of τ131. These data suggest the existence of functional interactions between TFIIIC and Pol III.DISCUSSIONWe present biochemical and genetic evidence in favor of a functional contact between Pol III and its cognate assembly transcription factor TFIIIC via a direct interaction between τ131 and a shared polymerase subunit ABC10α. This interaction extends the role of TFIIIC beyond its known functions in promoter recognition and TFIIIB assembly.The two-hybrid and far Western experiments clearly demonstrated the affinity of ABC10α for τ131. A deletion mutant analysis could not restrict the interaction with ABC10α to a specific domain of τ131. The binding of ABC10α might necessitate a cooperation between two or more domains of τ131. The stronger interaction of the τ131-ΔTPR1, -ΔTPR2, or -ΔTPR3 mutants over the wild-type protein suggests that a conformational change, facilitated by the absence of TPR motif 1, 2, or 3, exposes some important interacting domain. In two-hybrid experiments, τ131-ΔTPR2 interacted more strongly with TFIIIB90/B“ (16Rüth J. Conesa C. Dieci G. Lefebvre O. Düsterhöft A. Ottonello S. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which was not the case with TFIIIB70/BRF1 (15Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in a random mutagenesis experiment carried over TPR units 1–8, the search for suppressors of an A block-down mutation yielded 10 mutants covering a 53-amino acid area extending over TPR1, -2, and -3 and centered on TPR2. One of these mutants, PCF1-2, was shown to activate Pol III transcription by increasing the recruitment of TFIIIB70/BRF1 through a non-equilibrium binding mechanism (42Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results and those presented in this work converge to underscore the importance of the second TPR motif. It is possible that both the improved recruitment of TFIIIB70/BRF1 by PCF1-2 and the better interaction between τ131 and ABC10α could stem from the same conformational change in τ131 favored either by mutations that disrupt the second TPR structure or by the deletion of this whole TPR unit. In fact, drastic conformational changes are likely to occur in τ131 during the TFIIIB assembly process (43Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).The finding of an interaction between two proteins belonging to two different multiprotein complexes raises the question of its functional significance. The ABC10α-τ131 interaction occurred via the C terminus domain of ABC10α and was affected by a thermosensitive mutation in that region, rpc10-30. Interestingly, the ts phenotype of the rpc10-30 mutant was suppressed by overexpression of the τ131-ΔTPR2 protein as could be expected since the ΔTPR2 mutant interacted more strongly with ABC10α. As a matter of fact, we observed that a ts mutation (rpc10–11) in another region of ABC10α did not impair the two-hybrid interaction with τ131, whereas the thermosensitive mutant (rpc10-30) in the C-terminal region affected the interaction. Reciprocally, the overexpression of wild-type τ131 or τ131-ΔTPR2 was unable to suppress the rpc10-11 ts mutant that did not affect the ABC10α-τ131 interaction. It is also important to note that therpc10-30 mutant was specifically affected, in vivo, in Pol III transcription, whereas the non-rescuablerpc10-11 mutant was not Pol III-specific (26Rubbi L. Labarre-Mariotte S. Chédin S. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31485-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ABC10α has been previously identified as a suppressor of tsv115, a ts mutation in the τ138 subunit of TFIIIC (44Harris S.D. Pringle J.R. Genetics. 1991; 127: 279-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) affecting TFIIIC-DNA binding and the assembly of the Pol III preinitiation complex (45Lefebvre O. Ruth J. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23374-23381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other Pol III subunits tested at that time (C160, C128, C82, C53, AC40, C34, C31, AC19, and ABC10β) were found to suppress the tsv115 mutation when overexpressed. ABC10α was suggested to be a critical subunit limiting the rate of Pol III assembly. In fact, a purified Pol III harboring the rpc10-30mutation did not display any transcriptional defect in vitro, but the level of Pol III in mutant extracts was much decreased (26Rubbi L. Labarre-Mariotte S. Chédin S. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31485-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As diploid cells with only one gene copy for ABC10α have a growth defect, ABC10α is indeed likely to affect a rate-limiting step in polymerase assembly (26Rubbi L. Labarre-Mariotte S. Chédin S. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31485-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It remains that the Pol III-specific phenotype of rpc10-30 may be due in part to its deficiency in TFIIIC interaction since it is partially suppressed by τ131-ΔTPR2.A contact between yeast TFIIIC and Pol III is not implied in the sequential initiation complex assembly model where TFIIIC assembles TFIIIB which in turn recruits Pol III. Indeed a preassembled TFIIIB·DNA complex can direct accurate transcription by Pol III in the absence of TFIIIC (46Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the association of Pol III with TFIIIC in yeast extracts has been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (18Chédin S. Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Andrau J.C. Jourdain S. Lefebvre O. Werner M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ABC10α-τ131 interaction may be involved in the formation and/or stability of a Pol III holoenzyme. Alternatively, this interaction may facilitate the recruitment of Pol III by the TFIIIB·TFIIIC·DNA complex. An interaction of Pol III with TFIIIC is also likely to occur when the enzyme elongates through the TFIIIC-bound intragenic promoter. Therefore, Pol III may well engage in many interactions with TFIIIC which have not yet been discovered. Recently, Roeder and collaborators (47Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have characterized two subunits of human TFIIIC that are clearly homologous to τ131, with its characteristic TPR units distributed similarly over the sequence, and to τ95 that is involved in A block binding. Most interestingly, one of these polypeptides, hTFIIIC63 (homologous to τ95), was found to interact with a human Pol III subunit, hRPC62 (homologous to the yeast Pol III subunit C82). In addition to its recognized role as TFIIIB assembly factor and in relieving the repression by chromatin of class III gene transcription, the observed interaction of TFIIIC subunits with Pol III subunits suggests additional functions for TFIIIC. In eukaryotic cells, RNA polymerase (Pol)1 III is responsible for the transcription of genes encoding tRNAs, 5 S RNA, U6 RNA, and a number of small RNA species. In tRNA genes (tDNA), the internal promoter elements, the A and B blocks, are recognized by TFIIIC. DNA-bound TFIIIC then directs the assembly of TFIIIB that, in turn, is sufficient to recruit RNA polymerase III for multiple transcription cycles. The transcription of all yeast class III genes is a variation of this scheme (1White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag/Landes Bioscience, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). TFIIIC and TFIIIB are multiprotein complexes. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIIIC, also called τ, is a large transcription factor (about 550–600 kDa) that comprises six polypeptides, τ138, τ131, τ95, τ91, τ60, and τ55 (2Gabrielsen O.S.

Finally, the second largest subunit of TFIIIC, τ131, is located the most upstream within the TFIIIB binding region and also extends downstream between the A and B blocks (3Bartholomew B.

Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31485-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It remains that the Pol III-specific phenotype of rpc10-30 may be due in part to its deficiency in TFIIIC interaction since it is partially suppressed by τ131-ΔTPR2.A contact between yeast TFIIIC and Pol III is not implied in the sequential initiation complex assembly model where TFIIIC assembles TFIIIB which in turn recruits Pol III. Indeed a preassembled TFIIIB·DNA complex can direct accurate transcription by Pol III in the absence of TFIIIC (46Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the association of Pol III with TFIIIC in yeast extracts has been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (18Chédin S. Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Andrau J.C. Jourdain S. Lefebvre O. Werner M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ABC10α-τ131 interaction may be involved in the formation and/or stability of a Pol III holoenzyme. Alternatively, this interaction may facilitate the recruitment of Pol III by the TFIIIB·TFIIIC·DNA complex. An interaction of Pol III with TFIIIC is also likely to occur when the enzyme elongates through the TFIIIC-bound intragenic promoter. Therefore, Pol III may well engage in many interactions with TFIIIC which have not yet been discovered. Recently, Roeder and collaborators (47Hsieh Y.J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have characterized two subunits of human TFIIIC that are clearly homologous to τ131, with its characteristic TPR units distributed similarly over the sequence, and to τ95 that is involved in A block binding. Most interestingly, one of these polypeptides, hTFIIIC63 (homologous to τ95), was found to interact with a human Pol III subunit, hRPC62 (homologous to the yeast Pol III subunit C82). In addition to its recognized role as TFIIIB assembly factor and in relieving the repression by chromatin of class III gene transcription, the observed interaction of TFIIIC subunits with Pol III subunits suggests additional functions for TFIIIC. We present biochemical and genetic evidence in favor of a functional contact between Pol III and its cognate assembly transcription factor TFIIIC via a direct interaction between τ131 and a shared polymerase subunit ABC10α. This interaction extends the role of TFIIIC beyond its known functions in promoter recognition and TFIIIB assembly. The two-hybrid and far Western experiments clearly demonstrated the affinity of ABC10α for τ131. A deletion mutant analysis could not restrict the interaction with ABC10α to a specific domain of τ131. The binding of ABC10α might necessitate a cooperation between two or more domains of τ131. The stronger interaction of the τ131-ΔTPR1, -ΔTPR2, or -ΔTPR3 mutants over the wild-type protein suggests that a conformational change, facilitated by the absence of TPR motif 1, 2, or 3, exposes some important interacting domain. In two-hybrid experiments, τ131-ΔTPR2 interacted more strongly with TFIIIB90/B“ (16Rüth J. Conesa C. Dieci G. Lefebvre O. Düsterhöft A. Ottonello S. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which was not the case with TFIIIB70/BRF1 (15Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in a random mutagenesis experiment carried over TPR units 1–8, the search for suppressors of an A block-down mutation yielded 10 mutants covering a 53-amino acid area extending over TPR1, -2, and -3 and centered on TPR2. One of these mutants, PCF1-2, was shown to activate Pol III transcription by increasing the recruitment of TFIIIB70/BRF1 through a non-equilibrium binding mechanism (42Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results and those presented in this work converge to underscore the importance of the second TPR motif. It is possible that both the improved recruitment of TFIIIB70/BRF1 by PCF1-2 and the better interaction between τ131 and ABC10α could stem from the same conformational change in τ131 favored either by mutations that disrupt the second TPR structure or by the deletion of this whole TPR unit. In fact, drastic conformational changes are likely to occur in τ131 during the TFIIIB assembly process (43Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The finding of an interaction between two proteins belonging to two different multiprotein complexes raises the question of its functional significance. The ABC10α-τ131 interaction occurred via the C terminus domain of ABC10α and was affected by a thermosensitive mutation in that region, rpc10-30. Interestingly, the ts phenotype of the rpc10-30 mutant was suppressed by overexpression of the τ131-ΔTPR2 protein as could be expected since the ΔTPR2 mutant interacted more strongly with ABC10α. As a matter of fact, we observed that a ts mutation (rpc10–11) in another region of ABC10α did not impair the two-hybrid interaction with τ131, whereas the thermosensitive mutant (rpc10-30) in the C-terminal region affected the interaction. Reciprocally, the overexpression of wild-type τ131 or τ131-ΔTPR2 was unable to suppress the rpc10-11 ts mutant that did not affect the ABC10α-τ131 interaction. It is also important to note that therpc10-30 mutant was specifically affected, in vivo, in Pol III transcription, whereas the non-rescuablerpc10-11 mutant was not Pol III-specific (26Rubbi L. Labarre-Mariotte S. Chédin S. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31485-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ABC10α has been previously identified as a suppressor of tsv115, a ts mutation in the τ138 subunit of TFIIIC (44Harris S.D. Pringle J.R. Genetics. 1991; 127: 279-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) affecting TFIIIC-DNA binding and the assembly of the Pol III preinitiation complex (45Lefebvre O. Ruth J. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23374-23381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other Pol III subunits tested at that time (C160, C128, C82, C53, AC40, C34, C31, AC19, and ABC10β) were found to suppress the tsv115 mutation when overexpressed. ABC10α was suggested to be a critical subunit limiting the rate of Pol III assembly. In fact, a purified Pol III harboring the rpc10-30mutation did not display any transcriptional defect in vitro, but the level of Pol III in mutant extracts was much decreased (26Rubbi L. Labarre-Mariotte S. Chédin S. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31485-31492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2030855812,"Mammalian ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase consists of kinase and sulfurylase domains, and catalyzes two sequential reactions to synthesize the universal sulfate donor, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS). In simpler organisms, the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase reactions are catalyzed by separate enzymes encoded by two or three genes, suggesting that a fusion of separate genes during the course of evolution generated the bifunctional enzyme. We have characterized the genomic structure of the PAPS synthetase SK2 isoform genes for mouse (MSK2) and human (HSK2) and analyzed the possible fusion region. The MSK2 and HSK2 genes exhibit a common structure of 13 exons, including a 15-nucleotide alternatively spliced exon 8. Enzyme activities of several bacterially expressed exon assemblages showed exons 1–6 encode APS kinase, while exons 6–13 encode ATP sulfurylase. The MSK2 construct without the exon 6-encoded peptide showed no kinase or sulfurylase activity, demonstrating that exon 6 encodes sequences required for both activities. Exon 1 and its 5′-flanking sequence are highly divergent between the two species, and intron 1 of the HSK2 gene contains a region similar to the MSK2 promoter sequence, suggesting that it may be the remnant of a now-superceded regulatory region. The HSK2 promoter contains a GC-rich region, not present in the mouse promoter, and has few transcription factor binding sites in common with MSK2. These differences in the two promoter regions suggest that species-specific mechanisms regulate expression of the SK2 isoform. Mammalian ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase consists of kinase and sulfurylase domains, and catalyzes two sequential reactions to synthesize the universal sulfate donor, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS). In simpler organisms, the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase reactions are catalyzed by separate enzymes encoded by two or three genes, suggesting that a fusion of separate genes during the course of evolution generated the bifunctional enzyme. We have characterized the genomic structure of the PAPS synthetase SK2 isoform genes for mouse (MSK2) and human (HSK2) and analyzed the possible fusion region. The MSK2 and HSK2 genes exhibit a common structure of 13 exons, including a 15-nucleotide alternatively spliced exon 8. Enzyme activities of several bacterially expressed exon assemblages showed exons 1–6 encode APS kinase, while exons 6–13 encode ATP sulfurylase. The MSK2 construct without the exon 6-encoded peptide showed no kinase or sulfurylase activity, demonstrating that exon 6 encodes sequences required for both activities. Exon 1 and its 5′-flanking sequence are highly divergent between the two species, and intron 1 of the HSK2 gene contains a region similar to the MSK2 promoter sequence, suggesting that it may be the remnant of a now-superceded regulatory region. The HSK2 promoter contains a GC-rich region, not present in the mouse promoter, and has few transcription factor binding sites in common with MSK2. These differences in the two promoter regions suggest that species-specific mechanisms regulate expression of the SK2 isoform. phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate nucleotide(s) kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction Biosynthesis of the universal sulfate donor, phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS),1requires two sequential enzymatic reactions: the transfer of sulfate to ATP to form APS catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase (EC 2.7.7.4), followed by transfer of phosphate to APS yielding PAPS catalyzed by APS kinase (EC2.7.1.25) (1Schwartz N.B.

Recombinant individual ATP sulfurylase or APS kinase domains of a mouse PAPS synthetase retain the ability to catalyze the respective reactions (18Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Singh B. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10751-10757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), implying that the ancestral PAPS synthetase gene was formed by fusion of separate genes encoding the independent functional units. Variations in the structural organization of monofunctional and bifunctional PAPS synthetase genes in simpler organisms and animals, respectively, likely reflect differing histories of gene fusion/duplication events in evolution. For instance, the sulfate activation operon in Escherichia coli encodes ATP sulfurylase (cysD and cysN), followed by APS kinase (cysC) (3Leyh T.S. Vogt T.F. Suo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10405-10410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium,Rhizobium meliloti, there are only two genes;nodP is homologous to cysD, and encodes a subunit of ATP sulfurylase, while nodQ is homologous tocysN and cysC, encoding both a subunit of ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase (4Schwedock J.S. Liu C. Leyh T.S. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7055-7064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a filamentous fungus,Penicillium chrysogenum, the ATP sulfurylase gene encodes the ATP sulfurylase domain plus a nonfunctional APS kinase-like domain at the C terminus (5Foster B.A. Thomas S.M. Mahr J.A. Renosto F. Patel H.C. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19777-19786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reminiscent of thecysN-cysC fusion in R. meliloti nodQ. A functional APS kinase is encoded by a separate gene in P. chrysogenum as well. In plants and yeast, the functional catalytic units are encoded by two separate genes with no combination of domains. In the fused PAPS synthetases, the structural orientation of the two functional domains is the reverse of the nodQ arrangement with APS kinase N-terminal of the ATP sulfurylase, suggesting an unrelated origin of gene fusion. Our previous activity and stability studies with rearranged recombinant enzymes showed that reversing the order of the domain organization resulted in either diminished activity or a thermally unstable enzyme (18Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Singh B. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10751-10757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such a structural or functional advantage could be a possible selective factor for gene fusion in a specific order. Thus far, the complete genomic structure of the fused PAPS synthetase genes has not been determined; further, this additional information is needed to gain insights into the mechanism of the gene fusion that brought two separate genes into a single gene encoding a bifunctional PAPS synthetase. The PAPS synthesis pathway plays an important role in normal cartilage and skeletal development in mammals as demonstrated by the recent identification of PAPS synthetase isoforms (14Li H. Deyrup A.

Brachymorphism is characterized by a dome-shaped skull, short thick tail, and shortened but not widened limbs (19Lane P.W. Dickie M.M. J. Hered. 1968; 65: 297-300Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and is associated with limited PAPS availability due to a reduction of PAPS synthetase activity (20Schwartz N.B. Ostrowski V. Brown K.S. Pratt R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, severely reduced PAPS synthetase activity was found in brachymorphic cartilage and liver, while no reduction was observed in brachymorphic brain and skin (23Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 601-609Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Spondyloepimetaphysial dysplasia (Pakistani type) is characterized by short and bowed lower limbs, enlarged knee joints, and early onset of degenerative joint disease in the hands and knees (24Ahmad M. Haque M.F. Ahmad W. Abbas H. Haque S. Krakow D. Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Cohn D.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 78: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of two PAPS synthetase genes and the tissue-specific defects in PAPS synthesis in mammalian mutants implicate coordinated mechanisms that control the expression of the PAPS synthetase genes. To gain better insights into the origin and regulation of the PAPS synthetase gene, we determined the mouse and human genomic structures of one PAPS synthetase gene family member, SK2, whose importance in development is highlighted by both human and murine growth disorders due to mutations in this gene. Recombinant monofunctional ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase proteins and a fused protein with an internal deletion were produced to determine the distribution of exons for each catalytic domain. We also analyzed the 5′-flanking region sequences of the genes for potential transcription binding sites to guide future functional expression studies. A mouse C57BL/6 genomic BAC library (GenomeSystem, St. Louis, MO) was screened with a 32P-labeled mouse SK2 cDNA fragment following the manufacturer's instructions. A human genomic BAC library, release I (GenomeSystem) was screened by PCR with a set of human SK2 primers derived from cDNA sequence (accession no.AF173365 reported in the present study). Two mouse BAC clones, BACSK2#1 and BACSK2#5, and one human BAC clone, BAChSK2, were isolated and various plasmid subclones were prepared. Direct sequencing and PCR amplification with cDNA-derived primers were performed to determine the genomic structure, comprising exon-intron boundaries and the intron sizes. Search of publicly available human genomic sequences identified two BAC clone, CIT-HSP-306M19 (Caltech Genome Research Laboratory) and AC006191 (Human Chromosome 10 Sequencing Group, Sanger Center), both containing exons 1 through 9 of the HSK2 and at least 8 kb from the upstream 5′-flanking region of the gene. The sequence data obtained from BAChSK2, CIT-HSP-306M19, and AC006191 were used to determine the complete human genomic structure. The TESS (Transcription Element Search Software) program was used to search the sequence for high quality matches to a data base of position-weighted nucleotide distribution matrices. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on total RNA extracted from 3-day-old C57BL mouse cartilage. The first strand was synthesized by SuperScript II Reverse Tanscriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using an antisense primer (SK5, 5′-GCAATTGGATACAGAGCAGC-3′) complementary to the 3′-untranslated region of SK2 mRNA. The complete open reading frame cDNA was amplified with a 5′ end sense primer containing a NdeI site (SK30, 5′-AGAGAGTTCCATATGTCTGCAAATTCCAAAATGAACCATAAAAGAGACCAGC-3′) and a 3′ end antisense primer containing a XhoI site (SK31, 5′-GAGAGAGATTCGAGCTAGTTGGTCTTCTCCAGAGACCTGTAGTAATCTGTCAACAC-3′) using Expand polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reverse transcription-PCR total cartilage RNA yielded a single band approximately 1.9 kb in length. The fragment was digested withNdeI and XhoI and cloned into appropriate restriction sites in a bacterial expression vector, pET-15b (Novagen). Sequence was determined using the dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and ABI model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The sequence was compared with previously reported mouse SK2 cDNA (accession no. AF052453) prepared from liver RNA. In order to isolate a human SK2 cDNA, the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse SK2 (accession no. AF052453) was used as a BLAST query sequence against the human EST data base maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Library of Medicine. Nucleotide sequences from several EST clones suspected to contain human SK2 cDNA were used to generate oligonucleotide primers. The 5′ end sequence of a human SK2 cDNA was obtained by the 5′-inverse PCR method (25Zeiner M. Gehring U. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 1051-1053Google Scholar) using human fetal liver poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH). The complete open reading frame for a liver HSK2 cDNA was amplified from Marathon-ready human fetal liver cDNA (CLONTECH) with a 5′ end sense primer containing aNdeI site (HSK2–16, 5′-AGAGAGTTCCATATGTCGGGGATCAAGAAGC-3′) and a 3′ end antisense primer containing a BglII site (HSK2–4, 5′-GAGAGAGATCTCGAGTTAGTTCTTCTCCAGGGACCTGTAATAATCTG-3′) using Expand polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sequence was compared with a previously reported HSK2 cDNA (accession no. AF091242) prepared from cartilage RNA (17ul Haque M.F. King L.M. Krakow D. Cantor R.M. Rusiniak M.E. Swank R.T. Superti-Furga A. Haque S. Abbas H. Ahmad W. Ahmad M. Cohn D.H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The original SK2 construct in a pET-15b bacterial expression vector was prepared as described (16Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger R.C.J. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and used as the template DNA to prepare other constructs by PCR. MSK2 is the original SK2 (accession no.AF052453) prepared from liver RNA, while MSK2Δ8 is an alternatively spliced SK2 prepared from cartilage RNA, lacking the 15-nt/5-amino acid insert (amino acid residues 290–294) encoded by exon 8. Two APS kinase constructs were prepared. The functional APS kinase domain construct, APSK21–5.5 (residues 1–227) corresponds to the mouse SK1 APS kinase domain previously shown to catalyze the APS kinase reaction (18Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Singh B. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10751-10757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and is encoded by exon 1 through the first 72 bp of exon 6. Another APS kinase construct, APSK21–5 (residues 1–214), is encoded by exons 1–5 only. Two ATP sulfurylase constructs were prepared. ATPS26–13 (residues 215–621) is an ATP sulfurylase domain protein encoded by exons 6–13, while ATPS27–13 (residues 253–621) is another ATP sulfurylase protein encoded by exons 7–13. MSK2Δ6 (residues 1–214 and 253–621) is a MSK2 deletion construct lacking the sequence encoded by exon 6 (residues 215–252). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed by the heat-shock method with cDNA constructs cloned in the pET-15b vector (Novagen). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to an overnight bacterial culture and incubated for an additional 4 h. The bacterial cell culture was centrifuged at 9,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended into IMAC 5 buffer (5 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9). The expressed protein was extracted by cell sonication followed by centrifugation. MSK2, MSK2Δ8, APSK21–5.5, APSK21–5, and ATPS26–13 proteins were soluble and present in the supernatant, whereas MSK2Δ6, and ATPS27–13 were insoluble and present in the bacterial pellet as inclusion bodies. To purify the soluble expressed protein, the supernatant was loaded onto a His·Bind resin column (Novagen) followed by two washes (30 ml) with IMAC30 buffer to remove bacterial contaminant proteins. APSK21–5 protein eluted in IMAC30 buffer wash, while other proteins including APSK21–5.5were eluted with IMAC400 buffer (4–6 ml). Insoluble proteins, MSK2Δ6 and ATPS27–13, were extracted with 6 m urea in IMAC5 buffer. Both His·Bind-purified and urea-extracted enzymes were dialyzed into phosphate buffer (25 mmNaH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) overnight and diluted with phosphate buffer to 20 μg/ml for enzymatic assays. ATP sulfurylase was assayed in the reverse direction of ATP formation as described (26Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Stanzak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); standard assay contained 50 mmNaH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 7.8, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na4P2O (containing 6.7 mCi of 32P), 0.1 mm APS, and 50 μl of enzyme preparation. APS kinase was assayed as described (27Lyle S. Stanzak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); standard assay contained 80 nm [35S]APS, 0.5 mm ATP, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 12 μl of enzyme, brought up to 25 μl with buffer A (25 mmNaH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). The overall reaction with ATP and SO42− as substrate and measuring the production of APS and PAPS was assayed as described (28Lyle S. Stanzack J. Ng K. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); standard overall assay contained 0.4 mm[35S]H2SO4, 10 mmATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 22 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 15 μl of enzyme preparation in a total volume of 25 μl. The genomic structure of one PAPS synthetase gene family member, SK2, was determined both in mouse and human. A mouse BAC clone, BACSK2#1, contained exons 2–13, while another BAC clone, BACSK2#5, contained the mouse exon 1 and 5′-flanking regions. One human BAC clone, BAChSK2, contained the whole gene. Two additional BAC clones, CIT-HSP-306M19 (Caltech Genome Research Laboratory) and AC006191 (Human Chromosome 10 Sequencing Group, Sanger Center) contained exons 1–9 of the HSK2 gene. The sequence data obtained from these five clones were used to determine the whole genomic structure for the MSK2 and HSK2 genes. The MSK2 and HSK2 genes have identical exon organizations, consisting of 13 exons (Fig. 1 A) with a 15-nt alternatively spliced exon 8 (Fig.2; see below). The minimum sizes of the genes are 40 and 85 kb for the MSK2 and HSK2 genes, respectively. Nucleotide sequences of the intron/exon boundaries show that all introns in the MSK2 and HSK2 genes begin with a 5′-GT dinucleotide and conclude with 3′-AG termini (Table I). The size of exons and phases of splicing are also conserved between the species, with the exception of exon 1. The deduced amino acid sequences at the N termini encoded by exon 1, as well as the nucleotide sequences of the 5′-flanking regions, are significantly different between MSK2 and HSK2 (Fig. 4). By scanning the intron 1 sequence of the HSK2 gene, we identified a 800-bp sequence 25 kb downstream from exon 1, which is similar to the MSK2 5′-flanking region sequence (68% identity). However, this region does not appear to encode a peptide corresponding to the MSK2 N-terminal sequence, or to contain transcription factor binding motifs as found in the MSK2 promoter region, and thus may be the remnant of a former promoter.Figure 2Sequence around the alternative splice site in SK2 and SK2Δ8 in mouse and human.

The highly conserved gt…ag motif is shown in boldface. Comparison of the exon structures to the functional domains of PAPS synthetases reveals that the APS kinase domain is encoded by exon 1 through exon 6, base 39, and the ATP sulfurylase domain is encoded by exon 6, base 40, through exon 13. The intervening sequence present in the functional APS kinase domain is encoded by exon 5, base 48 through exon 6, base 39. An alternatively spliced 15-nt sequence comprises one exon, designated as exon 8 (Fig. 2). Exon distribution of several functional motifs was also analyzed. The GXXGXGK motif essential for ATP binding (P-loop) (29Smith C. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) is found in the APS-kinase domain (50GLSGAGK56). The first base of the G50 codon is encoded by exon 2, and the rest of the P-loop codons reside in exon 3, forming a phase I splicing. Our previous study on mutational analysis of the P-loop in mouse SK1 showed that a mutation of glycine 50 to alanine did not affect any of the enzyme activities (30Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that the functionally essential residues of the P-loop are solely encoded by exon 3. Another functional unit, a PAPS-dependent enzyme motif, KAXAXXXXFTG, in mouse SK2 is found as166KRARAGEIKG175FTG178 in the kinase portion. The first base of the G175 codon is encoded by exon 4, and the rest of the motif is encoded by exon 5, forming a phase I splicing. The FISP motif (31MacRae I.J. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol.

However, HSK2 lacks five amino acids in the ATP-sulfurylase domain, and the first 9 or 11 N-terminal residues are dissimilar between MSK2 and HSK2. Amplification of MSK2 partial cDNA generated from cartilage RNA identified a MSK2 cDNA variant, referred to as MSK2Δ8 (Fig. 2). This cartilage cDNA lacks 15 nt at positions 869–883, predicting a deletion of the five amino acids, GVVPR, from residues 290–294, in the ATP sulfurylase domain. Analysis of the genomic sequence shows that this 5-amino acid segment is encoded by an exon with typical flanking donor and acceptor sequences (Table I). PCR analysis of MSK2 gene expression showed that MSK2Δ8 is the major form in cartilage, while the original MSK2 is the major form in liver (data not shown). We have prepared liver HSK2 cDNA, and the sequence was compared with HSK2 cDNA isolated from a cartilage cDNA library (accession no.AF091242). The liver HSK2 cDNA is equivalent to MSK2 and contains the 15-nt exon 8 sequence, while the cartilage HSK2 protein is equivalent to MSK2Δ8, lacking the 5-amino acid sequence, GMALP from residue 289 to 293, encoded by exon 8. Both MSK2 and MSK2Δ8 proteins were bacterially expressed, and the ability of these proteins to catalyze the APS kinase, ATP sulfurylase, and overall PAPS synthetase reactions in vitro was compared. No significant difference between the two proteins was observed in any of the three assays (see below). In order to determine the distribution of exons encoding each enzyme catalytic unit, several expression constructs with different exon compositions were prepared, and the expressed proteins subjected to enzyme assays (Fig.3). Three assays were used to assess expression levels for the recombinants as well as the functionality of each mutant: the reverse sulfurylase, the forward kinase, and the overall reaction, which measures APS and PAPS simultaneously. The full-length proteins MSK2 and MSK2Δ8 were soluble proteins, and after purification and dialysis were assayed for the three activities (see “Materials and Methods” for details). MSK2 exhibited normal sulfurylase (2.35 μmol of ATP/min·mg), kinase (227.9 pmol of PAPS/min·mg), and overall (13.6 nmol of PAPS/min·mg) activities. Alternatively spliced isoform MSK2Δ8 also exhibited all three activities comparably to MSK2. The APS kinase constructs APSK21–5.5 and APSK21–5 were both soluble in IMAC5 buffer, but APS"

Lima A.A. Guerrant R.L. Baillieres Clin. Gastroenterol. 1987; 1: 335-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,2Holmgren J. Svennerholm A.M. Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Am. 1992; 21: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is currently no prophylaxis and only a very labor-intensive therapy against diarrhea caused by LT. Therefore, the discovery of potent inhibitors which can block the function of LT is very important for the development of effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of LT-caused diarrhea. The toxin is a heterohexamer and is assembled in the periplasm of the bacterium with one A subunit which contains its enzymatic active site and five identical B subunits which are responsible for target cell recognition. The mechanism of action by LT can be separated into several stages. After release from the bacterium, LT first binds to epithelial cells lining the intestines through its B pentameric subunits. The A subunit of LT is then translocated across the cell membrane. Inside the intestinal cell, the A subunit of the toxin modifies the α subunit of the trimeric protein Gsso that Gsα loses its GTPase activity and remains constitutively in its GTP-bound state (3Spangler B.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 622-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This in turn causes a continuous stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The resulting elevated levels of cyclic AMP in the cell lead to massive loss of fluid and ions from the cell, the characteristic pathology of enterotoxigenic disease. Based on this mechanism, one approach of developing drugs against LT would be to create molecules which have high affinity for the receptor binding site of LT and can therefore block the binding of LT to the epithelial cells. The natural cell surface receptor for LT is ganglioside GM1 (Gal-β1,3-GalNAc-β1,4-(NeuAc-α2,3)-Gal-β1,4-Glc-β1,1-ceramide). The oligosaccharide part of GM1 (GM1-OS) is responsible for binding to LT. Because of the high cost of synthesizing large amounts of complex oligosaccharide such as GM1-OS, the use of GM1-OS itself or its close derivatives as drugs against LT would not be economically feasible. Therefore, the discovery of simple and easily synthesizable small molecules which can effectively compete with GM1-OS for binding to the receptor binding site of LT would be of great value. The three-dimensional structure of LT in its apo state is well known (4Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A. Witholt B. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of the complex between GM1-OS and cholera toxin (CT), a closely related toxin with 80% sequence identity to LT, is also known (5Merritt E.A. Kuhn P. Sarfaty S. Erbe J.L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1043-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Structurally, both LT and CT have essentially identical binding sites for their natural receptor GM1 (5Merritt E.A. Kuhn P. Sarfaty S. Erbe J.L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1043-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two structures (LT and CT) can be used interchangeably in the design of easily synthesizable small molecules which can inhibit the receptor binding process of LT. The crystallographically determined structure of cholera toxin bound to its natural receptor (CT·GM1-OS (5Merritt E.A. Kuhn P. Sarfaty S. Erbe J.L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1043-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)) reveals which regions in the toxin can be exploited in drug design. The two terminal sugars, galactose and sialic acid, make the most contributions to the binding of GM1 to the toxin, and therefore their binding pockets are the primary targets. Binding of the terminal galactose group is very specific, because all hydroxyls are involved in multiple hydrogen bonds with the protein, and substituting this galactose moiety may be extremely difficult. The sialic acid moiety on the other hand is less intimately bound by the protein. The sugar ring of the sialic acid makes hydrophobic interactions with Tyr-12, whereas the carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl, and the N-acetyl substituents form hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone. The glycerol tail is only involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonding. However, close reexamination of the structure showed that the glycerol tail is very close to a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile-58 and Lys-34 of the neighboring B subunit (see Fig. 1 A), although no significant hydrophobic interactions are present. Subsequently, we used the program GRID with a hydrophobic probe (6Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar) to explore hydrophobic binding sites in LT. The results suggest that the proposed pocket is indeed favorable for hydrophobic binding determinants (Fig.1 B) in CT as well as in LT. The proposed hydrophobic target region formed by Ile-58 and Lys-34 has never been occupied in any of the other toxin structures complexed to different galactose derivatives (7Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1485-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to explore this region by screening ligands composed of galactose, a linker, and a hydrophobic group for their ability to inhibit toxin binding to GM1. Galactose was used as an anchor to direct binding to the GM1 pocket, which is needed to prevent possible unspecific binding of the hydrophobic group to other hydrophobic regions on the protein. The linker was necessary to bridge the distance between the galactose C1 atom and the target site for the hydrophobic group, the Ile-58/Lys-34 pocket. A library of compounds was synthesized to obtain a large and diverse selection of ligands with a hydrophobic group linked to the galactose anchor. For this library three different anchors were used, each of which had a different substituent on C1 of galactose (see Fig. 2). For the linker, we decided to use polymethylene. It was realized that conformational freezing of this very flexible linker upon binding would lead to loss of entropy. However, the rationale was that the hydrophobic group has to bind rather tightly to compensate for this entropic loss in order for the ligand to show reasonable inhibition. In that way we would only select very tight binding hydrophobic groups for which we can improve the linker in later stages of the project. For the hydrophobic group, we opted for considerable freedom with respect to types of ring, which were allowed to have any kind of heteroatoms, bonding, and substituents. Using a solution phase library synthesis protocol we recently developed, 2F. Hong and E. Fan, submitted for publication. 72 compounds were synthesized. These library compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of LT to gangliosides. Two of these compounds appeared to be the galactose derivatives with the highest affinity for the receptor binding site observed so far. The program GRID, Version 16 (6Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar), was used to indicate energetically favorable binding pockets in the receptor binding site of LT for a hydrophobic group. To find such favorable binding pockets, a hydrophobic probe was used with the default parameters to determine the interaction energies with the protein on a grid with 0.5-Å spacing. The grid was placed over the 2.2-Å resolution structure of LT·galactose (11Merritt E.A. Sixma T.K. Kalk K.H. Van Zanten B.A. Hol W.G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with the waters and galactose omitted while the grid covered a volume of 23 × 20 × 20 Å. Gal-βNHCO-(CH2)n-Ph, Gal-αO-(CH2)2-NHCO-(CH2)n-Ph, and Gal-βO-(CH2)2-NHCO-(CH2)n-Ph were built in InsightII (Version 97.0, Biosym/MSI) to represent, respectively, libraries I, II, and III. The galactose in binding site D of the LT·galactose structure (11Merritt E.A. Sixma T.K. Kalk K.H. Van Zanten B.A. Hol W.G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was used as the starting point from which the ligands were extended. The dihedrals of these compounds were adjusted manually to reach the Ile-58/Lys-34 pocket, leaving the galactose rigid including the C1-N or C1-O dihedral in its optimal position. For library I, this optimal position has an H1-C1-N1-C7′ dihedral angle of 20°, because in the Cambridge Structural Data Base (12Allen F. Kennard O. Chem. Des. Automa. News. 1993; 8 (31–37): 1Google Scholar) five structures of pyranoses which are N-acetylated at C1 have an average dihedral of 20° ± 15°. For libraries II and III, the glycosidic torsion prefers the exo-anomeric conformation; H1-C1-O1-C7′ = −60° ± 60° for αD-sugars, and 60° ± 60° for βD-sugars (13Tvaroska I. Bleha T. Adv. Carb. Chem. Biochem. 1989; 47: 45-123Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The ligands were energy-minimized using a conjugate gradient algorithm and the CFF91 forcefield until the r.m.s. derivative was smaller than 0.001 kcal mol−1 Å−1. The library compounds were built starting from n = 1, untiln was large enough for the phenyl group to be within 4 Å of either Ile-58 or Lys-34. A two-dimensional substructure search was conducted in the Available Chemicals Directory, ACD3D 97.2 (Molecular Design Ltd., San Leandro, CA). The software used for searching was the program ISIS (Molecular Design Ltd.) (14Moock T.E. Henry D.R. Ozkabak A.G. Alamgir M. J. Chem. Info. Comput. Sci. 1994; 34: 184-189Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For flexible docking of III3J to the rigid target site in pLT the program SAS (25Diller D.J. Verlinde C.L.M.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar) (Stochastic Approximation with Smoothing) was used. The protein coordinates used were prepared as follows: (i) the coordinates of pLT complexed to galactose (11Merritt E.A. Sixma T.K. Kalk K.H. Van Zanten B.A. Hol W.G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were taken from the Protein Data Bank, (ii) galactose was deleted from the coordinate set, (iii) the positions of the hydrogens on hetero atoms were determined using the HB2NET option in the program WHATIF (16Hooft R.W. Sander C. Vriend G. Proteins. 1996; 26: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), (iv) other hydrogens were added with InsightII, and (v) charges were assigned using the CFF91 forcefield. Affinity grids of the protein were calculated using the AUTOGRID program supplied with the AUTODOCK 2.2 package (17Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Proteins. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The ligand was built in InsightII, subsequently energy-minimized using a conjugate gradient algorithm and the CFF91 forcefield until the r.m.s. derivative was smaller than 0.001 kcal mol−1Å−1, and prepared for flexible docking using the program add_hydrogens supplied with the SAS package (25Diller D.J. Verlinde C.L.M.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The default parameters were used for running the docking program SAS. The ligand was docked 50 times, each time doing 150 cycles of 6000 iterations. After running SAS, the solutions were clustered in groups with r.m.s. deviations lower than 1.0 Å. The clusters were ranked by the lowest energy representative of each cluster. Porcine LT holotoxin was expressed from plasmid pROFIT-LT in E. coli strain MC1061 (18Feil I.K. Reddy R. de Haan L. Merritt E.A. Van den Akker F. Storm D.R. Hol W.G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The protein was purified using the protocol of Uesaka et al.(19Uesaka Y. Otsuka Y. Lin Z. Yamasaki S. Yamaoka J. Kurazono H. Takeda Y. Microbial. Pathogen. 1994; 16: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), except that the clarified cell lysate was subjected to a 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) prior to affinity chromatography on immobilizedd-galactose. The purity was estimated to be at least 95% on the basis of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Anti-LT B monoclonal antibody mAb 118–87 was a kind gift from Dr. T. Hirst (University of Bristol, Bristol, UK). Commercially obtained assay materials were: IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and GD1b (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA). Commercially obtained acids for library synthesis were: 6-maleimidocaproic acid, 3-cyclohexylpropionic acid, and cyclohexanebutyric acid (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI); 3-phthalimidopropionic acid and 7-phenylheptanoic acid (Lancaster, Windham, NH); phenytoin-N-butyric acid (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); β-N-indolepropionic acid (Pfaltz & Bauer Inc., Waterbury, CT); and all other acids were from Aldrich. Fig. 2 A depicts a short schematic of the synthesis, which uses trialkylphosphine-mediated amide formation (20Inazu T. Kobayashi K. Synlett. 1993; : 869-870Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The detailed library synthesis protocol will be published elsewhere.2 All library compounds screened gave satisfactory mass spectroscopy results and were judged to be >95% pure by thin layer chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography (with a small amount of the corresponding acid starting material as the contaminant, which was tested to have no adverse effect on the screening assay). Compounds selected for IC50measurements were synthesized in larger scale following a similar protocol as the library synthesis and were all purified by high performance liquid chromatography before use. The LT GD1b ELISA was performed as described by Minke et al. (21Minke W.E. Roach C. Hol W.G.J. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5684-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Test samples consisted of 0.2 μg/ml porcine LT toxin preincubated with the library compound for 2 h at room temperature. For initial screening, the test samples were diluted in a 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline solution (saline solution containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.2), and subsequently the solutions were filtered over a 0.22-μm membrane. For determination of the IC50 values, the test samples were prepared in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), 0.1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate and validated against a concentration gradient of 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 μg/ml toxin. IC50 values were calculated from at least five different concentrations of competitive ligand by nonlinear regression as described previously (22Bowen W.P. Jerman J.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with the statistical package S-PLUS (Mathsoft, Inc., Cambridge, MA). For the final IC50 values, the IC50 was determined at least two times in independent experiments. The reported IC50 of a ligand is the weighted average (weight = 1/estimated S.D.2) of the IC50 values from its different determinations. The binding pocket of the glycerol tail of GM1 suggested the presence of a hydrophobic site in LT and CT formed by Ile-58 and Lys-34, which was supported by the fact that a hydrophobic probe had very high affinity in this region as determined by the program GRID (Fig. 1). To explore this binding pocket, we decided to construct a library from galactose and carboxylate building blocks (Fig.2 A).2 Manual docking procedures were used to determine the minimal length of the methylene linker of the carboxylate building block: a phenyl ring was positioned in the Ile-58/Lys-34 pocket of LT while the phenyl was attached to galactose in the galactose binding site through a methylene linker joined by an amide bond. For sub-library I (Gal-βNHCO-(CH2)n-Ph) at least three methylene units were needed to bridge the distance between the galactose-C1-NH and the hydrophobic pocket. For sub-libraries II and III (Gal-O-(CH2)2-NHCO-(CH2)n-Ph, α for sub-library II and β for sub-library III), at least three and two methylene units were needed, respectively, to reach the Ile-58/Lys-34 pocket. Therefore, it was decided to use carboxylates with two to six methylene units attached to a hydrophobic group as building blocks for a galactose library to screen for ligands that inhibit LT binding to GD1b by making use of the hydrophobic pocket. To select appropriate building blocks for library synthesis, the Available Chemicals Directory was searched for the substructure depicted in Fig. 2 B, which yielded 485 carboxylate containing molecules. These compounds were screened for chemical properties, and the following substituents were excluded: additional carboxylates, free alcohols, free amines/imines, free thiols, aldehydes, borines, seleniums, furans, thienyls, and radicals. In addition, the following groups were rejected: porphyrins, steroids, and microperoxidases. Of the remaining 242 compounds we rejected the doubles, in which we considered methyls and halogens to be identical. Also, we discarded compounds without a price listing or compounds that cost more than $100. This led to a group of 58 compounds of which a subgroup of 33 compounds was selected based on diversity. Of these 33 acids that were ordered, only 24 were actually available and used in the library synthesis. The different linker lengths and different substituents of this final group of acids are depicted in Fig.2 C. After the synthesis following the protocol developed by us,2 72 library compounds were constructed with the general structure as drawn in Fig. 2 A and the different substituents (R-groups) as drawn in Fig. 2 C. The library compounds were tested at 5 mm for inhibition of LT binding to GD1b, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3. GD1b was chosen as the appropriate ganglioside because the toxin binds 11 times weaker to GD1b than to GM1 (23Sugii S. Tsuji T. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which makes it possible to screen for lower affinity inhibitors. We would like to point out that a few compounds were tested at a concentration below 5 mm as a result of a low yield in the synthesis or because of solubility problems; these compounds are marked with an asterisk in Fig. 3. The following compounds showed more than 50% inhibition and were subsequently tested at 0.5 mm: I2J (I2J denotes the sub-library I compound with a linker of two methylene units and substituent 2J), I3J, I4C, II2B, II2C, II2F, II2G, II3J, II4B, II4C, and II6A. At 0.5 mm only galactose library compounds II3J and II6A showed significant inhibition in the LT ELISA, respectively, 100% and 60%. Subsequently these compounds were synthesized at larger scale to confirm their inhibitory power and to determine the IC50. Unfortunately, the results with compound II6A from the larger scale do not confirm with the earlier, screening results: the IC50 is only 3.2 ± 0.1 mm. The better result obtained during the initial screening may have been because of impurities in the smaller scale library synthesis. However, compound II3J is indeed an extremely good inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.23 ± 0.04 mm (Fig.4 A), which means that the affinity is 300-fold higher than that of galactose (21Minke W.E. Roach C. Hol W.G.J. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5684-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because II3J is such a good inhibitor and compound III3J was only tested at an unknown and very low concentration, we also decided to resynthesize library compound III3J at a larger scale and test it in an appropriate solvent. The presence of 10% Me2SO in the II3J sample solutions did not have any effect on the IC50 of II3J (Fig.4 A), and in addition, III3J dissolved completely in the presence of 10% Me2SO. Therefore, the IC50 of III3J was determined in the presence of 10% Me2SO and turns out to be 40 ± 2 μm (Fig. 4 B). The IC50 of III3J is even 5-fold better than its α-isomer in library II or in other words it is 1500-fold better than galactose.Figure 4Inhibition of toxin binding to GD1b-coated microtiter plates by II3J (A) and III3J (B). Inhibition was determined using the LT GD1b ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The LT concentration was 0.2 μg/ml. For II3J, the experiment was performed in the absence and presence of 10% Me2SO (DMSO). For III3J, the experiment was only done in the presence of 10% Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Besides identifying several tight binding inhibitors of LT binding to GD1b, another motivation for designing, synthesizing and screening a galactose library was to analyze characteristics of this library for the design of future inhibitors. First of all, the effect of the linker length should be discussed. As was predicted, a linker of two methylene units is too short for libraries I and III (compounds I2J and III2J being exceptions, probably because of the presence of a second phenyl group). However, for the compounds with longer linkers in libraries I and III and for library II, there is not a clear correlation between linker length and inhibition of LT binding to GD1b. Second, library II distinctly contains better inhibitors (Fig. 3), although the best compound is from library III. This confirms our earlier findings that α anomers of galactose derivatives in general are better inhibitors than their β anomers (21Minke W.E. Roach C. Hol W.G.J. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5684-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To conclude, library II contains relatively the most potent inhibitors, and even compounds with the smallest linker in this library perform well in the ELISA. Therefore, it is probably wise to expand this library in the future and also include compounds in library II with only one methylene group as the linker. Of course our immediate goal is to follow up the hits of this successful library screen. To design the next round of inhibitors based on the very potent inhibitor III3J, we need to know its exact binding mode. Initially, we tried to expedite the design process by predicting the binding mode of III3J in LT using the docking program SAS. However, as shown in Fig. 5, no single binding mode was preferred. Instead, of the 50 solutions suggested by the program, only 7 were within 1 Å of another solution. Therefore, we are in the process of crystallizing the LT·III3J complex to obtain a better model for the binding mode of III3J in LT. We thank Dr. David Diller for early release of the program SAS and Dr. Peter Goodford for providing GRID. And we are very grateful to Dr. Tim Hirst for providing us with anti-LTB."

The availability of large pools of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins derived from normal tissues facilitates the purification and identification of previously unknown targets for cellular tyrosine kinases. Using this procedure, we have thus far identified four proteins in the liver and kidney of peroxovanadate-treated dogs. Two of these, annexin VII and annexin XI, were novel and had not been previously reported to be substrates of tyrosine kinases while the remaining two, ezrin and clathrin, have been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated in some cell culture systems. In the present study, isolated proteins were identified both by sequence analysis and immunological methods. Annexin VII and annexin XI are present in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells and both were tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a physiological ligand, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Furthermore, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PDGF-BB was augmented by the co-addition of peroxovanadate to cell cultures. In vitrophosphorylation assays showed that PDGF receptor, calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK/Pyk-2), Src kinase, and epidermal growth factor receptor all were able to phosphorylate purified annexin VII and XI on tyrosine residues. These findings confirm the usefulness of phosphatase inhibition by peroxovanadate as a tool for identifying previously unknown physiological targets for cellular protein tyrosine kinases. The intraperitoneal administration of peroxovanadate results in the rapid accumulation of many tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the liver and kidney of treated animals. The availability of large pools of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins derived from normal tissues facilitates the purification and identification of previously unknown targets for cellular tyrosine kinases. Using this procedure, we have thus far identified four proteins in the liver and kidney of peroxovanadate-treated dogs. Two of these, annexin VII and annexin XI, were novel and had not been previously reported to be substrates of tyrosine kinases while the remaining two, ezrin and clathrin, have been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated in some cell culture systems. In the present study, isolated proteins were identified both by sequence analysis and immunological methods.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). Enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins may be induced by treatment with appropriate cell activating ligands (growth factors, hormones, and cytokines). Many of these extracellular ligands directly or indirectly activate specific tyrosine kinases. Alternatively, we have previously reported that the simple intraperitoneal injection of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (peroxovanadate) into mice, in the absence of any added ligand, results within minutes in the appearance of numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in liver and kidney. These include the EGF-R,1 insulin receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, SHC, Stat 1α, Stat 1β, Stat 3, Stat 5, phospholipase Cγ, insulin receptor substrate-1, β-catenin, γ-catenin, SHP-1, SHP-2, etc., all of which were identified using antibodies to known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (2Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the importance of phosphatase activity on the steady-state levels of phosphotyrosine in cellular proteins and the extent to which global tyrosine kinase activity is always “on” in the intact animal (2Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).In the present study, in situ administration of peroxovanadate to dog was used to generate a sufficiently large pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in liver and kidney to attempt the biochemical isolation and identification of proteins not previously known to be tyrosine phosphorylated. Among the dozens (hundreds?) of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that could be induced in these organs of the intact animal, we now report the identification of four: annexin VII, annexin XI, clathrin heavy chain, and ezrin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin and clathrin heavy chain has been detected in some cell culture systems (3Gould K.L. Cooper J.A. Bretscher A. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Martin-Perez J. Bar-Zvi D. Branton D. Erikson R.L. J.

Since tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin VII and XI has not previously been reported, we present evidence for the physiological relevance of these phosphorylations: PDGF-BB induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of both annexins in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and both annexins are tyrosine phosphorylated in vitro by a number of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified in the liver and kidney of peroxovanadate-treated dogs four tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Two of these proteins, annexin XI and annexin VII, have not previously been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in any model system and the other two, clathrin and ezrin, have not been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the intact animal, although they have been detected in specialized cell systems (3Gould K.L. Cooper J.A. Bretscher A. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Martin-Perez J. Bar-Zvi D. Branton D. Erikson R.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Annexin VII and XI are related members of a family of homologous proteins that bind negatively charged phospholipids in the presence of calcium. The proposed physiological functions of the annexins include phospholipase A2 inhibition, exocytosis, membrane trafficking and binding, ion channel activity, and signaling. Although the proposed functions are diverse, they are all related to the phospholipid/membrane binding properties of the proteins.Annexins are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types of eukaryotes (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Family members contain conserved C-terminal domains with conserved repeats of 70 amino acids each of which forms the “endonexin-fold”-domain responsible for Ca2+ and phospholipid binding. The N-terminal domains are considered unique among annexins since they vary in sequence and length and presumably determine functional diversity among members (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 22Benz J. Hofmann A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). Like eps 8 and eps 15, annexin VII and XI are tyrosine phosphorylated, but contain neither SH2 nor phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Annexin VII and XI both have large, hydrophobic, structurally related N-terminal regions very rich in glycine, tyrosine, and proline residues (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar).The only annexins previously shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated are annexin I and II (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Annexin I was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in A-431 cells by the EGF-R in this laboratory (11Fava R.A. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin II was detected in cells transformed by pp60 src (23Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, serine phosphorylation has also been reported for a number of annexins. Despite these findings, the physiological role of phosphorylation of annexins (as well as of annexins themselves) is still largely unknown. Tyrosine phosphorylation may modulate one or more of the proposed physiological functions for this class of proteins.Annexin VII (also known as synexin) has previously been shown to occur in two isoforms: one full-length with a molecular mass of 51-kDa and one lacking exon 6 with molecular mass of 47-kDa. In our studies, only the 47-kDa isoform was observed. Annexin VII has been reported to be involved in ion channel activity, membrane fusion, aggregation, secretion, and Ca2+/GTP-regulated exocytosis (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 24Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B.

These observations do not appear to be an artifact due to species differences in antibody reactivity since Mizutani et al. (16Mizutani A. Usuda N. Tokumitsu H. Minami H. Yasui K. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13498-13504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also unable to detect annexin XI in rat kidney with a different polyclonal antibody. The reasons for these species differences are unknown.The two other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins we isolated, clathrin and ezrin, both had previously been identified as tyrosine kinase substrates in various cell systems (3Gould K.L.

Wilde and Brodsky (5Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin may affect only subpopulations of clathrin such as those found on endosomes, at sites of cell adhesion, or those involved in formation of the pentagon lattice. Phosphorylation of ezrin appears to be critical for its cellular distribution by the unmasking of actin-binding sites (34Vaheri A. Carpén O. Heiska L. Helander T.S. Jääskeläinen T.

Recently, tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin on Y353 has been shown to be involved in cell survival by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (33Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated ezrin (Y353) was reported to interact with an SH2 domain on the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and thereby protect against apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. When Y353 in ezrin was mutated to F, cells underwent apoptosis (33Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Our ability to isolate annexin VII and XI as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following the administration of peroxovanadate to dog indicates that there must be a kinase(s) that phosphorylates these proteins and a phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylates them. Since annexin VII and XI had not previously been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated in any cell system and we could detect both proteins in rat VSMC, we examined possible physiological stimuli that might induce their tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells.Using rat VSMC we were able to show enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin VII and XI in response to a physiological stimulus, PDGF-BB (Fig. 6). Furthermore, as might be expected, peroxovanadate increased the response to PDGF (Fig. 6). Presumably, the results with the mixture of PDGF-BB and peroxovanadate duplicate those in peroxovanadate-treated dog in which endogenous ligands are constitutively present. In support of these findings, in vitro kinase assays showed that PDGF-R, CADTK/Pyk-2, Src kinase, and EGF-R were able to phosphorylate the annexins (Fig. 7). Both CADTK/Pyk-2 and Src kinases are downstream of the PDGF-R and are activated by PDGF (37Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. Herman B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, CADTK/Pyk-2 is associated with the cytoskeleton and has been shown to be important for tyrosine kinase signaling in VSMC in response to PDGF (37Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. Herman B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results using a mixture of annexin VII and XI alone indicate that a trace of phosphotyrosine was present in the annexins as isolated. However, ATP was required for the appearance of phosphotyrosine following incubation of substrate with kinase (Fig.7).Finally, as can be concluded from data presented in Figs. 2 and 4, there are many other, as yet unidentified, phosphotyrosine proteins in our screen, a few of which may be the same as those previously identified in the mouse (2Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given the number of known substrates for tyrosine kinases, it is surprising to us that of the first four major proteins identified in our screen, two had not previously been identified as tyrosine phosphorylated, again suggesting that many more phosphotyrosine-containing proteins remain to be identified. Although tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins constitute only a very small percentage of the total phosphoprotein content of cells, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues plays an important regulatory role in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and differentiation (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). Enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins may be induced by treatment with appropriate cell activating ligands (growth factors, hormones, and cytokines). Many of these extracellular ligands directly or indirectly activate specific tyrosine kinases. Alternatively, we have previously reported that the simple intraperitoneal injection of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (peroxovanadate) into mice, in the absence of any added ligand, results within minutes in the appearance of numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in liver and kidney. These include the EGF-R,1 insulin receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, SHC, Stat 1α, Stat 1β, Stat 3, Stat 5, phospholipase Cγ, insulin receptor substrate-1, β-catenin, γ-catenin, SHP-1, SHP-2, etc., all of which were identified using antibodies to known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (2Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the importance of phosphatase activity on the steady-state levels of phosphotyrosine in cellular proteins and the extent to which global tyrosine kinase activity is always “on” in the intact animal (2Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, in situ administration of peroxovanadate to dog was used to generate a sufficiently large pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in liver and kidney to attempt the biochemical isolation and identification of proteins not previously known to be tyrosine phosphorylated. Among the dozens (hundreds?) of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that could be induced in these organs of the intact animal, we now report the identification of four: annexin VII, annexin XI, clathrin heavy chain, and ezrin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin and clathrin heavy chain has been detected in some cell culture systems (3Gould K.L. Cooper J.A. Bretscher A. Hunter T. J.

Since tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin VII and XI has not previously been reported, we present evidence for the physiological relevance of these phosphorylations: PDGF-BB induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of both annexins in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and both annexins are tyrosine phosphorylated in vitro by a number of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified in the liver and kidney of peroxovanadate-treated dogs four tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Two of these proteins, annexin XI and annexin VII, have not previously been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in any model system and the other two, clathrin and ezrin, have not been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the intact animal, although they have been detected in specialized cell systems (3Gould K.L.

The proposed physiological functions of the annexins include phospholipase A2 inhibition, exocytosis, membrane trafficking and binding, ion channel activity, and signaling. Although the proposed functions are diverse, they are all related to the phospholipid/membrane binding properties of the proteins.Annexins are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types of eukaryotes (20Gerke V.

Family members contain conserved C-terminal domains with conserved repeats of 70 amino acids each of which forms the “endonexin-fold”-domain responsible for Ca2+ and phospholipid binding. The N-terminal domains are considered unique among annexins since they vary in sequence and length and presumably determine functional diversity among members (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Annexin VII and XI both have large, hydrophobic, structurally related N-terminal regions very rich in glycine, tyrosine, and proline residues (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Annexin I was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in A-431 cells by the EGF-R in this laboratory (11Fava R.A. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin II was detected in cells transformed by pp60 src (23Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, serine phosphorylation has also been reported for a number of annexins. Despite these findings, the physiological role of phosphorylation of annexins (as well as of annexins themselves) is still largely unknown. Tyrosine phosphorylation may modulate one or more of the proposed physiological functions for this class of proteins.Annexin VII (also known as synexin) has previously been shown to occur in two isoforms: one full-length with a molecular mass of 51-kDa and one lacking exon 6 with molecular mass of 47-kDa. In our studies, only the 47-kDa isoform was observed.

Wilde and Brodsky (5Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J.

Phosphorylation of ezrin appears to be critical for its cellular distribution by the unmasking of actin-binding sites (34Vaheri A. Carpén O. Heiska L. Helander T.S. Jääskeläinen T.

Recently, tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin on Y353 has been shown to be involved in cell survival by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (33Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated ezrin (Y353) was reported to interact with an SH2 domain on the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and thereby protect against apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. When Y353 in ezrin was mutated to F, cells underwent apoptosis (33Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Our ability to isolate annexin VII and XI as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following the administration of peroxovanadate to dog indicates that there must be a kinase(s) that phosphorylates these proteins and a phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylates them. Since annexin VII and XI had not previously been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated in any cell system and we could detect both proteins in rat VSMC, we examined possible physiological stimuli that might induce their tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells.Using rat VSMC we were able to show enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin VII and XI in response to a physiological stimulus, PDGF-BB (Fig. 6). Furthermore, as might be expected, peroxovanadate increased the response to PDGF (Fig. 6). Presumably, the results with the mixture of PDGF-BB and peroxovanadate duplicate those in peroxovanadate-treated dog in which endogenous ligands are constitutively present. In support of these findings, in vitro kinase assays showed that PDGF-R, CADTK/Pyk-2, Src kinase, and EGF-R were able to phosphorylate the annexins (Fig. 7). Both CADTK/Pyk-2 and Src kinases are downstream of the PDGF-R and are activated by PDGF (37Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. Herman B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, CADTK/Pyk-2 is associated with the cytoskeleton and has been shown to be important for tyrosine kinase signaling in VSMC in response to PDGF (37Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A.

Our results using a mixture of annexin VII and XI alone indicate that a trace of phosphotyrosine was present in the annexins as isolated. However, ATP was required for the appearance of phosphotyrosine following incubation of substrate with kinase (Fig.7).Finally, as can be concluded from data presented in Figs. 2 and 4, there are many other, as yet unidentified, phosphotyrosine proteins in our screen, a few of which may be the same as those previously identified in the mouse (2Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given the number of known substrates for tyrosine kinases, it is surprising to us that of the first four major proteins identified in our screen, two had not previously been identified as tyrosine phosphorylated, again suggesting that many more phosphotyrosine-containing proteins remain to be identified. In the present study we have identified in the liver and kidney of peroxovanadate-treated dogs four tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Two of these proteins, annexin XI and annexin VII, have not previously been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in any model system and the other two, clathrin and ezrin, have not been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in the intact animal, although they have been detected in specialized cell systems (3Gould K.L. Cooper J.A. Bretscher A. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Martin-Perez J. Bar-Zvi D. Branton D. Erikson R.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Annexin VII and XI are related members of a family of homologous proteins that bind negatively charged phospholipids in the presence of calcium. The proposed physiological functions of the annexins include phospholipase A2 inhibition, exocytosis, membrane trafficking and binding, ion channel activity, and signaling. Although the proposed functions are diverse, they are all related to the phospholipid/membrane binding properties of the proteins. Annexins are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types of eukaryotes (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Family members contain conserved C-terminal domains with conserved repeats of 70 amino acids each of which forms the “endonexin-fold”-domain responsible for Ca2+ and phospholipid binding. The N-terminal domains are considered unique among annexins since they vary in sequence and length and presumably determine functional diversity among members (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 22Benz J. Hofmann A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). Like eps 8 and eps 15, annexin VII and XI are tyrosine phosphorylated, but contain neither SH2 nor phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Annexin VII and XI both have large, hydrophobic, structurally related N-terminal regions very rich in glycine, tyrosine, and proline residues (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The only annexins previously shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated are annexin I and II (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Annexin I was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in A-431 cells by the EGF-R in this laboratory (11Fava R.A. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2636-2645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin II was detected in cells transformed by pp60 src (23Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 150: 301-322Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, serine phosphorylation has also been reported for a number of annexins. Despite these findings, the physiological role of phosphorylation of annexins (as well as of annexins themselves) is still largely unknown. Tyrosine phosphorylation may modulate one or more of the proposed physiological functions for this class of proteins. Annexin VII (also known as synexin) has previously been shown to occur in two isoforms: one full-length with a molecular mass of 51-kDa and one lacking exon 6 with molecular mass of 47-kDa. In our studies, only the 47-kDa isoform was observed. Annexin VII has been reported to be involved in ion channel activity, membrane fusion, aggregation, secretion, and Ca2+/GTP-regulated exocytosis (20Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 24Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B.

These mutations are very heterogeneous, ranging from a single point mutation to a large deletion in the open reading frame. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the functional defect of these mutants, we examined the biochemical properties of 14 hyper-IgM-related CD154 mutant proteins produced by transient expression in COS7 cells. We show that deletion mutants lacking a significant portion of the tumor necrosis factor homologous domain cannot be stably produced. In contrast, point mutants can be detected as oligomers. Surprisingly, gene products of two point mutants, Thr-211 → Asp and Met-36 → Arg, can bind to the receptor, CD40. For Thr-211 → Asp variant, it is comparable to the wild-type protein in its surface expression level, biochemical structure, and functional activities. Thus, it appears that this mutation is a polymorphism of CD154 gene. For Met-36 → Arg variant, although it is interactive with CD40, it has a much lower surface expression level than wild-type protein. We propose that Met-36 → Arg mutant represents a prototype of a defective CD154 family whose low cell surface expression of intrinsically active protein is simply insufficient to trigger productive signals through CD40.

Several possibilities exist ranging from effects on folding or expression to subtle structural alterations that are sufficient to compromise the receptor binding activity of the mutant proteins. The ability to distinguish these possibilities for each of these point mutants is critical in the analysis of the receptor binding site(s) on CD154. Indeed, up to 20 point mutants identified in hyper-IgM patients were previously categorized into three classes based on the structural information from x-ray crystallography of CD154 (14Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and on the TNF-β-based modeling of CD154 (33Bajorath J. Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on this categorization, class I and class II mutations, affecting the packing of core regions in monomers and the intersubunit interactions within trimers, respectively, were predicted to fail in the assembly of CD154 trimers. Class III mutations were thought to result in trimers that are properly assembled but are incapable of interacting with CD40 (33Bajorath J. Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism for functional defect in CD154 mutants, we expressed 14 hyper-IgM-related CD154 mutants, including 9 point mutants from the three classes categorized previously (33Bajorath J. Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in the COS7 cells and analyzed the biochemical properties of these proteins with respect to the following two questions: first, can these mutant proteins be produced and assembled into oligomers; and second, can these mutant proteins interact with the receptor, CD40? Here we show that at least three different mechanisms account for lack of function of these mutants. The data provide further insights into how the genetic defects associated with hyper-IgM syndrome translate into functional defects. The BJAB, a human B cell line, was a gift from Dr. George Masialos (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The human B lymphocyte line, 2G6, was obtained from Drs. Seth Lederman and Len Chess (Columbia University, New York, NY). BJAB and 2G6 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine. TRAP1 antibody was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Procedures for engineering, producing, and purifying CD40-Fc fusion protein, humanized 5c8, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies, rabbit anti-peptide antisera, Rb779 and Rb784, were described previously (13Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We constructed a pUC-derived plasmid carrying the full-length human CD154 cDNA flanked by minimal 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences. Mutants of CD154 were made by unique site elimination mutagenesis of the wild-type CD154 plasmid template using a kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In designing the mutagenic primers, if a desired mutation did not produce a restriction site change, a silent mutation producing a restriction site change was introduced into an adjacent codon to facilitate identification of mutant clones following mutagenesis. To avoid aberrant codon usage, substituted codons were selected from those occurring at least once elsewhere in CD154 cDNA. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing through restriction fragment analysis of the cDNA. Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were subcloned or reconstructed from restriction fragments with confirmed sequence into a unique NotI site in a cytomegalovirus, immediate early promoter-driven, expression vector containing an SV40 origin for amplification in COS7 cells. Presence of the introduced restriction site change was reconfirmed in the expression vector for each CD154 mutant. COS7 cells were transfected with supercoiled plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacture's procedure. Plasmid DNA lacking the CD154 gene was used as a negative control, and a vector containing wild-type CD154 was used as a positive control in all experiments. Expression of CD154 and its variants were analyzed on transfected cells harvested 72 h after transfection. Metabolic labeling, biotinylation of cell surface proteins, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting analysis were performed using procedures described previously (13Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were collected 72 h after transfection by scraping with a rubber policeman and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was suspended in homogenization buffer (1 mmEGTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8), and homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). Large debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 5 min in an SA600 centrifuge. Membranes were recovered from low speed supernatant by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h in an SW41Ti rotor. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, layered on the top of an 8%/35% sucrose step gradient in homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 1 h. Membrane fractions residing at the 8%/35% interface of the sucrose gradient were collected, diluted with two volumes of homogenization buffer, and pelleted at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS, pH 7.2, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Approximately 2 × 106 2G6 cells in 0.3 ml of culture medium were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with membrane preparations from transiently transfected COS7 cells. The 2G6 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1300 × g, resuspended in 0.4 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were then lysed in a Dounce homogenizer and the nuclei recovered by centrifugation at 6,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a table-top Eppendorf centrifuge. Nuclear proteins were extracted from the pellet by incubating them on ice with three volumes of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA. Particulates were removed by centrifugation at 6,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted with three volumes of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40. NFκB activity was detected by incubating the nuclear extracts with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe which contains two tandem repeats of NFkB binding site from HIV-1 long terminal repeat enhancer (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) and were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The protein-nucleotide complexes were resolved on a 2–15% precast Daiichi PAGE that had been pre-run for 30 min using 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mmsodium borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Membrane preparations from transfected COS7 cells were sterilized with UV light for 30 min prior to use in the assay. BJAB cells at 5 × 105 cells/ml were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with membrane preparations containing wild-type or variants of CD154. Cells were pelleted and washed with FACS buffer (1% fetal bovine serum with 1% sodium azide in PBS, pH 7.2) and resuspended in 200 μl of FACS buffer.

Crystals of the CD154 mutant T211D were grown in similar conditions and are isomorphous to those of the wild-type protein (14Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D.

X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.95-Å resolution at −165 °C with an R-AXIS II detector (Molecular Structure Corp., Woodlands, TX). The data were processed with BioteX software (Molecular Structure Corp.), resulting in a reduced data set of 10,698 reflections with an R-merge of 6.2%. To investigate the biochemical properties of wild-type and hyper-IgM variants of CD154, cDNAs encoding these proteins were engineered and transiently transfected into COS7 cells. The resulting protein products were analyzed using four reagents specific for CD154: a CD40-Fc fusion protein; an anti-CD154 mAb, 5c8; a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against an N-terminal peptide (residues 1–15) from CD154, Rb784; and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide (residues 247–261) from CD154, Rb779.

The Rb784 recognizes specifically the N-terminal 15 amino acid peptide (13Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the Rb779 specifically recognizes the C-terminal peptide of CD154. 2Y.-M. Hsu, unpublished result. In this manner, the CD40-Fc fusion protein and 5c8 mAb provide readouts for functionally assembled CD154, whereas the anti-peptide antibodies provide non-function-based detection of protein products. Fourteen CD154 mutants associated with hyper-IgM syndrome were investigated in these studies (Fig. 1). Among these, four are deletion mutants, and eight are point mutants including one double point mutant (S128R/E129G) from which two separate constructs, each containing S128R or E129G, were generated to dissect the contribution from each mutated residue. COS7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the CD154 variants, metabolically labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, and subjected to immunoprecipitation studies. SDS-PAGE analysis of these immunoprecipitates are shown in Fig.2. CD40-Fc, 5c8, Rb784, and Rb779 recognize the wild-type CD154 protein as shown in lane 2 of panels A, B,C, and D, respectively. Consistent with what we described previously (13Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated CD154 contains the full-length 33-kDa protein (p33) and the 31-kDa protein (p31). We also generated a CD154 variant in which the N-terminal 22 amino acids (cytoplasmic domain) were deleted. Lane 3 shows this protein, co-migrating with p31, is recognized by CD40-Fc (panel A), 5c8 (panel B), and anti-C-terminal peptide antiserum, Rb779 (panel D), but not the anti-N-terminal peptide antiserum, Rb784 (panel C). These results are consistent with our previous observation that at least some CD154 is made of heterotrimers containing the full-length p33 protein and the p31 protein, which lacks the cytoplasmic domain. In addition, the intensities of p33 and p31 are slightly less in CD40-Fc and 5c8 immunoprecipitates than those in Rb779 and Rb784 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that not all CD154 protein molecules were fully assembled as trimers.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled CD154 variants. Cell lysates prepared from35S-metabolically labeled transfected COS7 cells were immunoprecipitated with CD40-Fc (A), 5c8 (B), rabbit anti-C-terminal peptide antiserum, Rb779 (C), and rabbit anti-N-terminal peptide antiserum, Rb784 (D). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by a 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Lane designations reflect construct numbers 1–17 as defined in Table I. M is for molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the 14 mutants examined (Fig. 2, lanes 4–17), W140Amber (lane 9), 136Δ(8) (lane 11), and 136Δ(10) (lane 15) showed no detectable protein in any of the immunoprecipitates. Since these three mutations should result in early termination in the N-terminal region of the TNFH domain, we anticipated that 5c8, CD40-Fc, and Rb779 immunoprecipitates would be negative. However, the fact that the expected protein products were not found in Rb784 immunoprecipitates suggests that either these truncated products are not expressed at all or, more likely, they fail to assemble into trimeric forms and undergo prompt proteolysis. It is interesting that the deletion mutant, Δ116–136, missing 21 amino acids from the N-terminal portion of the TNFH domain, is stably produced, as evidenced by its detection by both anti-peptide antisera (lanes 8, panels C and D). Based on the x-ray structure of CD154 (14Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), this region (Gly-116–Ser-136) corresponds to the first half of the AA“ loop of the TNF homologous domain and one would predict that this protein cannot form trimers and therefore would not be stable. Interestingly, both Rb779 and Rb784 immunoprecipitates of this variant contain two proteins, with approximately 2-kDa difference in their apparent molecular weights, whose relative abundance is similar to that of the p33 and p31 observed in the heterotrimeric wild-type protein. Thus, it appears that the Δ116–136 variant is assembled and post-translationally processed as heterotrimers like the wild-type protein. These results show that protein products of deletion mutants lacking a majority of the TNF homologous domain cannot be detected, while the variant with a modest deletion within the TNF homologous domain, up to 21 amino acid residues, can be produced, assembled, and processed like the wild-type protein. Protein products of 10 point mutants tested were readily detected by both Rb784 and Rb779 showing that these variants are stably produced (Fig. 2, panels C and D,lanes 4–7, 10, 12–14,16, and 17; see TableI for identity of mutations). Except for two variants (see below), all of these point mutants failed to interact with CD40-Fc fusion protein indicating that they are functionally inactive (Fig. 2, panels A and B). Since these mutants exhibit the wild-type heterotrimeric p33-p31 pattern and since Rb784 immunoprecipitates also contain the p31 protein (which lacks the N-terminal peptide recognized by Rb784), this result suggests that these variants also form oligomeric structures.Table ISummary of protein expression data for CD154 variants shown in Fig. 2MutationsTotal AACD40-Fc5c8Anti-NAnti-C1Mock−−−−−2Wild-type261++++3Cyt(−)239++−+4A235P261−−++5G227V261−−++6E129G261−−++7L155P261−−++8Δ116–136240−−++9W140Amber139−−−−10W140G261−−++11136Δ(8)138−−−−12A123E261−−++13T211D261++++14M36R261++++15136Δ(10)144−−−−16S128R261−−++17S128R/E129G261−−++Numbers in the first column reflect lane designations from Fig. 2.

Chinese hamster ovary N-methyl-d-glucamine protein phosphatase physiological salts solution 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid The Na+/Ca2+ exchange system is the primary Ca2+ efflux mechanism in cardiac myocytes and plays a crucial role in regulating the cellular Ca2+ content and the force of myocardial contraction (see reviews in Refs. 1Hryshko L.V.

The Ca2+-dependent process is thought to involve the binding of Ca2+ to regulatory sites within the central hydrophilic domain of the exchanger (4Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O.

Physiol. 1979; 73: 91-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but the mechanism underlying the ATP-dependent regulatory process has been less clearly defined. Investigations of exchange currents in excised sarcolemmal patches indicate that the effects of ATP in this experimental system are mediated by synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (7Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 8Hilgemann D.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 193-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), rather than protein kinase activity (9Collins A. Somlyo A.V. Hilgemann D.W. J. Physiol. 1992; 454: 27-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, evidence from several different laboratories supports the view that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation process. The large body of information favoring a phosphorylation mechanism in squid giant axons has recently been reviewed (10DiPolo R. Beaugé L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the exchangers of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, direct evidence for phosphorylation of the exchange protein and a modest stimulation of exchange activity during protein kinase C activation have been reported (11Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Shigekawa M. Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Studies with rat astrocytes, neurons, and the Xenopus expression system suggest that protein kinase A stimulates the activity of certain exchanger isoforms but not others (13He S. Ruknudin A. Bambrick L.L. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the stimulation of exchange activity described in these studies, inhibition of exchange activity was reported upon activation of protein kinases A and C in bovine chromaffin cells (14Lin L.F. Kao L.S. Westhead E.W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1941-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and human mesangial cells (15Mene P. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. Exp. Nephrol. 1993; 1: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously reported that ATP depletion partially inhibits Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1cells expressing the bovine cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (16Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9137-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A phosphorylation mechanism did not appear to be involved, because inhibitors or activators of various protein kinases did not affect Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in these cells, and phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated exchange protein was not detectable. As part of these studies, we reported that okadaic acid and calyculin A, potent inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, had no effect on exchange-mediated45Ca2+ fluxes when the inhibitors were added directly to the assay medium. In the present report, we reinvestigated the effects of these agents to determine whether exposing the cells to the inhibitors for longer incubation periods would reveal an acceleration of exchange activity through a phosphorylation-dependent process. Instead, we found that calyculin A and okadaic acid strongly inhibited the Ca2+influx (reverse) mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Curiously, these treatments had little or no effect on the Ca2+ efflux (forward) mode of exchange. The mechanism involved is uncertain, but it does not appear to entail phosphorylation of the exchanger itself. CHO cells expressing Na+/Ca2+exchange activity (CK1.4 cells) were prepared by transfecting the cells (CCL 61; American Type Culture Collection) with the expression vector pcDNA I/Neo (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) containing a cDNA insert coding for the bovine cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (17Aceto J.F.

CK138 cells were transfected with a deletion mutant of the exchanger, Δ(241–680), missing 440 out of the 520 amino acids of the central hydrophilic domain of the exchanger, as described (16Condrescu M.

Na-PSS contained 140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm Mops, adjusted to pH 7.4 (37 °C) with Tris. K-PSS and NMDG-PSS had the same composition as Na-PSS except that NaCl was replaced with KCl (total concentration, 140 mm) or NMDG. Na- and K-PSS were mixed to yield the Na+ and K+ concentrations specified as 20/120, 28/112, or 40/100 Na/K-PSS. Fura-2-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Calyculin A and okadaic acid were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). All other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. These assays were conducted essentially as previously described (16Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9137-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture medium was removed from cells grown in 24-well fibronectin-coated plastic dishes and replaced with 1 ml of nominally Ca2+-free Na-PSS containing 0.4 mm ouabain. For calyculin-treated cells, calyculin A (100 nm) was added to the preincubation medium after 20 min. After 30 min of incubation at 37° C, the medium in each well was replaced with 0.2 ml of 40/100 Na/K-PSS containing 1 mm45CaCl2 (37 °C). After the desired interval, the cells were washed four times with termination fluid consisting of 100 mm MgCl2 + 10 mmLaCl3 + 5 mm Mops/Tris, pH 7.4. The radioactivity was solubilized in 0.1 n HNO3, counted in a scintillation counter, and normalized to the amount of protein in the wells. For the 45Ca2+ efflux assay, ouabain-treated cells were loaded with45Ca2+ by reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange in 40/100 Na/K-PSS as described above with or without 100 nm calyculin A present. After the 10-min loading period, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of either Na-PSS or NMDG-PSS, and the reaction was terminated after various intervals as described above. The Ba2+ influx assay for Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity is fully described in Ref. 21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. Cells were grown to confluence in 75-cm2culture flasks, washed three times with Na-PSS, and incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with Na-PSS containing 5 mm EDTA to detach cells from the flask. The suspended cells were centrifuged at 700 × g for 1 min, resuspended in Na-PSS + 1 mmCaCl2, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 4–5 ml of Na-PSS + 1 mm CaCl2 containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were divided into 300-μl aliquots and incubated for 30 min with 3 μm fura-2-AM and 0.25 mmsulfinpyrazone (to retard transport of fura-2 out of the cells). The fura-2 and sulfinpyrazone were added as 1000-fold concentrated stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. After the 30-min loading period, the cells were centrifuged for several seconds in an Eppendorf mini-centrifuge, washed, and preincubated for 5 min in 100 μl of Na-PSS + 1 mm CaCl2 or with other additions and conditions as indicated in individual experiments. These cells were then added directly to fluorescence cuvettes containing 3 ml of 20/120 Na/K-PSS + 0.3 mm EGTA. Gramicidin (2 μg/ml) was added to the cuvettes to equilibrate transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients. After monitoring fura-2 fluorescence for 30 s, 1 mmBaCl2 (30 μl of 0.1 m stock solution) was added to the cuvette, and fura-2 fluorescence was monitored for an additional 220 or 270 s, as indicated for individual experiments. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at 510 nm with alternate excitation at 350 and 390 nm using a Photon Technology International RF-M 2001 fluorometer (South Brunswick, NJ); data points were obtained at 1.8-s intervals. All fluorescence values were corrected for autofluorescence using cells that had not been loaded with fura-2. Data are presented as the ratio of fluorescence for excitation at 350/390 nm and represent the mean values (± S.E.; error bars shown in figures) for the number of experiments (n) indicated in the figure legends. To measure Ca2+ efflux activity, the cells were placed in cuvettes containing either Na- or K-PSS + 0.3 mm EGTA. Ca2+ release from internal stores was initiated by adding ionomycin (0.6 μl; 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide), and fura-2 fluorescence was monitored at the excitation wavelengths appropriate for Ca2+ (340 and 380 nm). Dimethyl sulfoxide alone at the concentrations used had no effect on Ca2+release. The difference in the amplitude and duration of the ionomycin-induced [Ca2+] i transient in K-PSSversus Na-PSS was taken as an indication of exchange-mediated Ca2+ efflux activity (22Chernaya G. Vazquez M. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5378-5385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To measure Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, CK1.4 cells were pretreated with ouabain for 30 min in Na-PSS to elevate the cytosolic Na+ concentration and then placed in a low [Na+] medium (40/100 Na/K-PSS) containing 1 mm45CaCl2. As shown in Fig.1 A, 45Ca2+ uptake was diminished by 55–75% when the cells were treated with 50 nm calyculin A for the final 10 min of the preincubation period. A 5–10-min exposure to calyculin A was necessary to elicit this inhibitory effect. As previously reported (16Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9137-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), calyculin A did not inhibit 45Ca2+ uptake when added to the assay medium without preincubation, and it had no effect on 45Ca2+ uptake in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles (data not shown). Thus, calyculin A does not directly act on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger but presumably modulates its activity through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. The nonselective protein kinase inhibitor K252a (1 μm) offered partial protection against the inhibitory effects of calyculin A when included in the preincubation medium (Fig. 1). In the absence of calyculin, K252a had no effect on 45Ca2+ uptake (data not shown). A related broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (1 μm), also protected against inhibition by calyculin A (data not shown). Other protein kinase inhibitors were tested but were found not to protect against the effects of calyculin. These included 1 μm KN-62 (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase), 200 μmgenistein (tyrosine kinases), 0.5 μm calphostin C (protein kinase C), 10 μm H-89 (protein kinase A), and another relatively nonselective inhibitor, 50 μm H-7. When calyculin-treated cells were subsequently incubated in a calyculin-free medium for an additional 10 min, the rates of45Ca2+ uptake continued to decline. Including K252a in the calyculin-free medium enhanced recovery, but the rates of45Ca2+ uptake remained less than 40% of untreated controls (data not shown). The Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein contains 11 transmembrane segments with a cytosolically disposed hydrophilic domain of 520 amino acids residing between the 5th and 6th transmembrane segments (1Hryshko L.V. Philipson K.D. Basic. Res. Cardiol. 1997; 92: 45-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Reeves J.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic domain is thought to be essential for regulation of activity, because its elimination by chymotrypsin treatment or site-directed mutagenesis abrogates normal regulatory behavior (19Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing a mutant exchanger in which 440 residues from this domain have been deleted (CK138 cells) were treated with calyculin A and assayed for 45Ca2+ uptake by reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange. As shown in Fig.1 B, calyculin A inhibited 45Ca2+uptake by 40–65% in these cells. As with the CK1.4 cells, inhibition by calyculin A was partially alleviated by K252a. We conclude that the effects of calyculin A are not mediated by phosphorylation of residues within the deleted segment of this mutant. Although phosphorylation of one or more of the residual serine or threonine residues remains a possible mechanism for these effects, this seems implausible due to the absence of normal regulatory behavior in this mutant. The concentration dependence for inhibition of the initial rate of45Ca2+ uptake by calyculin A is shown in Fig.2. Maximal inhibition (64 ± 4%) was observed at 100 nm, and the half-maximally effective concentration was approximately 15 nm. Longer incubation periods with 100 nm calyculin did not increase the degree of inhibition. 45Ca2+ entering the cells by reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange is accumulated by intracellular organelles, especially mitochondria. Thus, the inhibition of 45Ca2+ uptake observed with calyculin A might have involved a reduction in organellar Ca2+sequestration rather than an inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. To examine this possibility, we measured the exchange-mediated influx of Ba2+ in fura-2-loaded cells treated with 2 μg/ml gramicidin as described in Ref. 21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. The presence of gramicidin, a channel-forming monovalent cation ionophore, eliminates transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients and provides a continuous supply of cytosolic Na+ for the activation of exchange activity (21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of CK1.4 cells or CK138 cells for 5 min with 100 nm calyculin A markedly inhibited the initial rate of Ba2+ influx in both cell types. Because Ba2+ is not accumulated by the endoplasmic reticulum in these cells and does not appear to be extensively accumulated by mitochondria (21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we conclude that the effects of calyculin A reflect the inhibition of exchange activity itself rather than an impairment of organellar Ca2+ sequestration. The residual rate of Ba2+ influx in the calyculin-treated CK138 cells was greater (p < 0.025) than for the calyculin-treated CK1.4 cells (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, the degree of inhibition by calyculin A for the CK138 cells (44 ± 4.6%) was significantly less than for the CK1.4 cells (74 ± 2.4%; p < 10−5). Thus, the effects of calyculin A are less pronounced for the mutant than for the wild-type exchanger. A similar pattern was evident in the45Ca2+ uptake studies (Fig. 1). We conclude that the hydrophilic domain of the exchanger mediates a portion of the inhibitory effects of protein phosphatase blockade but that substantial inhibition was still observed even in the absence of most of the hydrophilic domain. When CK1.4 cells were treated with okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor with greater potency toward PP-2A than PP-1, we found that exchange-mediated Ba2+ influx was nearly completely blocked (87 ± 2.3% inhibition of initial rate) (Fig.4, A and C). Incubations of 60 min with okadaic acid were required to observe this inhibition, consistent with a slow entry of this inhibitor into cells (24Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 25Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Under identical conditions, okadaic acid methyl ester, an inactive analog of okadaic acid, had no effect on Ba2+influx (Fig. 4 D). The okadaic acid treatment inhibited the initial rate of Ba2+ influx in CK138 cells by 65 ± 3.4% (Fig. 4 B). Although the percentage of inhibition was less than for the CK1.4 cells, the rates of Ba2+ uptake after okadaic acid treatment for both cell types were similar to those seen for passive Ba2+ leakage into the cell in the absence of exchange activity (21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the values given must be seen as lower limits for the percentage of inhibition of exchange activity by okadaic acid. Tautomycin (1 μm), a third protein phosphatase inhibitor with reduced affinity for PP-2A compared with PP-1, had no effect on Ba2+ influx after either a 5- or a 60-min preincubation (Fig. 4 D). The results suggest that the effects of calyculin A and okadaic acid are mediated by blockade of protein phosphatase 2A (see under “Discussion”). Other experiments demonstrated that K252a, as in the experiments with calyculin A, partially protected against inhibition of Ba2+influx by okadaic acid (data not shown). We were unable to mimic the effects of the protein phosphatase inhibitors on Ba2+influx by incubating the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 μm, 5 min), dibutyryl cAMP (1 mm, 5 or 60 min) or 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mm, 5 or 60 min). To determine whether the inhibition of Ba2+ entry could be overcome by increasing the cytosolic Na+ concentration, we carried out the experiment shown in Fig.5. CK1.4 cells were preincubated for 5 min with 2 μg/ml gramicidin in either Na-PSS or 28/112 Na/K-PSS, with or without 100 nm calyculin A. Under these preincubation conditions, the cytosol was loaded with either a high concentration (∼140 mm) or a low concentration (∼28 mm) of Na+ due to the presence of the monovalent cation ionophore gramicidin; the K m for activation of exchange activity by cytosolic Na+ is 18–28 mm(19Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 26Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cells were then diluted into K-PSS, and 1 mmBa2+ was added after 30 s. As expected, the cells with high cytosolic Na+ (Fig. 5 A) showed a greater rate and extent of Ba2+ uptake than cells with low cytosolic Na+ (Fig. 5 B). Calyculin A treatment inhibited the initial rates of Ba2+ influx by 57 ± 3.6 versus 68 ± 3.3% at 140 and 28 mmNa+, respectively (Fig. 5 C). The difference in the two values (p < 0.05) is quite small and suggests that calyculin A did not markedly affect the affinity of the exchanger for Na+. In other experiments (data not shown), Ba2+ influx was inhibited to the same extent by calyculin A at Ba2+ concentrations of 1 mm and 5 mm; the K m for external Ba2+uptake by Na+/Ca2+ exchange in these cells is 3 mm (21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results indicate that calyculin A inhibition is characterized by a reduction in the V max for exchange activity, rather than changes in the affinity of the exchanger for the transported ions. We expected the protein phosphatase inhibitors to reduce the Ca2+ efflux mode of exchange activity to a similar extent as for the Ca2+ influx mode. Surprisingly, this was not the case. We adopted three different protocols to assess Ca2+efflux mediated by Na+/Ca2+ exchange. In the first approach, ouabain-treated CK1.4 cells were loaded with45Ca2+ by a 10 min incubation in 40/100 Na/K-PSS containing 1 mm45CaCl2, with or without 100 nm calyculin A. The medium was then replaced with either NMDG-PSS or Na-PSS, and the rate of loss of45Ca2+ from the cells was monitored. As shown in Fig. 6, 45Ca2+efflux was more rapid in Na-PSS than in NMDG-PSS, presumably reflecting the acceleration of Ca2+ efflux by Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Remarkably, calyculin A had no effect on Na+-dependent45Ca2+ efflux. In other experiments, the cells were treated with calyculin A in Na-PSS for 10 min before beginning the 10 min 45Ca2+ loading period in 40/100 Na/K-PSS. Although the initial level of 45Ca2+uptake was lower under these conditions than in Fig. 6, the results were essentially the same; i.e. the presence of Na+ stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux, indicating that exchange activity had not been blocked by the calyculin A treatment (data not shown). Another approach to measuring Ca2+ efflux was to assess the effect of extracellular Na+ on the [Ca2+] i transient elicited by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, which releases Ca2+from intracellular stores. For the data shown in Fig.7, A and B,ionomycin (2 μm) was added to suspensions of CK1.4 cells that had been preincubated for 5 min with or without 100 nmcalyculin A. The suspension medium was either Na-PSS + 0.3 mm EGTA or K-PSS + 0.3 mm EGTA, as indicated in the figures. As shown for untreated cells in Fig. 7 A, the [Ca2+] i transient was reduced in amplitude and shorter in duration in Na-PSS compared with K-PSS, a result that reflects the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in mediating Ca2+ efflux (22Chernaya G. Vazquez M. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5378-5385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Half-times for the decline in [Ca2+] i from the peak value were 8.5 and 16 s in Na- and K-PSS, respectively, as determined from first-order plots of the data (see legend to Fig. 7 for details.) With calyculin-treated cells (Fig. 7 B), the half-times were 13 and 26 s in Na- and K-PSS, respectively, indicating that calyculin A prolonged the [Ca2+] i transient in both Na- and K-PSS. The reasons for this behavior are not known. As discussed in detail elsewhere (23Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the time course of the Ca2+ transient reflects a complex interplay between the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores, rates of Ca2+ efflux from the cell, and the time dependence of Ca2+ release from internal stores, which occurs over several tens of seconds in these cells. Calyculin treatment could have affected any of these contributing processes. We assumed that the rate constant for the decline in [Ca2+] i in Na-PSS was the sum of the Na-dependent component (due to Na+/Ca2+ exchange) and the Na-independent component, as measured in K-PSS. Subtracting the rate constants in K-PSS from those obtained in Na-PSS (cf. legend to Fig. 7), the Na+-dependent component was found to be reduced by 37% in the calyculin-treated cells. Although this value suggests that exchange activity may have been inhibited by the calyculin A treatment, the results with okadaic acid do not support such a conclusion, as discussed below. The ionomycin-induced [Ca2+] i transients for untreated cells and cells incubated for 60 min with 1 μmokadaic acid are shown in Fig. 7, C and D. The half-times for the decline in [Ca2+] i in untreated cells (Fig. 7 C) were 14 and 18 s in Na- and K-PSS, respectively. With the batch of cells used for this experiment, the effect of Na+ was somewhat reduced compared with the results described for the cells in Fig. 7 A. For cells treated with okadaic acid (Fig. 7 D), the corresponding half-times were 26 and 46 s. In this case, the Na+-dependent component was not reduced butincreased by 16% following the okadaic acid treatment, suggesting that there was no impairment of exchange activity. This analysis must be viewed cautiously because the Na-dependent component of the decline in [Ca2+] i provides only a rough estimate of exchange activity. As discussed elsewhere (23Fang Y. Condrescu M. Reeves J.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release is not instantaneous in these cells but appears to continue at a declining rate over several tens of seconds. Thus, the duration of the [Ca2+] i transient will be determined to a significant degree by the underlying rate of Ca2+ release. Both calyculin A and okadaic acid induce major cytoskeletal alterations (cf. “Discussion”), which could influence the quantity of stored Ca2+ and/or the rate of Ca2+ release. These factors make it difficult to quantitate exchange activity with certainty in these experiments. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that the exchanger remains capable of carrying out Ca2+ efflux following treatment with the phosphatase inhibitors. The results with okadaic acid are especially noteworthy because this agent almost completely abrogated exchange-mediated Ba2+ influx (cf. Fig. 4) but did not appear to markedly impair Ca2+ efflux. A final index of exchange-mediated Ca2+ efflux is shown in Fig. 8. In this ex"

Arum maculatum, Colocasia esculenta, Xanthosoma sagittifolium, and Dieffenbachia sequina. Based on their molecular structure, taxonomic relationship, and high sequence homology to the aforementioned mannose-binding lectins, they clearly belong to the monocot mannose-binding lectin superfamily. However, compared with the other members of the superfamily, these lectins exhibit either very weak or no affinity for d-mannose, whereas they bind with great avidity to asialoglycoproteins. Therefore, a detailed investigation of their carbohydrate-binding specificities has been undertaken.The results presented in this study reveal that one of these lectins,i.e. the lectin from X. sagittifolium(XSL),1 possesses two distinctly different types of binding sites: one type for oligomannoses and the other for complex carbohydrates, which best accommodates an asialo triantennary N-linked glycan. The knowledge obtained from this study might also shed light on the nature of the binding sites of other lectins with “complex” carbohydrate-binding specificity.DISCUSSIONAs noted above, during the last decade, an increasing number of lectins have been isolated from various monocotyledonous families such as Alliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Araceae, Liliaceae, and Orchidaceae. Data accumulated from physicochemical characterization and molecular cloning of these lectins reveal that, with the major exception of the Gramineae family, they all belong to a superfamily of monocot mannose-binding lectins with respect to their sequence homology, conserved domains, tissue occurrence, and exclusive specificity for mannose. However, recently, we isolated lectins from the tubers of several Araceae species, viz. A. maculatum,C. esculenta, X. sagittifolium, and D. sequina, and observed that in contrast to our previous findings, these monocot lectins are barely inhibited by mannose, whereas they strongly react with asialoglycoproteins (11Van Damme E.J.M. Goossens K. Smeets K. Van Leuven F. Verhaert P. Peumans W.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 107: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, Shangaryet al. (13Shangary S. Singh J. Kamboj S.S. Kamboj K.K. Sandhu R.S. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1995; 40: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of four monocot lectins from the family Araceae, viz. Arisaema consanguineum, Arisaema curvatum, Sauromatum guttatum, and Gonatanthus pumilus; they made the same observations. This discrepancy with other monocot lectins prompted us to make a detailed investigation into the carbohydrate-binding properties of these lectins. X. sagittifolium (also known as tannia, taro, cocoyam, and yautia), an edible member of the Araceae family, was chosen to pursue a detailed investigation.Inasmuch as the hemagglutination activity of the tuber extracts ofX. sagittifolium was inhibited by asialofetuin, affinity chromatography of the crude extract was performed on an asialofetuin-Sepharose column. Preliminary experiments showed that this lectin preparation gave a single low molecular mass band migrating close to the bromphenol blue dye front upon conventional SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), which had insufficient resolution in the low molecular mass range. Therefore, the Tricine/SDS-PAGE system of Schagger and von Jagow (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar), which allowed an excellent separation of small proteins, was used instead, revealing a minor impurity in this lectin preparation (data not shown). By introducing a second affinity chromatography step on immobilized invertase, taking advantage of its nine N-linked high mannose-type glycans (34Trimble R.B. Maley F. Chu F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2562-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a final purification of the lectin was achieved.The data presented in this paper indicate that theXanthosoma lectin possesses two distinctly different types of carbohydrate-combining sites: one type for oligomannoses and the other for N-linked complex carbohydrates. Since the lectin is precipitated by both mannan and asialoglycoproteins, it presumably contains at least two binding sites of each type per molecule.The oligomannose-binding site not only is exclusively specific for mannose, but also has very strict linkage specificity for terminal α1,3-linked mannosyl residues. As revealed by precipitation and inhibition assays, it reacts only with mannans and oligomannoses bearing nonreducing terminal α1,3-mannosyl groups, such as yeast mannan (S. cerevisiae) and branched tri- and pentamannoses, but not with glucans (e.g. glycogens, dextrans, etc.) and other types of mannans (such as the mutant 1B4 mannan and K. brevis mannan, both of which lack terminal α1,3-linked mannosyl residues). The oligomannose-binding site does not react with Man9GlcNAc2, which has internal α1,3-linked mannosyl residues substituted by a number of α1,2-linked mannoses. The branched mannopentaose is 5-fold more potent as an inhibitor than the branched mannotriose, suggesting there is a clustering effect, which is quite common for lectin/carbohydrate interactions.On the other hand, of a variety of native and desialylated glycoproteins and mucins tested, all those that precipitate theXanthosoma lectin bear asialo N-linked glycans, and the precipitation reactions are not inhibited by any mono-, di-, or trimannoses, suggesting that the lectin might possess yet another type of binding sites for complex N-glycans. In an effort to elucidate the structural requirements of this type of binding site, a group of oligosaccharides that represent the major components of the asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycans was prepared. By studying the effects of these complex oligosaccharides on both XSL/yeast mannan and XSL/asialoorosomucoid precipitation reactions, the following was revealed.1) The Xanthosoma lectin does possess a distinct type of extended binding site for complex N-glycans, which best accommodates a non-sialylated, triantennary carbohydrate with LacNAc (i.e. Galβ1,4GlcNAc-, such as Tri 2) or lacto-N-biose (i.e. Galβ1,3GlcNAc-, such as Tri 4) groups at its three nonreducing termini. This binding site can tolerate a substitution at the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4- branch by anl-fucose group α1,3-linked to the penultimate GlcNAc residue (as in Fuc-Tri), but not substitution by a sialic acid group (as in Tri 5) or a bisecting GlcNAc (as in Bis 2).2) The oligomannose-binding sites and the complex carbohydrate-combining sites are most likely non-overlapping,i.e. the oligomannose-binding site is not part of the complex carbohydrate-combining site. This was indicated by the fact that none of the complex carbohydrates tested is inhibitory in the XSL/yeast mannan precipitation system. On the other hand, the branched mannopentaose, which is by far the best inhibitor of the XSL/mannan precipitation system, is an extremely weak inhibitor of XSL/asialoorosomucoid precipitation, being 3 orders of magnitude less effective compared with the complex carbohydrates; it is also an order of magnitude less effective than it is against mannan precipitation.Allen (12Allen A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) characterized the lectin from A. maculatum as being inhibited (hemagglutination activity) primarily byN-acetyllactosamine, but not by lacto-N-biose. Our data (Table III) clearly indicate that in contrast to the A. maculatum lectin, glycoprotein precipitation by theXanthosoma lectin is inhibited byN-acetyllactosamine and lacto-N-biose only when they occur at the nonreducing termini of complex N-linked glycans, but not by the free disaccharides (up to 100 mm).Although the gene(s) for the Xanthosoma lectin has not yet been cloned, the conclusion that the lectin is a heterotetramer of two different subunits of nearly identical size, but with distinct N-terminal amino acid sequences, is supported by cloning and sequencing of the genes of closely related species, especially C. esculenta (11Van Damme E.J.M. Goossens K. Smeets K. Van Leuven F. Verhaert P. Peumans W.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 107: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The sequence contains an open reading frame comprising a 24-amino acid leader sequence followed by an 11-amino acid sequence identical to the X. sagittifolium lectin α-subunit N-terminal sequence; 140 residues from the initiation site is found a sequence identical to theN-terminal sequence of the β-subunit. Two clones fromA. maculatum show highly homologous, but not identical sequences similarly placed. Thus, these aroid lectins are most likely synthesized as a single 27-kDa peptide that undergoes post-translational cleavage of the 24-residue leader sequence and a second cleavage near the center into α- and β-subunits of nearly identical size, which probably remain associated and assemble into the (αβ)2-heterotetramer before or after the cleavage.We have observed that other aroid lectins, including those fromA. maculatum and C. esculenta, are also precipitated by both asialoglycoproteins and yeast mannan, 2H. Mo and I. J. Goldstein, unpublished data. suggesting that the presence of two distinct types of binding sites might be a general characteristic of the Araceae lectins. It is likely that the two types of sites reside specifically in the α- or β-subunits (or their juxtaposition) of the heterotetramer, but the relationship between the different subunits and the distinct binding sites has yet to be resolved. Lectins are (glyco)proteins of nonimmune origin that agglutinate cells and/or precipitate complex carbohydrates (1Goldstein I.J. Hughes R.C. Monsigny M. Osawa T. Sharon N.

As revealed by precipitation and inhibition assays, it reacts only with mannans and oligomannoses bearing nonreducing terminal α1,3-mannosyl groups, such as yeast mannan (S. cerevisiae) and branched tri- and pentamannoses, but not with glucans (e.g. glycogens, dextrans, etc.) and other types of mannans (such as the mutant 1B4 mannan and K. brevis mannan, both of which lack terminal α1,3-linked mannosyl residues). The oligomannose-binding site does not react with Man9GlcNAc2, which has internal α1,3-linked mannosyl residues substituted by a number of α1,2-linked mannoses. The branched mannopentaose is 5-fold more potent as an inhibitor than the branched mannotriose, suggesting there is a clustering effect, which is quite common for lectin/carbohydrate interactions.On the other hand, of a variety of native and desialylated glycoproteins and mucins tested, all those that precipitate theXanthosoma lectin bear asialo N-linked glycans, and the precipitation reactions are not inhibited by any mono-, di-, or trimannoses, suggesting that the lectin might possess yet another type of binding sites for complex N-glycans. In an effort to elucidate the structural requirements of this type of binding site, a group of oligosaccharides that represent the major components of the asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycans was prepared. By studying the effects of these complex oligosaccharides on both XSL/yeast mannan and XSL/asialoorosomucoid precipitation reactions, the following was revealed.1) The Xanthosoma lectin does possess a distinct type of extended binding site for complex N-glycans, which best accommodates a non-sialylated, triantennary carbohydrate with LacNAc (i.e. Galβ1,4GlcNAc-, such as Tri 2) or lacto-N-biose (i.e. Galβ1,3GlcNAc-, such as Tri 4) groups at its three nonreducing termini. This binding site can tolerate a substitution at the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4- branch by anl-fucose group α1,3-linked to the penultimate GlcNAc residue (as in Fuc-Tri), but not substitution by a sialic acid group (as in Tri 5) or a bisecting GlcNAc (as in Bis 2).2) The oligomannose-binding sites and the complex carbohydrate-combining sites are most likely non-overlapping,i.e. the oligomannose-binding site is not part of the complex carbohydrate-combining site. This was indicated by the fact that none of the complex carbohydrates tested is inhibitory in the XSL/yeast mannan precipitation system. On the other hand, the branched mannopentaose, which is by far the best inhibitor of the XSL/mannan precipitation system, is an extremely weak inhibitor of XSL/asialoorosomucoid precipitation, being 3 orders of magnitude less effective compared with the complex carbohydrates; it is also an order of magnitude less effective than it is against mannan precipitation.Allen (12Allen A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) characterized the lectin from A. maculatum as being inhibited (hemagglutination activity) primarily byN-acetyllactosamine, but not by lacto-N-biose. Our data (Table III) clearly indicate that in contrast to the A. maculatum lectin, glycoprotein precipitation by theXanthosoma lectin is inhibited byN-acetyllactosamine and lacto-N-biose only when they occur at the nonreducing termini of complex N-linked glycans, but not by the free disaccharides (up to 100 mm).Although the gene(s) for the Xanthosoma lectin has not yet been cloned, the conclusion that the lectin is a heterotetramer of two different subunits of nearly identical size, but with distinct N-terminal amino acid sequences, is supported by cloning and sequencing of the genes of closely related species, especially C. esculenta (11Van Damme E.J.M. Goossens K. Smeets K. Van Leuven F. Verhaert P. Peumans W.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 107: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The sequence contains an open reading frame comprising a 24-amino acid leader sequence followed by an 11-amino acid sequence identical to the X. sagittifolium lectin α-subunit N-terminal sequence; 140 residues from the initiation site is found a sequence identical to theN-terminal sequence of the β-subunit. Two clones fromA. maculatum show highly homologous, but not identical sequences similarly placed. Thus, these aroid lectins are most likely synthesized as a single 27-kDa peptide that undergoes post-translational cleavage of the 24-residue leader sequence and a second cleavage near the center into α- and β-subunits of nearly identical size, which probably remain associated and assemble into the (αβ)2-heterotetramer before or after the cleavage.We have observed that other aroid lectins, including those fromA. maculatum and C. esculenta, are also precipitated by both asialoglycoproteins and yeast mannan, 2H. Mo and I. J. Goldstein, unpublished data. suggesting that the presence of two distinct types of binding sites might be a general characteristic of the Araceae lectins. It is likely that the two types of sites reside specifically in the α- or β-subunits (or their juxtaposition) of the heterotetramer, but the relationship between the different subunits and the distinct binding sites has yet to be resolved. As noted above, during the last decade, an increasing number of lectins have been isolated from various monocotyledonous families such as Alliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Araceae, Liliaceae, and Orchidaceae. Data accumulated from physicochemical characterization and molecular cloning of these lectins reveal that, with the major exception of the Gramineae family, they all belong to a superfamily of monocot mannose-binding lectins with respect to their sequence homology, conserved domains, tissue occurrence, and exclusive specificity for mannose. However, recently, we isolated lectins from the tubers of several Araceae species, viz. A. maculatum,C. esculenta, X. sagittifolium, and D. sequina, and observed that in contrast to our previous findings, these monocot lectins are barely inhibited by mannose, whereas they strongly react with asialoglycoproteins (11Van Damme E.J.M. Goossens K. Smeets K. Van Leuven F. Verhaert P. Peumans W.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 107: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, Shangaryet al. (13Shangary S. Singh J. Kamboj S.S. Kamboj K.K. Sandhu R.S. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1995; 40: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of four monocot lectins from the family Araceae, viz. Arisaema consanguineum, Arisaema curvatum, Sauromatum guttatum, and Gonatanthus pumilus; they made the same observations. This discrepancy with other monocot lectins prompted us to make a detailed investigation into the carbohydrate-binding properties of these lectins. X. sagittifolium (also known as tannia, taro, cocoyam, and yautia), an edible member of the Araceae family, was chosen to pursue a detailed investigation. Inasmuch as the hemagglutination activity of the tuber extracts ofX. sagittifolium was inhibited by asialofetuin, affinity chromatography of the crude extract was performed on an asialofetuin-Sepharose column. Preliminary experiments showed that this lectin preparation gave a single low molecular mass band migrating close to the bromphenol blue dye front upon conventional SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), which had insufficient resolution in the low molecular mass range. Therefore, the Tricine/SDS-PAGE system of Schagger and von Jagow (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar), which allowed an excellent separation of small proteins, was used instead, revealing a minor impurity in this lectin preparation (data not shown). By introducing a second affinity chromatography step on immobilized invertase, taking advantage of its nine N-linked high mannose-type glycans (34Trimble R.B. Maley F. Chu F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2562-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a final purification of the lectin was achieved.

The oligomannose-binding site does not react with Man9GlcNAc2, which has internal α1,3-linked mannosyl residues substituted by a number of α1,2-linked mannoses. The branched mannopentaose is 5-fold more potent as an inhibitor than the branched mannotriose, suggesting there is a clustering effect, which is quite common for lectin/carbohydrate interactions.

This binding site can tolerate a substitution at the Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4- branch by anl-fucose group α1,3-linked to the penultimate GlcNAc residue (as in Fuc-Tri), but not substitution by a sialic acid group (as in Tri 5) or a bisecting GlcNAc (as in Bis 2). 2) The oligomannose-binding sites and the complex carbohydrate-combining sites are most likely non-overlapping,i.e. the oligomannose-binding site is not part of the complex carbohydrate-combining site. This was indicated by the fact that none of the complex carbohydrates tested is inhibitory in the XSL/yeast mannan precipitation system. On the other hand, the branched mannopentaose, which is by far the best inhibitor of the XSL/mannan precipitation system, is an extremely weak inhibitor of XSL/asialoorosomucoid precipitation, being 3 orders of magnitude less effective compared with the complex carbohydrates; it is also an order of magnitude less effective than it is against mannan precipitation. Allen (12Allen A.K. Biochim. Biophys.

We found that the occurrence of +1 frameshifts at a run of 6 residues of dA/dT could be increased proportionally by increasing the concentration of dATP present in thein vitro replication. Using single-stranded circular DNA containing either the coding sequence of the rpsL gene or its complementary sequence, the +1 frameshift mutagenesis by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli was extensively examined. A6 → A7frameshifts occurred 30 to 90 times more frequently during DNA synthesis with the noncoding sequence (dT tract) template than with the coding sequence (dA tract). Excess dATP enhanced the occurrence of +1 frameshifts during DNA synthesis with the dT tract template, but no other dNTPs showed such an effect. In the presence of 0.1 mm dATP, the A6 → A7 mutagenesis with the dT tract template was not inhibited by 1.5 mm dCTP, which is complementary to the residue immediately upstream of the dT tract. These results strongly suggested that the A6 → A7 frameshift mutagenesis possesses an asymmetric strand nature and that slippage errors leading to the +1 frameshift are made during chain elongation within the tract rather than by misincorporation of nucleotides opposite residues next to the tract.

E. coli DNA polymerase III single-stranded double-stranded ampicillin-resistant kanamycin-resistant streptomycin-resistant polymerase chain reaction Among the spontaneous mutations occurring in various organisms, deletions or additions of one or a few nucleotides are often observed. These sequence alterations are called frameshift mutations when they destroy a structural gene coding frame (1Ripley L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 189-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant types of spontaneous frameshifts are single-base deletions (−1 frameshifts) and single-base additions (+1 frameshifts). Because the function of target genes is abolished or severely affected by frameshift mutations, these are deleterious mutations undesirable for maintaining genetic information and survival of cells. There have been a large number of reports on frameshift mutations found in tumor suppressor genes of cancer cells as well as genes relating to genetic diseases. Therefore, molecular mechanisms of frameshift mutagenesis and its suppression are fundamental subjects in carcinogenesis and other areas of medical science. Whereas an incorrect recombination process at a run of the same nucleotide was hypothesized in the classical slippage model for frameshift mutagenesis (2Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that most spontaneous frameshifts might be caused by DNA replication errors. This is mainly because the frequency of frameshift mutations was elevated in cells lacking the capacity for mismatch repair that can correct replication errors (3Schaaper R.M. Dunn R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Bishop D.K. Andersen J. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Keen J.D. Kricker M. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2859-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, frameshift mutations were found in products of in vitro DNA synthesis with weakly processive DNA polymerases or replicative DNA polymerases that lack proofreading capacities (7Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8de Boer J.G. Ripley L.S. Genetics. 1988; 118: 181-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bebenek K. Joyce C.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18947-18953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, in some cases when in vitro andin vivo data could be directly compared, the pattern of frameshift mutations in a given target sequence differed between thein vitro and in vivo systems. Thus, there was no direct evidence that the cellular replicative apparatus made errors leading to frameshift mutations. We have recently examined errors made during DNA replication in vitro using a reconstitutedEscherichia coli replicative apparatus (11Fujii S. Akiyama M. Aoki K. Sugaya Y. Higuchi K. Hiraoka M. Miki Y. Saitoh N. Yoshiyama K. Ihara K. Seki M. Ohtsubo E. Maki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Using the same target sequence in the mutation assay, the mutations derived from replication errors in vitro were compared with mutations occurring in a mismatch repair-deficient E. coli strain. In this previous study, +1 and −1 frameshift mutations appeared to be the most frequent types of mutations derived from errors caused by the replicative apparatus of E. coli. Furthermore, the site distribution of +1 or −1 frameshifts and their relative frequencies were the same in both in vitro and in vivosystems. This implies that in vivo frameshift mutagenesis largely depends on the biochemical nature of the replicative apparatus. There were three sites within the coding region of the rpsLgene, a target sequence for our mutation assay, at which the frequency of single-base frameshifts was markedly increased relative to the rest of the sequence. These “hot spot” sites corresponded to runs of 4, 5, and 6 adenine nucleotides. About 66% of in vitro and 85% of in vivo single-base frameshifts occurred at these sites. Most of the other single-base frameshifts occurred at runs of 2 or 3 of the same nucleotide. These results clearly demonstrate the strong tendency of the replicative apparatus to make slippage errors at runs of the same nucleotide. Interestingly, the occurrence of +1 frameshifts was significantly different from that of −1 frameshifts in their dependence on the length of the runs. With an increase in run length, the frequencies of both +1 and −1 frameshifts increased. However, +1 frameshifts occurred infrequently at runs shorter than 3 nucleotides, and the frequency of +1 frameshifts was enhanced more sharply than that of −1 frameshifts at runs longer than 4 nucleotides. Therefore, +1 frameshift mutagenesis seems to occur through a mechanism somewhat different from that inducing −1 frameshifts. DNA replication errors leading to either +1 or −1 frameshifts, often called slippage error, might be expected to involve a structure in which one nucleotide residue is looped out at the mutation site. As described above, generation of the single-base loop error has been extensively studied using in vitro DNA replication with DNA polymerases other than DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. In those studies, rates of the single-base loop errors were much higher than that observed with the E. coli replicative apparatus, which catalyzes highly processive chain elongation and possesses a high proofreading capacity. Although some but not all of the polymerases showed a tendency to induce frameshifts at nucleotide runs, −1 frameshifts predominated in these previous studies, and +1 frameshifts were very rarely found even at runs longer than 4 nucleotide residues. These differences strongly suggest that the mechanisms of frameshift mutagenesis by processive and accurate DNA polymerases are different from those of less processive and more error-prone DNA polymerases. In the present study, we focused on +1 frameshift mutations within a dA6/dT6 run present in the rpsLtarget sequence. These mutations represented 44% of all frameshift mutations induced in the target sequence by DNA replication in vitro and 48% of the mutations in the same sequence recovered from mismatch repair-deficient E. coli cells. We found a strong strand asymmetry in the generation of single-base loop errors leading to +1 frameshifts within the run by Pol III1 holoenzyme, which plays a central role in the E. coli replicative apparatus. On the basis of the effects exerted on +1 frameshift mutagenesis by substrate nucleotides for in vitro DNA replication and by template nucleotides surrounding the dA6/dT6 run, biochemical nature of +1 single-base loop errors within a polynucleotide run is discussed.

To determine the number of the transformants, the cell suspension after outgrowth in SOC medium was diluted and placed on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin (for pMOL3) or ampicillin (for pMOL36, 37, 38, and 39). Four (for pMOL3) or two (for pMOL36, 37, 38, and 39) sets of appropriate dilutions of the cell suspension were made, and each was placed on a duplicate plate. Detection of cells transformed with rpsL − plasmid was carried out on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin and either 100 μg/ml kanamycin or 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The data from three or four independent dilutions were used to calculate the average number of transformants with mutant plasmids. The frequency of therpsL − mutation was calculated by dividing the number of Kmr Smr transformants by the number of Kmr transformants for pMOL3 or by dividing the number of Apr Smr transformants by the number of Apr transformants for pMOL36, 37, 38, and 39. TherpsL coding region and surrounding sequence (from position −130 to position 385) in each mutant plasmid was determined using an automated DNA sequencer (model 373A, Applied Biosystems). Each colony transformed with the rpsL − mutant plasmid was suspended in 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and boiled for 10 min. The debris was removed by centrifugation, and 1 μl of the supernatant was used for PCR. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μm primer B, and either primer C for pMOL36, 38, and 39 or primer D for pMOL37, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (TAKARA). The PCR was performed as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. 2 μl of PCR product was spotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotide hybridization was performed, using32P-labeled 17-mer-A7 as a probe, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For experiments with pMOL38 and pMOL39, 17-mer-CA7 and 17-mer-GA7, respectively, were used as probes. Hybridization was carried out at 36 °C in 5× SSC for 1 h. The membrane was then washed twice in 1× SSC at 42 °C for 15 min, and the radio activity was analyzed using a Fujix 2000 Bio Image Analyzer. The efficiency of detection of frameshift intermediates dA7/dT6 and dA6/dT7 was determined by transforming heteroduplex molecules containing the frameshift intermediates. These heteroduplex molecules were prepared by completion of ss → ds DNA synthesis using ss circular pMOL36 template DNA annealed to 40-mer-T7 or ss pMOL37 with 40-mer-A7. Pol III holoenzyme was used for this reaction. The products were methylated byDam methylase and introduced into MF101 cells. The numbers of Apr and Apr Smr transformants were determined. The detection efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of Apr Smr transformants by the number of Apr transformants. Fidelity of DNA replication by E. coli replicative apparatus has been assessed using the fully reconstituted system for oriCplasmid DNA replication in vitro (11Fujii S. Akiyama M. Aoki K. Sugaya Y. Higuchi K. Hiraoka M. Miki Y. Saitoh N. Yoshiyama K. Ihara K. Seki M. Ohtsubo E. Maki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). During in vitro DNA synthesis by the replicative apparatus including Pol III holoenzyme, the frequency of forward mutations within therpsL target sequence was increased to 1.9 × 10−4, 50-fold higher than the background level. Because about 70% of the forward mutations were single-base frameshifts and only a limited number of base substitutions were obtained, the nature of base substitution mutagenesis by the replicative apparatus remained unclear. In addition, base substitutions found in the replication products were mainly G:C → T:A and A:T → C:G transversions, both of which seemed to be caused by oxidative damage to guanine residues in template DNA and substrate nucleotides. To estimate the rate of generation of base-base mispairs during DNA synthesis, we carried out experiments in which unequal concentrations of dNTPs were provided. A similar approach was successfully used with a reversion assay for base substitution mutagenesis during φX174 ss → ds DNA replication (18Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,19Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the frequency ofrpsL − forward mutations in the products ofin vitro DNA synthesis was further increased severalfold when the concentration of dATP was increased relative to dGTP. On the other hand, however, higher concentrations of dTTP relative to dCTP showed no significant effect on the mutation frequency. It appeared that the increase of mutation frequency was not due to an imbalance between dATP and dGTP but was caused by the higher concentration of dATP in itself. The increased mutation frequency observed with 500 μm dATP and 50 μm dGTP was not changed when the concentration of dGTP was increased to 500 μm to balance dATP and dGTP. Furthermore, DNA synthesis with 50 μm dATP and dGTP resulted in a reduction of mutation frequency to 60% of that observed with all dNTPs present at 100 μm. From these results, we concluded that the concentration of dATP affects the generation of replication errors during the oriC plasmid DNA replication in vitro. To reveal the nature of replication errors specifically enhanced by higher concentrations of dATP, we determined sequence alterations in 31 rpsL −mutant plasmids derived from the products of in vitro DNA replication with 1.5 mm dATP, 50 μm dGTP, 100 μm dTTP, and 100 μm dCTP (biased conditions). As a control, we also analyzed 100rpsL − mutant plasmids derived from the products of in vitro replication with all 4 dNTPs at 100 μm (balanced conditions). Surprisingly, 23 out of 30 mutations induced under the biased conditions were single-base frameshifts that added the same nucleotide at dA/dT tracts. Four G → T and three G → C base substitutions were also observed. Among the +1 frameshifts, A6 → A7 mutations were predominant. The mutation frequency of each class of mutation is shown in Table I. It appeared that increased dATP concentrations in the in vitro DNA replication specifically enhanced +1 frameshifts at dA6/dT6and dA5/dT5 tracts as well as G:C → A:T transitions.Table IClass distribution of rpsL − mutations induced during oriC plasmid DNA replication in vitroClass of mutationMutation frequencyIncreaseBalanced conditionsBiased conditions × 10 −5foldBase substitutions G:C → A:T0.848.910.6 G:C → T:A5.7122.1 Other types3.3<2.9Single-base frameshifts A6 → A75.76210.9 A5 → A61.55.93.9 Other types1.72.91.7Other classes1.7<2.9Total21924.4100 and 31 rpsL − mutant plasmids were chosen from the products of in vitro DNA replication under balanced (100 μm each dNTP) and biased (1.5 mm dATP, 50 μm dGTP, 100 μm dTTP, and 100 μm dCTP) conditions, respectively. The mutation frequency of each class was calculated by multiplying the total mutation frequency by the ratio of the number of mutants in each class to the total number of mutants in all classes. Open table in a new tab 100 and 31 rpsL − mutant plasmids were chosen from the products of in vitro DNA replication under balanced (100 μm each dNTP) and biased (1.5 mm dATP, 50 μm dGTP, 100 μm dTTP, and 100 μm dCTP) conditions, respectively. The mutation frequency of each class was calculated by multiplying the total mutation frequency by the ratio of the number of mutants in each class to the total number of mutants in all classes. One possible explanation for the specific stimulation of +1 frameshift at dA/dT tracts by higher concentrations of dATP might be an asymmetric strand mechanism of +1 frameshift mutagenesis: the replicative apparatus might make slippage errors more frequently during DNA synthesis on the dT tract template than on the dA tract template. The concentration of dATP might affect the +1 frameshift mutagenesis during DNA synthesis on the dT tract template. However, it seemed difficult to clarify such a strand asymmetry in the +1 frameshift mutagenesis using theoriC plasmid DNA replication system. To overcome this problem, we developed an assay for examining the frequency of A6 → A7 frameshifts in the products of ss → ds DNA replication by Pol III holoenzyme (Fig.2). A set of ss circular DNAs containing either the coding (dA tract template, pMOL36) or noncoding (dT tract template, pMOL37) strand of the rpsL gene were used as the template DNA for ss → ds DNA replication, in which a highly processive DNA synthesis starts from a defined primer and completes to produce a nicked ds DNA circle. The product DNA was methylated byDam methylase and introduced into E. coli cells by electroporation to detect rpsL − forward mutations caused by replication errors during the in vitroDNA synthesis. Transformants carrying rpsL −mutant plasmids were picked at random and subjected to PCR to amplify the plasmid-borne rpsL DNA fragment. The PCR products were then analyzed by Southern hybridization to an oligomer DNA probe that contains a (dA)7 tract to detect those mutants carrying A6 → A7 frameshifts. The rpsL forward mutation assay is based on a dominant characteristic of wild-type S12 ribosomal protein against the streptomycin-resistant one (17Mo J.Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, some difficulty was expected in detecting product DNA molecules carrying replication errors within the target rpsL sequence. Cells transformed with such heteroduplex DNA molecules would soon harbor two types of plasmid DNA, one with the wild-type rpsL gene derived from the template strand and the other with a mutant rpsL sequence from the strand newly synthesized in vitro. In addition, some repair processes, including mutHLS-dependent mismatch repair, might eliminate such heteroduplex molecules to some extent. However, early rounds of selection for the progeny of heteroduplex molecule may produce transformed cells carrying only one type of plasmid. To determine the efficiency of detection of premutagenic replication errors by the rpsL mutation assay, we carried out model experiments using heteroduplex plasmid DNA. When heteroduplex molecules containing a single-base protruding loop at the dA6/dT6 tract in the rpsL sequence were introduced into a host cell (MF101), transformants withrpsL − mutant plasmid were readily detected, but the detection efficiency appeared to be dependent on which strand contained the single-base loop. The efficiency for dA6/dT7 heteroduplex was 12.4 ± 3.7%, whereas that observed for dA7/dT6 was 1.6 ± 0.3%. Although the reason for this strand bias was unknown, the efficiency of detection of each heteroduplex was reproducible and thus appropriate for use in further studies. Using the assay described above, we determined the frequencies of A6 → A7 frameshift mutations in the products of ss → ds DNA replication with dA tract template (ss pMOL36) or dT tract template (ss pMOL37) DNA (Table II). Concentrations of all 4 dNTPs were 100 μm in these experiments. The background level of A6 → A7 mutations pre-existing in the template DNA was also measured. When the dT tract template was used, A6 → A7 mutations were detected more frequently in the product DNA than ss template DNA. On the other hand, A6 → A7 mutations were not detected in the products of DNA replication with the dA tract template, even though approximately 200 rpsL − mutant plasmids were examined in two independent experiments. It seemed likely that the mutation frequency in the product DNA was equal to or below the background level. Taking into account the different efficiencies of detection of A6 → A7 frameshift intermediates in the replication products derived from dA and dT tract templates, the frequency of frameshift errors was estimated to be 30–90-fold higher in products derived from the dT tract (noncoding) template.Table IIStrand asymmetry of +1 frameshift mutagenesis at dA 6 /dT 6 run rpsL − mutation frequencyA6 → A7mutationsA6 → A7 mutation frequencyObservedCompensated× 10 −6positives/examined × 10 −6dA tract template Experiment 1 Background322 /2780.230.23 Replication product630 /238<0.26<2.1 Experiment 2 Background322 /2780.230.23 Replication product1400 /180<0.78<6.3dT tract template Experiment 3 Background883 /2780.90.9 Replication product11012 /4582.9180 Experiment 4 Background460 /180<0.26<0.26 Replication product833 /902.8180ss → ds DNA replication was carried out with ss pMOL36 (dA tract template) and pMOL37 (dT tract template) under balanced conditions, and the resulting plasmids were subjected to measurement ofrpsL − mutation frequency and A6 → A7 mutation assay.

When dT tract template was used in the assay, the presence of 15-fold excess dATP (1.5 mm dATP, other dNTPs 100 μm) induced a 14-fold increas"
