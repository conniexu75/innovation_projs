Here we determined the protein and lipid compositions of highly purified human B cell-derived exosomes. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated the abundant presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II, heat shock cognate 70, heat shock protein 90, integrin α4, CD45, moesin, tubulin (α and β), actin, Giα2, and a multitude of other proteins. An α4-integrin may direct B cell-derived exosomes to follicular dendritic cells, which were described previously as potential target cells. Clathrin, heat shock cognate 70, and heat shock protein 90 may be involved in protein sorting at multivesicular bodies. Exosomes were also enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and ganglioside GM3, lipids that are typically enriched in detergent-resistant membranes. Most exosome-associated proteins, including MHC class II and tetraspanins, were insoluble in 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS)-containing buffers. Multivesicular body-linked MHC class II was also resistant to CHAPS whereas plasma membrane-associated MHC class II was solubilized readily. Together, these data suggest that recruitment of membrane proteins from the limiting membranes into the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies may involve their incorporation into tetraspanin-containing detergent-resistant membrane domains.

Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Google Scholar). These vesicles are formed by inward budding of the endosomal limiting membrane and contain a selected cargo. Proteins that are sorted to the internal vesicles of MVB potentially may have three distinct fates. The first possibility is exemplified by ligand-activated epidermal growth factor receptor, which is ultimately transferred to lysosomes for degradation (2Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Google Scholar). A second possibility is that proteins may be stored temporarily in MVB, as observed for MHC class II in immature dendritic cells (3Kleijmeer M. Ramm G. Schuurhuis D. Griffith J. Rescigno M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Rudensky A.Y. Ossendorp F. Melief C.J. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 53-63Google Scholar). MHC class II-carrying MVB in dendritic cells have also been termed MHC class II compartments (MIIC), in accordance with similar structures in B cells (4Kleijmeer M.J. Morkowski S. Griffith J.M. Rudensky A.Y. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 639-649Google Scholar). MIIC play a crucial role in peptide loading of MHC class II. In pathogen-stimulated dendritic cells, the internal vesicles of MVB fuse back with their limiting membrane, thereby allowing subsequent transfer of peptide-loaded MHC class II to the plasma membrane (3Kleijmeer M. Ramm G. Schuurhuis D. Griffith J. Rescigno M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Rudensky A.Y. Ossendorp F. Melief C.J. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 53-63Google Scholar). The third potential fate of vesicles within MVB is their release into the extracellular environment as a consequence of fusion of the MVB-limiting membrane with the plasma membrane. These secreted MVB-derived vesicles have been called exosomes, which, depending on their source, may serve a multitude of functions (5Pan B.T. Teng K. Wu C. Adam M. Johnstone R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 942-948Google Scholar, 6Stoorvogel W. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Raposo G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 321-330Google Scholar, 7Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Google Scholar). Exosomes are released by a great number of cell types, including reticulocytes (5Pan B.T. Teng K. Wu C. Adam M. Johnstone R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 942-948Google Scholar), cytotoxic T cells (8Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Van der Donk H.A. Slot J.W. Griffith J.M. Stam N.J. Clevers H.C. Borst J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1469-1475Google Scholar), B lymphocytes (9Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp.

Desaymard C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2631-2645Google Scholar), platelets (15Heijnen H.F. Schiel A.E. Fijnheer R. Geuze H.J. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3791-3799Google Scholar), and intestinal epithelial cells (16van Niel G. Raposo G. Candalh C. Boussac M. Hershberg R. Cerf-Bensussan N. Heyman M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 337-349Google Scholar). The biological functions of exosomes are generally unclear. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that exosomes from hematopoietic cells may serve as intercellular communication vehicles that assist immune responses (6Stoorvogel W. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Raposo G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 321-330Google Scholar, 7Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Google Scholar). For example, B cell-derived exosomes that carry peptide-loaded MHC class II were demonstrated to stimulate CD4+ T cells (17Skokos D. Le Panse S. Villa I. Rousselle J.C. Peronet R. David B. Namane A. Mecheri S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 868-876Google Scholar) and to specifically bind follicular dendritic cells (18Denzer K. van Eijk M. Kleijmeer M.J. Jakobson E. de Groot C. Geuze H.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1259-1265Google Scholar) in vitro. Furthermore, exosomes derived from cultured dendritic cells that were loaded in vitro with tumor-derived peptides on MHC class I stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes both in vitro andin vivo (11Zitvogel L. Regnault A. Lozier A. Wolfers J. Flament C. Tenza D. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 594-600Google Scholar). Functions of exosomes should be reflected by their protein composition. Given that exosomes are formed as the internal vesicles of MVB, exosomes can be expected to also contain factors required for MVB formation and protein sorting therein. Immunoelectron microscopic studies, Western blot analyses, and peptide mass mapping of exosomes derived from dendritic cells (12Thery C. Regnault A. Garin J. Wolfers J. Zitvogel L. Ricciardi- Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 599-610Google Scholar, 13Thery C. Boussac M. Veron P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Garin J. Amigorena S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7309-7318Google Scholar), B lymphocytes (9Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Google Scholar, 10Escola J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Stoorvogel W. Griffith J.M. Yoshie O. Geuze H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20121-20127Google Scholar), intestinal epithelial cells (16van Niel G. Raposo G. Candalh C. Boussac M. Hershberg R. Cerf-Bensussan N. Heyman M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 337-349Google Scholar), and other cell types revealed the presence of common, as well as cell type-specific, proteins. For example, MHC class II is especially enriched in exosomes derived from B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells, and intestinal epithelial cells. Ubiquitous proteins in exosomes include cytoplasmic proteins, such as tubulin, actin, and actin-binding proteins, the heat shock proteins hsc70 (also named hsc71 or hsp73) and hsp90, and trimeric G proteins, as well as membrane proteins, such as members of the tetraspanin family (CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82). Sorting of a number of membrane proteins into the MVB pathway involves ubiquitination of their cytoplasmic domain (19Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Google Scholar) and binding of these acquired ubiquitin moieties to Tsg101 (20Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Google Scholar). Indeed, Tsg101 (12Thery C. Regnault A. Garin J. Wolfers J. Zitvogel L. Ricciardi- Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 599-610Google Scholar), as well as c-Cbl (21Blanchard N. Lankar D. Faure F. Regnault A. Dumont C. Raposo G. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3235-3241Google Scholar), a ubiquitin ligase required for ubiquitination of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (2Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Google Scholar), have been detected in isolated exosomes. Alternatively, membrane proteins may rely on ubiquitinated adaptors for their sorting in MVB (20Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Google Scholar, 22Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Google Scholar). Importantly, sorting of at least some proteins into the MVB pathway occurs independently of the ubiquitin system (23Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5176-5186Google Scholar). The molecular factors and mechanism(s) behind such alternative sorting processes in MVB are unknown, and the analysis of exosomes may help their discovery. In an approach to understand more about the formation and function of exosomes we developed a protocol that yielded highly purified exosomes from human B cells and studied their molecular content and biochemical properties. Based on exosome characteristics, we propose a model in which the incorporation of proteins into tetraspanin networks and detergent-resistant membranes (DRM) at the limiting membrane of MVB may be conditional for their sorting into the internal vesicles of MVB. Rabbit anti-MHC class II (24Neefjes J.J. Stollorz V. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 171-183Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. H. L. Ploegh (Harvard Medical School), rabbit anti-MHC class II β-chain was provided by Dr. N. Barois (INSERM-CNRS de Marseille-Luminy), and the mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-CD81 (clone M38) and anti-CD82 (clone C33) were provided by Dr. O. Yoshie (Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan). Mouse monoclonal anti-MHC class II (CR3/43) was from DAKO (Glastrup, Denmark), mouse monoclonal anti-CD86 (BU63) was from Ancell (Lauflingen, Switzerland), mouse monoclonal anti-CD63 (435; CLB1/2) was from CLB (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and polyclonal rabbit anti-biotin was from Sanver Tech (Boechout, Belgium). For the analysis of exosomes and cell fractions by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, samples were incubated for 15 min at 65 °C in urea-containing sample buffer (5% SDS, 9 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Proteins were separated on 12.5, 10, or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies in PBS containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk (Protivar; Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Primary antibodies were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RN cells (HLA-DR15+) were cultured as described (9Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Google Scholar). We observed that fetal calf serum contains exosomes (data not shown). To exclude bovine exosomes, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum that had been ultracentrifuged for 60 min at 141,000 ×g max. RN-derived exosomes were isolated routinely from 800 ml of culture medium containing ∼108RN cells. As a first isolation step, exosomes were collected from the medium by differential centrifugation, as described (9Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R. Harding C.V. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Google Scholar). In short, cells were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 200 ×g. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged sequentially twice for 10 min at 500 × g max, once for 15 min at 2,000 × g max, once for 30 min at 10,000 × g max, and once for 60 min at 70,000 × g max using a SW27 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Exosomes were pelleted at the final centrifugation step and were resuspended in PBS and re-pelleted at 70,000 × g max. The final pellet routinely contained ∼100 μg of protein. Re-pelleted exosomes were resuspended in 5 ml of 2.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and floated into an overlaid linear sucrose gradient (2.0–0.25m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) in a SW41 tube for 16 h at 270,000 × g max. Gradient fractions of 1 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed for the presence of MHC class II and tetraspanins by Western blotting. When indicated, gradient fractions were diluted with 3 ml of PBS each and centrifuged for 60 min at 350,000 ×g max, and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. As a final purification step, 750-μl samples of pooled exosome-containing gradient fractions were added to 200 μl of Dynabeads M-450 (∼8 × 107 beads) coated with monoclonal mouse anti-human MHC class II (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). As a negative control, Dynabeads M-450 coated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Dynal) were used. The Dynabeads that were added to the exosomes suspensions were first extensively washed with and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For adsorption, samples were rotated end-over-end for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed once with PBS with the aid of a magnet (Dynal). Non-adsorbed membranes were diluted with PBS and collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 200,000 ×g max in a SW50 tube. Proteins from Dynabead-associated exosomes were segregated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, excised from the gels, and analyzed by mass spectrometry by Protana (Denmark). In-gel tryptic digestion of proteins was performed as described (25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). Approximately 2% of the tryptic digest was analyzed on a Bruker Reflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany), and the obtained peptide maps were queried against a non-redundant sequence data base. Search criteria was as follows: mass accuracy, 50 ppm; tryptic peptides, allowed missed cleavage sites, 1. Samples not unambiguously identified by peptide mass fingerprints were purified and concentrated using home built Poros R2 (Applied Biosystems) microcolumns before sequence analysis. The tryptic peptides were sequenced on a QSTAR quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer (Sciex) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (ProtanaEngineering). Prior to analysis, the mass spectrometer was calibrated to a mass accuracy of 20 ppm and a resolution of 9500. The data were processed with PPSS2 (Protana's Proteomics Software Suite), and the peptide sequence tags obtained were queried against a non-redundant sequence data base (26Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Google Scholar). Search criteria were as follows: MS mass accuracy, 1.1 Da; MS/MS accuracy, 0.1 Da; tryptic peptides, allowed missed cleavage sites, 1. For verification of a retrieved peptide sequences theoretical patterns were compared with the obtained collision-induced dissociation mass spectra. PBS-washed RN cells, Dynabead-associated exosomes, and ultracentrifuged non-adsorbed membranes were suspended in a total volume of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v), and lipids were extracted overnight at 40 °C. The suspensions were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g, and the clear supernatants were dried in a stream of nitrogen. The residue was dissolved by first adding 60 μl of chloroform followed by 0.96 ml of methanol and 0.94 ml of water. Each resulting solution was freed of salts and sucrose by reverse phase chromatography. For this procedure small pieces of silanized glass fiber wadding were introduced into glass Pasteur pipettes, and a suspension (1.5 ml; 1:3 (v/v) in methanol) of LiChroprep RP18 (40–63 μm; Merck) was added. These columns were subsequently washed three times with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v), 3 × 1 ml of methanol, and 3 × 1 ml of water. Then the sample solution was applied, and the column was washed with 3 × 1 ml of water. Bound lipids were eluted with 3 × 1 ml of methanol and 3 × 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v). The eluate was dried under a stream of nitrogen, dissolved in 0.10 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v), and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TLC was performed in a horizontal development chamber (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland) using 10 × 10-cm silica gel-coated thin-layer plates (Merck) and a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, by volume) as the mobile phase. Lipids were visualized by fine spraying the developed plates with copper sulfate (10%) (w/v) in phosphoric acid (8%) (w/v) followed by charring for 8 min at 180 °C. For quantitation the charred plates were scanned, and the data were analyzed by phosphorimaging using the TINA software, version 2.0 (Raytest) and compared with known amounts of reference lipids (cholesterol, dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, bovine heart cardiolipin, dioleoyl phosphatidyl choline, and sphingomyelin containing stearic or nervonic acid). For the distinction between cholesterol and its esters thin-layer plates were developed inn-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:1, by volume). For an unambiguous identification extracted lipids from B lymphocytes, which were grown in quantity in the presence of [1-14C]sodium acetate (Amersham Biosciences), were separated into uncharged and acidic lipids prior to preparative TLC. Lipids were traced by their radioactivity, scraped, and extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v). The lipid extracts were then subjected to mass spectrometry. The separation according to charge was by DEAE-Sephadex A 25 chromatography in chloroform/methanol/water (3:7:1, by volume). Acidic lipids were eluted with chloroform/methanol/1m ammonium acetate (3:7:1, by volume) and freed of salts, short chain fatty acids, and other less hydrophobic material by reverse phase chromatography on LiChroprep RP18 as described above. For electrospray-MS, mass spectra were recorded in the negative or positive ion mode for acidic or uncharged lipids, respectively, on a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with a nanospray source. Lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1) (v/v). Solutions were injected into the mass spectrometer by glass capillaries (long type; Protana, Odense, Denmark) using a capillary voltage of 1000 V and a cone voltage of 50 V at 70 °C. Instrument calibration was done with a mixture of sodium iodide and cesium iodide in 50% aqueous acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. For MS/MS experiments argon was used as collision gas, and fragmentation was observed at energy values from 20–50 eV. For MALDI-TOF-MS, measurements were done on a TOFSpec E (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) in positive or negative ion mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. For lipid samples matrix solutions of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were used in a concentration of 10 mg/ml in methanol. Spectra were calibrated externally by using suitable reference substances. RN cells were collected and washed with PBS by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 200 × g. The cell surface was biotinylated for 15 min at 0 °C using 5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce). Excess sulfo-NHS-biotin was quenched with 10 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 20 min at 0 °C after which the cells were collected and washed twice with homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.4) by centrifugation. Cells were homogenized using an EMBL-cell cracker (ball 8.011 applying 10 strokes), and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 900 × g max for 3 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was treated with trypsin (25 μg/mg protein) for 15 min at 37 °C after which trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/mg protein; Sigma) and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added. Density gradient electrophoresis was performed as described (27Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Fernandez-Borja M. Neefjes J. Hart A.A. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 173-178Google Scholar) for 30 min at a constant current of 10 mA. Fractions of 500 μl were collected from the anodic side and analyzed by Western blotting for MHC class II β-chain. Plasma membrane proteins were detected by probing Western blots with streptavidin-peroxidase (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. β-Hexosaminidase was determined as described (28Koldovsky O. Palmieri M. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 697-701Google Scholar), and total protein was assayed using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). To compare plasma membrane-associated MHC class II with exosomes-associated MHC class II, intact cells and isolated floated exosomes were biotinylated at 0 °C as described above. After detergent extraction and ultracentrifugation, pellets were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 μl of Neutravidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 16 h. The beads were washed with PBS and analyzed for bound MHC class II by Western blotting. Gradient fractions (3 ml in total) containing floated exosomes were diluted with 26 ml of PBS. Aliquots of 3.6 ml were mixed with 0.4 ml of PBS containing 10% CHAPS, 10% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, and/or 100 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) as indicated. The samples were then centrifuged in SW60 tubes for 1 h at 350,000 × g max. Pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. To demonstrate association of low density lipid material with MHC class II after detergent solubilization we performed floatation assays. Floated exosomes from sucrose density gradients were pelleted as above and suspended in 500 μl of 2.5 m sucrose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.2, in the presence or absence of 1% CHAPS by 10 passages through a 23-gauge needle mounted on a syringe. The suspension was overlaid with a 2-0.4 m sucrose gradient in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.2, and centrifuged for 4 h at 200,000 × g max. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. Perfringolysin O modified with subtilisin Carlsberg and subsequent biotinylation was kindly obtained from Dr. Ohno-Iwashita (29Iwamoto M. Morita I. Fukuda M. Murota S. Ando S. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 222-230Google Scholar). Cells were prepared for cholesterol labeling as detailed elsewhere (30Mobius W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. van Donselaar E.G. Oorschot V.M. Shimada Y. Fujimoto T. Heijnen H.F. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 43-56Google Scholar). Perfringolysin O-labeled sections were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and labeled with rabbit polyclonal anti-DR (24Neefjes J.J. Stollorz V. Peters P.J. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 171-183Google Scholar) or anti CD63 followed by protein A coupled to 15 nm of gold. After another fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde, sections were incubated with anti-biotin antibodies (4 μg/ml) followed by incubation with protein A coupled to 10 nm of gold. Sections were then examined and photographed at 80 kV with a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Exosomes secreted by the human B cell line RN were purified in three sequential steps. In the first step we performed differential centrifugation to collect membranes from the culture medium that sedimented between 300,000 and 4,200,000 g max × min (10Escola J.M. Kleijmeer M.J.

Amigorena S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 599-610Google Scholar). In the second purification step pelleted exosomes were washed and floated into sucrose density gradients to remove non-membranous serum protein (complexes). Exosomes, as identified by the presence of MHC class II, floated up to a density of ∼1.15 g/ml (Fig.1 B), consistent with previous observations (9Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Liejendekker R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20121-20127Google Scholar). The gradient fractions were diluted with PBS and ultracentrifuged, and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 A). The sample buffer used for SDS-PAGE was supplemented with urea (see “Materials and Methods”) as we found that this greatly enhanced the separation of exosome-associated proteins by SDS-PAGE. A number of proteins, possibly originating from fetal calf serum in the culture medium, remained in the bottom fractions (indicated by the arrows) whereas the majority of proteins co-distributed with MHC class II in the gradient. In addition to MHC class II, these proteins include CD86 and the tetraspanins CD37, CD53, CD63, CD81, and CD82 (data not shown) as identified previously (10Escola J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Stoorvogel W. Griffith J.M. Yoshie O. Geuze H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20121-20127Google Scholar) by Western blotting. As a third purification step, gradient fractions containing MHC class II (fraction 6–8) were pooled, and exosomes were immunoadsorbed onto anti-MHC class II-coupled magnetic beads. Membranes that did not associate with the beads were collected from the bead supernatant by ultracentrifugation. Bead-associated and non-associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). The anti-MHC class II antibody-conjugated beads recovered nearly all proteins whereas beads coated with negative control antibodies did not collect any of these proteins. This indicates that all detected proteins were linked physically to MHC class II-carrying exosomes.Figure 2Immunopurification of exosomes.Exosomes, isolated by differential centrifugation and floatation into sucrose gradients (as in Fig. 1), were immunoadsorbed to Dynal beads coated with anti-MHC class II or control IgG. The beads were collected and analyzed by 7.5% (lanes 1–4) or 12.5% (lane 5) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue-stained. Essentially all proteins were immunoadsorbed to anti-MHC class II-coated beads (lanes 1 and 5), and little protein remained in the supernatant (lane 3). In contrast, essentially all protein remained in the supernatant (lane 4) of control IgG-coated beads (lane 2), indicating the specificity of the procedure. Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were excised from lanes 1and 5 and analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Identified proteins are indicated in the figure, as well as in Table I. mIgHC is immunoglobulin-derived from the mouse anti-MHC class II antibody from the Dynal beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To analyze the identity of e"

Still, we know little about the mechanisms that regulate its expression and its activity. In this study, we show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1, which is implicated in the control of energy metabolism, regulates ERRα at two levels. First, PGC-1 induces the expression of ERRα. Consistent with this induction, levels of ERRα mRNA in vivo are highest in PGC-1 expressing tissues, such as heart, kidney, and muscle, and up-regulated in response to signals that induce PGC-1, such as exposure to cold. Second, PGC-1 interacts physically with ERRα and enables it to activate transcription. Strikingly, we find that PGC-1 converts ERRα from a factor with little or no transcriptional activity to a potent regulator of gene expression, suggesting that ERRα is not a constitutively active nuclear receptor but rather one that is regulated by protein ligands, such as PGC-1. Our findings suggest that the two proteins act in a common pathway to regulate processes relating to energy metabolism. In support of this hypothesis, adenovirus-mediated delivery of small interfering RNA for ERRα, or of PGC-1 mutants that interact selectively with different types of nuclear receptors, shows that PGC-1 can induce the fatty acid oxidation enzyme MCAD (medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase) in an ERRα-dependent manner.

The nuclear receptor ERRα 1The abbreviations used are: ERRα, estrogen-related receptor α; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; LBD, ligand-binding domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; AD, activation domain; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NRF, nuclear respiratory factor; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; aa, amino acid(s); MCAD, medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RT, reverse transcriptase was identified in 1988 as a protein that shares significant sequence similarity to known steroid receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (1Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Google Scholar). ERRα and its relatives ERRβ and ERRγ form a small family of orphan nuclear receptors that are evolutionarily related to the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, and whose in vivo function is still unclear (Refs. 1Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Google Scholar and 2Hong H. Yang L. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22618-22626Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 3Giguere V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Google Scholar). The three ERRs recognize and bind similar DNA sequences, which include estrogen response elements (EREs) recognized by ERs, as well as extended ERE half-sites that have been termed ERR response elements (4Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Google Scholar, 5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell.

Cavailles V. Laudet V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 764-773Google Scholar). Despite their high similarity to ligand-dependent receptors, ERRs seem to regulate transcription in the absence of known natural lipophilic agonist ligands. Searches for ligands have so far identified only synthetic antagonists. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen, which binds ERRβ and ERRγ but not ERRα, and diethylstilbestrol, which binds all three ERRs, inhibit the ability of ERRs to activate transcription (8Tremblay G.B. Kunath T. Bergeron D. Lapointe L. Champigny C. Bader J.A. Rossant J. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 833-838Google Scholar, 9Coward P. Lee D. Hull M.V. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8880-8884Google Scholar). In support of the pharmacological data, elucidation of the crystal structure of the ERRγ LBD suggests that the ERRs assume the conformation of ligand-activated nuclear receptors in the absence of ligand (10Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Google Scholar) and that agonist ligands may not be required. These findings raise the question of how the activity of these nuclear receptors is regulated. One way to control orphan receptor activity is to express the receptors in a temporally and spatially restricted manner. ERRα is expressed widely; however, particularly high ERRα mRNA levels have been noted at sites of ossification during development, and in heart, kidney, brown fat, and muscle in adults (Refs. 5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar and 11Bonnelye E. Vanacker J.M. Dittmar T. Begue A. Desbiens X. Denhardt D.T. Aubin J.E. Laudet V. Fournier B. Mol.

Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Google Scholar). Thus, differential expression of ERRα may contribute to the regulation of ERRα-mediated transcription. The mechanisms and signals that regulate ERRα expression are not clear. The activity of orphan nuclear receptors may also be regulated at the protein level via interactions with specific cofactors. ERRα has been reported variably as an activator, a repressor, or a DNA-binding factor with little activity, suggesting that cellular factors determine the ability of the ERRα protein to activate transcription (4Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Google Scholar, 5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell.

Possible candidates for exerting such control are coactivators that interact with ERRα, such as members of the p160 family of coactivators. Overexpression of p160 coactivators can indeed enhance ERRα-mediated transcription at model reporters (18Xie W. Hong H. Yang N.N. Lin R.J. Simon C.M. Stallcup M.R. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2151-2162Google Scholar, 19Zhang Z. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20837-20846Google Scholar, 20Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761Google Scholar). However, ERRα shows weak transcriptional activity in cells that express endogenous p160 coactivators (5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 20Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761Google Scholar), suggesting that additional cofactors must be important. PGC-1 is a transcriptional coactivator of many nuclear receptors, as well as specific other transcription factors like the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and members of the MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) family (22Puigserver P.

PGC-1 is expressed in a tissue-selective manner, with the highest mRNA levels found in heart, kidney, brown fat, and muscle (22Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar, 25Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Google Scholar, 29Larrouy D. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Int. J. Obes. Relat.

Moreover, PGC-1 expression is induced in a tissue-specific manner by signals that relay metabolic needs. Exposure to cold leads to the induction of PGC-1 in brown fat and muscle, starvation induces PGC-1 expression in heart and liver, and physical exercise increases its expression in muscle (22Puigserver P.

PGC-1 function has been implicated in the control of energy metabolism, as PGC-1 expression stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and modulates mitochondrial functions and utilization of energy (Refs. 23Wu Z.

The nuclear receptors PPARγ, TRα, PPARα, HNF4, and GR, and the transcription factors NRF-1, MEF2C, and MEF2D, interact with, and may recruit, PGC-1 to the promoters of target genes that execute the metabolic effects of PGC-1. Additional transcription factors are likely to contribute to PGC-1 function. In the study presented here, we show that PGC-1 regulates, first, the expression of ERRα mRNA and, second, the transcriptional activity of the ERRα protein. Our findings indicate that ERRα by itself is a poor activator of transcription and that PGC-1 fulfills a specific role as a cofactor required for ERRα function. The interactions of PGC-1 and ERRα suggest that the two proteins act in a common pathway. Expression plasmids for wild-type and mutant human PGC-1, and luciferase reporters pGK1, pΔLUC, and pΔ(cERE)x2-Luc (referred in this study as pERE-Luc), have been described previously (35Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-9718Google Scholar, 36Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol.

The human ERRα ligand-binding domain (LBD) was amplified by PCR, using HeLa cDNA and primers CGAATTCATATGGGGCCCCTGGCAGTCGCT and GCTCTAGACTATCAGTCCATCATGGCCTC, and cloned as anNdeI-XbaI fragment into pcDNA3/Gal4DBD (36Kressler D.

Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). Yeast expression vectors for Gal4-PGC-1 (aa 91–408, wild-type or mutants) were generated by subcloning the PGC-1 cDNA fragments encoding aa 91–408 in the vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). Plasmid pAS2-ERRαLBD expresses the ERRα LBD fused to the Gal4 DBD and was generated by subcloning theNdeI-XbaI fragment encoding the ERRα LBD into pAS2–1 (Clontech). pGBKT7/hERα.280C expresses the human ERα LBD (starting at aa 280) fused to the Gal4 DBD. Human PPARγ (full-length), RXRα (starting at aa 10) and ERRα (starting at aa 221) fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) were isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen and were expressed from the vector pACT2 (Clontech). Adenoviral vectors were generated by CRE-lox-mediated recombination in CRE8 cells (38Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Google Scholar). Briefly, CRE8 cells were transfected with 3 μg of purified Ψ5 adenovirus DNA and 10 μg of pAdlox DNA shuttle plasmid (38Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Google Scholar) carrying the cDNA for human PGC-1 (wild-type or mutant) downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. For the expression of siRNA from adenoviruses, the cytomegalovirus promoter and SV40 polyadenylation sequences of pAdlox were replaced by a DNA fragment harboring the expression cassette of pSUPER (37Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar) to generate AdSUPER. The viral vector AdSiERRα expresses the same siRNA as pSiERRα. All viruses were plaque-isolated to obtain single clones, titered by serial dilution in CRE8 cultures that were grown under 0.6% Noble agar overlay, and used as freeze-thaw lysates. 293, CRE8 (38Hardy S.

When measuring ERRα- and GR-mediated transcription, cells were grown in medium with charcoal-stripped serum. SAOS2-GR(+) and CRE8 cultures were supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml). For infection, cells were plated at 2 × 105per well in a six-well dish. The next day, viruses were added at a multiplicity of infection of 40 or 100, as indicated in the figure legends to Figs. 1 and 5, for 2 h. Cells were then washed and replenished with fresh medium. For transfections, cells were incubated with a calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate. Transfections included 0.2 μg of p6RlacZ for normalization of transfection efficiency, and 1 μg of the luciferase reporters pΔLuc, pERE-Luc, or pGK1. The amounts of expression plasmids per transfection were as follows: 0.5–1 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/HA-PGC-1, 1 μg of pSG5 or pSG5-mERRα, 1 μg of pcDNA3/Gal4 DBD or pcDNA3/ Gal4-ERRα LBD, and 1 μg of pSUPER or pSiERRα for siRNA. Cell lysates were prepared 40–48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity as described (25Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Google Scholar). Luciferase values normalized to the β-galactosidase activity are referred to as luciferase units.Figure 5PGC-1 induces the endogenous MCAD gene in an ERRα-dependent manner.

In all cases, a single PCR product was detected. The sequences of the primers and the sizes of the PCR products were as follows: AAGACAGCAGCCCCAGTGAA (exon 4) and ACACCCAGCACCAGCACCT (exon 5) for human ERRα (product 254 bp), TGTGGAGGTCTTGGACTTGGA (exon 4/5) and TCCTCAGTCATTCTCCCCAAA (exon 6) for MCAD (product 173 bp), CTGTGCCAGCCCAGAACACT (exon 4) and TGACCAGCCCAAAGGAGAAG (exon 5) for 36B4/ribosomal protein P0 large (product 201 bp), CGGGATGAGTTGGGAGGAG (exon 1) and CGGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAA (exon 2) for p21 (product 212 bp), GGAGGACGGCAGAAGTACAAA (exon 4) and GCGACACCAGAGCGTTCAC (exon 5) for mouse ERRα (product 130 bp); primers for mouse PGC-1 and actin have been described previously (36Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 100 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer. Cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis using antibodies against the HA epitope (HA.11, Babco), ERRα (4Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Google Scholar), or PGC-1 (sera from rabbits immunized with a PGC-1 fragment bearing aa 1–293). Yeast carrying Gal4-responsive β-galactosidase reporters (CG1945xY187, Clontech) were transformed by the lithium acetate transformation method with expression plasmids for Gal4 DBD and Gal4 AD fusion proteins. Single transformants were grown to stationary phase, diluted 1:20 in selective media, grown for an additional 14 h at 30 °C in 96-well plates, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (36Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Google Scholar). To identify genes that are induced by PGC-1 and that could execute the cellular processes activated by PGC-1, we have compared the RNA profiles of SAOS2-GR(+) cells infected with adenoviral vectors expressing PGC-1 with those of cells infected with control vectors expressing β-galactosidase or GFP. Analysis of the RNA profiles after hybridization to high density oligonucleotide arrays (data not shown) identified the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα as a gene that is induced strongly by PGC-1. Expression of PGC-1 led to the induction of ERRα at the RNA and protein level in SAOS2-GR(+) cells, as well as in HtTA-1, HepG2, and 293 cells (Fig.1 A and data not shown). Evaluation of protein levels by immunoblotting showed that the increase in the levels of ERRα protein followed closely the appearance of PGC-1 protein at different times after infection, suggesting that ERRα induction is an early event upon PGC-1 expression (Fig.1 B). ERRα mRNA levels have been reported to be high in PGC-1 expressing tissues, such as kidney, heart, muscle, and brown adipose tissue (5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 13Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31693-31699Google Scholar, 14Shi H. Shigeta H. Yang N. Fu K. O'Brian G. Teng C.T.

Krempler F. Patsch W. Genomics. 1999; 62: 98-102Google Scholar). Analysis of mRNA expression levels in tissues of adult mice shows that indeed ERRα levels correlate with PGC-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 C). PGC-1 expression in some of these tissues is known to be induced in response to physiological signals, such as exposure to cold (22Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar). Thus, to test the ability of PGC-1 to induce ERRα in vivo, we determined PGC-1 and ERRα mRNA levels in the brown fat and muscle of mice that were exposed to cold for 6 h. As seen in Fig. 1 D, the increase in PGC-1 expression was accompanied by an increase in ERRα mRNA levels, suggesting that PGC-1 can also induce ERRα expression in vivo. The finding that PGC-1 induces the expression of ERRα suggests that PGC-1 enhances also the activity of ERRα-regulated promoters. To test this, we transfected 293 cells with a PGC-1 expression vector and a reporter that carries the luciferase gene under the control of the minimal ADH promoter with or without binding sites for ERRα (pERE-Luc and pΔLuc, respectively). PGC-1 strongly enhanced expression from the pERE-Luc reporter, in a manner dependent on the presence of the binding sites for ERRα (Fig. 2 A). Estradiol, tamoxifen, or hydroxytamoxifen did not affect the enhancement by PGC-1 (data not shown), suggesting that it was not mediated by receptors that are regulated by these ligands and can recognize the same DNA binding site (e.g. ERα, ERβ, ERRβ, or ERRγ). To confirm that endogenous, PGC-1-induced ERRα was mediating the effect of PGC-1 on the pERE-Luc reporter, we determined the effect of inhibiting the expression of ERRα. For this, cells were transfected with a vector expressing a small interfering (si) RNA specific for ERRα (pSiERRα) (37Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar). Expression of the ERRα-specific siRNA led to a decrease in ERRα mRNA levels (Fig.2 B) and a decrease in the PGC-1-mediated induction of the luciferase reporter, demonstrating that endogenous ERRα was required for the PGC-1 effect (Fig. 2 C). In the absence of PGC-1, pSiERRα decreased ERRα expression (Fig. 2 B) but had no effect on the pERE-Luc reporter (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that in this context ERRα was not transcriptionally active. PGC-1 interacts physically with many nuclear receptors and enhances their transcriptional activity (reviewed in Ref. 34Knutti D. Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Google Scholar). Thus, PGC-1 could also interact with ERRα. In this case, the increased ERRα-mediated transcription could be the combined result of PGC-1 inducing ERRα levels and enhancing ERRα activity. To address this, we first asked whether overexpression of ERRα would lead to the same phenotype as PGC-1 expression. If the only function of PGC-1 were to increase ERRα levels, we would expect that exogenous ERRα expression would mimic the PGC-1 effect. Surprisingly, overexpression of ERRα had very little effect on pERE-Luc (<2-fold), suggesting that ERRα alone was not sufficient for the transcriptional activation of this reporter (Fig. 3 A). Coexpression of PGC-1 with ERRα led to an increase in luciferase expression that was stronger than that seen with just endogenous ERRα, indicating that PGC-1 activated the exogenously introduced ERRα (Fig.3 A). To determine the effect of PGC-1 on the activity of ERRα directly, we evaluated the consequence of PGC-1 expression on the activity of a Gal4 DBD-ERRα LBD chimera, using a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter. In this context, endogenous ERRα does not interfere with the luciferase readout. As seen in Fig. 3 B, Gal4-ERRα LBD by itself activated transcription modestly, ∼2-fold, suggesting that the LBD of ERRα carries only a weak transcriptional activation function. Addition of PGC-1 converted the Gal4-ERRα LBD fusion to a strong activator of transcription, indicating that PGC-1 enables the transcriptional function of ERRα (Fig. 3 B). PGC-1 harbors three Leu-rich motifs (L1, L2, and L3), one of which (L2) bears the consensus LXXLL sequence present in many proteins that interact with the LBD of nuclear receptors. The L2 motif serves as the major binding site for many nuclear receptors, and mutations in L2 disrupt the interactions of PGC-1 with nuclear receptors tested so far (24Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Google Scholar, 26Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Google Scholar, 35Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-9718Google Scholar). Surprisingly, PGC-1 harboring a mutant L2 (L2A) was still capable of interacting with ERRα in a yeast two-hybrid assay; in the same context, the L2A mutant was severely compromised for interaction with PPARγ, RXRα, and ERα (Fig.4, A and B). In previous studies, we had noted that the L3 site can mediate a weak interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (35Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-9718Google Scholar). We thus tested the contribution of the L3 site to the PGC-1/ERRα interaction. As seen in Fig. 4, A and B, PGC-1 bearing a disruption of just L3 (L3A) was also capable of interacting with ERRα, while the double L2A/L3A mutation abolished the interaction. Mutations in motif L1, alone or in combination with L2, had no effect on the physical interaction of PGC-1 with ERRα (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that motifs L2 and L3 can be used equivalently for physical interactions between PGC-1 and ERRα, while L2 is the preferred site for most other receptors (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we determined the requirement of the physical interaction between PGC-1 and ERRα for the activation of the ERRα LBD in mammalian cells, using the context of the Gal4-ERRα LBD chimera. Single mutations in either L2 or L3 did not compromise the PGC-1 effect (Fig.4 C), suggesting that interaction via either site is sufficient for activation of ERRα by PGC-1. The double L2A/L3A mutation abolished the activation, indicating that the physical interaction between the two proteins is necessary for the effect of PGC-1 on the ERRα LBD (Fig. 4 C). The ability of PGC-1 to induce ERRα expression and activity predicts that PGC-1 should also induce the expression of ERRα target genes. To test this, we determined the effect of PGC-1 on the RNA levels of a proposed ERRα target, the MCAD, an enzyme in fatty acid oxidation (5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 13Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31693-31699Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, PGC-1 expression led to the induction of MCAD in HtTA-1 and SAOS2-GR(+) cells. To address whether the induction was mediated by ERRα, we asked whether suppression of ERRα expression affected the response of MCAD to PGC-1. Infection of HtTA-1 cells with adenoviruses that express ERRα-specific siRNA led to a decrease in ERRα mRNA levels (Fig. 5 A), and a reduced induction of MCAD (Fig. 5 B), consistent with ERRα mediating the PGC-1 effect at the MCAD promoter. The distinct utilization of the L3 site of PGC-1 for interaction with ERRα and not other receptors like GR suggests that mutations in the L2 and L3 sites could be used to diagnose the type of nuclear receptors that mediate specific functions of PGC-1. Functions that are mediated by receptors utilizing the L2 site should be abrogated by the single PGC-1 mutation L2A, while functions that rely on ERRα should be disrupted only by the double L2A/L3A and not the single L2A mutation. To test this, we infected SAOS2-GR(+) cells that express GR from a stably integrated locus with adenoviruses expressing PGC-1, wild-type or mutant variants. As predicted, the glucocorticoiddependent induction of the endogenous GR target p21 (39Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Google Scholar) was enhanced by both wild-type PGC-1 and the L3A mutant, but not by the L2A mutant (Fig.5 C). In contrast, induction of MCAD in the same cells was not affected by the L2A mutation and was only abolished by the double L2A/L3A mutation (Fig. 5 D). These findings indicate that the L2 and L3 sites of PGC-1 are indeed used selectively by different nuclear receptors to recruit PGC-1 at their respective endogenous target genes. Many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are still orphan receptors, with no known physiological ligands. The mechanisms that regulate the activity of these receptors are not fully understood. The results presented here provide evidence that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 is a key regulator of the orphan nuclear receptor ERRα. PGC-1 acts at two levels. First, it induces ERRα expression, and second, it associates with ERRα and enables the transcriptional activation of ERRα target genes. PGC-1 expression is known to be regulated in a tissue-selective manner by physiological signals that relay metabolic needs (22Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar, 28Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M.

Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Google Scholar). Accordingly, PGC-1 function has been implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism (Refs. 23Wu Z. Puigserver P.

Our findings suggest that ERRα functions in PGC-1-regulated pathways, where it may contribute to the transcriptional activation of genes important for energy homeostasis. The activity of several orphan nuclear receptors is restricted by expression of the receptors in specific tissues or at particular times (reviewed in Ref. 17Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control the selective expression of these receptors are often not clear. The observation that PGC-1 induces ERRα mRNA levels provides a molecular explanation for the high ERRα expression in heart, kidney, muscle, and brown fat,i.e. tissues that express PGC-1. Moreover, it suggests physiological signals that are likely to control ERRα expression, as shown here for exposure to cold in brown fat and muscle. In support of these findings, Ichida et al. have recently shown that fasting, which is known to induce PGC-1 expression in the liver (28Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Google Scholar,33Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Google Scholar), also increases ERRα mRNA levels (40Ichida M. Nemoto S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50991-50995Google Scholar). The spatial and temporal correlation of PGC-1 and ERRα expression implies that ERRα induction is an early, and possibly direct, outcome of PGC-1 action. Future studies must address whether PGC-1 acts directly at the ERRα promoter. Additional regulatory mechanisms may restrict or enhance ERRα induction by PGC-1, in a tissue- or physiological state-dependent manner. Interestingly, we find that in the absence of PGC-1, ERRα is a very weak activator of transcription. Coexpression of PGC-1 enables potent transcriptional activation by ERRα. These findings suggest that ERRα is not a constitutively active receptor and that transformation into an active form is favored by binding to protein ligands, such as PGC-1, rather than to small lipophilic ligands. Expression levels of PGC-1 may explain why ERRα has been reported as an efficient transcriptional activator in some cells (e.g. ROS 17.2/8) and a poor activator in others (4Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Google Scholar, 5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24826-24834Google Scholar). Many established cell lines express very low, if any, levels of PGC-1. Importantly, the ability of PGC-1 to activate ERRα at the protein level predicts that physiological signals that induce PGC-1 are likely to activate ERRα-mediated transcription, even in the absence of increased ERRα expression. The activation of ERRα at the protein level requires the physical interaction of PGC-1 with ERRα. Surprisingly, this interaction differs from that of PGC-1 with other nuclear receptors. While PGC-1 recognizes most receptors tested until now (GR, ERα, TRα, RXRα, RARα, PPARα, PPARγ, HNF4) via the canonical LXXLL motif L2, it can interact with ERRα equally well via the L2 or the L3 site. Similar to our findings, Huss et al. have recently shown that ERRα, as well as the related receptor ERRγ, bind the L3 site of PGC-1 (41Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Google Scholar), suggesting that the L3-mediated interaction is characteristic of the ERR subfamily of receptors. Interestingly, the differential utilization of the Leu-rich motifs can be used to dissect the receptors that mediate specific PGC-1 functions, as shown by the fact that L2A mutations disrupt GR-dependent, but not ERRα-dependent, effects of PGC-1. Thus, the L2 and L3 mutants of PGC-1 may provide useful tools for elucidating the types of receptors that recruit PGC-1 at distinct promoters. The in vivo functions of ERRα are not yet defined. Based on its ability to bind EREs and modulate some estrogen-responsive genes, ERRα has been proposed to modulate ER signaling and possibly play a role in ER-dependent tumors (6Vanacker J.M. Pettersson K. Gustafsson J.A. Laudet V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4270-4279Google Scholar, 20Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761Google Scholar, 21Kraus R.J. Ariazi E.A. Farrell M.L. Mertz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24826-24834Google Scholar). A function of ERRα in bone development is supported by the high levels of ERRα at sites of ossification during embryogenesis, and the ability of ERRα to promote osteoblast differentiation in vitro and to activate the promoter of the bone matrix protein osteopontin (11Bonnelye E. Vanacker J.M. Dittmar T. Begue A. Desbiens X. Denhardt D.T. Aubin J.E. Laudet V. Fournier B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 905-916Google Scholar, 42Bonnelye E. Merdad L. Kung V. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 971-984Google Scholar). Finally, the strong expression of ERRα in tissues with high capacity for fatty acid oxidation, and its ability to bind the promoter of the MCAD gene, suggest a role in the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids (5Sladek R. Bader J.A. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Google Scholar, 13Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31693-31699Google Scholar). Our findings support a function of ERRα in PGC-1-stimulated cellular processes, such as fatty acid oxidation (24Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Google Scholar), and possibly other aspects of energy homeostasis. Interestingly, the close relationship of PGC-1 and ERRα activity may reflect not only an involvement of ERRα in known PGC-1-regulated functions, but also of PGC-1 in processes where ERRα roles have been suggested, such as bone development and homeostasis or breast cancer.

Through positional cloning, a gene that spans the deleted region Xp22.1 in XLH patients or is mutated in nondeletion patients with the disorder has been identified (designated PEX and subsequentlyPHEX, for phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the Xchromosome) (3The HYP Consortium Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 130-136Google Scholar). The predicted human PHEX gene product exhibits structural similarity to a family of neutral endopeptidases involved in either activation or degradation of peptide hormones. Therefore, PHEX probably functions as a protease, and it may act by processing factor(s) involved in bone mineral metabolism. Extensive mutation analysis of XLH families has revealed a range of defects in the PHEX gene, all of which appear to be loss of function mutations (4Rowe P.S. Oudet C.L. Francis F. Sinding C. Pannetier S. Econs M.J. Strom T.M. Meitinger T. Garabedian M. David A. Macher M.A. Questiaux E. Popowska E. Pronicka E. Read A.P. et al.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 539-549Google Scholar). The ADHR gene product, on the other hand, is a new secreted member of the fibroblast growth factor family of proteins, FGF23 (5The ADHR Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Google Scholar, 6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar). Missense mutations R176Q, R179W, and R179Q in FGF23 from ADHR kindreds replace Arg residues within a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase cleavage site 176RHTR179((K/R)X n(K/R)) motif, whereX n = 2, 4, or 6 residues of any amino acid) (7Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Google Scholar). Whereas native FGF23 protein from culture-conditioned medium resolves as 32- and 12-kDa forms, the mutated proteins are detected only as the 32-kDa band (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar, 8White K.E. Carn G. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Benet-Pages A. Strom T.M. Econs M.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 2079-2086Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutations cause the ADHR phenotype possibly by preventing proteolytic cleavage and thereby enhancing the biological activity of circulating FGF23. In turn, FGF23 acts either directly or indirectly to decrease phosphate reabsorption in the proximal nephron, leading to renal phosphate wasting. Whereas conflicting results have been reported regarding the capacity of wild type and mutant FGF23 forms to alter phosphate transportin vitro (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar, 9Bowe A.E. Finnegan R. Jan de Beur S.M. Cho J. Levine M.A. Kumar R. Schiavi S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 977-981Google Scholar), there has been indirect evidence to support this action of FGF23. First, FGF23 is abundantly expressed in tumors associated with tumor-induced osteomalacia or TIO, a paraneoplastic disease characterized by many of the clinical and laboratory characteristics reported in patients with ADHR, such as hypophosphatemia caused by renal phosphate wasting and decreased renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10White K.E. Jonsson K.B. Carn G. Hampson G. Spector T.D. Mannstadt M. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Miyauchi A. Yang I.M. Ljunggren O. Meitinger T. Strom T.M. Juppner H. Econs M.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 497-500Google Scholar). Because removal of the responsible tumors normalizes phosphate and vitamin D metabolism, a humoral phosphaturic factor, perhaps FGF23, is thought to be responsible for this syndrome. Second, overexpression of wild type FGF23 in an animal model recapitulates the biochemical and skeletal abnormalities associated with TIO (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been postulated that overproduction of wild type FGF23 causes TIO by overcoming subtilisin-like proprotein convertase activity, so that the major fraction of the expressed protein is being secreted as the full-length molecule. In ADHR, on the other hand, mutations in FGF23 prevent proteolytic cleavage, increase its stability, and enhance the biological potency of the circulating protein (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar, 8White K.E. Carn G. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Benet-Pages A. Strom T.M. Econs M.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 2079-2086Google Scholar). Experimental proof, however, is lacking. Here, we undertook to explore the biological actions of FGF23 proteins in a relevant setting (i.e. the intact organism), by overexpressing the R176Q (mFGF23) and wild type forms of FGF23 cDNA in the tumor-bearing nude mouse system. We show that the R176Q substitution is a gain-of-function mutation that is resistant to cleavage and in vivo is able to promote the phenotypic alterations associated with the disorder. In addition, we provide an explanation for the associated peculiarities in vitamin D metabolism by describing, for the first time, a role for FGF23 in dissociating the mineral and vitamin D actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) at the level of the kidney. Human FGF23 cDNA was cloned by PCR using oligonucleotide primers derived from the published sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF263537). The forward primer was 5′-CCGACAGGAGTGTCAGGTTT-3′ (93–112 bp), and the reverse primer encompassed sequences encoding the c-myc epitope (underlined) followed by FGF23 sequences (901–886 bp), 5′-CTACTAGTTGTTCAGGTCCTCTTCGCTAATCAGCTTTTGTTCCATAGAGATGAACTTGGCGA-3′. The PCR was conducted using as template aliquots of a cDNA expression library generated from a human mesenchymal tumor (hemangiopericytoma) associated with oncogenous osteomalacia (11Lipman M.L. Panda D. Bennett H.P. Henderson J.E. Shane E. Shen Y. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13729-13737Google Scholar). The reaction was heated at 94 °C for 2 min and then cycled at 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product (∼0.9 kb) was first subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, WI), restricted with EcoRI, and ligated into theEcoRI site of the polylinker region of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Its authenticity was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The wild type cDNA was then used as template to introduce the point mutation at nucleotide 527 (g→a; R176Q) by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The fidelity of clones was verified by direct sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were maintained on Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were stably transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector or vector expressing either wild type or mutant FGF23-myc cDNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). Following selection with G418 (400 μg/ml), cells were trypsinized, the suspension was diluted with culture medium to approximately one cell per 25 μl, and aliquots were plated in 96-well plates. When colonies had formed, conditioned media were treated with 5 volumes of acetone, cooled on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged, and the protein sediment was resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in 0.5% Triton X-100) and examined for FGF23 content by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and Western blot analysis using an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care committee. Male CD-1 nu/nu mice were purchased from Charles River and kept in cages eating commercial rodent diet and drinking sterilized tap water ad libitum. Groups of six mice were implanted on both sides of the back with CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 or CHO cells expressing either the wild type or R176Q mutant form of FGF23-myc (1 × 107 cells/0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline). The experiment was performed twice. Serum and urine concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine and serum alkaline phosphatase activity were determined by routine methods using Sigma Diagnostics reagents (Sigma). Tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per 100 ml of glomerular filtrate was calculated using the nomogram of Walton and Bijvoet (12Walton R.J. Bijvoet O.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 81: 273-276Google Scholar). Serum-intact PTH and human FGF23 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA), whereas 1,25(OH)2D3 determinations were performed using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems). cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1177–1515 of mouse sodium-phosphate cotransporter Npt2 (accession number L33878) (13Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 862-868Google Scholar) was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse kidney RNA, subcloned, and verified by sequencing. Riboprobes for Npt2 and β–actin (250-bp KpnI-XbaI fragment of the mouse β-actin gene) were prepared by transcription of the subcloned cDNA fragments using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and RPA was performed, as per the instructions of the manufacturer (Ambion). Total RNA (10 μg) isolated from kidney with Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche Molecular Biosciences) was hybridized with the appropriate labeled riboprobes (8 × 104 cpm) at 42 °C overnight and treated with ribonuclease A/T1 mix (1:100) for 30 min at 37 °C. The protected fragments were precipitated, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to Kodak BioMax film at −80 °C for the appropriate time, with intensifying screens. A cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 535–1586 of mouse 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (Cyp24; accession number D49438) (14Itoh S. Yoshimura T. Iemura O. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Kohama Y. Mimura T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 26-28Google Scholar) was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR of mouse kidney RNA, subcloned, and sequenced. DNA probes for Cyp24 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were prepared by a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was isolated from kidney with Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche Molecular Biosciences), and 20-μg aliquots were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by upward capillary transfer in 20× SSC overnight, and hybridized to the radiolabeled cDNA fragment (48% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 42 °C overnight. The membranes were washed in 0.1% SDS plus 2× SSC for 15 min at room temperature with rotation and then in 0.1% SDS plus 0.1× SSC for another 15 min at 60 °C. The autoradiograms were prepared using Kodak BioMax film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Quantification of signal intensity on autoradiograms was performed byAmersham Biosciences personal densitometer using ImageQuant software. The distal end of femur was removed and dissected free of soft tissue, and radiographs were taken using a Faxitron model 805 radiographic inspection system (22-kV voltage and 4-min exposure time). Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat TL film was employed and processed routinely. Thyroparathyroidal tissue, kidney, femurs, and tibiae were removed and fixed in PLP fixative (2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.075 m lysine and 0.01 m sodium periodate solution) overnight at 5 °C and processed histologically, as previously described (15Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Google Scholar). The proximal end of the left tibiae was decalcified in EDTA glycerol solution for 5–7 days at 5 °C. Decalcified tibiae and other tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, after which 5-μm sections were cut on a rotary microtome. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained, as described below. Undecalcified, the proximal ends of left tibiae were embedded in LR White acrylic resin (London Resin Company Ltd., London, UK). 1-μm sections were cut on an ultramicrotome. These sections were stained for mineral with the von Kossa staining procedure and counterstained with toluidine blue. Paraffin sections were stained immunohistochemically for PTH, Npt2, and Cyp40 using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique. Briefly, primary antibody was applied to tissues overnight at room temperature. Goat serum against PTH (16Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Google Scholar), affinity-purified rabbit serum against NPT2 (courtesy of M. Knepper, Laboratory of Kidney and Electrolyte Metabolism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and affinity-purified rabbit serum against Cyp40 (provided by G. Hendy, McGill University, Montréal, Canada) were employed. As negative control, preimmune serum or Tris-buffered saline was substituted for the primary antibody. After washing, tissues were incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG). Sections were then washed and incubated with the Vectastain ABC-AP reagent (Vector Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) for 45 min. After washing, red pigmentation to demarcate regions of immunostaining was produced by a 10–15-min treatment with Fast Red TR/Naphthol AS-MX phosphate (containing 1 mm levamisole as endogenous alkaline phosphatase inhibitor; Sigma). After washing with distilled water, the sections were counterstained with methyl green and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol jelly. Computer-assisted image analysis was performed, as previously described (15Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Google Scholar). The positive and negative areas of von Kossa staining in trabecular and cortical bone were measured by digital image capture and image analysis using Northern Eclipse version 6.0 (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Canada) image software. The mineralization percentage of trabecular and cortical bone was calculated using the following formula: mineralized bone (%) = von Kossa positive area/von Kossa positive area + von Kossa negative area of bone × 100%. Data from image analysis are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 6). Statistical comparisons were made using a two-way analysis of variance, with p< 0.05 being considered significant. A 0.9-kb fragment corresponding to the FGF23 transcript was amplified from several pools of a cDNA expression library generated from a hemangiopericytoma associated with TIO (Fig.1 A) (11Lipman M.L. Panda D. Bennett H.P. Henderson J.E. Shane E. Shen Y. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13729-13737Google Scholar). The addition of the c-myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus of the protein was employed for its subsequent identification and visualization. The R176Q mutation, initially described in a family with ADHR (5The ADHR Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Google Scholar), was also introduced in the FGF23 cDNA using site-directed mutagenesis. When transiently transfected into COS-1, OK, or CHO cells, the wild type and mutant forms of FGF23 (mFGF23) were processed, as previously described (results not shown) (8White K.E. Carn G. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Benet-Pages A. Strom T.M. Econs M.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 2079-2086Google Scholar). To investigate the in vivo biological properties of mFGF23, CHO cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector alone or vector expressing either the myc-tagged wild type or the myc-tagged R176Q form of the protein. Following G418 selection, neomycin-resistant clones were further processed by limited dilution to identify high expressor cells. Shown in Fig.1 B is Western blot analysis of conditioned media from single isolated clones. Abundant secretion of mature FGF23 (32-kDa form) was apparent in both wild type and mutant form-expressing cells, whereas vector-transfected CHO cells did not express the protein. Whereas the wild type form was primarily processed to an amino-terminal fragment (not detected) and a 12-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment, the mature mutant protein failed to be cleaved and remained intact in the conditioned medium. The biological activity of the two FGF23 forms was then assessed following subcutaneous implantation into nude mice of CHO cell clones expressing either FGF23, mFGF23, or CHO cells transfected with vector alone as control (each at a total of 1 × 107 cells). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects epitopes within the carboxyl-terminal portion of human but not murine FGF23, circulating serum levels of the protein were shown to be equivalent in both groups of mice expressing FGF23, whereas none was detectable in the control animals (Fig. 1 C). The mice were followed for 45 days, and urine and blood samples were obtained periodically for analyses. Tumor-bearing animals secreting FGF23 and mFGF23 developed profound hypophosphatemia as early as 10 days following implantation (the first time blood samples were obtained) that progressively became even more profound, although at a slower rate, over the next 35 days (Fig. 2 A). This was accompanied by inappropriate excretion of urinary phosphate (Fig.2 B), as indicated by the decrease in tubular phosphate reabsorption (12Walton R.J. Bijvoet O.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 81: 273-276Google Scholar). In addition, as observed in patients with TIO and ADHR, FGF23-overexpressing animals developed reduced serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 that were inappropriate for the prevailing degree of hypophosphatemia (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, these biochemical alterations were somewhat more pronounced in the mice implanted with CHO cells expressing mFGF23 than in those secreting the wild type form of the protein. However, both were significantly different from those from animals implanted with CHO cells carrying the empty vector. Based on these observations, we next examined parameters of calcium homeostasis. In all three groups of mice, serum calcium concentration was maintained within the normal range (Fig.3 A). However, distinct differences in the levels of circulating PTH were evident among the three groups of animals, being markedly increased in mice overexpressing the two forms of FGF23 (Fig. 3 B). This alteration was accompanied by concomitant decreases in urinary calcium excretion (Fig. 3 C) and increases in serum (Fig.3 D) and bone (Fig. 3 E) alkaline phosphatase activity, changes consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. This was further confirmed by histological analysis of thyroparathyroidal tissue from these animals (Fig. 3 F). Predictably, parathyroid glands from mice expressing FGF23 forms were enlarged, as determined by immunoreactive staining for PTH, compared with glands from animals transplanted with CHO cells carrying the empty vector. The abnormalities in phosphate, vitamin D, and calcium homeostasis were studied further by first assessing the expression of renal sodium phosphate transport protein 2 (Npt2) in the proximal renal tubule 45 days following tumor implantation. Fig.4 A shows that immunoreactivity for the protein was markedly diminished in the presence of circulating FGF23 forms, with a somewhat more pronounced decrease arising from expression of the mutant protein. Moreover, RPA analysis for renalNpt2 mRNA demonstrated that the FGF23-induced reduction in Npt2 was in part due to a decrease in transcript levels, an effect that was again more evident with the mutant FGF23 form. These changes are likely to account, therefore, for the diminished tubular phosphate reabsorption and inappropriate excretion of urinary phosphate in these animals. Nevertheless, despite the marked hypophosphatemia, expected alterations in the expression of enzymes aimed at increasing circulating levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 failed to take place. In fact, contrary to its anticipated up-regulation, immunoreactivity for 25(OH)D3-1α-hydroxylase (Cyp40) in the proximal renal tubule was reduced (Fig.4 B), whereas transcript levels of 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase (Cyp24) were increased (Fig. 4 C) instead of diminished. Again, these inappropriate renal adaptations in Cyp40 and Cyp24 expression were more apparent in mice implanted with CHO-mFGF23 cells, as compared with the wild type FGF23 form, suggestive of the increased biological potency of the mutant protein. We next examined the long bones of these animals. Histological sections of the epiphyseal region of tibiae are shown in Fig.5. In comparison with the growth plate of the control animals, the growth plate of mice implanted with CHO cells expressing wild-type FGF23 was wider, more disorganized, and less well mineralized. Once more, these rachitic changes were more apparent in the animals implanted with CHO cells expressing the mutant form of FGF23. Osteomalacic changes were also noted in the metaphyses of these bones (Fig. 6 A). Increased unmineralized osteoid was present in specimens from animals expressing FGF23 and was even more abundant in bones from mFGF23-expressing mice. This alteration was evident in both trabecular as well as cortical bone (Fig. 6, B–D). The reduced skeletal mineralization arising from expression of the FGF23 forms was further confirmed from radiographic studies (Fig. 6 E).Figure 6Osteomalacia arising from FGF23 overexpression. A, proximal tibial sections indicate the pathognomonic findings of rickets (increased growth plate thickness) and osteomalacia (increased deposition of unmineralized osteoid). The arrowheads and arrows indicate unmineralized osteoid deposits in trabecular (B) and cortical (C) bone, respectively. D, theinset depicts quantitatively the percentage of unmineralized bone in the three groups of mice. All data are reported as mean ± S.E. (n = 6). *, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.01 versus vector; #,p < 0.05 versus FGF23. E, radiographs of distal end of femurs shown are representative of two different samples from each group of mice and further substantiate the impairment in the mineralization of bone that follows FGF23 and mFGF23 overexpression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) FGF23 is mutated in the hereditary renal phosphate wasting disorder ADHR (5The ADHR Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 345-348Google Scholar). Missense mutations described in the patients with ADHR have been postulated to stabilize the protein by impairing its cleavage and thereby potentially elevating circulating concentrations of FGF23, leading to phosphate wasting (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar, 8White K.E. Carn G. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Benet-Pages A. Strom T.M. Econs M.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 2079-2086Google Scholar). Here we show using anin vivo overexpression system that the R176Q form of FGF23 that is resistant to proteolytic cleavage has an equivalent and probably higher capacity than wild type FGF23 to recapitulate the biochemical and skeletal abnormalities associated with ADHR. Similar findings have recently been reported by other investigators (17Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I. Yoneya T. Yamazaki Y. Okawa K. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3179-3182Google Scholar). Although it is rather difficult to make direct comparisons on thein vivo potency of the two FGF23 forms, their nearly equivalent circulating concentrations that we describe in our experimental model would tend to add further credence to our conclusion. Hence, the mutant protein has profound effects on phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism, leading to the concomitant development of renal phosphate wasting, rickets, and osteomalacia. The phenotypic similarities between ADHR, TIO, and XLH would suggest that deregulation of the same phosphate-regulating pathway, namely FGF23, is involved in the pathogenesis of all three renal phosphate-wasting disorders. Thus, as indicated by our studies here and by others (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar), overexpression of wild type FGF23 in TIO is likely to overwhelm the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase processing of the protein, leading to increased circulating levels of the unprocessed 32-kDa FGF23 form with the ensuing biochemical and skeletal alterations. Similarly, it is reasonable to postulate that circulating FGF23 also serves as one of the humoral factor(s) that underlie the etiology of XLH. In this model, FGF23, secreted by one or more tissues, would serve as substrate processed by PHEX enzymatic activity. Consequently, inactivating mutations in PHEX endopeptidase would lead to impaired processing of FGF23 and persistent biological activity that would adversely affect renal phosphate handling, calcitriol synthesis, and bone metabolism. Therefore, overproduction of FGF23 by tumors (as in TIO), mutations that prevent its cleavage (as in ADHR), or mutations that inactivate PHEX (as in XLH) would all increase the level of active circulating FGF23, leading to renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, rickets, and osteomalacia. The molecular and physiological mechanisms by which FGF23 and its naturally occurring mutant forms associated with ADHR cause derangement in renal phosphate handling, however, are currently unknown. One possibility is that FGF23 acts directly on the kidney to alter phosphate transport and renal parameters of vitamin D metabolism. Studies addressing this scenario, however, tend to be conflicting, since both confirmatory and negative findings have been reported (6Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Google Scholar,10White K.E. Jonsson K.B. Carn G. Hampson G. Spector T.D. Mannstadt M. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Miyauchi A. Yang I.M. Ljunggren O. Meitinger T. Strom T.M. Juppner H. Econs M.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 497-500Google Scholar). The difficulty in clearly demonstrating a direct effect of FGF23 on phosphate transport in vitro suggests that perhaps a more complex mechanistic model exists. For example, FGF23 may act as an intermediary in causing phosphaturia, by altering either the expression of PHEX or the expression of its putative substrate or by mobilizing another factor whose nature at present remains unknown. A somewhat unexpected finding in our study, not described by others (17Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I. Yoneya T. Yamazaki Y. Okawa K. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3179-3182Google Scholar), was the marked increase in circulating PTH levels in animals bearing FGF23- and mFGF23-secreting tumors. This change was attributed to the observed decrease in calcitriol synthesis, leading to hypocalcemia. The ensuing appropriate rise in PTH secretion would then be aimed toward maintaining calcium homeostasis by increasing bone turnover (increased alkaline phosphatase activity in bone and serum) and decreasing urinary calcium excretion, consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Additional confirmatory support for this argument is provided by the diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia observed histologically in these two groups of animals. Increased circulating levels of PTH have been reported in some patients with TIO (18Ryan W.G. Gitelis S. Charters J.R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 358-362Google Scholar, 19Yang I.M. Park Y.K. Hyun Y.J. Kim D.Y. Woo J.T. Kim S.W. Kim J.W. Kim Y.S. Choi Y.K. Korean J. Intern. Med. 1997; 12: 89-95Google Scholar) and in Hyp and Gy mice, the murine homologs of XLH (20Meyer Jr., R.A. Meyer M.H. Morgan P.L. Bone. 1996; 18: 23-28Google Scholar). Although not described in ADHR, a trend toward higher PTH levels has been observed in patients with this disorder (1Econs M.J. McEnery P.T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 674-681Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy between this observation and our findings can be explained, in part, by the fact that in our animal model deregulated overexpression would tend to raise the circulating levels of the FGF23 forms more profoundly. Conceivably, in patients with ADHR, potential feedback mechanisms are likely to be set in motion so as to restrain excess production of FGF23. Whereas the nature of such mechanisms remains unclear, their existence has been substantiated by the apparent reversal of the phenotype in a number of patients with ADHR (2Kruse K. Woelfel D. Storm T.M. Horm. Res. 2001; 55: 305-308Google Scholar). The question then arises as to whether the concomitant increase in circulating PTH levels contributes, at least in part, to the decrease in Npt2 expression at the level of the renal proximal tubule and the inappropriate phosphaturia associated with this condition. Confirmation of this would have to await the completion of similar experiments that are presently under way using nude mice carrying targeted disruption of the Pth gene. Nevertheless, it is rather remarkable that when FGF23 is overexpressed, high circulating PTH levels do not normalize 1,25(OH)2D3 serum concentration. Normally, the enzymes Cyp40 and Cyp24 are very tightly and reciprocally regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and PTH (21Tanaka Y. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 196-199Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 activates its own breakdown by strongly inducing Cyp24 while at the same time down-regulating Cyp40 (22Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Google Scholar). On the other hand, PTH induces Cyp40 while down-regulating Cyp24 expression (23Zierold C. Reinholz G.G. Mings J.A. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 323-327Google Scholar, 24Zierold C. Mings J.A. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13572-13576Google Scholar). Here we show that, following FGF23 overexpression, Cyp40 expression remains decreased while, concurrently, Cyp24 expression is increased, effects that are diametrically opposed to those one would anticipate from the presence of increased PTH and decreased 1,25(OH)2D3 circulating levels. Thus, an apparent dissociation of PTH actions at the level of the kidney occurs, whereby the effects of PTH on reabsorbing urinary calcium and perhaps promoting phosphaturia are preserved, whereas Cyp40 andCyp24 expression are refractory to its action. FGF23, therefore, appears to be directly or indirectly responsible for the inappropriate alterations in the activity of the renal vitamind-metabolizing hydroxylases observed both in our mice and likely in patients with ADHR, TIO, and XLH. This may also explain, in part, the inappropriately normal levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 associated with these three disorders despite the prevailing hypophosphatemia, a finding that is unique to them, since in other renal phosphate wasting states, 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis is up-regulated. For example, 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis is appropriately increased by hypophosphatemia in Npt2-null mice (25Beck L. Karaplis A.C. Amizuka N. Hewson A.S. Ozawa H. Tenenhouse H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5372-5377Google Scholar) and in patients with hypophosphatemia associated with heterozygote missense mutations in the NPT2 gene (26Prie D. Huart V. Bakouh N. Planelles G. Dellis O. Gerard B. Hulin P. Benque-Blanchet F. Silve C. Grandchamp B. Friedlander G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 983-991Google Scholar). In summary, our findings demonstrate the enhanced in vivobiological potency of the R176Q mutant form of FGF23 associated with ADHR compared with the wild type protein and provide a novel perspective on the molecular intricacies that underlie the pathophysiology of hereditary and acquired disorders of renal phosphate wasting."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions remain largely unknown. Here we report that liprin-α interacts with the neuron-specific kinesin motor KIF1A. KIF1A colocalizes with liprin-α in various subcellular regions of neurons. KIF1A coaccumulates with liprin-α in ligated sciatic nerves. KIF1A cofractionates and coimmunopreciptates with liprin-α and various liprin-α-associated membrane, signaling, and scaffolding proteins including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptors, GRIP/ABP, RIM, GIT1, and βPIX. These results suggest that liprin-α functions as a KIF1A receptor, linking KIF1A to various liprin-α-associated proteins for their transport in neurons."

The PKC substrates responsible for phosphorylation-dependent changes in regulated exocytosisin vivo have not been identified. Munc18a is essential for neurotransmitter release by exocytosis and can be phosphorylated by PKCin vitro on Ser-306 and Ser-313. We demonstrate that it is phosphorylated on Ser-313 in response to phorbol ester treatment in adrenal chromaffin cells. Mutation of both phosphorylation sites to glutamate reduces its affinity for syntaxin and so acts as a phosphomimetic mutation. Unlike phorbol ester treatment, expression of Munc18 with this phosphomimetic mutation in PKC phosphorylation sites did not affect the number of exocytotic events. The mutant did, however, produce changes in single vesicle release kinetics, assayed by amperometry, which were identical to those caused by phorbol ester treatment. Furthermore, the effects of phorbol ester treatment on release kinetics were occluded in cells expressing phosphomimetic Munc18. These results suggest that the dynamics of vesicle release events during exocytosis are controlled by PKC directly through phosphorylation of Munc18 on Ser-313.

The effects of phorbol ester were originally attributed to activation of PKC1 although the PKC substrates responsible had not been identified, and it is not known if the same target regulates all of the parameters modified by phorbol esters.

PKC phosphorylation of specific residues in intact cells has only been demonstrated for SNAP-25 (29Iwasaki S. Katoaka M. Sekiguchi M. Shimazaki Y. Sato K. Takahashi M. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and synaptotagmin I (25Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Norstedt C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In no case has the functional consequences of these phosphorylation events for exocytosis been established. Indeed, the phosphorylation of SNAP-25 by PKC in PC12 cells lagged well behind the effects of phorbol ester on the extent of exocytosis (29Iwasaki S. Katoaka M. Sekiguchi M. Shimazaki Y. Sato K. Takahashi M. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In that study, it was also shown that the phorbol ester effects had both a PKC-dependent and a PKC-independent component. The synaptic protein Munc13 has been identified as an alternative phorbol ester-binding protein (30Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and recently it has been suggested that the effects of phorbol ester on synaptic transmission are mediated entirely by Munc13 (32Rhee J.-S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A PKC-dependent component of phorbol ester stimulation of exocytosis was shown to involve vesicle recruitment to the plasma membrane in PC12 cells (33Shoji-Kasai Y. Itakura M. Kataoka M. Yamamoir S. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 1390-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester-stimulated recruitment of vesicles into the ready releasable pool in adrenal chromaffin cells was inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide in chromaffin cells (4Gillis K.D. Mobner R. Neher E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 34Smith C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 589-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) consistent with a role for PKC. In addition, we have shown that another aspect of exocytosis, the kinetics of single vesicle release events, is modified by phorbol esters in a PKC-dependent (bisindolylmaleimide-sensitive) fashion in adrenal chromaffin cells (9Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is clear that alternative approaches are needed to establish whether PKC-mediated phosphorylation of any identified substrate directly regulates one or more aspect of exocytosis. Munc18 binds tightly to syntaxin holding it in a closed conformation that prevents its assembly into a SNARE complex (35Misura K.M.S. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 36Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In some as yet uncharacterized way, Munc18 is required to donate syntaxin ready for its interaction with the other SNARE proteins and in its absence membrane fusion is abolished. Modification of the interaction between Munc18 and syntaxin could, therefore, be an important mechanism for the regulation of membrane fusion, and we have shown that mutations in Munc18, which modify the affinity of this interaction, change the kinetics of single vesicle release events in chromaffin cells (38Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Munc18a is phosphorylated by PKC on Ser-306 and Ser-313in vitro, and this reduces the amount of Munc18 that binds to syntaxin (28Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kontani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We have investigated whether phosphorylation on these sites occurs in intact cells and demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-313 of Munc18 in response to PKC activation leads to changes in the kinetics of vesicle fusion and release. Rabbit polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies were produced by AbCam Ltd (Cambridge, UK) using the peptides CQEVTRpSLKDFS for Ser-306 and CDFSSpSKRMNTG for Ser-313. Cysteine was included at the N terminus of each peptide for conjugation to carrier proteins and for use in affinity purification. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised to these peptides, affinity-purified using a Sulfolink kit (Pierce), and characterized by Western blotting of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Munc18. For phosphorylation, His-tagged proteins were incubated in MES buffer, pH 6.9 (50 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) with 100 μm ATP, 1.25 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 2.5 μg/ml PMA, and 1.2 mm CaCl2. The final reaction volume was 50 μl containing 2 μg of Munc18 protein and 70 milliunits of PKC. Reactions were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. For mock phosphorylation, PKC was omitted. Munc18a and mutants were expressed and purified as full-length GST fusion or His-tagged proteins. The cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin was expressed as GST fusion or His-tagged protein. Binding reactions (39Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were performed in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Munc18-GST proteins at a concentration of 200 nm were incubated with His-tagged syntaxin at various concentrations, and then 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and binding buffer were added to make the total reaction volume 100 μl. Reactions were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, the supernatants were removed by passing through spin filter columns (Affinity Research Products Ltd, Exeter, UK), and the glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed four times in binding buffer. Proteins were eluted with 60 μl of SDS gel buffer and boiled for 5 min, after which 20 μl of each assay was run on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was then performed to assay bound syntaxin using monoclonal anti-syntaxin (HPC-1, Sigma) and125I-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) to allow quantification. In control incubations with GST instead of GST-Munc18 or GST-syntaxin, nonspecific binding was not detected. Wild-type and mutant Munc18 proteins were produced in radiolabeled form byin vitro transcription/translation with the TnT T7 PCR DNA system (Promega) using PCR template amplified from plasmids encoding Munc18 wild type or Munc18 mutants. The35S-labeled proteins were bound to syntaxin in the absence or presence of unlabeled wild-type Munc18 protein to act as a binding competitor as follows: purified GST-syntaxin (5 μg) was incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 200 μl of PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of PBS and twice with 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and resuspended in binding buffer to a final volume of 195 μl giving a final GST-syntaxin concentration of 0.4 μm. 5 μl of the radiolabeled Munc18 (giving final concentrations of ∼5 pm) was incubated with the GST-syntaxin for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of various concentrations of purified wild-type His-tagged Munc18. After 2 h, the supernatant from the reaction was removed, precipitated with an equal volume of methanol at −20 °C for 30 min, resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The glutathione-Sepharose pellet was washed four times with 500 μl of binding buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples of the binding reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gels air-dried in cellulose sheets before exposing to Biomax MR film (Kodak) for 16 h. Isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (40Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods, Volume 20: Intracellular Messengers. Humana Press Inc., NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar) were plated on non-tissue culture-treated 10-cm Petri dishes and left overnight at 37 °C. Non-attached cells were resuspended in growth medium at a density of 1 × 107/ml. A plasmid encoding wild-type Munc18a (in pcDNA3) (41Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was mutated at Ser-306 and Ser-313 using the QuickChange system (Stratagene). Plasmids (encoding EGFP and Munc18 or mutants) were mixed and added at 2 μg/1 × 106cells, and cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. The cells were then rapidly diluted to 1 × 106/ml with fresh growth medium and maintained in culture for 3–5 days. For immunofluorescence, transfections were performed as described above, and cells plated onto glass coverslips. After washing twice with PBS, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, processed for detection of overexpressed Munc18 as described (38Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and viewed using appropriate filters to visualize EGFP and immunofluorescence. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid (pcDNA3, or the plasmids encoding Munc18 and mutants) using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). After an additional 72 h, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of SDS dissociation buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal antibody against Munc18 (BD Biosciences). Electrophysiological recording conditions were as described previously (9Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in bath buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) and a 5-μm diameter carbon fiber electrode was positioned in contact with a cell. For stimulation, a cell permeabilization/stimulation buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 μm digitonin, and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 6.5) was pressure-ejected from a glass pipette on the opposite side of the cell, and amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany). For examination of the effects of phorbol ester treatment, recordings were taken of untreated control cells, and then 100 nm PMA added to the bath for at least 10 min before recording from treated cells. For the comparison of control- and mutant-expressing cells, analysis of untransfected and transfected cells before and after PMA treatment was carried out in parallel on the same batch of cells. To rule out any variability between cell batches and carbon fibers, transfected cells and untransfected cells as controls were recorded alternately in the same dishes and with the same carbon fibers. Data from transfected cells was always compared with the respective control cells. For all treatments, cells were derived from multiple cell preparations. The data were subsequently analyzed using Origin (9Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All of the data are shown as mean ± S.E., and statistical differences were assessed using the non-parametric Mann Whitney test. Chromaffin cells in culture were washed in a Krebs-Ringer buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and then incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 100 nm PMA. The cells were then stimulated and permeabilized by incubation in 139 mmpotassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm digitonin, pH 6.5 with either no added CaCl2 or CaCl2 added to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm. After 10 min, the supernatant and the cells were taken for analysis of catecholamine using a fluorimetric assay (40Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods, Volume 20: Intracellular Messengers. Humana Press Inc., NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar). To test whether PKC phosphorylated residues Ser-306 and Ser-313 of Munc18, phosphospecific antisera were generated using phosphorylated peptides surrounding each phosphorylation site. These antisera specifically recognized recombinant Munc18a phosphorylated by PKC in vitro but not the non-phosphorylated protein (Fig.1 A). In these experiments the bacterially expressed Munc18 often ran as a doublet, presumably due to some limited proteolysis, but the two forms behaved essentially identically in all assays. Recombinant His6-tagged Munc18 was also prepared with double mutations to either alanine (dAla) or glutamate (dGlu) at Ser-306 and Ser-313. Specificity of the antisera was further shown by the fact that neither antisera detected the proteins mutated at Ser-306 and Ser-313 after the proteins had been incubated with PKC (Fig. 1 B). Adrenal chromaffin cells are widely used in the study of regulated exocytosis, and phorbol ester treatment modifies the extent (4Gillis K.D. Mobner R. Neher E.

Phosphorylation of Munc18, therefore, was examined in these cells using the phosphospecific antisera. A specific signal from the antiphospho-Ser-306 antiserum was not obtained from either control or PMA-treated cells and therefore, it is unclear if this residue is phosphorylated in vivo. In contrast, a specific signal for Ser-313 phosphorylation was obtained based on competition with the immunizing peptide (Fig. 1, C and D). Phosphorylation of Ser-313 was low in control cells but was markedly increased by PMA treatment, showing that this residue is phosphorylated following PKC activation in intact cells (Fig. 1 C). It has been shown that phosphorylation of Munc18 by PKC reduced the amount of the protein recovered with syntaxin in anin vitro binding assay (28Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kontani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, in vitrophosphorylation of Munc18 by PKC significantly reduced the affinity of its binding to syntaxin 1A (39Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) from a K D of 56 to 390 nm. In the study identifying Ser-306 and Ser-313 as phosphorylation sites, two additional phosphorylated peptides were not characterized. In order to determine whether phosphorylation of only the two identified residues was responsible for the effect on syntaxin binding, they were both mutated to the potentially phosphomimetic residue glutamate. The dGlu mutant also showed a reduced affinity (from a K D of 10.3–840 nm) as seen for phosphorylated wild-type Munc18 (Fig. 2 B). This effect was specific for phosphomimetic residues, because mutation of Ser-306 and Ser-313 to alanine (dAla) did not affect syntaxin binding (K D of 17.2 nm). In order to confirm the reduced affinity of the dGlu mutant for binding to syntaxin and to rule out any potential problems resulting from bacterial expression of the mutant, binding assays were carried out using radiolabeled Munc18s prepared by in vitro transcription and translation. Binding of 35S-labeled proteins to syntaxin was carried out in the absence or presence of competing unlabeled wild-type Munc18. Binding of the dGlu form of Munc18 was much more efficiently competed than that of wild-type protein, showing the reduced affinity of the dGlu mutant (Fig. 2 C). In order to test the effect of phosphorylation in vivo we expressed Munc18 with Ser-306 and Ser-313 mutated to glutamate as this mutant was phosphomimetic in the syntaxin binding assay. Use was made of a well characterized assay (8Graham M.E. O'Callaghan D.W. McMahon H.T. Burgoyne R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Treatment of chromaffin cells with phorbol esters results in an increase in catecholamine release when measured in populations of intact or permeabilized cells (6Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaro J.-M.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The extent of this overall increase in catecholamine release for a cell population experiment (around 40%) is shown by the example in Fig.3 A for digitonin-permeabilized cells challenged with 0 and 10 μm Ca2+. We examined whether phorbol ester treatment or expression of the dGlu Munc18 mutant would increase the number of exocytotic events detected by amperometry. In a series of independent experiments, PMA-treatment increased the number of amperometric spikes to 166.6 + 18.1% of control values (n = 8, p < 0.01, data from a total of 137 control and 139 PMA-treated cells). The effect of PMA on the time course of release is shown for one experiment in Fig.3 B. In contrast, expression of the Munc18 dGlu mutant had no effect on either the overall number of amperometric spikes per cell (21.9 + 5.0 for control cells, n = 32 and 19.5 + 5.2 for transfected cells, n = 35) or the time course of the cell responses (Fig. 3 C). From examination of the kinetics of release from single vesicles using amperometry we have previously shown that treatment with the phorbol ester PMA reduced the amount of release per vesicle (total charge) and the spike half-width and reduced both the rise and fall time of the amperometric spikes (8Graham M.E.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) implicating PKC as the target for PMA. Identical effects were seen following expression of a Munc18 mutant (R39C) that had a reduced affinity for syntaxin (38Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) because Arg-39 makes an important contact with syntaxin (35Misura K.M.S. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type Munc18 had no detectable effects on either the extent or kinetics of exocytosis (38Fisher R.J.

Here we analyse the probability distribution of demand, conditioned on its local noise intensity Σ, and discover the surprising existence of a critical threshold, Σc. For Σ < Σc, the most probable value of demand is roughly zero; we interpret this as an equilibrium phase in which neither buying nor selling predominates. For Σ > Σc, two most probable values emerge that are symmetrical around zero demand, corresponding to excess demand and excess supply1; we interpret this as an out-of-equilibrium phase in which the market behaviour is mainly buying for half of the time, and mainly selling for the other half."

Resensitization of these desensitized receptors requires endocytosis and subsequent dephosphorylation. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the rat μ-opioid receptor (MOR1, also termed MOP) was found to be associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2), a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane, which has been implicated in the formation of endocytotic vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells coexpressing MOR1 and PLD2 confirmed that MOR1 constitutively interacts with PLD2. Treatment with the μ receptor agonist DAMGO ([d-Ala2, Me Phe4, Glyol5]enkephalin) led to an increase in PLD2 activity, whereas morphine, which does not induce MOR1 receptor internalization, failed to induce PLD2 activation. The DAMGO-mediated PLD2 activation was inhibited by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) but not by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C indicating that opioid receptor-mediated activation of PLD2 is ARF- but not PKC-dependent. Furthermore, heterologous stimulation of PLD2 by phorbol ester led to an accelerated internalization of the μ-opioid receptor after both DAMGO and morphine exposure. Conversely the inhibition of PLD2-mediated phosphatidic acid formation by 1-butanol or overexpression of a negative mutant of PLD2 prevented agonist-mediated endocytosis of MOR1.

Signal-dependent activation of PLD was demonstrated in numerous cell types stimulated by various hormones, growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters, adhesion molecules, drugs, and physical stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 3Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Google Scholar). Pathways leading to PLD activation include protein serine/threonine kinases, e.g. protein kinase C, small GTPases, e.g. ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), RhoA and Ral, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and tyrosine kinases (4Kiss Z.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11408-11413Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation studies have demonstrated the presence of PLD1 in intracellular membranes,e.g. ER, Golgi, and vesicular compartment (9Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M.

Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Google Scholar). After stimulation with serum, redistribution of PLD2 from the plasma membrane into submembraneous endocytotic vesicles (early endosomes) was observed (9Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Google Scholar). Another study revealed that PLD2 is associated with the EGF receptor (12Slaaby R. Jensen T. Hansen H.S. Frohman M.A. Seedorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33722-33727Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGF receptor endocytosis is impaired when PLD activity is inhibited (13Shen Y. Xu L. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 595-602Google Scholar) suggesting a role for PLD2 in receptor trafficking. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the μ-opioid receptor, we isolated a rat cDNA encoding for the NH2 terminus of PLD2. We therefore investigated the potential role of PLD2 in the process of agonist-mediated endocytosis of the μ-opioid receptor. We show that PLD2 is constitutively associated with the μ-opioid receptor. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the opioid receptor-mediated activation is ARF-dependent and essential for receptor endocytosis. The μ-opioid receptor was subcloned into pGBKT7 vector (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) and used as bait to screen a rat brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech). The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out according to the protocol of the manufacturer. 280 clones were positive on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine, 6 of which were further confirmed by yeast mating and filterlift assays for β-galactosidase: one encoding for PLD2, two clones encoding for known proteins, and three clones encoding for novel proteins. The rat μ-opioid receptor (MOR1) was tagged at the NH2 terminus with the HA epitope tag sequence MYPYNVPNYA using polymerase chain reaction and then subcloned into the pEAK10 expression vector (Edge Bio Systems, Gaithersburg, MD). Dr. S. Ryu (Pohang, South Korea) kindly provided the human PLD1b and PLD2 cDNAs subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The PLD2 truncation mutant (nPLD2) expressing only the NH2-terminal amino acids 1–235 of PLD2 lacking the active site motif of the enzyme was constructed by PCR mutagenesis. To introduce a HindIII restriction site, the forward primer 5′-GCG GCC GCG AAG CTT ATG ACG GCG ACC CCT GAG-3′was synthesized. The sequence for the reverse nPLD2-mutagenesis primer introducing a XbaI restriction site and an amber stop codon in amino acid position 235 of the PLD2 gene was 5′-CCA GCC ACC TCT AGA ACC AGC GAT AAC AAA CTT-3′. The amplified 695-bp NH2-terminal fragment of PLD2 (nPLD2) was subcloned in theHindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1. Cells were first transfected with peak10:MOR1 plasmid containing puromycin resistance using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (14Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). To generate cell lines coexpressing HAMOR1 and PLD1b, PLD2, or nPLD2, cells were subjected to a second round of transfection using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and selected in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin and 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The whole pool of resistant cells was used without selection of individual clones. Receptor expression and PLD1b or PLD2 expression was monitored using receptor ligand binding assays, PLD activity assays, Western blot analysis, and confocal microscopy as described below. Binding studies were performed on membranes prepared from stably transfected cells. The dissociation constant (K D) and number of [3H]DAMGO binding sites (Bmax) were calculated by Scatchard analysis using at least six concentrations of [3H]DAMGO in a range from 0.3 to 9 nm as previously described (15Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined as radioactivity bound in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled DAMGO. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 150-mm dishes and grown to 80% confluence. Cells were then lysed, and the resulting lysate was subjected to Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation as described (15Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Google Scholar, 16Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schröder H. Klutzny M. Kirscht S. Kreienkamp H.J. Höllt V. Schulz S. J. Biol.

Briefly, receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads preloaded with 10 μg of anti-HA antibodies. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting, membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-human PLD antibody (kindly provided by Dr. S. Ryu, Pohang, South Korea) or 1 μg/ml mouse anti-human ARF1 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 12 h at 4 °C. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (AmershamBiosciences). PLD activity was determined using a transphosphatidylation assay (18Kotter K. Klein J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2517-2523Google Scholar). HEK293 cells coexpressing MOR1 and PLD1b or PLD2 were kept in serum-free OPTIMEM containing [1,2,3-3H]glycerol (1 μCi/ml; specific activity 40 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h in order to label phospholipids. Cells were then exposed to serum-free medium containing drugs and 2% ethanol. The following drugs were added as aqueous solutions resulting in final concentrations of 1 μm DAMGO, 1 μm morphine, 1 μmphorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), 1 μm calphostin C, or 25 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) (all from Sigma). During the assay, BFA was added 15 min before PMA or agonists. After 30 min of drug treatment, cells were extracted in 2.5 ml of ice-cold methanol/water (3:2, v/v). Subsequently, 1.5 ml chloroform and 0.35 ml H2O were added, and the lipid phase was separated by thin layer chromatography using the lower phase of methanol/chloroform/water (10:10:9, v/v/v). Individual phospholipids were stained with iodine, identified by standards, and spots corresponding to phosphatidylethanol (PtdEtOH), PA, and PC were isolated and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. PLD activity was expressed as percent [3H]PtdEtOH of the total cellular PC concentration. HEK293 cells stable expressing MOR1 or coexpressing MOR1 and PLD2 were grown onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips overnight. Cells were then exposed to 1 μm DAMGO or 1 μm morphine for 30 min at 37 °C to induce receptor endocytosis with or without 1 μm PMA stimulation. Cell fixation, antibody incubation, and confocal analysis were carried out as previously described (15Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Google Scholar, 16Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schröder H. Klutzny M. Kirscht S. Kreienkamp H.J. Höllt V. Schulz S. J. Biol.

Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 per well and grown onto poly-l-lysine-treated 24-well plates overnight. After washing, cells were preincubated with 1 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-HA antibody for 2 h in OPTIMEM 1 (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Cells were then treated as indicated with 1 μmDAMGO, 1 μm morphine, and/or 1 μm PMA, 1% butanol, or 1% isobutyl alcohol in OPTIMEM for 60 min. To prevent receptors from recycling back to the plasma membrane, the culture medium was supplemented with 50 μm monensin. Subsequently, cells were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were developed with 250 μl of ABTS solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 10–30 min, 200 μl of the substrate solution from each well were transferred to a 96-well plate and analyzed at 405 nm using a microplate reader. To identify tail-interacting proteins that could modulate endocytosis of rat μ-opioid receptor we used the yeast two-hybrid system (MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid-System 3); (Clontech). A yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat cDNA library using the rat MOR1-tail domain (COOH-terminal amino acids 340–398) as bait led to the finding of a cDNA encoding only the NH2-terminal amino acids 116–226 (representing exons 4–8) of PLD2. This NH2-terminal fragment of the PLD2 harbors a major part of the phosphoinositide-binding Phox homologous (PX) domain (amino acids 63–192) of the enzyme. The interaction between the COOH terminus of MOR1 (fused with Gal4 binding domain as bait protein) and the NH2-terminal domain of PLD2 (fused with the Gal4-activating domain) was verified in a yeast mating and β-galactosidase assay according to the protocol of the manufacturer. As negative control empty Gal4-BD with Gal4-AD-PLD2 and empty Gal4-AD vector with Gal4-BD-MOR1, as well as a fusion of Gal4-BD with human lamin C, which neither forms complexes nor interacts with most other proteins, were used. Since PLD2 activation has been previously described for various G protein-coupled receptors, the association of MOR1 and PLD2 indicated that agonist stimulation of the MOR1 might activate the PLD2. Therefore, we stable expressed MOR1 and full-length human PLD2 in HEK293 cells. MOR1 and PLD2 expression was monitored by ligand binding experiments, Western blot, and immunocytochemical analyses. Saturation binding experiments (n = 3–5) revealed no substantial differences between MOR1 and MOR1-PLD2 expressing cells with respect to their affinities (K D) to [3H]DAMGO (1.4 ± 0.3 nm and 1.4 ± 0.4 nm for MOR1 and MOR1-PLD2, respectively) and their numbers of binding sites (Bmax) (1329 ± 399 fmol/mg protein and 938 ± 107 fmol/mg protein for MOR1 and MOR1-PLD2, respectively). We then incubated MOR1-PLD2 expressing HEK293 cells for 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min with the μ-agonist DAMGO and determined the relative PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, treatment with the μ-receptor selective agonist DAMGO led to a time-dependent increase in the PLD2 activity with a maximum (3-fold increase in activity) after 30 min, whereas an incubation for 30 min with morphine failed to induce activation of PLD2. The observed DAMGO-induced PLD2 activation was opioid receptor-mediated, because it could be completely blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. Activation of PKC by PMA also promoted a 4.5-fold increase in PLD2 activity, which was not blocked by naloxone (data not shown). Furthermore, DAMGO-mediated activation of PLD2 could not be blocked by the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (Fig. 1 B), indicating that activation of PKC seems not to play a major role in the opioid receptor-induced PLD2 activation in these cells. We therefore examined whether activation of PLD2 by the opioid receptor involves ARF-GTP proteins. Fig. 1 B shows that DAMGO-mediated activation of PLD2 was completely blocked by the ARF inhibitor brefeldin A indicating that PLD2 activation by the μ-opioid receptor is ARF-dependent. BFA had no effect on the PMA-induced PLD2 activation (data not shown). In MOR1 and human PLD1b coexpressing HEK293 cells, PLD1b activity was stimulated by PMA treatment, whereas DAMGO incubation did not lead to an increase in the PLD1b activity (Fig. 1 C) indicating that the opioid receptor specifically activates PLD2. To analyze an interaction between MOR1, PLD1b, PLD2, and ARF1 in HEK293 cells, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation studies. Expression of HAMOR1, PLD1b, PLD2, and ARF was examined by directly immunoblotting lysates from these cells with specific antibodies against HA tag, PLD1b, PLD2, or ARF1 (Fig. 2, lysate). For coimmunoprecipitation, HAMOR1 receptors were precipitated from lysates of HAMOR1-expressing cells and cells coexpressing HAMOR1 and PLD1b or PLD2 using anti-HA antibodies. The resulting precipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies directed against PLD1b, PLD2, or ARF1. As shown in Fig. 2 A (lanes 2 and 3), PLD2 was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells coexpressing HAMOR1 and PLD2, suggesting that MOR1 is physically associated with PLD2 in vivo. Surprisingly, after agonist treatment we observed a decrease in the amount of coimmunoprecipitated PLD2 in HAMOR1-PLD2-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). In immunoprecipitates from HAMOR1-expressing control cells no PLD2 was detected, which might be because of the low basal PLD2 expression levels (Fig.2 A, lane 4). In addition, ARF was coimmunoprecipitated from HAMOR1-PLD2-coexpressing cells but not from cells stable expressing HAMOR1 alone (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4), indicating that ARF binds to the HAMOR1-PLD2 signaling complex and not directly to the MOR1 receptor. After DAMGO treatment an increase in the amount of coimmunoprecipitated ARF protein was detected in HAMOR1-PLD2 cells (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). PLD2 and ARF were not nonspecifically immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, because in PLD2-expressing control cells no PLD2 and ARF were detected after precipitation with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). Furthermore, from HAMOR1-PLD1b-coexpressing control cells no PLD1b or ARF was coimmunoprecipitated with MOR1 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) indicating that MOR1 is not associated with PLD1b in vivo. First, we examined the subcellular distribution of HAMOR1 and PLD2 using double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.3, A and A′, both MOR1 and PLD2 were confined to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells. To test the possibility that physical association would promote cointernalization of PLD2 and MOR1 after agonist-exposure, MOR1-PLD2-expressing cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μm DAMGO for 30 min. The results in Fig. 3, Band B′ reveal that the MOR1 receptor is rapidly internalized while PLD2 remained at the plasma membrane. We next examined whether the activation of PLD2 by the μ-opioid receptor influences the agonist-induced receptor endocytosis. Therefore, HEK293 cells stable expressing HAMOR1 or HAMOR1 and PLD2 were incubated with anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C to label cell surface receptors. The cells were then treated with DAMGO, morphine in the presence or absence of the PKC activator PMA for 30 min at 37 °C. During the experiment, the culture medium was supplemented with 50 μm monensin to prevent internalized receptors from recycling back to the plasma membrane. Cells were subsequently fixed, permeabilized, and bound anti-HA antibodies were immunofluorescently detected. The subcellular distribution of the receptor proteins was then analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fig.4 shows that without agonist incubation (control), μ-opioid receptors were almost exclusively confined to the plasma membrane. After 30 min of DAMGO incubation at 37 °C, the μ-opioid receptor exhibited robust receptor endocytosis. In contrast, after incubation with morphine the MOR1 receptor was highly resistant to agonist-mediated endocytosis. Preincubation with PKC activator PMA alone did not increase the endocytosis of MOR1. In the presence of overexpressed PLD2, however, the combination of morphine and PMA resulted in a robust receptor internalization suggesting that both the agonist-induced conformational change and stimulation of PLD2 activity were required for receptor endocytosis under these conditions. Quantitative analysis of receptor endocytosis by ELISA confirmed that in HAMOR1-PLD2 coexpressing HEK293 cells, PMA treatment enhances the rate of receptor endocytosis after both DAMGO and morphine in HAMOR1-PLD2 coexpressing HEK293 cells (Fig.5). In contrast, in cells expressing the MOR1 receptor alone, PMA treatment did not significantly affect the rate of agonist-mediated receptor endocytosis indicating that the PMA-induced facilitation of receptor endocytosis depends on PLD2 and is not simply caused by increased PKC activity in these cells. Next, we examined whether the production of PA by PLD2 is required for the induction of opioid receptor endocytosis in HEK293 cells. For inhibition of PA production the primary alcohol 1-butanol was used, which is known to be preferentially used over water by PLD2 in the transphosphatidylation reaction to generate phosphatidylalcohol instead of phosphatidic acid. This reaction is highly specific for primary alcohols, whereas secondary alcohols (such as isobutyl alcohol) are not utilized by PLD2 (1Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 1-9Google Scholar). Since 1.5% of butanol was found to inhibit the PLD activity but also to induce toxic effects (19Skippen A. Jones D.H. Morgan C.P. Li M. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5823-5831Google Scholar), we used 1% of butanol for inhibition of PA production. Fig. 6 A shows that DAMGO-mediated endocytosis of HAMOR1 was strongly inhibited by the primary alcohol (1-butanol) but not the secondary alcohol (isobutyl alcohol). This inhibitory effect of primary alcohol (1-butanol) on the agonist-induced endocytosis of the μ-opioid receptor was confirmed by quantitative analysis (Fig. 6 B). These data strongly suggest that PA production by PLD2 is required for the induction of opioid receptor endocytosis. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the NH2 terminus of the PLD2 as the important MOR1 interacting site of the enzyme. This region harbors the phosphoinositide binding domain of the PLD2 but lacks the PLD2 active site motif. After overexpression of the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1–235) of the PLD2 in HAMOR1 cells (HAMOR1-nPLD2), the DAMGO-induced MOR1-internalization was reduced by nearly 50% compared with control cells expressing HAMOR1 alone (Fig.7), suggesting that nPLD2 competes for binding of full-length endogenous PLD2 to MOR1 and impairs opioid receptor-mediated PLD2 activation and subsequent receptor internalization. Furthermore, costimulation of HAMOR1-nPLD2-expressing cells with DAMGO and PMA resulted in a restoration of receptor endocytosis to the same extent as in HAMOR1-expressing cells (Fig. 7), indicating that PMA stimulation of PLD2 bypasses the nPLD2-mediated impairment of opioid receptor induced PLD2 activation. This effect is not simply due to increased PKC activity in these cells, because PMA treatment alone did not induce the endocytosis of MOR1 in both HAMOR1- and HAMOR1-nPLD2-expressing cells. Stimulation of PLD activity has been observed for numerous G protein-coupled receptors including the VPAC 1 and 2 (for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) receptors, PAC1 (for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide) receptor (20McCulloch D.A.

McClue S.J. Carr I.C. Jess T. Wakelam M.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2149-2156Google Scholar), and the D2 dopamine receptor (26Senogles S.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 455-462Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of PLD activation by G protein-coupled receptors as well as the cellular functions of activated PLD are still incompletely understood. For the first time, the present study provides evidence for an essential role of PLD2 in agonist-induced endocytosis of a G protein-coupled receptor namely the μ-opioid receptor. The present study demonstrates that the μ-opioid receptor interacts specifically with PLD2 and not with PLD1b. Using a yeast two-hybrid technique we identified the Phox homologous (PX) domain in the NH2 terminus of the PLD2 to be the important site for the interaction with the COOH terminus of the μ-opioid receptor. PX domains are known to be phosphoinositide-binding motifs found in a number of signaling and adapter proteins (Ref. 27Xu Y. Seet L.F. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 513-530Google Scholar for review), but their precise function is still poorly defined. Recently, PX domains in proteins mediating the protein trafficking were shown to be required not only for the association with cellular membranes but also for the association with various receptors (e.g. epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor) (28Phillips S.A. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Haft C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5074-5084Google Scholar, 29Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Google Scholar). The fact that PX domains are present in the NH2 terminus of both PLD1b and PLD2, whereas only PLD2 was found to be associated with the μ-opioid receptor might be due mainly to sequence differences in the NH2 termini of PLD1b and PLD2. The specific interaction between MOR1 and PLD2 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells stable expressing MOR1 and PLD2. The interaction between MOR1 and PLD2 was shown to be constitutive and not inducible by agonist-treatment. In HAMOR1-PLD2 cells ∼68% of the expressed PLD2 was coimmunoprecipitated with the MOR1, whereas agonist-stimulation resulted in only ∼35% coimmunoprecipitated PLD2. This reduction might be due to the separation of MOR1 and membranal localized PLD2 after agonist-induced receptor internalization. It was further shown that stimulating the μ-opioid receptor with DAMGO activates PLD2 and that this DAMGO-mediated elevation of PLD2 activity was completely blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. The DAMGO-mediated PLD2 activation was ARF-dependent because it was completely blocked by the ARF inhibitor brefeldin A, which inhibits ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange proteins by locking them in an abortive complex with ARF-GDP. In addition, after DAMGO stimulation a 50% increase in the amount of coimmunoprecipitated ARF1 with MOR1 was detected. Thus, it is possible that the opioid-mediated PLD2 stimulation may involve a direct interaction of the μ-opoid receptor with small G proteins,e.g. ARF. The NPXXY motif, which is highly conserved within the seventh transmembrane domain of many G protein-coupled receptors including the μ-opioid receptor, was previously demonstrated to represent a specific ARF binding site implicated in receptor-mediated PLD activation (30Mitchell R. McCulloch D. Lutz E. Johnson M. MacKenzie C. Fennell M. Fink G. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 411-414Google Scholar). However, for coimmunoprecipitation of MOR1 and ARF the presence of PLD2 seemed to be required, because ARF was only detected in coimmunoprecipitates from MOR1-PLD2- but not from MOR1-expressing cells. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ARF binds directly to PLD2 rather than to MOR1, but it cannot be excluded that a conformational change of MOR1 in the MOR1-PLD2 signaling complex is necessary to facilitate ARF binding to MOR1. However, after agonist-stimulation we observed an increase in the coimmunoprecipitation of ARF (from ∼4 to ∼8% of total ARF) from MOR1-PLD2-expressing cells supporting the hypothesis of an ARF-dependent activation pathway of PLD2 by MOR1. We further demonstrate that PLD2 can be activated by heterologous stimulation of PKC with PMA. However, the finding that DAMGO-induced PLD2 stimulation was not blocked by calphostin C suggests that PKC is not required for opioid receptor-mediated activation of PLD2. Similar to phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and sphingomyelinase, PLD2 is a signal- and receptor-activated phospholipase; however, little is known about the cellular effects of PLD2 and its primary metabolite PA. It has been demonstrated that the second messenger PA can activate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5-kinase leading to the production of PIP2 (31Moritz A. De Graan P.N. Gispen W.H. Wirtz K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7207-7210Google Scholar, 32Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Google Scholar), which can further activate PLD in a positive feedback. In addition, an increase in the level of PA after PLD activation results in a change of the physical properties, e.g. charge and pH, of cellular membranes, thereby facilitating vesicle formation. Whereas PLD1 seems to play a role for the vesicle formation from the Golgi apparatus (33Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Google Scholar,34Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Google Scholar), PLD2 has been suggested to be involved in vesicle formation from the plasma membrane (9Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that local activation of PLD2 by the μ-opioid receptor might play a key role in the stimulation of vesicle formation during μ-opioid receptor endocytosis. Because PLD2 levels in wild-type HEK293 cells were below the detection limit in Western blot and immunocytochemical assays, we stably coexpressed PLD2 and MOR1. Immunocytochemical studies revealed that both proteins were localized at the plasma membrane and that coexpression of PLD2 led to a significant increase in the agonist-induced endocytosis of the μ-opioid receptor. However, cointernalization of PLD2 and MOR1 was not observed in agonist-treated HAMOR1-PLD2-expressing cells. On the other hand, preventing the PLD2-mediated production of PA by treatment with the primary alcohol (1-butanol) led to an ∼80% reduction of agonist-induced receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, overexpression of an inactive nPLD2 mutant which competes for binding of full-length PLD2 to the MOR1 resulted in a ∼50% reduction of agonist-induced receptor endocytosis. Heterologous activation of endogenous PLD2 by PMA together with DAMGO-treatment bypasses the nPLD2-mediated block of receptor-induced activation of PLD2 and led to a robust μ receptor internalization in HAMOR1-nPLD2-expressing cells. In addition, it should be noted that morphine, which failed to induce μ-opioid receptor internalization, did not activate PLD2. However, heterologous PLD2 activation by PMA permitted morphine to induce robust μ receptor internalization suggesting that both the agonist-induced conformational change and stimulation of PLD2 activity were required for receptor endocytosis. Desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor after agonist-treatment is induced by a rapid receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding resulting in an uncoupling of the receptor from G proteins (15Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Google Scholar, 35Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y.

Gainetdinov R.R. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 720-723Google Scholar). Since morphine failed to induce μ-opioid receptor internalization, it was speculated that morphine restrains the MOR1 receptor in a conformation that is recalcitrant to GRK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent β-arrestin binding (15Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Google Scholar, 38Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Google Scholar). This is supported by our previous finding that morphine failed to induce MOR1 phosphorylation, whereas splice variants (MOR1D and MOR1E) of the mouse μ-opioid receptor, which are internalized after morphine treatment, revealed a marked morphine-induced receptor phosphorylation (15Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schröder H. Kahl E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Google Scholar). Moreover, β-arrestin was shown to interact with β2-adaptin (AP-2) leading to the initiation of clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis (39Laporte S.A. Miller W.E. Kim K.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9247-9254Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the recruitment of AP-2 is facilitated by the acidic phospholipid-enriched membrane resulting from PA production by ARF-activated PLD2 (40Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Google Scholar, 41De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Google Scholar). This indicates that receptor endocytosis can be modulated not only by receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding but also by the PLD2-mediated PA production which, in turn, facilitates recruitment of AP-2 and clathrin to the plasma membrane. Consistent with this hypothesis we observed that inhibition of PLD2 activity led to a marked decrease in receptor endocytosis, whereas activation of PLD2 by PKC resulted in an enhanced agonist-induced endocytosis of the μ-opioid receptor even after morphine treatment. Thus, it can be suggested that activation of PLD2 may be a key step during the induction of agonist-mediated endocytosis of the μ-opioid receptor.

Here, we demonstrated the physical interaction of FKHR with hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4, a member of steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily, and the repression of HNF-4 transactivation by FKHR. FKHR interacted with the DNA binding domain of HNF-4 and inhibited HNF-4 binding to the cognate DNA. Furthermore, the binding affinity of HNF-4 with phosphorylated FKHR significantly decreased in comparison to that with unphosphorylated FKHR. Therefore, a phosphorylation of FKHR by insulin followed by its dissociation from HNF-4 and the redistribution of FKHR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm would expect to induce the transcriptional activation of HNF-4 by facilitating to the access of HNF-4 to its DNA element. Indeed, most intriguingly, insulin stimulation reversed the repression of HNF-4 transcriptional activity by phosphorylation-sensitive (wild-type) FKHR, but not by phosphorylation-deficient FKHR.

Insulin has a dynamic effect on the localization of FKHR, when phosphorylated by Akt at the three residues of FKHR: Thr-24, Ser-253, and Ser-316.

In the present study, we analyzed the interaction of FKHR with HNF-4, the effect of FKHR on the transactivation mediated by HNF-4, and its molecular mechanism. FKHR associates with HNF-4 in vivo and in vitro and represses the transactivation by HNF-4 through the decrease in its DNA binding affinity. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect is canceled by insulin, resulting from the dissociation of HNF-4 from phosphorylated FKHR that subsequently translocates to the cytoplasm. This suggests the possibility that HNF-4 is a novel downstream target of insulin via FKHR as a signal-regulated transcriptional inhibitor. HepG2 cells were cultured in Dalbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed by FuGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty ng of pCMV-βgal plasmid were included in each transfection experiment to control for the efficiency of transfection. To ensure equal DNA amounts, empty plasmids were added in each transfection. The luciferase activity was measured with an ARVO™SX (Wallac Berthold). The values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. The hHNF-4 α2 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 tagged with the HA epitope (pcDNA3HA). A series of HNF-4 deletion fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or pcDNA3HA. The pGAL4-HNF-4 vector was made by subcloning hHNF-4 α2 cDNA tagged with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) of pGBT9 (Clontech) at the N terminus into pcDNA3. pGAL4 control vector, pHNF4-tk-Luc, pG5b-Luc, pcDNA3-FLAG-FKHR-wild-type, and 3A mutant were described previously (18Miyagishi M.

[35S]Methionine-labeled FKHR was prepared byin vitro translation with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with T7 RNA polymerase. 293T whole cell extracts that transiently expressed full-length HNF-4 or its deletion mutants were prepared with 1xlysis buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mmDTT). For GST pull-down assay, [35S]methionine-labeled FKHR or 200 μg of 293T whole cell extracts were incubated with about 20 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 4 h in 1 ml of the HEPES binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 200–300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitors). After washing the beads with HEPES binding buffer, the pull-down complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were performed immunoblotting with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody or analyzed using the imaging analyzer. Approximately 200 μg of HepG2 nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FKHR antibody in IP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitors). Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates was done using anti-FKHR antibody or anti-HNF-4 antibody as described previously (19Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K.

Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody (PL14, Medical Biological Laboratory). The kinase reaction was performed using CA or DN form Myc-Akt, 2 μg of purified GST fusion protein as a substrate, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm ATP in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm βglycerophosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm Na3VO4) for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction products were resolved by SDS/PAGE and analyzed with a bio-imaging analyzer. In vitro kinase assay for GST pull-down assay was performed with [35S]methionine-labeled FKHR wt and 3A mutant, 0.7 mm ATP, and activated Akt (Upstate Biotechnology) in a kinase reaction buffer. After each reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C, GST pull-down assay was performed with HEPES binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, protease inhibitors). In vitro translated HNF-4 was synthesized in the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with T7 RNA polymerase. GST-FKHR or GST was expressed in Escherichia coli strains BL21, purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads, eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm reduced glutathione), dialyzed to reaction buffer (22Yanai K.

Four microliters of in vitro translated HNF-4 were incubated with 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and GST-FKHR or GST at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 2 μl of anti-HNF-4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), subsequently added end-labeled oligonucleotide (0.14 ng, 11,000 cpm) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min.

The reaction mixtures were directly loaded onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels made in 1 × TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis was performed at 130 V for 3 h at 4 °C, the gels were dried and analyzed with a bio-imaging analyzer. HepG2 cells were plated onto glass coverslips at 20% confluence and transfected using FuGENE-6 regents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) contained 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and sequentially serum-free DMEM for 4 h and then stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 45 min. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (18Miyagishi M. Fujii R. Hatta M. Yoshida E. Araya N. Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, cells were incubated with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution; 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution; M2, Sigma), followed by staining with Cy5-conjugated anti-rat and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution each; Amersham Biosciences). Anti-HNF-4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a GST-HNF-4-(133–366). Anti-FKHR rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a GST-FKHR-(541–652). GST pull-down assay was conducted to test whether FKHR could interact with HNF-4. 293T whole cell extracts, transiently expressed HA-HNF-4, were incubated with GST or GST-FKHR fusion protein. As seen in Fig.1A, HA-HNF-4 associated with GST-FKHR but failed to bind to GST protein. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assay was carried out to confirm the interaction between HNF-4 and FKHR in HepG2. FKHR was immunoprecipitated with anti-FKHR antibody from HepG2 cells, and the immune complexes were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with antibodies against FKHR or HNF-4. The FKHR-precipitated complexes included HNF-4 (Fig. 1B), demonstrating the in vivo interaction between FKHR and HNF-4. To determine the domain of HNF-4 involved in the interaction with FKHR, each of the HA-tagged HNF-4 N-, M-, and C-fragments expressed in 293T was incubated with GST or GST FKHR fusion protein (Fig. 1C). FKHR associated with the N-region but neither with the M- nor C-region of HNF-4 (Fig. 1D). The N-terminal fragment contains several functional domains, such as AF1, a DNA binding domain, and a part of AF2. To define which domains of HNF-4 could associate with FKHR, it was expressed using in vitrotranscription/translation and tested for the interaction with GST-HNF-4 subregions using GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 1E, FKHR interacted with the NM fragment of HNF-4 containing the DNA binding domain. To investigate the functional significance of this association, a luciferase reporter assay using the eight copies of the HNF-4 binding element was conducted. HNF-4 enhanced promoter activity, but FKHR did not alter it (Fig.2A). When FKHR wt was cotransfected along with HNF-4, luciferase activity was strongly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The FKHR 3A mutant, in which three putative Akt phosphorylation sites (Thr-24, Ser-253, and Ser-316) were replaced by a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue, resulting in the predominant localization in the nucleus, repressed the reporter activity more dramatic than FKHR wt. These data prompted us to propose the hypothesis that FKHR may inhibit the binding of HNF-4 to the cognate DNA and repress the transactivation. To determine whether FKHR could inhibit the transactivation by an HNF-4 tethered to DNA by a heterologous DNA binding domain, the luciferase reporter assay using Gal4-HNF-4 fusion was conducted. The transactivation by Gal4-HNF-4 fusion was not repressed by FKHR (Fig.2B). EMSA indicated that GST-FKHR prevented HNF-4 from binding to its recognition motif in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a control GST protein did not (Fig. 2C). These data suggested that the transcriptional reduction of HNF-4 results from the inhibitory effect of FKHR on HNF-4 binding to target DNA elements. We tested a possible role of insulin in the repression of HNF-4-mediated transcriptional activity by FKHR. Whereas insulin did not alter the HNF-4-mediated transcriptional activity, insulin restored that activity, in the presence of cotransfected FKHR wt, to 80% of the HNF-4-mediated transcriptional activity, but not FKHR 3A mutant (Fig. 3A). As a step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of this restoration, we first investigated the effect of Akt phosphorylation on HNF-4 because of being a putative Akt phosphorylation site (RXRXXS/T) in the NM region of HNF-4 (RDRIST: 125–130 amino acids). To determine whether HNF-4 is a substrate of Aktin vitro, GST-full-length HNF-4 or GST-HNF4 NM region was bacterially expressed for this assay. The CA, but not DN, form of Akt immunoprecipitated from 293T cells effectively phosphorylated GST FKHR as a positive control. However, CA-Akt failed to phosphorylate GST-full-length HNF-4 or GST-HNF4 NM region in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3B), suggesting that insulin stimulation via the PI3K/Akt pathway induced the phosphorylation of FKHR, but not that of HNF-4. We next investigated the subcellular localization of FKHR in the presence of HNF-4. We coexpressed HNF-4 and FKHR in HepG2 cells in the absence or presence of insulin. Whereas HNF-4 was exclusively in the nucleus when exposed to insulin, FKHR was found to be predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). To examine whether the FKHR phosphorylation by Akt affects its binding affinity with HNF-4, we performed the GST pull-down assay using FKHR mutants (3A, 3D, and S253D). HNF-4 bound to unphosphorylated FKHR wt with the same affinity as the FKHR 3A mutant (Fig.3D, left). However, the binding affinity of FKHR wt phosphorylated by Akt with HNF-4 significantly decreased in comparison to that of FKHR 3A mutant (Fig. 3D,right). Next, we tested FKHR mutants, in which Thr-24/Ser-253/Ser-316 or Ser-253 was replaced by an aspartic acid residue, to mimic the effect of phosphorylation. The FKHR mutants (3D and S253D) interacted with HNF-4 weaker than FKHR wt (Fig. 3,E and F). Taken together, these findings suggest that insulin stimulation promotes the dissociation of HNF-4 from FKHR, resulting in its subsequent retention into the cytoplasm, and reverses the inhibitory effects of FKHR on the transactivation by HNF-4 through facilitating the access to the target elements. FKHR binds to specific DNA elements and activates its transcription in the nucleus. Once cells are exposed to extracellular signals, such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), PI3K-regulated kinase Akt phosphorylates FKHR, thereby inducing the exit of FKHR from the nucleus and the repression of FKHR-dependent transcription (12Nakae J.

Our data showed that FKHR associated with the DNA binding domain of HNF-4 and inhibited the access of HNF-4 to its binding element, leading to repress HNF-4 mediated transactivation. Moreover, one striking finding is that insulin stimulation reversed the repression by FKHR wt, but not by the FKHR 3A mutant, suggesting that the reverse regulation might result from insulin dependent shuttling of FKHR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It has been reported that the localization of FKHR is altered through a phosphorylation by various kinases, such as CK1, DYRA1A, and SGK in addition to Akt (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

These observations raise the possibility that HNF-4 may be a “downstream target” of diverse signals mediated by the above kinases via FKHR. Recent reports have shown that the DNA binding activity of HNF-4 is modulated by diet in vivo. Namely, the HNF-4 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of fasted rat liver was markedly reduced in comparison with that of refed rat liver in EMSA, at least resulting from the phosphorylation of HNF-4 by PKA (9Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We illustrated that the HNF-4 DNA binding activity was decreased by the interaction of HNF-4 with FKHR. It is known that the physiological effects of fasting are mediated by the activation of cAMP-dependent PKA, coincident with the inactivation of Akt by the decrease in insulin secretion. Therefore, because of not only the phosphorylation of HNF-4 by PKA but also the reinforced interaction of HNF-4 with FKHR resulting from the translocation of FKHR to the nucleus, the DNA binding activity of HNF-4 to the target DNA elements might be decreased in the fasted states. The primary target tissues for insulin are muscle, adipose tissue, and liver. Tissue-specific knock-out of the insulin receptor in muscle failed to produce diabetes, but disruption of the gene in the liver exhibited a diabetic phenotype, suggesting that insulin actions in the liver play central roles in glucose homeostasis (30Bruning J.C.

Insulin decreases transcription of the genes encoding gluconeogenic enzymes and increases transcription of those encoding glycolytic enzymes in the liver. A number of studies have established that FKHR activates the transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes in the absence of insulin and inhibits the transcription in the presence of insulin. On the other hand, HNF-4 positively regulates the genes involved in glucose transport and glycolysis (4Diaz Guerra M.J. Bergot M.O. Martinez A. Cuif M.H. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Here, we provided a novel mechanism that insulin reversed the repression of HNF-4 transcriptional activity by FKHR. One might expect that in the fasted state, FKHR as an inhibitor of HNF-4 represses glycolysis, whereas FKHR as a DNA binding transcription factor enhanced gluconeogenesis, leading to glucose secretion. In contrast, in the fed state, because FKHR phosphorylated by insulin translocates into the cytoplasm following the dissociation from HNF-4, HNF-4 that is released from FKHR promotes the glucose transport and glycolysis, leading to glucose uptake. The identification of an insulin-regulated transcriptional inhibitor, FKHR, might assist in clarifying a molecular mechanism of glucose homeostasis.

Two major control circuits, specific induction and general carbon catabolite repression (CCR),1 enable considerable versatility in utilizing a wide range of carbon sources while preferentially consuming readily available substrates of high nutritional value before less accessible ones. In A. nidulans, CCR is ultimately mediated by the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor CreA, which prevents activation of the catabolism of less preferred carbon sources if a more favorable growth substrate is available (1Arst Jr., H.N.

The presence of a high concentration of a repressing growth substrate, not restricted to d-glucose, is necessary to trigger the CCR response. Much is known about the targeting of transcriptional control of nutrient utilization in A. nidulans, the molecular means by which induction and repression are imposed on the promoter regions of genes subject to catabolic regulation. In the inducible ethanol utilization pathway, the functional cis-acting elements conferring induction and repression, the target sequences of the DNA-binding activator AlcR and the general CCR-repressor, have been identified in the regulatory alcR gene encoding the pathway-specific activator and the structural genes for alcohol dehydrogenase I and aldehyde dehydrogenase, alcA andaldA, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 4Felenbok B.

Far less is known about the means by which the CreA repressor becomes functional in response to repressing carbon sources and how the repressional regulatory circuit adapts to changing nutrient conditions,e.g. upon exhaustion of a preferable carbon source. It has been shown that transcription of the creA gene itself is negatively autoregulated in response to repressing carbon sources, leading to a reduced steady-state creA transcript level (17Strauss J. Horvath H.K. Abdallah B.M. Kindermann J. Mach R.L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 169-178Google Scholar). However, the CCR-repressor function appears to be mainly controlled at the post-transcriptional or post-translational level (17Strauss J. Horvath H.K. Abdallah B.M. Kindermann J. Mach R.L. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 169-178Google Scholar, 18Vautard-Mey G. Cotton P. Fèvre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 252-259Google Scholar, 19Vautard-Mey G. Fèvre M. Curr.

In A. nidulans, strains mutant in two additional genes, creB and creC, exhibit some derepressed characteristics similar to those observed in loss-of-functioncreA mutants but also show a number of phenotypes not related to CCR (21Hynes M.J. Kelly J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 150: 193-204Google Scholar, 22Arst, H. N., Jr., Genetics as a Tool in Microbiology, Society for General Microbiology Symposium, Cambridge, UK, April 1981, Glover, S. W., Hopwood, D. A., 31, 1981, 131, 160, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.Google Scholar). These two genes have been characterized recently and, interestingly, S. cerevisiae does not appear to harbor any close homologues (23Todd R.B. Lockington R.A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 561-570Google Scholar, 24Lockington R.A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1311-1321Google Scholar). Still less is known about the sensing of repressing compounds and the means by which such compounds trigger the CCR response in filamentous fungi. In S. cerevisiae, an important role in the glucose-sensing process has been ascribed to hexokinase Hxk2p, an enzyme catalyzing the first step in glycolysis and glucose fermentation, phosphorylation of d-glucose at C6 (reviewed in Ref. 6Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Google Scholar). Baker's yeast actually specifies three enzymes capable of this phosphorylation, hexokinases (Hxk: EC 2.7.1.1) Hxk1p and Hxk2p, and glucokinase (Glk: EC 2.7.1.2) Glk1p (25Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 639-645Google Scholar). Any one suffices for growth on glucose, but Hxk2p is the main activity for phosphorylating glucose because it is predominantly expressed during fermentation (26Gancedo J.M. Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4443-4444Google Scholar,27Rodrı́guez A. de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 625-631Google Scholar). Concomitantly, only this isozyme is essential for repression of catabolism of alternative carbon sources such as sucrose and maltose; loss-of-function hxk2 mutants are defective in glucose repression mediated by Mig1p (28Entian K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 633-637Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 6Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Google Scholar and 29Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 183-201Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Hxk2p participates in glucose repression remains obscure to date. In general, a strong correlation is found between the capacity of mutant Hxk2p to phosphorylate glucose or fructose and CCR by these two sugars (30Ma H. Bloom L.M. Walsh C.T. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5643-5649Google Scholar, 31Rose M. Albig W. Entian K.-D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 511-518Google Scholar). However, catalytic activity of Hxk2p might not be essential for glucose repression; rather, signal transmission might be linked to Hxk2p conformational changes induced by the sugar and ATP (32Hohmann S. Winderickx J. de Winde J.H. Valckx D. Cobbaert P. Luyten K. de Meirsman C. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 703-714Google Scholar, 33Kraakman L.S. Winderickx J.

In the filamentous fungus A. nidulans, hexose phosphorylation was previously studied in the d-fructose non-utilizing frA1 (舠fructokinase舡) mutant (35Roberts C.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1963; 31: 45-58Google Scholar, 36Ruijter G.J.G. Panneman H. van den Broeck H.C. Bennett J.M. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 223-228Google Scholar). This mutant lacks Hxk activity but, unlike the situation in S. cerevisiae, its glucose CCR of ethanol and l-arabinose catabolism appeared fully functional. Here, we have utilized three carbon utilization systems, ethanol (alcA andalcR genes), xylan (xlnA), and acetate (facA), to investigate the role of hexose kinases in CCR at the transcript level. The previously mentioned Hxk mutant (frA1, herein renamed hxkA1) as well as newly obtained Glk (glkA4) and hexose kinase double mutants(hxkA/glkA4) were studied. We show that the two hexose kinases play parallel roles in glucose repression in the model organism A. nidulans. A. nidulans strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The references refer to the mutations relevant to this work. Other markers are in standard use (37Clutterbuck A.J. O'Brien S.J. 6th Ed. Genetic Maps. Locus Maps of Complex Genomes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 3.71-3.84Google Scholar). Media composition, supplements, and basic growth conditions at 37 °C were as described by Cove (38Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Google Scholar), using di-ammonium tartrate (5 mm) as the nitrogen source and the various carbon sources at 17 (w/v or v/v), unless stated otherwise. Conidiospores were obtained on solidified complete medium with either glycerol or sodium d-gluconate as the carbon source. Mycelia for enzyme assays were grown on glycerol minimal medium for 16 h and then transferred to fresh minimal medium containing 17 (v/v) ethanol and 17 (w/v) d-glucose ord-fructose and incubated for another 4 h prior to harvesting. Mycelia for the analysis of alc andfacA transcription were grown for 10–12 h in minimal medium with glycerol as the carbon source and urea (5 mm) as the nitrogen source. For the analysis of xlnA transcription, sodium d-gluconate replaced glycerol and the incubation time was extended to 40 h. Induction was achieved by the addition of the inducer compounds specific for the three diagnostic systems examined, 2-butanone to 50 mm (final concentration) foralc, d-xylose to 50 mm forxlnA, or sodium acetate (pH 6.8) to 10 mm forfacA, respectively. Cultures were harvested after 2.5 h of further incubation (inducing conditions). For repressed conditions,d-glucose or d-fructose was added simultaneously with the inducer to a final concentration of 17 (w/v) (i.e. 55 mm). Noninduced mycelia were grown in the initial growth media during the induction period.Table IAspergillus nidulans strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferences for characterized mutation or strainBF054yA2 pabaA1BF110biA1 creAd3056Arst Jr., H.N.

Plenum Press, New York1974: 447-510Google Scholar). Following UV mutagenesis of a suspension of 106 conidiospores of G092 per ml, the survival rate was ∼257. Selection for resistance to 50 mg/l 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DOG) was done in the presence of 17 (v/v) glycerol as carbon source and 0.087 (w/v) sodium desoxycholate to reduce colony size. Resistant colonies were allowed to develop for 6 days at 37 °C, and mutants were purified using the same medium. Wild-type strain C62 was used to cross out the hxkA1(frA1) translocation in NW298 to yield single glucokinase (glkA4) mutants NW299 and NW300. Genetic mapping of theglkA4 mutation was only possible in a Hxk-deficient background (see 舠Results舡). 2DOG-resistant strain NW193 (glkA4 hxkA2) was crossed to CEA54 to exchange auxotrophic markers to facilitate the formation of a diploid between the progeny strain NW303 and the tester strain NW301, utilized in parasexual analysis to localize the glkA4 and hxkA2mutations (see Table I). Cell-free extracts were prepared from frozen mycelia in liquid nitrogen as described previously (36Ruijter G.J.G. Panneman H. van den Broeck H.C. Bennett J.M. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 223-228Google Scholar). All enzyme assays were done at 25 °C. Glucose- and fructose-phosphorylating activities in crude extracts were determined as described by Ruijteret al. (36Ruijter G.J.G. Panneman H. van den Broeck H.C. Bennett J.M. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 223-228Google Scholar). To distinguish better between in vitro Hxk and Glk activities, assays were performed in both the absence and presence of the Hxk-specific inhibitor trehalose-6-phosphate (40Blázquez M.A. Lagunas R. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 51-54Google Scholar). At 1 mm, the inhibitor reduced the measured Hxk activity to about 1/10 of its actual value (see TableII, compare with activities in the Glk mutant glkA4).Table IIPhosphorylation of glucose and fructose in extracts of various A. nidulans strainsRelevant genotypeCarbon source2-aThe transfer media contained ethanol (1 7 v/v) in addition to the indicated sugar to avoid starvation response in thehxkA1 and glkA4/hxkA1 mutant strains.

Total RNA was isolated from about 250 mg of mycelial powder, obtained by grinding mycelia in liquid nitrogen, with RNA Plus extraction solution (Qbiogene) following the manufacturer's instructions. It was further purified by precipitation in 3 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, for 2 h at −20 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and residual salt was removed by conventional alcohol precipitation. Northern analysis was carried out with 15-ॖg samples of glyoxal-treated total RNA (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with32P-labeled probes synthesized from DNA fragments from the cloned A. nidulans genes alcA (10Panozzo C. Cornillot E. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6367-6372Google Scholar),alcR (42Felenbok B. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Sibley S. Gwynne D.I. Davies R.W.

Hynes M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 87-92Google Scholar), andacnA (γ-actin) (45Fidel S. Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 283-293Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were exposed for various time periods to avoid film saturation. Intensities of the hybridization signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The γ-actin gene was used to normalize the data from a single membrane. For alc and facA, panelsA and C of Figs. 1 and Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 originate from a single membrane, enabling direct comparison among all principal strains. For xlnA, panels B of Figs. 1 and Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6originate from a single membrane, allowing direct comparison between wild type and the three different hexose kinase mutants. All expression experiments were repeated at least twice. To investigate the involvement of hexose phosphorylation in the signaling of d-glucose repression in filamentous fungi, we obtained new mutants lacking either Glk or both Glk and Hxk by classic means. d-Fructose non-utilizing Hxk-deficienthxkA1 (frA1) mutant strains are unable to phosphorylate fructose but grow quite well on glucose by virtue of Glk activity (36Ruijter G.J.G. Panneman H. van den Broeck H.C. Bennett J.M. Visser J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 139: 223-228Google Scholar). The selection of Glk mutations in a hxkA1strain was based on increased resistance to the toxic antimetabolite 2DOG in the presence of glycerol as sole carbon source (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡 for details). This glucose analogue is phosphorylated by either hexose kinase but cannot be catabolized any further (46Brown C.E. Romano A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1198-1203Google Scholar). Among the 2DOG-resistant mutants, several were unable to grow on glucose. The glucose non-utilizing mutant exhibiting the lowest residual glucose phosphorylating activity was chosen for further analysis. Fructose-utilizing (hxkA+) progeny from an outcross grew normally on glucose and were tested for hexose phosphorylating activities in crude extracts as compared with wild type, the 2DOG-resistant glucose non-utilizing parent, and the singlehxkA1 mutant. Some of the glucose- and fructose-utilizing progeny clearly lacked Glk activity (see TableII). The mutation resulting in the Glk lesion was designated glkA4. Other glucose and fructose non-utilizing mutants were selected for 2DOG resistance in an outcrossed glkA4 single mutant. Parasexual analysis of one such strain allocated glkA4 to chromosome III and the newly selected hxkA2 mutation, as expected, to chromosome IV (results not shown). We can conclude that only hexose kinase double mutants are unable to grow on glucose as sole carbon source. In contrast to the fructose non-utilizing Hxk mutants, the Glk mutant strains do not show any obvious nutritional deficiencies. Table II shows high levels of glucose and fructose phosphorylating activities in a glkA4 strain that are decreased drastically in the presence of the Hxk inhibitor trehalose-6-phosphate. This strongly suggests that Hxk can compensate the lack of Glk activity, allowing glkA4 mutants to grow normally on glucose. Similarly, Glk appears to compensate the absence of Hxk in hxkA1 for glucose phosphorylation and growth because reasonable levels of glucose phosphorylation were measured in the absence and presence of trehalose-6-phosphate (Table II). In agreement with nutritional phenotypes, only the double sugar kinase double mutant (hxkA1/glkA4) is unable to phosphorylate either hexose (Table II). The ethanol utilization (alc) pathway is convenient for studying the signaling of CCR because of its highly inducible structural (alcA) and regulatory (alcR) gene expression, the marginal levels of non-induced (constitutive) expression, and the high repressibility by CreA in the presence of repressing carbon sources like glucose, fructose, andd-xylose (Fig.1A). Competition between the pathway-specific activator AlcR and the general repressor CreA occurs in the alcA and alcR genes under all conditions of growth; alcR expression is, in addition, subject to direct repression by CreA (7Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Google Scholar, 8Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Google Scholar, 10Panozzo C. Cornillot E. Felenbok B. J. Biol.

A further advantage is the availability of an efficient gratuitous inducer, 2-butanone (47Flipphi M. Kocialkowska J. Felenbok B. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 25-31Google Scholar). The gene encoding xylanase A (X22) in A. nidulans, xlnA (43Pérez-González J.-A. de Graaff L.H. Visser J. Ramón D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2179-2182Google Scholar), was chosen as the second system (Fig. 1B). xlnA is one of the few genes in which a functional target site for CreA has been identified (13Orejas M. MacCabe A.P. Pérez-González J.-A. Kumar S. Ramón D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 177-184Google Scholar). In addition, the xlnR regulatory gene, encoding the pathway-specific activator, is most likely subject to CreA-mediated repression (48Orejas M. MacCabe A.P. Pérez-González J.-A. Kumar S. Ramón D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1517-1523Google Scholar). For expression of xlnA, induction is absolutely required. The simplest inducer,d-xylose (the monomer of xylan), is highly metabolizable and is strongly repressing at high concentrations (1Arst Jr., H.N. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 111-141Google Scholar). 2As confirmed by transcript analyses inalc (M. Flipphi and B. Felenbok, unpublished data). This pentose requires specific transport (see below). The xylanase system is extremely sensitive to repression. d-Gluconate as carbon source for growth allows reproducible glucose-repressible, xylose-inducible expression of xlnA in wild type but, as will be shown below, nevertheless exerts significant repression. The third system chosen is thefacA gene, encoding acetyl-CoA synthetase catalyzing the first step of acetate catabolism in A. nidulans (44Sandeman R.A. Hynes M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 87-92Google Scholar, 49Armitt S. McCullough W. Roberts C.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 92: 263-282Google Scholar). This gene features expression characteristics completely different from those of xlnA (Fig. 1C). Glycerol was used as growth substrate. As on many other carbon sources, facA is constitutively expressed to considerable levels on glycerol, but wild-type strains remain clearly inducible by acetate and glyoxylate (to between 2- and 3-fold the basal level). We utilized 10 mm acetate (pH 6.8) as inducer, because higher concentrations reduce general transcription efficiency as characterized by lower γ-actin transcript levels (47Flipphi M. Kocialkowska J. Felenbok B. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 25-31Google Scholar). The true inducer offacA expression is neither acetate nor glyoxylate but more likely acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate of cellular metabolism (50Hynes M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 770-775Google Scholar). 3M. Flipphi and B. Felenbok, unpublished data.In contrast to the basal level, the acetate-induced facAexpression appears completely repressible by glucose and fructose in the wild type. Although repression of induced facAexpression appears to depend on CreA (see below), no functional analysis of CreA target sites has been reported. To establish appropriate conditions to study the effects of hexose kinase mutations on carbon catabolite repression, it was important to analyze the time course of induction versus repression for the CCR-regulated systems. For xlnA, a short induction period appears desirable because the inducibility drops sharply with time when using a high concentration of xylose as inducer of medium-shifted mycelia (51MacCabe A.P. Orejas M. Pérez-González J.-A. Ramón D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1331-1333Google Scholar). This feature could result from 舠self舡 CCR by the inducer compound, xylose, consistent with observations for xylanolytic genes inA. niger, for which the inducibility drops with increasing xylose concentration (52de Vries R.P. Visser J. de Graaff L.H. Res. Microbiol. 1999; 150: 281-285Google Scholar). In the absence of medium shift, the inducibility does not decline drastically with time or with increasing xylose concentrations, although the xlnA transcript levels are lower than those reported by MacCabe et al. (51MacCabe A.P. Orejas M. Pérez-González J.-A. Ramón D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1331-1333Google Scholar) (results not shown). Fig. 2Ashows that an induction period of 1 h was not sufficient to observe any repression by fructose, whereas some xlnArepression could be observed after 2.5 h. Comparison of these two induction periods in wild type for the alc genes clearly shows that induction by 2-butanone had been established within 1 h, whereas repression by fructose and also that by glucose was far from complete at that time (Fig. 2B). Induction thus occurs faster than repression. For the alcsystem, induction is a rather straightforward process, requiring the binding of AlcR to DNA targets in the presence of the physiological inducer, acetaldehyde (reviewed in Ref. 4Felenbok B. Flipphi M. Nikolaev I. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 149-204Google Scholar). Our results suggest that onset of transcriptional repression requires several steps such as sugar uptake, formation of a physiological repressor, post-translational modification of CreA, and possibly indirectly involved proteins such as CreB and CreC. For transcript analysis, we have chosen the longer time period of 2.5 h to properly evaluate induction and repression of all three systems. A very straightforward way to prevent the expression of an inducible catabolic system is by inducer exclusion, i.e.blocking entry of the inducer. Inducer exclusion can result from direct CreA-mediated repression of th"
https://openalex.org/W2119451154,"The metabotropic glutamate 1 (mGlu1) receptor in cerebellar Purkinje cells plays a key role in motor learning and motor coordination. Here we show that the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) 2 and 4, which are expressed in these cells, regulate the mGlu1 receptor by at least in part different mechanisms. Using kinase-dead mutants in HEK293 cells, we found that GRK4, but not GRK2, needs the intact kinase activity to desensitize the mGlu1 receptor, whereas GRK2, but not GRK4, can interact with and regulate directly the activated Gαq. In cells transfected with GRK4 and exposed to agonist, ॆ-arrestin was first recruited to plasma membranes, where it was co-localized with the mGlu1 receptor, and then internalized in vesicles. The receptor was also internalized but in different vesicles. The expression of ॆ-arrestin V53D dominant negative mutant, which did not affect the mGlu1 receptor internalization, reduced by 70–807 the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by the mGlu1 receptor. The agonist-stimulated differential sorting of the mGlu1 receptor and ॆ-arrestin as well as the activation of MAP kinases by mGlu1 agonist was confirmed in cultured cerebellar Purkinje cells. A major involvement of GRK4 and of ॆ-arrestin in agonist-dependent receptor internalization and MAP kinase activation, respectively, was documented in cerebellar Purkinje cells using an antisense treatment to knock down GRK4 and expressing ॆ-arrestin V53D dominant negative mutant by an adenovirus vector. We conclude that GRK2 and GRK4 regulate the mGlu1receptor by different mechanisms and that ॆ-arrestin is directly involved in glutamate-stimulated MAP kinase activation by acting as a signaling molecule.

The expression of ॆ-arrestin V53D dominant negative mutant, which did not affect the mGlu1 receptor internalization, reduced by 70–807 the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by the mGlu1 receptor. The agonist-stimulated differential sorting of the mGlu1 receptor and ॆ-arrestin as well as the activation of MAP kinases by mGlu1 agonist was confirmed in cultured cerebellar Purkinje cells. A major involvement of GRK4 and of ॆ-arrestin in agonist-dependent receptor internalization and MAP kinase activation, respectively, was documented in cerebellar Purkinje cells using an antisense treatment to knock down GRK4 and expressing ॆ-arrestin V53D dominant negative mutant by an adenovirus vector. We conclude that GRK2 and GRK4 regulate the mGlu1receptor by different mechanisms and that ॆ-arrestin is directly involved in glutamate-stimulated MAP kinase activation by acting as a signaling molecule. metabotropic glutamate G protein-coupled receptor GTP-binding protein G protein-coupled receptor kinase the N-terminal domain of GRK inositol phosphate green fluorescent protein the α subunit of G protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase regulators of G protein signaling glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin platelet-activating factor PAF receptor Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)1 receptors, which are activated by the excitatory amino acid glutamate, are part of an original family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) called the family 3 GPCRs (1De Blasi A. Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Nicoletti F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 114-120Google Scholar, 2Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 29: 1031-1037Google Scholar, 3Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Google Scholar). These include all the mGlu receptor subtypes, Ca2+-sensing and GABAB receptors, and some putative olfactory, pheromone, and taste receptors. Eight subtypes of mGlu receptors have been identified, which are implicated in different aspects of physiology and pathology of the central nervous system. Group I mGlu receptors (mGlu1 and mGlu5), which stimulate polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis by coupling to Gq, are localized in the peripheral parts of postsynaptic dendrites and contribute to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. For example, mGlu1 receptor present in cerebellar Purkinje cells plays a key role in motor learning and motor coordination. Similar to many other GPCRs, the signal transduction of the mGlu1 receptor is strictly regulated by multiple mechanisms acting at different levels of signal propagation (1De Blasi A. Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Nicoletti F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 114-120Google Scholar). After prolonged or repeated stimulation, receptors are profoundly desensitized. Protein kinase C is clearly involved in this process, although a protein kinase C-independent component of mGlu1 receptor desensitization was also observed (4Catania M.V. Aronica E. Sortino M.A. Canonico P.L. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1329-1335Google Scholar). The activated α subunit of the Gq(Gαq) can in turn be inhibited by RGS (forregulators of G protein signaling) proteins (5Saugstad J.A. Marino M.J. Folk J.A. Hepler J.R. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 905-913Google Scholar). These RGS proteins work by interacting with Gα and by increasing the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα, acting as GTPase-activating proteins (6Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Google Scholar, 7Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Google Scholar). Recent studies from our and other laboratories have documented that G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins are involved in the mechanism of agonist-stimulated mGlu1 receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization. Using transfected HEK293 cells, it was shown that the mGlu1 receptor is phosphorylated and desensitized by different GRK subtypes (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar, 9Dale B.D. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi S. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38213-38220Google Scholar) in an agonist-dependent manner. In these cells agonist treatment induced the internalization of the mGlu1 receptor, and this mechanism was ॆ-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent (10Mundell S.J. Matharu A. Pula G. Roberts P.J. Kelly E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 546-551Google Scholar, 11Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Google Scholar). The mGlu1 receptor is also internalized tonically (i.e. in an agonist-independent manner) by a mechanism that is ॆ-arrestin- and dynamin-independent and likely involves a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway (11Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Google Scholar). Based on these results and on studies with different receptor types, it was suggested that multiple endocytic pathways may contribute to the internalization of the same GPCR (11Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Google Scholar). We have recently shown that GRK4, one GRK subtype originally identified in testis and sperm cells, may play a major role in the regulation of the mGlu1 receptor. In HEK293 cells transfected with GRK4 and in cultured cerebellar Purkinje cells, which naturally express high levels of GRK4, we demonstrated that this kinase is important for the desensitization and for rapid internalization of the mGlu1receptor (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). The present study shows that the stimulation of the mGlu1receptor induces the rapid redistribution of ॆ-arrestin, which is first recruited to plasma membranes and then internalized in intracellular vesicles. Our results support the possibility that ॆ-arrestin acts as a signaling protein that mediates the mGlu1 receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinases (MAPK). Polyclonal anti-mGlu1 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology; polyclonal anti-RGS4, anti-ERK1, and anti-Gαq were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 was from Cell Signaling Technology; monoclonal anti-GRK2/3 was from Upstate Biotechnology; polyclonal anti-GRK4 was from Santa Cruz; monoclonal anti-FLAG M5 was from Eastman Kodak Co.; Alexa-594 protein labeling kit, Alexa-488 anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit IgGs were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); monoclonal anti-ॆ-arrestin antibody (F4C1) was kindly provided by Dr. L. A. Donoso; Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was from Sigma. To generate a fusion protein between GST and the N-terminal domain of GRK2 (GST-GRK2-Nter) and of GRK4 (GST-GRK4-Nter), we used a PCR-based method as previously described (12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar). The GRK4-(K216M,K217M) was prepared as previously described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). The following plasmids were generous gifts: GRK2-(K220R) from C. Scorer (Glaxo Wellcome, Stevenage, UK), Gαq from A. Gilman (University of Texas, Dallas, TX), Gαq(Q209L) from N. Dhanasekaran (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA), ॆ-arrestin V53D from Federico Mayor (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain), human mGlu1 receptor in pcDNA 3 from M. Corsi (Glaxo Wellcome, Verona, Italy), the human EAAC1 from J. P. Pin (CNRS, Montpellier, France) and M. A. Hediger (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and PAF receptor (PAFr) in pCDM8-FLAG plasmid from C. Gerard (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Cerebellar neurons were prepared from Wistar rats as previously described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar, 13Furuya S. Makino A. Hirabayashi Y. Brain Res. Protoc. 1998; 3: 192-198Google Scholar), with minor modifications to obtain a Purkinje cell-rich culture. Seven-day-old pups were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the cerebella excised and minced with a scalpel. The cerebellar cells were disgregated with 0.0257 trypsin and 0.017 DNase I in Krebs Ringer plus 0.037 MgSO4, 0.37 BSA for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with the same buffer containing 40 ॖg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 0.017 DNase I and dissociated by repeated passage through a fine-tipped pipette. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 × g for 2 min, and cells resuspended carefully in 2 ml of the same buffer. After 30–45 min, the Purkinje cells are enriched from granules by gravity. The upper part of the suspension (granules) was removed very carefully, and the sediment (Purkinje cells) was rinsed with culture medium. Recovered cells were plated at a density of 20–25 × 104 cells/cm2 onto poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides in serum-free defined medium: Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 ॖg/ml insulin, 0.1 nm l-thyroxin, 0.1 mg/ml transferrin, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 30 nm selenium, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 57 CO2 in air at 37 °C. The cultures, which consisted of ∼2–37 Purkinje cells (assessed by calbindin immunostaining), were used after 15–20 daysin vitro. HEK293 cells were transfected as described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). One day after transfection, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 18 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen), then washed and incubated overnight with minimal essential medium/Glutamax-1 containing 3 ॖCi/well myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences). On the third day, IP production was measured as described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (146 mmNaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.17 glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), washed again with HEPES-buffered saline, and pre-incubated for 15 min in the same buffer containing 10 mm LiCl, 1.8 units/ml glutamic pyruvic transaminase, 2 mm sodium pyruvate. The stimulus was carried out for 30 min with 100 ॖm quisqualate, unless otherwise indicated. The reaction was stopped by replacing the incubation medium with 1 ml of ice-cold perchloric acid (57). Inositol phosphates were separated by an ion exchange chromatography column of Dowex AG1-X8 (formiate form) (200–400-mesh, 350-ॖl bed volume). Usually 1 × 106 cells were co-transfected with 1 ॖg of mGlu1 plasmid along with 5 ॖg of GRK cDNA, or empty vector. For mGlu1a 5 ॖg of the plasmid encoding the glutamate transporter EAAC1 (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar) was included. For antisense oligonucleotide treatment, the experiments were performed as previously described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). Cerebellar neurons were prepared as described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar) and maintained in culture for 2–3 weeks, at which time two-end phosphorothioate oligonucleotides at 1 ॖm final concentration were added for 4–5 days. The sequence of the GRK4 antisense oligonucleotide and of the scrambled oligonucleotide (used as control) are as described in Ref. 8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar. Recombinant adenovirus was prepared according to Ref. 14He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar with minor modifications. The ॆ-arrestin V53D cDNA was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the shuttle plasmid (pAd-CMV-TRK) by standard cloning procedures. The purified shuttle plasmid was digested with the restriction enzyme PmeI to obtain the 舠rescue fragment.舡 The fragment was then purified on agarose gel, and 2 ॖg of purified rescue fragment was used for homologous recombination. The adenoviral plasmid pAdEasy-1 (14He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar) was then mixed with the rescue fragment, and the DNA mixture was transformed into the BJ5183 bacterial strain and incubated overnight. Colonies were screened by digesting the DNA withBglII and performing a Southern blot to confirm the presence of the cDNA insert. The DNA with the proper orientation was transformed into the DH5a bacterial strain. The recombinant construct, purified using Qiagen Maxi preparation kit, was digested overnight withPacI and transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Adenoviral plaques were purified twice by infecting HEK293 cells in agar. Virus was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, dialyzed, and titrated by plaque assay. The recombinant adenovirus obtained expresses both green fluorescent protein (GFP) and ॆ-arrestin V53D under independent cytomegalovirus promoters. A virus expressing only GFP was used as a control. For infection cerebellar Purkinje cells were incubated with the recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell for 3 h at 37 °C in medium without serum. The virus-containing medium was then removed, and cells were incubated in standard medium plus serum. At 48 h after infection, >957 of the cultured cerebellar Purkinje cells were infected, as assessed by the expression of GFP. The expression of ॆ-arrestin V53D was confirmed by immunocytochemistry in cerebellar Purkinje cells or by immunoblot in a U87MG glioblastoma cell line. These experiments were performed as described previously (12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins (150 ॖg) from HEK293 cells transfected with the Gαq subunit were mixed with 40 ॖl of slurry containing GST-GRK-Nter fusion proteins bound to glutathione agarose beads in a final volume of 400 ॖl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.17 Lubrol, 10 ॖm GDP, 3 mm MgCl2), in the presence or absence of 47 mm MgCl2, 30 ॖmAlCl3, and 20 mm NaF. After 1 h at 4 °C the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and the resins containing the eventual bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting, using anti-Gαq antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). One fraction of starting material (30–40 ॖg, ∼257 of the total cytosolic proteins used for binding) was also included in the gel (indicated as S in Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation was done as follows. After treatments, cells were rapidly washed in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Triton-X 100, 1 mm EDTA, 107 glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate) for 15 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). Protein concentration of supernatants was determined, and 600 ॖg of total proteins were incubated with 5 ॖg of anti-Gαq antibodies for 2h at 4 °C followed by addition of 50 ॖl of di-protein A-Sepharose pre-equilibrated in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0,17 Triton X-100, 57 glycerol), and an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in HNTG buffer, and the pellets were boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min before electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitates and starting materials were subjected to 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing condition. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted using anti-GRK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-GRK4 (Santa Cruz) antibodies. After treatments, cells were rapidly washed in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 107 glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate) for 15 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), and 80–100 ॖg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed using a commercial anti-phosphospecific antibody against phosphorylated ERK1/2. Monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody was used at 1:2000 dilution. The membranes were stripped according to instructions from the manufacturer and reprobed with polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody at 1:5000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Other Western blot analyses were performed as described (12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands were visualized either by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. HEK293 cells transfected as above and 20-day-old Purkinje cell primary cultures were fixed with 47 paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The autofluorescence was quenched by incubation for 30 min in 50 mm NH4Cl, 50 mm glycine in PBS, and nonspecific interactions were blocked by treatment with blocking solution (0.057 saponin, 0.57 BSA in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar) with anti-mGlu1a (0.3 ॖg/ml, overnight at 4 °C), anti-ॆ-arrestin (F4C1) (12.5 ॖg/ml, 1 h, room temperature), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (4 ॖg/ml, 1 h, room temperature), anti-ERK1 (2 ॖg/ml, 1 h, room temperature), and anti-RGS4 (2 ॖg/ml, overnight at 4 °C) antibodies in blocking solution. The chamber slides were then incubated with blocking solution containing Alexa-488 anti-rabbit (1:400, Molecular Probes), Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:200, Sigma), or Alexa-488 anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. For PAFr localization, an anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody directed at MDYKDDDDKEF amino acid sequence at the N-terminal Met-FLAG fusion protein of PAFr was used; this antibody was conjugated to the fluorochrome Alexa-594 and diluted at 1 ॖg/ml in blocking buffer (1 h, room temperature). Each incubation step was carried out in the dark and followed by careful washes with PBS (six times/3 min each). After immunostaining the coverslips were mounted on slides with Mowiol 4–88 and analyzed by a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope equipped with an Axiovert 100 m-BP and by the Confocal Imaging System Ultraview (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The internalization of the mGlu1 receptor and of PAF receptors was quantified as previously described (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). Co-localization was quantified as previously reported (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar) or using the 舠co-localization and correlation舡 option of the Ultraview software. GRK2 and GRK4 are the two GRK subtypes expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar). As these cells represent one relevant site of the mGlu1 receptor expression and function, we investigated the role of GRK2 and GRK4 in the regulation of this receptor. Previous studies have shown that the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the mGlu1areceptor expressed in HEK293 cells is significantly enhanced when GRK2 (9Dale B.D. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi S. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38213-38220Google Scholar) or GRK4 (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar) are co-transfected. To assess the role of GRK-dependent receptor phosphorylation in the homologous desensitization of the mGlu1 receptor-stimulated IP production, we used GRK2 and GRK4 kinase-dead mutants in which the kinase activity was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis of key amino acids located in the catalytic domain. Both mutants, which are named GRK2-(K220R) and GRK4-(K216M,K217M) for GRK2 and GRK4, respectively, lost their ability to phosphorylate receptor substrates (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar, 12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar). We determined the agonist-stimulated IP production in HEK293 cells transfected with the mGlu1 receptor and the effect of co-expression of different GRK mutants (Fig.1A). According to our previous results (8Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knopfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Google Scholar), the co-transfection of either GRK2 or GRK4 resulted in a 35–407 reduction of the agonist-stimulated response. By contrast, the effect of the two kinase-dead mutants was substantially different; the GRK4-(K216M,K217M) mutant was ineffective, whereas the GRK2-(K220R) desensitized the mGlu1 receptor-stimulated signaling to the same extent as the GRK2 wild type. These results indicated that the phosphorylation of the mGlu1 receptor was necessary for GRK4-mediated receptor desensitization, whereas GRK2 utilized, at least in part, a phosphorylation-independent mechanism for receptor regulation. The likely mechanism by which GRK2 could regulate mGlu1receptor signaling in a phosphorylation-independent manner is provided by the RGS-like domain present in the N terminus of GRK2, because we and others have previously shown that this is a functionally active domain able to regulate the GPCR-stimulated Gq signaling by direct binding and inhibition of the activated Gαq (12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar,15Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Stenweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, our results suggest that, unlike GRK2, the GRK4 N terminus, which also contains an RGS homology domain, should be unable to interact with Gαq and to regulate its signaling cascade at the G protein level. To test this possibility we prepared a GST-GRK4-Nter fusion protein and we measured the binding of this domain to Gαq, using the GST-GRK2-Nter as a positive control. For binding experiments, the cytosolic proteins from HEK293 cells transfected with Gαq were incubated with agarose-conjugated GST-GRK-Nter fusion proteins. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing, and Gαq bound to GST-GRK-Nter proteins was revealed by immunoblot. According to previous findings (12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar), when the incubation was done in the presence of AlF4− (i.e. Gαq was in the active state), a substantial fraction of Gαq was bound to GST-GRK2-Nter, whereas in the absence of the AlF4− (with Gαq in the inactive state), the Gαqbound to GST-GRK2-Nter was undetectable (Fig. 1B). When similar experiments were done using GST-GRK4-Nter, the amount of Gαq interacting with this domain was significantly lower even when Gαq was in the active state (Fig.1B). The amount of the Gαq bound to GRK4-Nter (in the presence of AlF4− ) was estimated to be ∼3–57 of the starting material, whereas that bound to GRK2-N-ter was estimated at ∼257 of the starting material. To assess whether GRK2, but not GRK4, interacts with the activated Gαq in cells, we investigated the interaction of Gαq and GRKs by co-immunoprecipitation in transfected HEK293 cells. We used both the wild type Gαq or the constitutively active mutant Gαq(Q209L), which can bind in vitro to the GRK2-Nter even in the absence of AlF4− (12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar). Gαq was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with GRK2 or GRK4 plus Gαq or Gαq(Q209L), and the presence of GRK subtypes in the immunoprecipitates was assessed by immunoblot (Fig. 1C). GRK2 was co-immunoprecipitated in an agonist-dependent manner from cells expressing Gαq, showing that GRK2 and Gαq interact in intact cells and that this binding depends on the active state of Gαq. In cells expressing Gαq(Q209L), GRK2 was co-immunoprecipitated even in the absence of agonist, although we consistently found that the amount of GRK2 co-immunoprecipitated with Gαq(Q209L) was enhanced by quisqualate treatment. This indicates that the activation of the mGlu1 receptor by agonist may favor the interaction between GRK2 and Gαq in intact cells, perhaps by modulating the active state of GRK2, which, in turn, could govern the interaction with Gαq. This hypothesis is consistent with our previous finding showing that the presence of an agonist-stimulated receptor increased the ability of GRK2-Nter to inhibit Gαq-stimulated IP production (Fig. 4 of Ref. 12Sallese M. Mariggiò S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Google Scholar). By contrast, GRK4 was never co-immunoprecipitated with Gαq, indicating that this kinase does not interact with Gαq. The levels of expression of GRKs (Fig.1C), Gαq, and Gαq(Q209L) (data not shown) were comparable in different samples. In our experimental conditions ॆ-arrestin was not co-immunoprecipitated with GRK2 or with GRK4 in either the presence or absence of agonist stimulation (not shown). GRK4 is also primarily involved in mGlu1 receptor internalization (Fig. 2). In HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mGlu1 receptor, exposure to quisqualate for 5 min did not induce a significant level of receptor internalization and the co-expression of GRK2 resulted in a 2–3-fold increase of receptor internalization. In cells transfected with GRK2, the maximal internalization was observed after 20–30 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 2). The expression of GRK4 drastically enhanced the internalization of the mGlu1 receptor induced by the quisqualate, and this effect was rapid with a maximal peak at 5 min of agonist stimulation and was reversible within 30 min (Fig. 2). Previous work from our laboratory documented a substantial co-localization of the mGlu1 receptor and GRK4 both under basal conditions and after internalizatio"
https://openalex.org/W2056379192,"Protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4 is a low affinity thrombin receptor with slow activation and desensitization kinetics relative to PAR-1. This study provides novel evidence that cardiomyocytes express functional PAR-4 whose signaling phenotype is distinct from PAR-1 in cardiomyocytes. AYPGKF, a modified PAR-4 agonist with increased potency at PAR-4, activates p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase but is a weak activator of phospholipase C, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; AYPGKF and thrombin, but not the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN, activate Src. The observation that AYPGKF and thrombin activate Src in cardiomyocytes cultured from PAR-1−/− mice establishes that Src activation is via PAR-4 (and not PAR-1) in cardiomyocytes. Further studies implicate Src and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity in the PAR-4-dependent p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

G protein-coupled receptor protease-activated receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase inositol phosphate epidermal growth factor receptor inositol 1,4-bisphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pertussis toxin Serine proteases regulate cell functions in large part by activating a family of seven transmembrane spanning domain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).1 PAR-1, the prototypical receptor for thrombin, is a ubiquitously expressed GPCR that is activated by cleavage of its extracellular N terminus to expose a new N-terminal sequence that binds intramolecularly and serves as a tethered ligand (1Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Google Scholar, 2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar). Since the initial cloning of PAR-1, three additional structurally homologous PARs have been identified; two newer PAR family members (PAR-3 and PAR-4) are activated by thrombin, whereas PAR-2 is activated as a result of limited proteolysis by trypsin, membrane-type serine protease-1 (a type II transmembrane protein with serine protease activity) or mast cell tryptase (not by thrombin (3Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Google Scholar,4Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Google Scholar)). Synthetic peptides that mimic the tethered ligand domains of PAR-1 (SFLLRN), PAR-2 (SLIGRL), and PAR-4 (GYPGKF), but not PAR-3, activate their cognate receptors independent of proteolysis (2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar). Detailed studies identify PAR-1 coupling to several heterotrimeric G protein family members (Gq, Gi, and G12/13) and thereby a host of intracellular response mechanisms that influence cell shape, growth, and differentiation. In contrast, knowledge of PAR-4 expression and function is still quite limited. In heterologous expression systems, PAR-4 mimics the actions of PAR-1 to activate phospholipase C and mobilize intracellular calcium. However, major differences between PAR-1 and PAR-4 in their sensitivity to activation by thrombin and kinetics of activation and desensitization have been identified. Specifically, PAR-1 is efficiently cleaved by low concentrations of thrombin, but PAR-4 activation requires much higher thrombin concentrations. PAR-4 activation and desensitization kinetics also are quite slow and sustained relative to the rapid and transient responses typically elicited by PAR-1 (5Shapiro M.J. Weiss E.J. Faruqi T.R. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25216-25221Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that PAR-1 and PAR-4 might not be functionally redundant, there is still scant information on distinct functional properties of PAR-1 and PAR-4 in native tissues. The signaling properties of PAR-1 have been explored largely in platelets (where the actions of thrombin are critical for normal hemostasis and arterial thrombosis) and the vessel wall (where PAR-1 promotes changes in endothelial cell morphology leading to altered monolayer permeability and PAR-1 induces proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar)). Recent studies indicate that cardiomyocytes represent an additional cardiovascular target for the actions of thrombin and related proteases. Cardiomyocytes cultured from neonatal rat ventricles co-express PAR-1 and PAR-2 (mRNA for PAR-3 is not detected), which stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), increase intracellular calcium, and promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (6Jiang T.

Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 860-866Google Scholar). This study tests the hypothesis that cardiomyocytes also express PAR-4 and that PAR-4 activates mechanisms that contribute to cardiac remodeling in areas of cardiac injury and/or inflammation. Cardiac myocytes were dissociated from the ventricles of outbred, PAR-1 knockout, or background strain C57BL/6 mice (embryonic day 18 (11)) by a trypsin digestion protocol that incorporates a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiac myocytes (6Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). Although the preplating step effectively decreases fibroblast contamination, myocytes were subjected to 30 grays of X-rays on day 1 of culture to halt the proliferative potential of any residual contaminating fibroblasts (6Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). The myocytes were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml (2 ml/35-mm dish) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For assays of ERK, p38-MAPK, or Src activation, the cells were serum-starved in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent and was reverse transcribed to random primed cDNA with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR primers used for PAR-4 were P4Pan-U 5′-GCCAATGGGCTGGCGCTGTG-3′ and P4Pan-L 5′- GCCAGGCAGATGAAGGCCGG-3′. The reactions were carried out in 50-μl reactions using Advantage Klentaq polymerase (Clontech) with the indicated number of cycles consisting of a 30-s 94 °C denaturation followed by a 30-s 63.1 °C annealing with a 60-s elongation at 68 °C. The PCR primers used for β-actin were β-actin PTP-U 5′-AGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATG-3′ and β-actin PTP-L 5′-CTCGGCCGTGGTGGTGAAGC-3′. The β-actin reactions were carried out in 25-μl reactions using Advantage Klentaq polymerase (Clontech) for 25 cycles consisting of a 30-s 94 °C denaturation followed by a 30-s 60.4 °C annealing with a 30-s elongation at 68 °C. The amplified products were fractionated in 2% agarose gels and Southern transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were hybridized to the appropriate digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled nested primer probes; PANP4 PP-L 5′-CCAGCAGCAACACTGAACCATACATGTGGCCATAGAG-3′ for PAR-4, and actin PP-L 5′-TGGGCACAGTGTGGGTGACCCCGTCACCGGAGTCCATCAC-3′ for β-actin. The specific PCR products were then visualized using DIG luminescent detection (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cardiomyocytes were incubated for 72 h with 3 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol, washed, preincubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min, and then stimulated with agonists for the indicated intervals at room temperature. Inositol phosphates (IPs) were extracted and eluted sequentially by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex columns according to methods published previously (6Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). Src kinase activity was assayed on lysates from cells extracted for 10 min on ice in extraction buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). c-Src was immunoprecipitated from 550 μg of lysates (precleared with protein G-Sepharose). Immunoprecipitates were successively washed with extraction buffer, buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA), and buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl, 1 mmEGTA) followed by incubation with 30 μm kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP with 1 mg/ml enolase as substrate for 15 min at 20 °C. The reactions were stopped with sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel); quantification was with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The precleared lysates (700 μg) were also subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-EGFR and anti-ErbB2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-EGFR and anti-ErbB2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activation of ERK and p38-MAPK was monitored by immunoblot analysis with antibodies for phosphorylated (activated) signaling proteins. Where indicated, PP1 or AG1478 (Calbiochem) were included (starting 45 min prior to the stimulatory intervals) to inhibit the kinase activities of Src family kinases or EGFR kinases, respectively. In all of the experiments, the immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to total protein to confirm equal protein loading. Phospho-ERK1/2, total p38-MAPK, and phospho-p38-MAPK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology; antibodies to total ERK1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoblotting was according to methods published previously or to the manufacturer's instructions (12Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Google Scholar). Each panel in each figure represents results from a single gel exposed for a uniform duration, with bands detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by laser scanning densitometry. The measurements of protein synthesis were performed in triplicate according to methods published previously (12Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were stimulated in serum-free medium with agonists (or vehicle) for 48 h at 37 °C. The medium was supplemented with [14C]phenylalanine (0.1 μCi/ml) plus 0.3 mm nonradioactive phenylalanine during the final 24 h of stimulation. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. The precipitates were washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 1% SDS at 37 °C for 1 h. Duplicate aliquots from each sample were assayed for radioactivity and protein content. The results are normalized to protein content. Total RNA from cultured embryonic mouse ventricular myocytes (embryonic day 18), cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (postnatal day 2), and ventricular tissue from adult mouse and rat hearts was converted to first strand cDNA with reverse transcriptase and used as templates in analytical PCR reactions. Total RNA from rat platelets was included as a positive control. The reaction products were analyzed by Southern blot hybridized with appropriate nested primer probes. Fig.1 (upper panel) shows that a band corresponding in size to that predicted by the sequence of the primer pairs for PAR-4 is detected in all of the samples. The reaction product is prominent in platelets, but it also is readily detected in samples from adult rodent ventricles and (at lower levels) in neonatal rat and mouse cardiomyocyte cultures. In cardiomyocyte preparations, a band that migrates more rapidly (and likely corresponds to a smaller nested product from internal priming) also is consistently detected. Equivalent levels of reaction product for β-actin verify uniform loading, and β-actin is detected only in reactions that include reverse transcriptase performed in parallel as negative controls. These studies identify PAR-4 transcripts in mouse and rat cardiomyocytes. Consistent with previous studies establishing functional PAR-1 expression in mouse cardiomyocyte cultures (10Sabri A. Muske G. Zhang H. Pak E. Darrow A. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1054-1061Google Scholar), Fig. 2 shows that SFLLRN induces a rapid/brisk increase in inositol polyphosphates (IP2/IP3) that is followed by a more progressive and sustained accumulation of IP1. Although SFLLRN has known agonist activity at both PAR-1 and PAR-2 (13Lerner D.J. Chen M. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13943-13947Google Scholar), the PAR-2-selective agonist peptide SLIGRL does not promote IP accumulation in mouse cardiomyocytes cultures (data not shown), excluding a significant contribution of PAR-2 to the actions of SFLLRN. To determine whether mouse cardiomyocytes express functional PAR-4, the cultures were stimulated with AYPGKF, a PAR-4-specific agonist peptide that is reported to be ∼10-fold more potent than the PAR-4 tethered ligand sequence GYPGKF at activating PAR-4 (14Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that AYPGKF promotes phosphoinositide hydrolysis in mouse cardiomyocytes. However, the characteristics of signaling by AYPGKF-activated PAR-4 and SFLLRN-activated PAR-1 differ in two major respects: 1) the magnitude of IP accumulation (both IP2/IP3 and IP1) in response to AYPGKF is relatively modest, compared with the robust responses elicited by SFLLRN and 2) the kinetics of IP2/IP3 accumulation in response to AYPGKF is atypically delayed. SFLLRN-induced IP2/IP3accumulation is detected maximally at early time points (2–5 min); this response wanes at 30 min. In contrast, little AYPGKF-dependent IP2/IP3accumulation is detected at 5 min; a modest AYPGKF-dependent increase in IP2/IP3 is detected with longer incubations. AYPGKF responses cannot be attributed to robust PAR-4 signaling in a minor contaminating fibroblast population; thrombin and SFLLRN promote brisk and pronounced increases in IP accumulation in cardiac fibroblasts, but cardiac fibroblasts do not detectably respond to AYPGKF (15Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Google Scholar). Previous studies established that IP accumulation in response to SFLLRN displays substantial sensitivity to inhibition by pertussis toxin (PTX; 100 ng/ml for 24 h, a protocol that completely ADP-ribosylates/inactivates Gi proteins (16Sabri A. Pak E. Alcott S.A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1047-1053Google Scholar)). In contrast, the modest AYPGKF-dependent activation of phospholipase C is PTX-insensitive (data not shown). Fig. 3 compares AYPGKF and SFLLRN activation of MAPK cascades in cardiomyocytes. AYPGKF activates ERK, but the magnitude of this response is modest and the kinetics are protracted relative to the brisk ERK activation induced by thrombin and SFLLRN. The weak and sluggish nature of PAR-4 signaling to ERK parallels the protracted time course for PAR-4 agonist activation of phospholipase C. AYPGKF also activates p38-MAPK. Here, AYPGKF activation is substantial; it is to a level comparable with p38-MAPK activation by PAR-1 agonists (or stimuli such as sorbitol, data not shown). However, the kinetics of p38-MAPK activation by SFLLRN and AYPGKF differ. p38-MAPK activation by SFLLRN (or thrombin) peaks at 5 min and is sustained for at least 30 min. In contrast, the onset of p38-MAPK activation by AYPGKF is delayed, with little increase in p38-MAPK activity in response to AYPGKF during incubations shorter than 20 min. Previous studies identified the effects of thrombin and SFLLRN to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as manifest by an significant increase in [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into protein as well as total protein content (10Sabri A. Muske G. Zhang H. Pak E. Darrow A. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1054-1061Google Scholar). AYPGKF also is a weak hypertrophic agonist, inducing a 19.3 ± 2.3% increase in [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into protein (compared with a 43.7 ± 3.2% increase by thrombin, n = 3 for each, p < 0.05 versus basal). Src has been implicated in many of the cellular actions of thrombin. To determine whether Src contributes to cardiomyocyte activation by thrombin, the cardiomyocytes were exposed to vehicle or PAR agonists, and the intrinsic kinase activity of Src was determined by an immune complex kinase assay. Fig. 4 Ashows that thrombin increases the kinase activity of Src toward the exogenous substrate enolase. In contrast, Src is not activated by SFLLRN. This result is surprising, because thrombin-dependent activation of Src generally is ascribed to a signaling pathway emanating from PAR-1 (which would be activated by SFLLRN). This pharmacologic profile suggested that Src might lie downstream from PAR-4 (not PAR-1) in cardiomyocytes. Fig. 4 A shows that AYPGKF induces a modest level of Src activation, consistent with this formulation. The PAR-1 requirement for thrombin-dependent activation of Src was explored further in cardiomyocytes cultured from PAR-1−/− mice. This model was first validated by demonstrating that SFLLRN and the purinergic agonist ATP activate phospholipase C and ERK in wild type cardiomyocytes, but only ATP activates phospholipase C and ERK in PAR-1−/−cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5, A andB). Although PAR-1−/− cardiomyocytes are unresponsive to SFLLRN, effects of thrombin to activate p38-MAPK and Src persist in PAR-1−/− cardiomyocytes (Figs. 4,B and C, and 5 C); AYPGKF-dependent activation of p38-MAPK and Src also is detected in this preparation. Collectively, these results indicate that cardiomyocyte responses to thrombin are mediated by the combined actions of PAR-1 and PAR-4. PAR-1 activates the phospholipase C/ERK pathway and also provides a mechanism to activate p38-MAPK. In contrast, PAR-4 promotes only a low level of sustained phospholipase C/ERK activation; its more prominent action is to stimulate p38-MAPK and Src. Surprisingly, thrombin-dependent activation of Src is mediated only by PAR-4 in cardiomyocytes (and not PAR-1). To determine whether Src lies upstream from p38-MAPK in the PAR-4 signaling pathway, further studies were performed with PP1 (a specific inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases). Fig.6 shows that PP1 blocks p38-MAPK and ERK activation by AYPGKF; this is not due to a nonspecific inhibitory effect of PP1, because ERK and p38-MAPK activation by sorbitol is equivalent in control and PP1-treated cultures. Given the recent evidence that hypertrophic signaling by cardiomyocyte G protein-coupled receptors also can involve EGFR transactivation (17Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Google Scholar), AYPGKF responses also were examined in cultures pretreated with AG1478 (a well established inhibitor of the kinase activity of the EGFR (18Ben-Bassat H. Rosenbaum-Mitrani S. Hartzstark Z. Levitzki R. Chaouat M. Shlomai Z. Klein B.Y. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gazit A. Tsvieli R. Levitzki A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1442-1457Google Scholar, 19Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar)). Fig. 6 shows that AG1478 also inhibits ERK and p38-MAPK activation by AYPGKF (but not sorbitol) in cardiomyocytes. Separate experiments demonstrated that PAR-4 activation of p38-MAPK and Src is not blocked by PTX (data not shown). Collectively, these results implicate Src and EGFR kinases activities, but not Gi proteins, in the pathway for PAR-4-dependent activation of ERK and p38-MAPK in cardiomyocytes. PAR-4 expression reconstitutes thrombin-dependent activation of ERK and p38-MAPK in fibroblasts from PAR-1−/− mice (Fig.7), providing a model system to resolve the mechanism(s) underlying the actions of PAR-4. The goal of studies in PAR-4-expressing cells was to determine whether separate signaling pathways for PAR-4 could be resolved (and whether PAR-4 signaling in cardiomyocytes conforms to a defined subset of the actions of PAR-4). GF109203X was used to inhibit phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms and thereby ablate the phospholipase C-protein kinase C pathway. PP1 and AG1478 were used to inhibit the kinase activities of Src and EGFRs, respectively. The EGFR antagonist was included in these experiments as a control for the specificity of inhibition by PP1; it also provided a strategy to consider a potential role for EGFR transactivation in PAR-4 signaling. Fig. 7 shows that thrombin induces a robust increase in ERK and p38-MAPK activity at 5 min; ERK activation wanes slightly at 30 min, whereas p38-MAPK activation persists during this interval. PP1 is a generalized inhibitor of thrombin-dependent activation of ERK and p38-MAPK at both early and late time points. This result implicates Src kinases in all aspects of PAR-4 signaling. At the early time point, thrombin-dependent activation of ERK also is blocked by GF109203X; GF109203X does not inhibit ERK activation at the later time point or thrombin-dependent activation of p38-MAPK at either time point. The PAR-4 signaling phenotype in GF109203X-treated cells is reminiscent of PAR-4 signaling in cardiomyocytes, where AYPGKF induces prominent p38-MAPK activation and ERK activation with delayed kinetics. The more delayed component of thrombin-dependent activation of ERK and p38-MAPK is blocked by the EGFR antagonist AG1478 or PP1 (and not by GF109203X). Thrombin-dependent activation of ERK at 30 min is inhibited by PP1 and AG1478, whereas EGF-dependent activation of ERK is blocked only by AG1478 (not by PP1). This result establishes the efficacy of inhibition by AG1478, as well as the specificity of PP1 for Src (and not the EGFR). This result also places Src upstream from EGFRs in the PAR-4 signaling pathway leading to ERK activation (although further evidence that PP1 effectively blocks EGF-dependent activation of p38-MAPK indicates that Src also exerts a role downstream from EGFRs in the pathway leading to p38-MAPK activation). The pharmacologic studies implicate EGFR transactivation in the PAR-4 signaling pathway. These results are quite novel; there is precedent for PAR-1 transactivation of EGFR and the related EGFR family member ErbB2 (20Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Google Scholar), but EGFR transactivation as a mechanism for signaling by PAR-4 has never been reported. Because preliminary studies indicated that PAR-4-expressing fibroblasts from PAR-1−/− mice express EGFRs and ErbB2 (data not shown), we explored the potential individual roles for EGFRs and ErbB2 in the PAR-4-dependent signaling pathway. Fig. 8 shows that thrombin promotes a large increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ∼170–175- and ∼180–185-kDa proteins, respectively, in anti-EGFR and anti-ErbB2 immunoprecipitates from PAR-4 expressing PAR-1−/− fibroblasts; thrombin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation is largely blocked by the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (but not by PP3, a structurally analogous compound that does not inhibit Src family kinases, attesting to the specificity of the inhibitory actions of PP1; data not shown). The direct activation/phosphorylation of EGFR (by EGF) and ErbB2 (by EGF and heregulin) is not blocked by PP1; to the contrary, EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 is slightly increased, and heregulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 is markedly increased in PP1-treated cultures. A similar effect of PP1 to increase EGF phosphorylation of ErbB2 was identified previously (21Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Google Scholar). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-EGFR and ErbB2 to validate equal protein loading. EGFR immunoreactivity is detected at grossly similar levels in all of the samples. ErbB2 also is detected at similar levels in samples from unstimulated, thrombin-stimulated, and heregulin-stimulated cultures, but ErbB2 protein appears to be reduced in EGF-stimulated samples (and in the EGF- and heregulin-stimulated samples from PP1-treated cultures). However, this is an artifact, related to the sequence for immunoblotting in this experiment, because ErbB2 is detected at similar levels in all samples when the immunoblot is first probed with anti-ErbB2 antibody (data not shown). This suggests that extensive signals with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody prevent subsequent anti-ErbB2 antibody binding to the ErbB2 protein epitope. Collectively, these studies effectively resolve two parallel Src-dependent signaling pathways emanating from PAR-4 (as schematized in Fig. 9). The initial rapid PAR-4-dependent activation of ERK involves Gq/phospholipase C-dependent activation of protein kinase C and Src. The more sustained PAR-4-dependent activation of ERK (and p38-MAPK) is via a separate Src-dependent pathway that involves EGFR and/or ErbB2 transactivation. This latter Src-p38-MAPK pathway dominates in cardiomyocytes. These studies provide novel evidence that cardiomyocytes express functional PAR-4 and that the signaling properties of PAR-4 in cardiomyocytes are distinct from those previously reported for PAR-1. Specifically, PAR-1 promotes the rapid/strong activation of phospholipase C and ERK (via PTX-sensitive and -insensitive pathways) and a more sustained activation of p38-MAPK. Although human PAR-4 (expressed in PAR-1−/− fibroblasts) supports thrombin-dependent activation of all of these responses (phospholipase C, ERK, and p38-MAPK), PAR-4 native to mouse cardiomyocytes preferentially elicits a subset of these responses. PAR-4 stimulation leads to a relatively strong activation of p38-MAPK, with only a minor associated increase in phospholipase C and ERK that is delayed in onset. Additional studies implicate tyrosine phosphorylation events on both EGFRs and ErbB2 in the actions of PAR-4, providing the first evidence that transactivation of EGFR family members can contribute to PAR-4 responses. The protracted kinetics for PAR-4 signaling in cardiomyocytes presumably is attributable to the slow activation and desensitization kinetics described for PAR-4 (relative to PAR-1 (5Shapiro M.J. Weiss E.J. Faruqi T.R. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25216-25221Google Scholar)). However, a mechanism that accounts for the very weak PAR-4 coupling to the phospholipase C/ERK pathway is not obvious. It is tempting to speculate that this lesion in PAR-4 signaling in mouse cardiomyocytes is part of a more generalized defect in GqPCR-dependent activation of phospholipase C recently identified in mouse cardiomyocytes; α1-adrenergic agonists and endothelin promote only a trivial activation of phospholipase C in mouse cardiomyocytes compared with the robust actions of these agonists in rat cardiomyocytes (16Sabri A. Pak E. Alcott S.A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1047-1053Google Scholar). According to this formulation, PAR-1 activation of phospholipase C is preserved in mouse cardiomyocytes, because it is largely mediated by PTX-sensitive G proteins and not Gq; PAR-4 coupling through Gq to phospholipase C is impaired. Alternatively, differences in PAR-4 signaling may not necessarily reflect a limitation of the signaling machinery inherent to mouse cardiomyocytes but could be due to species-dependent differences in the signaling properties of the expressed human PAR-4 and the native PAR-4 sequence in mouse cardiomyocytes. This study provides surprising evidence that thrombin-dependent activation of Src is mediated by PAR-4 (and not PAR-1) in cardiomyocytes. It is noteworthy that many laboratories have reported effects of thrombin to activate Src family kinases. Although an early study performed on the CCL39 Chinese hamster fibroblast line implicated PAR-1 in thrombin-dependent activation of Src (on the basis of evidence that a PAR-1 agonist peptide mimics the effect of thrombin to activate Src (22Chen Y.H. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Google Scholar)), most subsequent studies have focused on Src family kinase activation by thrombin in platelets and have not attempted to replicate the response with a PAR-1 agonist peptide. In this context, the studies reported herein demonstrate that thrombin activates Src in cardiomyocytes and that this response is mimicked by the PAR-4 (not the PAR-1) agonist peptide. The observation that thrombin activates Src in PAR-1−/− cardiomyocytes provides further evidence that Src activation does not require PAR-1 expression. The mechanism whereby a GPCR such as PAR-4 activates Src family tyrosine kinases has been the focus of research by several laboratories. Although Src activation by GPCRs has been attributed in certain model systems to the downstream effectors of heterotrimeric Gq proteins (calcium, direct actions of PKC, or indirect actions of PKC to stimulate PYK2 (23Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Google Scholar)), the relatively weak activation of phospholipase C by PAR-4 makes this pathway unlikely. Similarly, effectors downstream from G protein βγ dimers (such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase) have been implicated in Src activation (24Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Google Scholar). Because βγ dimers generally are derived from Gi proteins, this pathway also is unlikely because PAR-4 signaling is PTX-insensitive. Other mechanisms for Src activation (including a direct interaction of Src with G protein α subunits, anchoring of Src to a signaling complex formed by the GPCR and the scaffolding protein β-arrestin, and/or anchoring of Src directly to the agonist-activated GPCR) should be considered in future studies. This study identifies a Src-p38-MAPK pathway emanating from PAR-4 in mouse cardiomyocytes; the PAR-4 agonist peptide is a rather weak hypertrophic agonist relative to other hypertrophic stimuli such as thrombin, norepinephrine, or endothelin. Of note, Src and p38-MAPK on balance are implicated in deleterious functional and structural changes in cardiomyocytes (25Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 345-352Google Scholar). The Src-p38-MAPK pathway is opposed by ERK (which is generally considered cardioprotective) when the actions of thrombin are mediated by the combined actions of PAR-4 and PAR-1. However, the conditions that render PAR-1 inactive (such as inflammation, where neutrophil-derived proteases such as cathepsin G would amputate the N-terminal tethered ligand domain of PAR-1) would shift the balance of signaling by PAR-1 and PAR-4, leading to unopposed PAR-4 activation. Under these conditions, dominant signaling through Src and p38-MAPK may contribute to adverse functional outcomes. The predominant natural activator(s) of endogenous cardiomyocyte PARs remains uncertain. Although cardiomyocyte PAR-1 may be activated by thrombin in the setting of hemorrhagic infarction (where the endothelial barrier is broken and cardiomyocytes come into direct contact with blood-borne substances), most myocardial events are not accompanied by hemorrhage into the myocardium. Hence, other potential mechanisms for PAR activation must be considered. PAR-4 has been identified as a potential substrate for neutrophil-derived proteases that are released at sites of cardiac injury and/or inflammation (26Sambrano G.R. Huang W. Faruqi T. Mahrus S. Craik C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6819-6823Google Scholar). Hence, the cardiac actions of PAR-4 may become important in the context of cardiac remodeling during myocarditis and/or at the border zone of a myocardial infarction.

Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid (sPLA2 cDNAs subcloned into the pRc-CMV or pCR3.1 vector) was mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min and then added to cells that had attained 40–60% confluence in 12-well plates (Iwaki Glass) containing 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh culture medium. After overnight culture, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium, and culture was continued at 37 °C in an incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air. The cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml geneticin. After culture for 3–4 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen, and the expression of each protein was assessed by RNA blotting. The established clones were expanded and used for the experiments as described below. In order to establish double transformants expressing sPLA2and glypican, cells expressing each sPLA2 were subjected to a second transfection with glypican cDNA subcloned into pCDNA3.1/Zeo(+) using LipofectAMINE 2000. Three days after the transfection, the cells were used for the experiments or seeded into 96-well plates and cloned by culturing in the presence of 50 μg/ml zeocin to establish stable transformants. To assess functional coupling between sPLA2 and either of the two COX isozymes, cells stably expressing sPLA2 were transfected with COX-1 or COX-2 subcloned into pCDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE 2000. Three days after the transfection, the cells were activated with A23187 to measure PGE2 generation and were subjected to immunoblotting to examine COX-1 or COX-2 expression (see below). sPLA2activity was assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled fatty acids released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (2-AA-PE), 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PE (2-LA-PE), 2-AA-PC, or 2-LA-PC (Amersham Biosciences).

Baculovirus expression of recombinant sPLA2proteins was performed using the BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Briefly, sPLA2 cDNAs were subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pFASTBAC1 (Invitrogen) at appropriate restriction enzyme sites. Recombinant sPLA2proteins were first expressed in Sf9 insect cells and then amplified in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Culture supernatants and cell lysates (4–5 days after infection) were used for subsequent experiments. Sf9 cells and High Five cells were maintained in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and Express Five SFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen), respectively.

We examined the structural requirements of the AT1 receptor for transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). Studies using carboxyl terminal-truncated AT1 receptors indicated that the amino acid sequence between 312 and 337 is required for activation of EGFR. The role of the conserved YIPP motif in this sequence in transactivation of EGFR was investigated by mutating tyrosine 319. Ang II failed to activate EGFR in cells expressing AT1-Y319F, whereas EGFR was activated even without Ang II in cells expressing AT1-Y319E, which mimics the AT1 receptor phosphorylated at Tyr-319. Immunoblot analyses using anti-phospho Tyr-319-specific antibody showed that Ang II increased phosphorylation of Tyr-319. EGFR interacted with the AT1 receptor but not with AT1-Y319F in response to Ang II stimulation, whereas the EGFR-AT1 receptor interaction was inhibited in the presence of dominant negative SHP-2. The requirement of Tyr-319 seems specific for EGFR because Ang II-induced activation of other tyrosine kinases, including Src and JAK2, was preserved in cells expressing AT1-Y319F. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation was also maintained in AT1-Y319F through activation of Src. Overexpression of wild type AT1 receptor in cardiac fibroblasts enhanced Ang II-induced proliferation. By contrast, overexpression of AT1-Y319F failed to enhance cell proliferation. In summary, Tyr-319 of the AT1 receptor is phosphorylated in response to Ang II and plays a key role in mediating Ang II-induced transactivation of EGFR and cell proliferation, possibly through its interaction with SHP-2 and EGFR.

This results in inositol triphosphate generation, which in turn causes an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations and diacylglycerol formation, leading to activation of protein kinase C. However, recent investigations revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation is also intimately involved in AT1 receptor signaling (2Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ.

It is unclear, however, how AT1 receptors, which lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities, are able to stimulate tyrosine kinases. We have recently shown that an AT1 receptor second intracellular loop mutant, lacking heterotrimeric G protein coupling, is able to activate Src tyrosine kinase (11Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar). This suggests that heterotrimeric G protein-independent mechanisms are able to activate Src. Furthermore, increasing lines of evidence suggest that the carboxyl terminus (C-tail) of the AT1 receptor plays an important role in the AT1 receptor signaling (11Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar, 12Franzoni L. Nicastro G. Pertinhez T.A. Tato M. Nakaie C.R. Paiva A. Schreier S. Spisni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9734-9741Google Scholar). For example, ligand binding to the AT1 receptor induces physical association of the C-tail of the AT1 receptor with Jak2, thereby causing phosphorylation and translocation of STAT to the nucleus (13Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Google Scholar). Other signaling molecules, including phospholipase Cγ and SHP-2, also have been shown to interact with the C-tail of the AT1 receptor (14Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N.

These results suggest that direct interaction between the heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor and intracellular signaling molecules may play an important role in mediating activation of downstream-signaling mechanisms. Accumulating data suggests that EGFR is involved in signal transduction of many G protein-coupled receptors, including the AT1 receptor (9Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Ang II-induced EGFR activation, we investigated the structural requirements of the AT1 receptor and the associating signaling mechanism leading to transactivation of EGFR.

Plasmid encoding Myc-dominant negative SHP-2 (SHP-2-(1–225)) was generated by PCR, and the PCR product was subjected to TA cloning using pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid encoding dominant negative Src (K296R/Y528F) and its control vector (pUSE) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections were performed on 70% confluent monolayers in 60-mm dishes for immunoprecipitation and Src kinase assays or in 35-mm dishes for ERK1/2 assays. For transient transfection, 2.5 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) containing 4 μg of DNA, 8 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, and 12 μl of LipofectAMINE was used for a 60-mm dish. One ml of Opti-MEM I containing 2 μg of DNA, 6 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE was used for a 35-mm dish. Empty pcDNA 3.0 plasmid was added as needed to keep the total amount of DNA constant per transfection. Cells were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM at 37 °C for 3 h. COS-7 cells were then incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM and incubated overnight. Transfected cells were serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for 24–36 h before stimulation. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Saturation binding curves were determined using a modification of the whole cell receptor binding assay (16Ullian M.E. Linas S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 840-846Google Scholar) as described previously (11Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar). The B max and the dissociation constant (K d) 3-[4-iodotyrosyl-125I]AngII binding was determined by using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad). Protein assay was performed on each sample using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Cardiac fibroblast cultures were prepared as described previously (17Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Google Scholar). In brief, hearts were removed from 1-day-old Crl:(WI)BR-Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) and subjected to digestion with collagenase type IV (Sigma), 0.1% trypsin (Invitrogen), and 15 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Cell suspensions were applied on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (1.060/1.086 g/ml) and subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min (18Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Google Scholar). The layer containing primarily non-cardiac myocytes was removed and subjected to the preplating procedure for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded, and the attached cells were cultured in the media containing DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were passed twice to enrich for cardiac fibroblasts. Cells were cultured in serum-free conditions for 48 h before experiments. Cell stimulation was carried out at 37 °C in serum-free medium. After stimulation, COS-7 cells were scraped and lysed in CHAPS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 40 mm HCl-Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for immunoprecipitation or hypoosmotic lysis buffer (25 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for ERK1/2 kinase assays. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and subjected to centrifugation for 30 min. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were adjusted to be 1 mg/ml with the lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation of EGFR-FLAG, the cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel at 4 °C for 2 h. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous EGFR, the cell lysates were incubated with 4 μg of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody for 1 h followed by protein G-agarose (30 μl of slurry) for 45 min. The immune complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and denatured in Laemmli sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membranes (Millipore). Immunoblots were performed as described previously. Phosphorylated levels of the EGFR, the AT1 receptor, or ERK1/2 were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphospecific antibody and scanning densitometry, and the results were expressed as fold increase compared with the control. Polyclonal anti-phospho-specific antibody was generated by injecting Ac-QLLK(pY)IPPKAKS(Ahx)C-amide (pY is phosphotyrosine; Ahx, is a six-carbon spacer) into rabbits as an immunogen. Generated antibody was then subjected to affinity purification (BIOSOURCE International). Measurement of inositol phosphates (IPx) was based upon the method of Berridgeet al. (19Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Google Scholar) as described previously (11Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with myo-[3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml) in DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C. Labeling was terminated by aspirating the medium, rinsing cells with oxygenated reaction buffer (142 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml d-glucose), and harvesting cells with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02%EDTA. Cells were centrifuged twice (300 × g, 5 min) in reaction buffer, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of reaction buffer containing 60 mm LiCl. Stimulation of IPx production was initiated by mixing 0.25 ml of cell suspension with 0.25 ml of 0–100 nmAng II in reaction buffer (without LiCl). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, then 0.5 ml of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added. Precipitates were pelleted (4100 × g, 20 min), and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was transferred to new tubes, washed with water-saturated diethyl ether, and neutralized with NaHCO3. IPx were isolated by adsorption to 0.5 ml of Dowex AG1-X8 formate resin slurry and rinsed 5 times with 3 ml of unlabeled 5 mm myoinositol followed by elution with 1 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid. The elutes were counted by liquid scintillation counter in 5 ml of ScintiVerse. The tyrosine kinase activity of Src was determined by the immune complex kinase assay using enolase as a substrate as described previously (7Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Google Scholar, 11Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mmNaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysates containing equal amount of protein (750 μg) were incubated with anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose was then added. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer without SDS or deoxycholic acid and then washed once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.015% Brig 35). Pellets were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the kinase buffer with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.25 μg of enolase as a substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer on ice. Reaction mixtures were boiled and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Results were analyzed by densitometry. Adenovirus-mediated transduction was performed as described previously (20Aoki H. Richmond M. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 275-284Google Scholar). Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transduced with an adenovirus vector harboring dominant-negative Ras (Ad5.N17Ras) (courtesy of Dr. M. Schneider, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) at a multiplicity of infection of 100. For a control study, Ad5/ΔE1sp1B (courtesy of Dr. B. French, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) was used. Adenovirus vectors harboring the wild type AT1 receptor or AT1-Y319F were generated by using the AdEasy system (21He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). All experiments were performed 48 h after transduction. Cells were plated at a density of 0.3 × 106/well in six-well plates. Twelve hours after plating, cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with Ang II (10−7m) in the presence or absence of AG1478 (250 nm) for 36 h. Ang II or AG1478 was added every 12 h. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell layer was scraped with 1 ml of standard sodium citrate containing 0.25% SDS and vortexed extensively. Total DNA content was determined by the Hoechst dye method as described previously (17Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Google Scholar). Data are given as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of variance. The post-test comparison was performed by the method of Tukey. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05 level. Ang II stimulation of COS-7 cells without transfection of the AT1 receptor did not activate either endogenous or transfected EGFRs (not shown). By contrast, in COS-7 cells transfected with the AT1 receptor, Ang II, caused time-dependent increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of either endogenous (not shown) or transfected EGFRs (Fig. 1 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by Ang II was observed within 3 min, reached a peak around 5 min, and lasted for more than 60 min (Fig.1 B (n = 7) and 2.8 ± 0.1-fold at 60 min (n = 3)). This suggests that stimulation of the AT1 receptor causes transactivation of EGFR in COS-7 cells. Because it has been suggested that the C-tail of the AT1 receptor plays an important role in mediating cell-signaling mechanisms of the AT1 receptor (11Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar), we examined the role of the AT1 receptor C-tail in Ang II-induced transactivation of EGFR. We co-transfected EGFR-FLAG and carboxyl-terminal-truncated AT1 receptors into COS-7 cells, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Although Ang II caused significant increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in cells transfected with AT1-(1–338), it failed to do so in cells transfected with AT1-(1–311) (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that the amino acid sequence located between amino acid 312 and 337 of the AT1 receptor is required for activation of EGFR by Ang II stimulation. Between amino acids 312 and 337 of the AT1 receptor, the YIPP-(319–322) motif is evolutionarily conserved in AT1 receptors cloned from many species (Fig. 2 B). It has been shown that several signaling molecules directly or indirectly associate with the YIPP motif in the AT1 receptor (13Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Dirksen L.B. Hayzer D.J. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23382-23388Google Scholar, 14Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Google Scholar). To test the role of this conserved motif in Ang II-induced EGFR activation, we made a mutant where a tyrosine residue at position 319 in this motif was mutated to phenylalanine (AT1-Y319F). Interestingly, Ang II-induced activation of EGFR was abolished in COS-7 cells transfected with AT1-Y319F (Fig.2 C). To test if phosphorylation of tyrosine 319 is involved in activation of EGFR, we mutated tyrosine 319 to glutamate (Y319E) to mimic the status of phosphorylation. Expression of AT1-Y319E in COS-7 cells significantly increased phosphorylation of EGFR in basal conditions, and Ang II stimulation failed to increase phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosine 319 may be involved in Ang II-induced activation of EGFR. To test if tyrosine 319 of the AT1 receptor is phosphorylated in vivo in response to Ang II stimulation, we generated phosphotyrosine 319-specific anti-AT1 receptor antibody (anti-phosphotyrosine 319 antibody). Either wild type AT1 receptor (AT1-WT) or AT1-Y319F was transfected in COS-7 cells. The AT1 receptor phosphorylated at tyrosine 319 was immunoprecipitated by the anti-phosphotyrosine 319 antibody and immunoblotted with the same antibody. Although AT1-WT was not detected by anti-phosphotyrosine 319 antibody in unstimulated cells, it was detected after the cells were stimulated with Ang II for 3 min (Fig. 3 B). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 319 was transient and returned to the basal level at 5 min. No apparent signals of phosphotyrosine 319 were detected in samples obtained from cells expressing AT1-Y319F (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the signal found in AT1-WT was most likely from phosphorylated Tyr-319. Duplicate samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-(total)-AT1 receptor antibody and immunoblotted with the same antibody. The result confirmed that similar amounts of the AT1 receptor were solubilized in each sample (Fig.3 C). These results indicate that tyrosine 319 in AT1-WT is transiently phosphorylated in response to Ang II stimulation. To confirm that tyrosine 319 of the AT1 receptor is important for Ang II-induced transactivation of EGFR, we examined the effect of overexpression of a mini-gene-containing AT1 receptor carboxyl terminus peptide (HA-AT1-C) upon Ang II-induced EGFR activation in COS-7 cells. Expression of HA-AT1-C inhibited Ang II-induced activation of EGFR in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of HA-AT1-C alone did not inhibit activation of EGFR by EGF treatment (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the effect of HA-AT1-C is stimulus-specific. Furthermore, a mini-gene-containing HA-AT1-C, whose tyrosine 319 is mutated to phenylalanine (HA-AT1-C-Y319F), failed to inhibit Ang II-induced EGFR activation in COS-7 cells (Fig.4 A). These results further support the notion that tyrosine 319 in the AT1 receptor plays an essential role in mediating EGFR activation by the AT1 receptor. We next examined if the AT1 receptor and EGFR physically associate with each other. We co-transfected AT1 receptors and EGFR into COS-7 cells and stimulated the cells with Ang II. EGFR immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-AT1 receptor antibody. Interestingly, AT1 receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR in samples stimulated with Ang II for 3 min (2.7 ± 0.2-fold versus 0 min,n = 4, Fig.5 A). This interaction between the AT1 receptor and EGFR was transient, since it was not observed at 5 min. Equal amounts of EGFRs were immunoprecipitated in each sample, and the immunoprecipitated EGFR was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to Ang II stimulation, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1 (Fig.5 A). Because it has been shown that SHP-2 is associated with AT1 receptor at the YIPP motif (14Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Google Scholar, 15Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Google Scholar), we examined if disrupting interaction between the AT1 receptor and SHP-2 affects interaction between the AT1 receptor and EGFR and abolishes Ang II-induced activation of EGFR. Ang II-dependent interaction between the AT1 receptor and EGFR and activation of EGFR were both inhibited in the presence of dominant negative SHP-2 (22Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that SHP-2 plays an essential role in mediating Ang II-induced activation of EGFR. Because tyrosine 319 plays an essential role in mediating Ang II-induced activation of EGFR, we attempted to determine if EGFR can interact with AT1-Y319F. EGFR and AT-Y319F were co-transfected into COS-7 cells, and cells were stimulated with Ang II. EGFR was immunoprecipitated and then immunoblotted with anti-AT1 receptor antibody. We did not detect the AT1 receptor in the EGFR immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 B). As expected, EGFR was not phosphorylated in response to Ang II stimulation in these experiments. These results suggest that tyrosine 319 plays an essential role in mediating Ang II-dependent interaction between the AT1 receptor and EGFR. We examined if other signaling mechanisms are also affected in the AT1-Y319F mutant. Ang II caused significant levels of IPx accumulation in cells transfected with AT1-Y319F, which was not statistically different from those in cells transfected with AT1-WT (Fig. 6 A). This suggests that AT1-Y319F maintains coupling with the Gαq-phospholipase C pathway. This also suggests that activation of IPx alone is not sufficient for the AT1 receptor to mediate EGFR activation. We attempted to determine if activation of other tyrosine kinases is also affected in AT1-Y319F. Ang II caused significant increases in Src activities in cells transfected with either AT1-WT or AT1-Y319F (2.9 ± 0.1-fold in WT, 2.7 ± 0.2-fold in Y319F at 5 min) (Fig. 6 B). Ang II also caused similar levels of increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected JAK2-FLAG in cells expressing either AT1-WT or AT1-Y319F (3.5 ± 0.1-fold in WT, 3.4 ± 0.2-fold in Y319F at 5 min) (Fig. 6 C). These results suggest that Ang II-induced activation of some tyrosine kinases, including Src and JAK2, is preserved in cells expressing AT1-Y319F. Ang II activated ERKs (3.5 ± 0.1-fold,p < 0.05 versus control) in COS-7 cells transfected with AT1-WT (Fig.7 A). AG1478, a specific inhibitor for EGFR, abolished Ang II-induced ERK activation in COS-7 cells transfected with AT1-WT (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that EGFR plays an essential role in ERK activation by AT1-WT in COS-7 cells. Surprisingly, however, Ang II was still able to activate ERKs in AT1-Y319F (3.6 ± 0.2-fold, p < 0.05versus control), where Ang II-induc"

https://openalex.org/W2071035461,"We investigated the role of mitochondria (MT) in calcium signaling in a culture of rat aortic smooth muscle cells. We used targeted aequorin to selectively measure [Ca2+] in this organelle. Our results reveal that smooth muscle cell stimulation with agonists causes a large, transient increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m). This large transient can be blocked with inhibitors of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, suggesting a close relationship between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the mitochondria. FCCP completely abolished the response to agonists, and targeted mitochondrial GFP revealed a vast tubular network of MT in these cells. When added before stimulation with ATP, IP3 inhibitors partially blocked the ATP-induced rise in mitochondrial Ca2+ release. The role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) was examined by removing extracellular Na+. This procedure prevented the decrease in the [Ca2+]m transient normally seen on removal of extracellular Ca2+. We propose a functional linkage of MT and SR dependent on a narrow junctional space between the two organelles in which Ca2+ diffusion is restricted. Approximately half of the mitochondria appear to be associated with the superficial SR, which communicates with the extracellular space via NCX."
https://openalex.org/W2080405913,"The bile salt export pump (BSEP) plays an integral role in lipid homeostasis by regulating the canalicular excretion of bile acids. Induction of BSEP gene expression is mediated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to the FXR response element (FXRE) located upstream of the BSEP gene. RXR ligands mimic several partner ligands and show additive effects upon coadministration. Using real-time quantitative PCR and cotransfection reporter assays, we demonstrate that the RXR agonist LG100268 antagonizes induction of BSEP expression mediated by endogenous and synthetic FXR ligands, CDCA and GW4064, respectively. Moreover, this antagonism is a general feature of RXR agonists and is attributed to a decrease in binding of FXR/RXR heterodimers to the BSEP-FXRE coupled with the inability of RXR agonists to recruit coactivators to FXR/RXR. Our data suggest that FXR/RXR is a conditionally permissive heterodimer and is the first example of RXR ligand-mediated antagonism of FXR activity.

The FXR/RXR heterodimer binds to farnesoid X receptor response elements (FXREs) or bile acid response elements found in the promoter of FXR-responsive genes such as the bile-salt export pump (BSEP), which controls the excretion of bile acids from hepatocytes. The BSEP gene promoter is stimulated by bile acid-bound FXR, and transactivation by FXR/RXR is lost when this FXRE is mutated (15Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

More recently, we and others have shown that CDCA induces BSEP mRNA in HepG2 cells (16Huber R.M. Murphy K. Miao B. Link J.R. Cunningham M.R. Rupar M.J. Gunyuzlu P.L. Haws T.F. Kassam A. Powell F.

Because RXR is the heterodimeric partner of FXR, we tested whether LG100268, a high affinity, selective RXR agonist (rexinoid) (Refs. 10Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M.

We demonstrate that RXR agonists alone do not induce BSEP expression, but antagonize ligand-bound FXR-induced expression of BSEP. Furthermore, RXR agonists fail to recruit certain coactivator peptides to FXR/RXR heterodimers. Hence, we propose that FXR/RXR heterodimers function as conditionally permissive heterodimers. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 9-cis retinoic acid were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). GW4064, LG100268, and LG100641 (18Mukherjee R. Hoener P.A. Jow L.

Total RNA was prepared from cultured HepG2 cells (ATCC) using the RNeasy purification system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed using the Advantage RT-PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed essentially as described (16Huber R.M. Murphy K. Miao B. Link J.R. Cunningham M.R. Rupar M.J. Gunyuzlu P.L. Haws T.F. Kassam A. Powell F. Hollis G.F.

Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was DNaseI-treated and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Twenty five ng of each cDNA was added to the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix along with 900 nm each primer and 200 nm probe according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Real-time fluorescence monitoring was performed with the Applied Biosystem 7700. Relative expression levels of the various transcripts were determined essentially as described (19Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Values were normalized to 18S rRNA and expressed relative to Me2SO (taken as 1) and represent the average of three determinants carried out in duplicate ± S.D. Probes for BSEP were modified at the 5′ end with 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) and at the 3′ end with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA); the 18S rRNA probe was modified at the 5′ end with VIC and the 3′ end with TAMRA. Primer and probe sequences were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) and are as follows: BSEP primer, 5′-GGTGAGAAAAGAGAGGTTGAAAGG, 5′-CCACACGAATCCAGTAAAGAATCC; BSEP probe, 5′-CCAACGCTGGGCGAACACAAGATTT; 18S rRNA primer, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA, 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT; 18S rRNA probe, 5′-TGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTC. Cloning of the 1.5-kb human BSEP promoter by PCR has been described previously (15Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, the forward primer (ccaagcttCCCTTTGACTGCTGTCAATAAC) and the reverse primer (ccaagcttGAGGAAGCCAGAGGAAATAATGG) were used to amplify the 1.5 kb (−1445 to +86) human BSEP promoter and cloned into pGL3-Basic Vector (Promega) to give BSEP-LUC. The reporter plasmid BSEP-3xFXRE-pTA-LUC was constructed by subcloning three copies for the FXRE identified in the BSEP promoter (15Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M.

Complementary oligonucleotides containing the FXRE sequences were synthesized and cloned into the BglII site upstream of the TATA box using flanking BamHI and BglII sequences engineered in the oligonucleotides. The full-length open reading frame of the human FXR was amplified by PCR using the published sequence (accession number U68233) and cloned into pCDNA3.1/TOPO (Invitrogen). HepG2 cells were transfected in 24-well plates with FuGENE reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For each well, transfection mixes contained 0.25 μg of FXRE-pTA-luc report plasmid, 0.05 μg of human FXR, 0.05 μg of human RXRα expression vectors, and 0.25 μg of pSV β-galactodidase control plasmid (Promega). Twenty-four h later, FXR and RXR ligands or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.1% final concentration) were added to cells at the concentration indicated in the figures. After 24 h, cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI and Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, respectively). Human FXR (amino acids 222–472) or PPARα (amino acids 196–468) with an N-terminal His tag and RXR (amino acids 225–462, untagged) were expressed in Escherichia coli. The cells were disrupted by sonication and FXR and RXR or PPARα and RXR pastes mixed and the heterodimers formed purified by nickel column chromatography. Amino acid analysis indicated the complexes were a 1:1 heterodimer of FXR/RXR or PPARα/RXR. The FRET assay (20Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M.

Data are expressed as the ratio of the emission intensity at 665 nm to that at 620 nm. The FRET method for PPARα and the sequences for the coactivator peptides have been published (21Mukherjee R.

Biol. 2002; 81: 217Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vitro-translated FXR and RXR were made using the TNT Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Electromobility-shift assay was performed as described (22Mukherjee R. Jow L. Noonan D. McDonnell D.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) with in vitro-translated FXR, RXR, or the combination (0.3 μl of each per reaction) as indicated. Total lysate was kept constant by the addition of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate. Ligands were added from 100× stock solutions in Me2SO and incubated for 10 min on ice.32P-labeled probe was then added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min and the complex resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels. The sequence of the oligonucleotide used is 5′-GATCCTGCCCTTAGGGACATTGATCCTTAGGCAAAA. The intensities of the protein-DNA complexes were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Because RXR is the heterodimeric partner of FXR, we investigated whether the selective RXR agonist, LG100268, (10Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D.E. Suto C.M.

HepG2 cells were treated with CDCA, GW4064, and LG100268 alone or in combination, and BSEP mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Robust induction of BSEP mRNA was observed in HepG2 cells by CDCA, a natural bile acid ligand and GW4064, a synthetic, high affinity ligand for FXR (30-fold and 80-fold, respectively) (23Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M. Chandra G. Plunket K.D. Creech K.L. Moore L.B. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Jones S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2971-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with LG100268 induced BSEP mRNA very poorly (2-fold), but surprisingly, strongly inhibited CDCA- and GW4064-mediated induction by 80% (p < 0.0005) and 83% (p < 0.00005), respectively. Time course analysis of LG100268-mediated antagonism of FXR activity shows a significant effect (p < 0.05) as soon as 8 h after treatment, suggesting an immediate transcriptional effect (Fig.1 B). To determine whether this antagonism is a general property of RXR ligands we tested 9-cis retinoic acid, a natural ligand for RXR (8Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). In addition, to address ligand selectivity of this effect, we utilized another synthetic ligand, LG100641 (LG641), which although structurally similar to LG268, binds very poorly to RXR (18Mukherjee R. Hoener P.A. Jow L. Bilakovics J. Klausing K. Mais D.E. Faulkner A. Croston G.E. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with LG268, very poor induction of BSEP mRNA (less than 2-fold) was observed with 9-cis retinoic acid and LG641 (Fig.1 C). However, both LG268 and 9-cis retinoic acid antagonized GW4064-mediated induction. (82 and 65%, respectively) whereas LG641 inhibited weakly (32%) (Fig. 1 C). This is the first example of RXR ligand-mediated antagonism of FXR activity. To determine whether RXR agonists also antagonized FXR activation of the natural BSEP promoter, we cloned a 1445-base pair fragment of the BSEP promoter into a luciferase reporter. HepG2 cells were transfected with this reporter and treated with different ligands (Fig.2 A). In the presence of GW4064. we observed 5-fold induction from the BSEP promoter, but no effect with LG100268, 9-cis retinoic acid, or LG641. Coadministration of LG100268 or 9-cis retinoic acid with GW4064 antagonized FXR-mediated activation by 67% and 63%, respectively (p < 0.05, Fig. 2 A) whereas LG641 antagonized less than 10%. Hence, RXR agonist-mediated antagonism of FXR-induced BSEP promoter activity is observed with endogenous levels of FXR/RXR heterodimers corroborating our real-time PCR data (Fig. 1). An inverted repeat (IR-1) element has been identified in the BSEP promoter and shown to be a functional FXRE (15Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In a cotransfection assay with expression plasmids for FXR, RXRα, and a reporter containing three tandem copies of the FXRE from the BSEP gene promoter, CDCA and GW4064 induced FXR/RXR-mediated transcription from the BSEP-FXRE (9-fold and 28-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, LG100268 weakly activated FXR/RXR (2-fold) and antagonized activation by CDCA and GW4064. LG100268 and 9-cis retinoic acid antagonized FXR-mediated activation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 6 nm and 300 nm, respectively (Fig.2 C). FXR-mediated induction was also antagonized by LGD1069 (9Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Badea B.A. White S.K. Mais D.E. Berger E. Suto C.M. Goldman M.E. Heyman R.A. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2930-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), another synthetic high affinity RXR ligand (data not shown). No antagonism was observed with LG641 (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that antagonism by RXR ligands is mediated via FXR/RXR through the FXR response element in the BSEP promoter and is not observed with ligands that do not bind to RXR. We next determined whether LG100268-mediated antagonism was caused by limiting amounts of RXR in HepG2 cells. Transient transfections were performed by increasing the ratio of RXRα to FXR expression plasmid from 1 to 5. This caused a slight increase in the signal observed with both ligands compared with GW4064 alone (Fig.2 D). However, even a 5-fold increase in RXR plasmid did not overcome LG100268-mediated antagonism. To explain the lack of transcriptional activity of FXR/RXR with LG100268, we determined whether LG100268-liganded FXR/RXR recruits coactivators. In a FRET assay, GW4064 induced recruitment of a peptide identical to the receptor-interacting domain of SRC-1 and CBP (Fig.3 A) to the heterodimer but not LG100268. This implies that RXR agonists do not recruit these coactivators to the FXR/RXR heterodimer. To rationalize the mechanism of LG100268-mediated antagonism of FXR activity, we speculated that LG100268 may function as an FXR ligand, displacing GW4064 from the FXR ligand-binding pocket, thereby decreasing coactivator recruitment and activity of FXR. To test this, we coadministered increasing concentrations of LG100268 with a fixed concentration of GW4064 in the presence of FXR/RXR. LG100268 did not alter the signal observed with GW4064 (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that LG100268, by binding to RXR, does not induce an allosteric conformation that reduces coactivator recruitment to FXR/RXR. A similar result was also observed with FXR alone (data not shown), indicating that LG100268 is not a ligand for FXR. These results are in stark contrast to those observed with PPARα/RXR (Fig. 3 C) where LG100268 induced SRC-1 recruitment similar to that seen with GW9578 (24Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a potent and selective PPARα agonist. Furthermore, a decrease in the EC50 and increase in the maximum signal was observed when LG100268 was added in the presence of a fixed concentration of the PPARα agonist. These results suggest that the RXR ligand-binding and coactivator recruitment properties of FXR/RXR are distinct from that of PPARα/RXR, a well characterized permissive heterodimer. Previous reports have demonstrated that FXR/RXR heterodimers bind to the BSEP-FXRE in vitro (15Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). To determine whether LG100268 modulated FXR/RXR binding to DNA, we performed an electromobility-shift assay with in vitro-translated FXR and RXR protein and a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the FXRE sequence from the BSEP gene. No protein-DNA complex was observed with FXR or RXR alone in the presence or absence of their respective ligands, (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–4). However, a distinct complex was seen with the FXR and RXR in the same reaction (lane 5). This DNA-protein complex formation is enhanced in the presence of GW4064 (lane 6) but not with LG100268 (lane 7). When both ligands are present, LG100268 decreased the ability of GW4064 to enhance binding to the FXRE by 47% (p < 0.05, Figs.4 A, lane 8 and 4 B). Both LG268 and 9-cis retinoic acid decreased GW4064-bound FXR/RXR complexes to the BSEP-response element (Fig. 5) in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was much reduced with LG641. Therefore, RXR ligands decrease the binding of FXR ligand-bound FXR/RXR heterodimers to the BSEP-FXRE.Figure 5RXR ligands inhibit binding of FXR/RXR to the BSEP-FXRE in a dose-dependant manner. Electromobility-shift assays were performed as in Fig. 4 with GW4064 (1 μm) in all lanes and increasing amounts of LG268 (A), 9-cisretinoic acid (9-cis RA; B), or LG641 (C). The concentration of these three compounds are:lanes 2, 1 nm; lanes 3, 10 nm; lanes 4, 100 nm; lanes 5, 1 μm; and lanes 6; 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An important means by which the body eliminates excess dietary cholesterol is through the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. Recently, the nuclear hormone receptors, FXR and RXR and their putative ligands have been implicated as key regulators in cholesterol/bile acid metabolism. In this report, we have demonstrated RXR ligand-mediated antagonism in a gene- and response element-specific manner. This antagonism in not observed with related compounds that do not bind to RXR. In contrast to our data involving antagonism of BSEP gene expression via the BSEP-FXRE, LG100268-mediated activation has been observed with the FXRE from the ultraspiracle(usp) gene (7Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C.

These contrasting results may be due in part to sequence-specific differences between the BSEP and usp FXRE. Hence, the same ligand and receptor may induce one gene while repressing another, a phenomenon reported with another RXR partner, the vitamin D receptor. RXR ligands have been shown to activate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase promoter and to synergize with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (26Zou A. Elgort M.G. Allegretto E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19027-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas RXR ligands inhibit 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent induction of the rat osteocalcin gene (27MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate the complexity underlying RXR-permissiveness extends to the FXR/RXR heterodimer which, to date, has been described as a permissive heterodimer (28Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that this may not be true in all cases and we therefore describe FXR/RXR as a conditionally permissive heterodimer. One possible mechanism of RXR-mediated antagonism is by induction of the small heterodimerization partner (29Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G.

However, the small heterodimerization partner was not induced in HepG2 cells with LG100268 (data not shown). Our results could also be reasonably explained by RXR agonist-induced formation of RXR homodimers (32Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), which do not bind to IR-1 FXREs but precludes formation of FXR/RXR heterodimers, as has been postulated for vitamin D receptor (33Thompson P.D.

Although possible, this may not be the predominant explanation because a similar magnitude of LG100268-mediated antagonism of FXR was observed with 5-fold excess of transfected RXR (Fig. 2 D). Our data are also consistent with LG100268-induced dimerization of RXRs with other heterodimeric partners like PPARs in vivo, thus reducing the availability of RXR for dimerization with FXR. Reduced BSEP expression by antagonizing FXR activity is consistent with the phenotype of FXR knockout mice, which have significantly lower BSEP expression in the liver compared with wild-type controls (34Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J.

Our data suggest that LG100268-mediated antagonism of FXR may also contribute to the hypertriglyceridemia induced by RXR agonists. This report is the first example of RXR-mediated antagonism of FXR activity by decreasing DNA binding coupled with the inability of RXR agonists to recruit coactivators to the FXR/RXR heterodimer. FXR/RXR thus falls into a distinct category as a conditionally permissive heterodimer.

Defective antifolate uptake due to inactivating mutations in the hRFC gene is an established mechanism of drug resistance in various tumor cells. However, while antifolate transport is frequently impaired, either no or only a single hRFC allele is inactivated, suggesting that additional mechanism(s) of resistance are operative. Here we studied the relationship between the expression and function of transcription factors and antifolate resistance in transport-defective leukemia cells that poorly express or completely lack RFC mRNA. Stable transfection with a hRFC expression construct resulted in restoration of normal RFC mRNA expression and nearly wild type drug sensitivity in these antifolate-resistant cells. The loss of RFC gene expression prompted us to explore transcription factor binding to the hRFC promoter. The hRFC promoter contains an upstream GC-box and a downstream cAMP-response element (CRE)/AP-1-like element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and oligonucleotide competition revealed a substantial loss of nuclear factor binding to CRE and GC-box in these drug-resistant cell lines. Consistently, antibody-mediated supershift analysis showed a marked decrease in the binding of CRE-binding protein 1 (CREB-1) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) to CRE and GC-box, respectively. Western blot analysis revealed undetectable expression of CREB-1, decreased ATF-1 levels, parental Sp1 levels, and increased levels of the short Sp3 isoforms, recently shown to repress hRFC gene expression. Transient transfections into these antifolate-resistant cells demonstrated a marked loss of GC-box-dependent, and CRE-driven reporter gene activities and introduction of CREB-1 or Sp1 expression constructs resulted in restoration of hRFC mRNA expression.

Mammalian cells are devoid of reduced folate biosynthesis and therefore meet their folate growth requirement via uptake from exogenous sources (1Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Reduced folates are absolutely essential cofactor vitamins involved in a host of one-carbon transfer reactions resulting in the biosynthesis of purines, deoxythymidylate, and methionine (1Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Folate antagonists (i.e. antifolates) including methotrexate (MTX) 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; RFC, reduced folate carrier; hRFC, human RFC; CRE, cyclic AMP-response element; CREB-1, CRE-binding protein 1; Sp1, specificity protein 1; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; FPGS, folylpolyglutamate synthetase; MRP1, multidrug resistance protein 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; RT, reverse transcription; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase are potent inhibitors of purine and deoxythymidylate biosynthesis and thereby block DNA synthesis. Consequently, MTX is an integral component of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the treatment of various human malignancies (2Bertino J.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 11: 5-14Google Scholar). Folates and antifolates are hydrophilic divalent anions that cannot cross membranes via diffusion and are therefore taken up into mammalian cells by the reduced folate carrier (RFC) (3Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 4-6Google Scholar). Among the antifolates recognized as transport substrates by the RFC are the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, MTX (2Bertino J.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 11: 5-14Google Scholar), the novel thymidylate synthase inhibitors Tomudex (ZD1694, Raltitrexed) (4Jackman A.L. Taylor G.A. Gibson W. Kimbell R. Brown M. Calvert A.H. Judson I.R.

Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 621-627Google Scholar). Although decreased expression of hRFC mRNA has been suggested as a mechanism of clinical resistance to MTX, the underlying molecular basis is still unknown (12Gorlick R. Cole P.D. Banerjee D. Longo G. Li W.W. Hochhauser D. Bertino J.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 543-550Google Scholar, 13Rots M.G. Willey J.C. Jansen G. Van Zantwijk C.H. Noordhuis P. DeMuth J.P. Kuiper E. Veerman A.J.

It was recently shown that transcription of the hRFC gene is driven by at least two promoter elements: an upstream constitutive element consisting of a GC-box as well as a downstream inducible cAMP-response element (CRE)/AP-like element (CRE/AP-1) (15Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Google Scholar). Reporter gene assays revealed that the binding of Sp1 and the long Sp3 isoforms to the GC-box as well as that of CRE-binding protein (CREB-1) to the CRE/AP-1-like element result in activation of hRFC transcription (15Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Google Scholar). Using stepwise antifolate selection, the human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell lines AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 were isolated, which displayed up to 2300-fold resistance to various antifolates due to abolished drug transport (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar). This was a result of a marked decrease (or complete loss) of RFC mRNA expression. This major decrease in RFC mRNA expression was associated with alterations in the expression of transcription factors, resulting in a prominently decreased binding to both the constitutive and inducible elements of the hRFC promoter. This was associated with poor expression of CREB-1 and binding to the inducible CRE as well as substantially diminished Sp1 binding to the constitutive GC-box element in the hRFC promoter. The current study constitutes the first demonstration of a novel mechanism of antifolate resistance that is based on alterations in the expression of transcription factors and their binding to the hRFC promoter. MTX was from Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Novel antifolate drugs were generous gifts from the following sources: ZD9331 from Dr. A. L. Jackman, (Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom), AG2034 from Dr. T. Boritzki (Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and PT523 from Dr. W. T. McCulloch (Sparta Pharmaceuticals). CCRF-CEM, a human T-cell leukemia line, and its antifolate-resistant sublines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid (Biological Industries, Beth-Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). The cell lines AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5were established by stepwise antifolate selection of parental CCRF-CEM cells in gradually increasing concentrations of AG2034 and ZD9331 as previously described (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar). CCRF-CEM-7A cells with a high RFC overexpression were cultured in folic acid-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and supplemented with 0.25 nmleucovorin as the sole folate source (16Jansen G. Westerhof G.R. Jarmuszewski M.J.A. Kathmann I. Rijksen G. Schornagel J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18272-18277Google Scholar). Parental cells and their antifolate-resistant sublines were first grown in antifolate-free growth medium for five to eight cell doublings. Thereafter, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3 × 104/well) in growth medium (0.15 ml/well) containing various concentrations of different antifolates. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, viable cell numbers were determined by hemocytometer count using trypan blue exclusion. The percent inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to untreated controls. To examine the ability of the antifolate-resistant sublines to transport antifolates, we determined the initial rates of [3H]MTX uptake relative to wild type CEM cells. Exponentially growing cells (2 × 107) were washed three times in transport buffer consisting of HEPES-buffered saline solution (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min in same buffer (1-ml suspensions) containing 2 μm[3H]MTX. Transport controls contained a 500-fold excess of unlabeled MTX (1 mm). Transport was terminated by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold HEPES-buffered saline solution, after which cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the cell pellet was washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. The final cell pellet was lysed in water and processed for scintillation counting. Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing cells (2 × 107cells) as previously described (17Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were formed by incubating nuclear extract proteins (6 μg) with [γ-32P]dCTP or [γ-32P]dATP end-labeled CRE, AP-1, or GC-box double-stranded oligonucleotides (TableI) as detailed elsewhere (18Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide competition was performed with a 10–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides (Table I). For supershift analysis, an aliquot of nuclear proteins (6 μg) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-CREB-1, -ATF-1, -Sp1, and -Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies (2–4 μg) in binding buffer according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Then, the radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added and DNA-protein immunocomplexes were allowed to form for 30 min at 4 °C. Complexes consisting of DNA, nuclear protein(s), and a specific antibody were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, pH 8.4, at 4 °C. The gels were then dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by phosphorimaging. Protein concentration was determined by the colorimetric method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar).Table IOligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assayOligonucleotide1-aFor double-stranded oligonucleotides used in EMSA, only the sense strand is shown.

Exponentially growing cells (2 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was isolated using the Tri-Reagent kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma). A portion of total RNA (20 μg in a total volume of 20 μl) was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (180 units, Promega) in a reaction buffer containing random hexamer primers, dNTPs, and ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega). Portions of cDNA (∼50 ng) synthesized from parental CEM cells and their antifolate-resistant sublines were amplified using Expand polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a reaction buffer (total volume 25 μl) containing: 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2% Me2SO according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The PCR reaction was performed as follows: initial melting at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles each of 1 min at 95 °C, annealing at 62 °C (56 °C for β-actin) for 45 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. Then, the PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels. The primers used for the semiquantitative RT-PCR of hRFC, DHFR, FPGS, MRP1, GAPDH, and β-actin are depicted in TableII.Table IIOligonucleotides used for RT-PCR of various housekeeping genesGeneSense primerAntisense primerRFC5′-CTGGCCTTCCTCACCTTCCA-3′5′-CCGAGTTGAAGACCCACCAGA-3′DHFR5′-CTGCACAAATAGGGACGAGG-3′5′-TAATGCCTTTCTCCTCCTGG-3′FPGS5′-CCGGCTGAACATCATCCA-3′5′-CTTTCTGCCATGCGATCTTCT-3′MRP15′-CAGGAGCAGGATGCAGAGGA-3′5′-TGTAGTCCCAGTACACGGAAAGC-3′β-Actin5′-AAGAGAGGCATCCTCACCCT-3′5′-TACATGCTGGGGTGTTGAA-3′GAPDH5′-AGGGGGGAGCCAAAAGGG-3′5′-GAGGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Logarithmically growing suspension cells (2 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation and transfected by electroporation (1000 microfarads, 234 V) with 10 μg of reporter constructs containing CRE-luciferase, GC-box-luciferase (pGL3-luciferase) and GC-box-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or with expression plasmids (10 μg) including pRSV-CREB-1 and pPacSp1 (kindly provided by Drs. M. E. Greenberg and G. Suske, respectively). Cells were then seeded at 2 × 106/ml in prewarmed growth medium. For reporter gene experiments, after 24 h of growth at 37 °C cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cell lysates were prepared, and firefly luciferase activity was assayed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega) and a luminometer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized withRenilla luciferase, following co-transfection with aRenilla-luciferase plasmid. For transient RFC mRNA expression, after 24 h of growth cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted. Results presented were obtained from at least three independent transfections performed in duplicate cultures and activity determinations. Exponentially growing cells (2 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation and stably transfected by electroporation (1000 microfarads, 234 V) with 10 μg of an expression vector (pcDNA3-hRFC1) harboring the hRFC cDNA (10Drori S. Jansen G. Mauritz R. Peters G. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30855-30863Google Scholar). Following 24 h of growth at 37 °C, cells were exposed to 600 μg/ml active G-418 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). Stable transfectants expressing high levels of hRFC mRNA were obtained after at least 1 month of G-418 selection and were used for further analyses. Nuclear extract proteins (20 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, electroblotted onto a Protran cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), reacted with anti-CREB-1, -ATF-1, -Sp1, and -Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To examine RFC expression in parental and antifolate-resistant cells, microsomes were first isolated (20Borgnia M.J. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3163-3171Google Scholar), and proteins were extracted in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 as previously described (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar). Detergent-soluble proteins (12.5–150 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis, electroblotted onto a nylon membrane and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris/Cl at pH 8.0) containing 1% skim milk. The blots were then reacted with a polyclonal antiserum (1:700) prepared in mice against a C-terminal hRFC peptide (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar), rinsed in the same buffer for 10 min in room temperature, and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:40,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes (10 min each) in TBS at room temperature, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel). ECL was recorded on x-ray films using several exposure times, which were evaluated by scanning densitometry. We studied the molecular basis of antifolate resistance in the human leukemia sublines ZD9331R1.5 and AG2034R2. These cell lines displayed up to 2300-fold resistance to various antifolates that use RFC as their primary route of uptake (Fig.1 A). This was associated with a marked decrease (95–97%) in the transport of [3H]MTX (Fig. 1 B). While detectable with 25 μg of microsomal proteins from parental CEM cells, RFC was not detectable even with 150 μg of proteins from AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5cells (Fig. 2 A). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that AG2034R2 cells expressed ∼1/300th of parental RFC mRNA, whereas ZD9331R1.5 cells had no detectable expression (Fig.2 B). In contrast, AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells expressed normal mRNA levels of various housekeeping genes including DHFR, FPGS, MRP1, and GAPDH (Fig.2 C), thereby suggesting that these cells did not suffer from a global transcriptional repression.Figure 2Expression of RFC and various housekeeping genes in wild type and antifolate-resistant cells. Western blot analysis with microsomal proteins from RFC-overexpressing CEM-7A cells (50 μg, lane 1), wild type CEM cells (100, 50, 25, and 12.5 μg, lanes 2–5, respectively), as well as AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells (150 μg,lanes 6 and 7, respectively) was performed with anti-hRFC antibodies as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” Messenger RNA levels of RFC (B), DHFR, GAPDH, FPGS, and MRP1 (C) were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” RFC mRNA expression determined by various dilutions of total cDNA prior to or after transient transfection of parental and antifolate-resistant cells with the expression vectors pRSV-CREB-1 and pPacSp1 (D) was normalized to β-actin (B) or GAPDH (D). RFC mRNA expression in wild type and antifolate-resistant cells stably transfected with an expression vector harboring the hRFC cDNA is also shown (B, lane 1). The H2O group represents a negative PCR control in which no cDNA was present (B, lane 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the impact of restoration of RFC expression on antifolate sensitivity, AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells were stably transfected with an expression vector harboring the wild type hRFC cDNA (Fig. 2 B,lane 1). This resulted in restoration of normal RFC mRNA expression in these cell lines (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Consequently, AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells became up to 170-fold more sensitive to MTX, thereby approaching the sensitivity of wild type cells to this antifolate (Fig.1 C). These results establish that the loss of hRFC gene expression is a major underlying mechanism of antifolate drug resistance in these transport defective cell lines. To explore the basis for the loss of RFC mRNA expression, nuclear proteins from parental CEM and antifolate-resistant cells were isolated and examined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This electrophoretic mobility shift assay assessed the binding of nuclear factors to [32P]-labeled CRE, GC-box, and AP-1 double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table I). A 3-band binding pattern to [32P]-labeled CRE (Fig.3 A) and [32P]-labeled GC-box (Fig. 3 B) was observed in parental CEM cells, whereas AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells had a markedly decreased binding to both oligonucleotides (Fig. 3, A and B) but retained normal binding to [32P]-labeled AP-1 (Fig.3 C). To examine the specificity of nuclear factor binding to these consensus binding sites, two independent parameters were used: (a) competition of binding to CRE and GC-box with unlabeled oligonucleotides and (b) binding to mutant CRE and GC-box oligonucleotides (Table I). The binding of nuclear proteins from parental cells to [32P]-labeled CRE, and GC-box was competed in a dose-dependent manner, with a 10–100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides (data not shown). In contrast, the residual binding of nuclear proteins from AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells to CRE and GC-box could not be competed even with a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. Furthermore, nuclear proteins from both parental and antifolate-resistant sublines failed to bind to the mutant [32P]-labeled CRE and [32P]-labeled GC-box oligonucleotides and displayed a similar nonspecific basal binding (data not shown). These results suggest that the residual binding to CRE and GC-box in these antifolate-resistant sublines was largely nonspecific. The putative loss of function of transcription factors that are involved in the binding to CRE and GC-box prompted us to explore the impact of the introduction of CREB-1 and Sp1 on RFC mRNA expression (Fig.2 D). Transfection of AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells with expression constructs harboring CREB-1 (pRSV-CREB1) or Sp1 (pPacSp1) resulted in restoration of normal RFC mRNA expression (Fig. 2 D). To assess CRE- and GC-box-mediated transcription, parental cells and their antifolate-resistant sublines were transiently transfected with CRE-luciferase (Fig. 4 A), GC-box luciferase (Fig. 4 B), and GC-box-CAT (Fig.4 C), and reporter gene activity was determined. The activities of firefly luciferase and CAT were normalized to that of a promoterless Renilla construct. Antifolate-resistant cells had a substantial decrease in luciferase activity driven by the CRE-containing construct, relative to parental cell transfectants (Fig.4 A). Reporter gene activity driven by two independent constructs containing GC-box was markedly reduced in these antifolate-resistant cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, these drug-resistant cell lines had a major loss in GC-box- and CRE-dependent transcription, resulting in a marked or complete loss of hRFC mRNA expression. It was recently shown that CREB-1 and Sp1 bind to CRE and GC-box in the hRFC promoter, respectively (15Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Google Scholar). To identify alterations in the binding of specific transcription factors to CRE (Fig.5 A) and GC-box (Fig.5 B), antibody-mediated supershift analysis was used. Preincubation of nuclear proteins either with antibodies to CREB-1 and ATF-1 or a combination of the two followed by [32P]-labeled CRE-protein-antibody complex formation revealed supershifts in parental CEM cells (Fig. 5 A,complexes A–C in lanes 2–4, respectively; note the elimination of bands 1 and/or 2). Likewise, [32P]-labeled GC-box supershifts in parental CEM cells were obtained with anti-Sp1 (Fig. 5 B, complex Ain lane 2; note the elimination of band 2) and anti-Sp3 antibodies (Fig. 5 B; note the elimination of bands 1 and 3 in lane 3). Furthermore, the combination of anti-Sp1 and -Sp3 antibodies eliminated all three [32P]-labeled GC-box bands and formed a high molecular weight complex (Fig. 5 B, complex B in lane 4). In contrast, nuclear proteins from AG2034R2(lanes 5–8) and ZD9331R1.5 cells (lanes 9–12) neither showed [32P]-labeled CRE supershifts with anti-CREB-1 or ATF-1 antibodies (Fig. 5 A) or [32P]-labeled GC-box supershifts with antibodies to Sp1 (Fig. 5 B). However, anti-Sp3 antibodies eliminatedband 3 of [32P]-labeled GC-box in both AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells (Fig.5 B, lanes 7 and 11, respectively). As alterations in the function of transcription factors could also result from changes in their expression, we determined CREB-1, ATF-1 (Fig. 6 A), Sp1 (Fig. 6 B), and Sp3 levels (Fig. 6 C) by Western blot analysis. Parental CEM cells expressed substantial levels of CREB-1 and ATF-1 (Fig. 6 A, lane 1), whereas AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells did not contain detectable levels of CREB-1 (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and3, respectively). In addition, these cells had decreased ATF-1 levels (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Reprobing the Western blot with anti-Sp1 antibodies revealed similar Sp1 levels in parental cells and their antifolate-resistant sublines (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–3). Parental CEM cells expressed both the long and short isoforms of Sp3 (Fig. 6 C, lane 1), whereas AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells showed increased levels of the short Sp3 isoforms (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). As the short Sp3 isoforms were recently shown to act as inhibitors of hRFC transcription (15Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that a repressor activity was present in these antifolate-resistant cells that could interfere with GC-box binding. A nuclear protein mixture (vol:vol) derived from parental and ZD9331R1.5 cells showed a normal binding to [32P]-labeled CRE (Fig. 3 D, compare lane 3 with 1) but a poor binding (<15% of wild type) to the [32P]-labeled GC-box (Fig. 3 E, comparelane 3 with 1). These results suggest that an inhibitory component was present in the nuclear extract from ZD9331R1.5 cells that appeared to disrupt GC-box binding. The aim of the current study was to identify the molecular basis underlying the loss of RFC mRNA expression in antifolate-resistant human leukemia cell lines displaying impaired MTX transport. We find substantial alterations in the expression of CREB-1, ATF-1, and the short isoforms of Sp3. These alterations were associated with a prominent decrease in the binding of transcription factors to the inducible (CRE) and constitutive (GC-box) elements in the hRFC promoter, presumably leading to a marked decrease in RFC mRNA expression. Consistently, introduction of CREB-1 and Sp1 into these antifolate-resistant cells resulted in restoration of RFC mRNA expression. Importantly, stable transfection of a hRFC cDNA driven by a potent cytomegalovirus promoter, resulted in restoration of normal RFC mRNA expression and nearly wild type sensitivity to MTX. These results provide the first demonstration of a novel mechanism of antifolate drug resistance that is based upon altered expression and function of transcription factors resulting in transcriptional silencing of the hRFC promoter. It was recently found that the hRFC promoter is driven by an inducible CRE/AP-1-like element and a constitutive GC-box element (15Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Google Scholar). This study showed that CREB-1 and c-Jun in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, as well as CREB-1 and ATF-1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, were the cell-specific transcription factors involved in CRE binding (the inducible element) in the hRFC promoter. We consistently find here that CREB-1 and ATF-1 were expressed at substantial levels in wild type human leukemia CEM cells and displayed a functional binding to CRE. The marked decrease or loss of RFC mRNA expression in AG2034R2 and ZD9331R1.5 cells, respectively, was associated with a decreased expression (or lack) of CREB-1 and ATF-1. These results strongly suggest that CREB-1 and ATF-1 are essential components for the transcriptional activation of the inducible element in the hRFC promoter in leukemia cells. However, antifolate-resistant cancer cell lines and malignant tumors of different cell lineages may potentially express alternative, cell-specific transacting factors of the basic region-leucine zipper (bZip) family, which may also contribute to hRFC transcription. Transient transfections of either Sp1 or the long Sp3 isoform resulted in a potent activation of the constitutive GC-box element in the hRFC promoter (15Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Google Scholar). In contrast, introduction of the short Sp3 isoform resulted in a potent repression of the Sp1-dependent activation of the hRFC promoter. Consistently, ZD9331R1.5and AG2034R2 cells showed elevated levels of the short Sp3 isoforms; the latter is likely to act as a repressor of the Sp1-mediated activation of the constitutive GC-box element in the hRFC promoter. This suggestion could gain support from the following results and considerations. First, the 1:1 mixing of nuclear proteins from parental and ZD9331R1.5 cells markedly blocked GC-box binding but did not interfere with CRE binding. Second, it is likely that transfection of ZD9331R1.5 and AG2034R2cells with an Sp1 expression construct should result in Sp1 levels that exceed those of the short Sp3 isoforms, resulting in restoration of RFC mRNA expression. Thus, the short Sp3 isoforms that are expressed at elevated levels in these antifolate-resistant cells appear to competitively block Sp1 binding to the GC-box, thereby repressing transcriptional activation of the hRFC gene. We have recently shown that a predominant mechanism of resistance to MTX and various novel hydrophilic antifolates is the loss of RFC-mediated drug transport in multiple human leukemia sublines (8Jansen G. Mauritz R. Drori S. Sprecher H. Kathmann I. Bunni M.A. Priest D.G. Noordhuis P. Schornagel J.H. Pinedo H.M. Peters G.J. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30189-30198Google Scholar, 10Drori S.

J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar). These transport-defective sublines harbored various inactivating mutations that primarily clustered in the first transmembrane domain of the hRFC (8Jansen G. Mauritz R. Drori S. Sprecher H. Kathmann I. Bunni M.A. Priest D.G. Noordhuis P. Schornagel J.H. Pinedo H.M. Peters G.J. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30189-30198Google Scholar, 10Drori S.

J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar). In contrast, AG2034R2 cells were devoid of RFC mutations (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar), had an extremely poor expression of RFC mRNA, and had no detectable levels of RFC protein. These cells consequently displayed an abolished antifolate transport. Thus, the loss of RFC expression in AG2034R2 cells constitutes the first mechanism of antifolate-resistance that appears to rely solely on the loss of transcriptional activation of the hRFC promoter. In contrast, ZD9331R1.5 cells harbored a heterozygous premature translation termination mutation (Glu257Stop) but retained a wild type hRFC allele (11Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Google Scholar). Although this wild type allele could have been substantially transcribed, ZD9331R1.5 cells were devoid of RFC mRNA expression. These results suggest that although mutations are frequently observed in the human (7Gong M. Yess J. Connolly T. Ivy S.P. Ohnuma T. Cowan K.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 2494-2499Google Scholar, 8Jansen G.

Goldman I.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 68-76Google Scholar) RFC genes, the mutational inactivation of a single allele is insufficient and may be accompanied by transcriptional silencing of both alleles via alterations in the expression and function of certain transcription factors.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 68-76Google Scholar) leukemia sublines harbored both RFC-inactivating mutations and prominently decreased RFC mRNA levels. The present findings have potentially important implications for the development of clinical resistance to MTX and novel antifolates, including ZD1694 (Raltitrexed, Tomudex) (4Jackman A.L. Taylor G.A. Gibson W. Kimbell R. Brown M. Calvert A.H. Judson I.R. Hughes L.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5579-5586Google Scholar) and multitargeted antifolate (Pemetrexed) (22Shih C. Chen V.J.

Consistently, decreased RFC mRNA expression has also been documented in specimens from ALL (12Gorlick R. Cole P.D. Banerjee D. Longo G. Li W.W. Hochhauser D. Bertino J.R. Adv. Exp. Med.

Still, the physiological/pathological roles of PP5 are unclear. To characterize the relationship of PP5, glucocorticoid receptor activation and p53, here we describe the development of chimeric antisense oligonucleotides that potently inhibit human p53 expression. This allowed us to regulate the expression of either p53 (e.g. with ISIS 110332) or PP5 (e.g. with ISIS 15534) in genetically identical cells. Studies with ISIS 110332 revealed that the suppression of p53 expression is associated with a decrease in the basal expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein, p21WAF1/Cip1, and a concomitant increase in the rate of cell proliferation. Suppression of p53 also blocks dexamethasone-induced p21WAF1/Cip1 expression and G1-growth arrest. Furthermore, treatment with ISIS 110332, but not the mismatched controls, ablates the suppression of growth produced by prior treatment with dexamethasone. Additional studies revealed that dexamethasone-dependent p21WAF1/Cip1 expression occurs without an apparent change in p53 protein levels or the phosphorylation status of p53 at Ser-6, -37, or -392. However, dexamethasone treatment is associated with an increase in p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15. Suppression of PP5 expression with ISIS 15534 also results in the hyperphosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. Together, these findings indicate that the basal expression of p53 plays a functional role in a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated response regulating the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 via a mechanism that is suppressed by PP5 and associated with the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15.

In estrogen-responsive breast carcinoma cells, the expression of PP5 is induced by treatment with estrogen, and the constitutive expression of PP5 converts MCF-7 cells into an estrogen-independent phenotype (9Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27638-27646Google Scholar). Still, determining the physiological/pathological roles of PP5 has proven difficult for many reasons. First, in a crude cell homogenate PP5 exists predominately in an inactive state (for review see Ref. 10Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Google Scholar). Second, the physiological activators of PP5 are unknown. Third, when activated by the addition of polyunsaturated lipids or protease mediated cleavage of the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain (11Skinner J. Sinclair C. Romeo C. Armstrong D. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Google Scholar, 12Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Google Scholar), the activity of PP5 cannot be distinguished from that of PP2A and PP1, which are both ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all eukaryotic cells. Finally, no selective small molecule inhibitors of PP5 have been reported, and genetic deletions studies in Drosophila suggest that the lack of PP5 expression results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (13Brown L. Borthwick E.B. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 470-476Google Scholar). Therefore, to date there is no reliable method to measure changes in the enzymatic activity of PP5 in vivo or in crude cell homogenates. Despite the difficulties associated with studying PP5, several studies suggest PP5 plays a functional role in both GR- and p53-dependent growth control. PP5 associates with the GR·Hsp-90 complex (2Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Google Scholar, 3Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.S.

Aragon I.V. Swingle M. Miller B. Rusconi S. Bueno M. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 6Google Scholar). ISIS 15534 treatment also markedly increases the association of GR with its cognate DNA binding sequence and induces GR-transcriptional activity in the absence of glucocorticoids (18Zuo Z. Urban G.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Google Scholar). In contrast, in p53−/−human fibroblast or p53-defective T-24 bladder carcinoma cells, ISIS 15534 treatment does not suppress growth or induce the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 (18Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Google Scholar). Studies with TR9–7 cells (p53−/− human fibroblasts that contain tetracycline-regulated transactivator and operator plasmids to control the expression of wild-type p53) revealed that ISIS 15534-mediated induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 requires a small amount of p53 protein, which becomes hyperphosphorylated but does not necessarily accumulate when PP5 expression is suppressed (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar). In A549 cells both GR activation and p53 activation have been shown to induce the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 and induce G1 growth arrest. Therefore, the data obtained with ISIS 15534 is consistent with PP5 acting as a suppresser of both a GR-dependent and a p53-dependent pathway leading to the induction of p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. Alternatively, the data are also consistent with PP5 acting to suppress a single pathway in which p53 is a functional participant in GR-induced expression of p21Waf1/Cip1. In the present study we further explored the relationship between PP5, GR, and p53 by developing chimeric antisense oligonucleotides that potently and specifically suppress the expression of p53. The data presented indicate that dexamethasone induces a response leading to the hyperphosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and that Ser-15-phosphorylated p53 is a functional participant in a glucocorticoid-initiated response regulating the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1. The data are consistent with the basal expression of p53, in cells that have not encountered environmental stress, playing a functional role in glucocorticoid-mediated growth control via a pathway that was likely masked in previous studies by the ubiquitous expression of PP5. Dexamethasone, all chemicals, and goat anti-mouse Ig were purchased from Sigma. Purified mouse anti-human p53 monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Antibodies recognizing specific sites of phosphorylation on p53 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides and 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described previously (19Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar, 20Dean N.M. Griffey R.G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug. Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Google Scholar). The sequence of antisense oligonucleotides targeting p53 (ISIS 110332), PP5 (ISIS 15534), and mismatched controls are as follows: ISIS110332, 5′-CCCAGCCCGAACGCAAAGTG; ISIS 15534, 5′-GGGCCCTATTGCTTGAGTGG; ISIS 116947, 5′-CACCGCACGGCCACAAGGTA; ISIS 122205, 5′-GCCACCACGCAGCCAGAGTA; ISIS 15521, 5′-GTGCGATCGTTGCGGTTAGC. Tissue culture medium, Lipofectin® and TRIzol® were purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Human A549 lung carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Cell cultures were passed when 90–95% confluent unless indicated otherwise. Antisense treatment was performed using a 1-ml solution of DMEM containing 15 μg/ml DOTMA/DOPE (Lipofectin®) and the indicated amount of oligonucleotides for 4 h at 37 °C, as described previously (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar, 19Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar, 20Dean N.M.

Cell numbers were determined with a cell counter (Coulter Counter ZM) following detachment from the dish by brief treatment with trypsin. For cellular staining with propidium iodine (PI), cell cultures were gently detached from the dish with trypsin, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml PI and 0.5 ml of Vindelovs reagent (10.0 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 75 μm propidium iodine, 0.1% igepal, and 700 units/liter RNase adjusted to pH 8.0). The PI-stained cells were kept in the dark at 4 °C for 30–60 min and then analyzed with a FACS Vantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Immunocytometry Systems, BDIS, San Jose, CA) using pulse processing (FL2 width and FL2 area) to gate out cell doublets and ModFitLT cell cycle analysis software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). PI fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser (Spectra Physics, Sunnyvale, CA), and fluorescence emission was collected with a 582/42 BP filter in front to the FL2 detector. Multivariate data acquisition and analysis were performed with BDIS CellQuest software. RNA was isolated using TRIzol® according to the methods of the manufacturer. Total RNA (15 μg) was then fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a Duralon-UV (Stratagene) membrane. Following UV cross-linking and pre-hybridization, the membrane was hybridized overnight in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C with the indicated 32P-labeled cDNA probe. cDNA probes were generated by random labeling with a DECAprime DNA labeling kit (Ambion) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The membranes were subjected to two high stringency washes with 0.1 × SSC at 55 °C and two low stringency washes with 2 × SSC at room temperature (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar). Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography. For quantification of hybridization signals, the radiograms were scanned and the scanned signals were integrated using Scion Image software, beta 3b release (Scion Corp.). The membranes were then stripped and probed a second time with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Signals were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to account for any inconsistencies in loading. Western analysis was performed essentially as described previously (21Cheng A. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1846-1854Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified using Bradford (Bio-Rad) protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples (5–50 μg of total protein/lane) were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblotting was performed with primary anti-human p53 purified mouse monoclonal antibodies and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (BD Pharmingen) to identify total p53 protein. The identification of site-specific phosphorylation was achieved with antibodies recognizing the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, Ser-37, Ser-6, and Ser-392. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Promega) was used as a secondary antibody when phosphorylation-specific antibodies were employed. Antibody association was detected employing ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England) essentially following the protocols of the manufacturer. 2′-O-(2-Methoxy)ethylphosphorothioate oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described previously (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar, 19Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar, 20Dean N.M. Griffey R.G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug. Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of p53 expression and Northern blot analysis were performed essentially as described previously (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol.

Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1846-1854Google Scholar). Briefly, cells that reached ∼60–70% confluency in 60-mm dishes were washed once with DMEM and then treated with a solution (1 ml) of DMEM containing oligonucleotides at the indicated concentrations and 15 μg/ml DOTMA/DOPE (Lipofectin®). After incubating for 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed and replace with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. At the times indicated, the cells were scraped in TRIzol®, and RNA or proteins were prepared for Northern or Western blot analysis, respectively, as described above. A549 cells were plated at a density of 300,000 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish and incubated overnight. After 24 h the cells were transfected with p21-luciferase reporter plasmids and treated with ISIS 110332 (to suppress p53 expression) or ISIS 122205 (a mismatch control) as described above. After 4 h the cells were washed with media and plated in fresh media containing 100 nm dexamethasone. After 24 h the cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured with a Monolight 2010 luminometer as described previously (9Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27638-27646Google Scholar). The p21-luciferase reporter plasmid was generously provided by Dr. P. Howe (Cleveland Clinic Foundation). To study the relationship of GR, p53, PP5, and p21Waf1/Cip1 in human cells, we needed a system that would allow us to independently regulate the expression of either p53 or PP5 in cells that are p21Waf1/Cip1 wild-type and sensitive to dexamethasone-induced growth suppression. Although dexamethasone has been reported to suppress growth in many types of cells, after testing numerous cell lines we failed to find a single p53-null cell line that was still sensitive to growth suppression by dexamethasone. Indeed, a search of the published literature failed to reveal even a single report documenting dexamethasone-induced growth suppression in p53-defective or p53-null cells. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that treatment with either dexamethasone (18Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Google Scholar) or ISIS 15534 can induce G1 growth arrest with a concomitant increase in the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 in A549 cells (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar, 17Dean D.A. Urban G. Aragon I.V. Swingle M. Miller B. Rusconi S. Bueno M. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 6Google Scholar). This suggests we could use A549 cells as a model if we could develop a method of suppressing p53 expression. Therefore, we developed potent and highly specific “chimeric” 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides that suppressed the expression of human p53. To identify a suppressor of p53 expression, oligonucleotides, 20 bases in length and predicted to hybridize to different regions of human p53 mRNA, were synthesized and tested for their ability to suppress the expression of human p53 employing Northern and Western blot analyses as described previously (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar, 16Honkanen R.E. Crooke S.T. Antisense Drug Technology: Principles, Strategies and Applications.

Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides tested were designed to target specific regions in the protein coding, the 5′-untranslated or the 3′-untranslated regions of human p53 mRNAs, and were chimeric 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphorothioate oligonucleotides, containing 10 central phosphorothioate oligodeoxy residues (“oligodeoxy gap”) flanked by five 2′-O-(2-methoxy) residues on the 3′- and 5′-ends. These modifications have been shown previously to enhance the potency of antisense oligonucleotides targeting mRNAs encoding other proteins (12Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Google Scholar, 22Zellweger T. Miyake H. Cooper S. Chi K. Conklin B.S. Monia B.P. Gleave M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 934-940Google Scholar, 23Zhang H. Cook J. Nickel J. Yu R. Stecker K. Myers K. Dean N.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 862-867Google Scholar). Because phosphorothioate oligonucleotides commonly act through an RNase H-dependent mRNA cleavage mechanisms in cells (24Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 329-376Google Scholar), the ability of a particular oligonucleotide to inhibit the expression of p53 was originally identified based on their ability to inhibit p53 mRNA expression (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar, 16Honkanen R.E. Crooke S.T. Antisense Drug Technology: Principles, Strategies and Applications. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 587-614Google Scholar, 20Dean N.M. Griffey R.G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug. Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Google Scholar). The initial screen revealed that many oligonucleotides had little or no effect on the inhibition of p53 mRNA levels, whereas others had a moderate effect, and a few had pronounced effects. The activity of the active antisense oligonucleotides was verified with dose-response studies, utilizing Northern analysis to detect changes in p53 mRNA levels and Western analysis to detect changes in the level of p53 protein. Of the antisense oligonucleotides identified as having potent inhibitory activity against p53 in the initial screen, two were chosen for further characterization. Both of these antisense oligonucleotides produced a dose-dependent inhibition of p53 expression, and representative Northern and Western blots for ISIS 110332 are shown in Fig. 1. To test the specificity of the response, several mismatched control oligonucleotides were also synthesized and tested. The mismatched control analogues contain the same base composition and same chemistry as the antisense oligonucleotides targeting p53. However, the sequences are scrambled and noncomplementary to p53. None of the mismatched controls inhibited p53 protein expression. Time course analysis revealed that p53 protein levels could be effectively suppressed 4 h after the addition of antisense oligonucleotides (Fig.1 C). As observed previously with chimeric 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphorothioate oligonucleotides that target other proteins (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol.

Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1846-1854Google Scholar), protein levels remained repressed for ∼3 days. The cationic lipids (DOTMA/DOPE; Lipofectin®) were used to facilitate the uptake of the oligonucleotides (25Bennett C.F. Chiang M.Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033Google Scholar) and had no apparent effect on p53 mRNA or protein levels. Having developed a method of specifically inhibiting the expression of human p53, we next tested the effect of a single treatment with ISIS 110332 at 300 nm on A549 cells. Similar to results obtained in studies employing p53-deficient human cells or cells derived from mice homozygously null for p53 (26Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Google Scholar, 27Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Google Scholar), A549 cell growth was not dependent on p53. In contrast, the suppression of p53 was associated with an increase (∼26%) in the rate of cell proliferation (Table I).Table IEffects of ISIS 110332 on A549 cell growthTimemm control (ISIS 116947; 300 nm)Anti-p53 (ISIS 110332; 300 nm)daysNumber of cellsNumber of cells (% of controls)1628,563 ± 33,391601,783 ± 7,918 (96%)21,165,090 ± 13,2171,463,940 ± 18,351 (126%1-ap ≤ 0.01.)A549 cells in log phase growth were treated with a single dose (300 nm) at time zero with ISIS 110332 or the mismatched control analogue, ISIS 116947 (as described under “Experimental Procedures”).

Cell number was determined 24 and 48 h following treatment. Each point represents the mean of triplicate cultures with error bars representing mean ± S.E. of four different experiments. The ability of glucocorticoids to suppress cell growth can be diminished or lost as cells are passed in culture. Therefore, to ensure our cell cultures were responding as reported previously, we treated A459 cells with dexamethasone and measured both p21Waf1/Cip1 mRNA levels and proliferation rates. As reported previously, 50–100 nm dexamethasone was sufficient to suppress A459 cell growth (18Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Google Scholar). FACS analysis 24 h after treatment with a single dose of 100 nm dexamethasone revealed that the majority of the cells became arrested prior to the onset of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2), which is similar to the effect produced by treatment with ISIS 15534, which targets PP5 (15Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Google Scholar, 18Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Google Scholar). Northern analysis confirmed that dexamethasone treatment produced a dose-dependent increase in the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 (Fig. 2, inset). Dexamethasone-induced p21Waf1/Cip1expression was clearly evident after ∼24 h, and maximal induction occurred ∼48 h after continuous exposure to ∼100 nmdexamethasone (Figs. 2 and 3) (18Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Google Scholar). A single treatment with 300 nm ISIS 110332 inhibited dexamethasone-induced p21WAF1/Cip1 expression at all concentrations tested, even in cell cultures continuously exposed to 100 nm dexamethasone for 48 h (Fig. 3). The inhibition of p53 expression also suppressed the basal expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, treatment with mismatched control antisense oligonucleotides did not suppress dexamethasone-induc"

In spreading platelets, most endogenous ASAP1 is localized at peripheral focal adhesions. To determine the physiologic significance of the CrkL-ASAP1 association, we overexpressed CrkL, ASAP1, or both in combination in COS7 cells. Unlike endogenous ASAP1 in platelets, overexpressed ASAP1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. However, when co-expressed with wild-type CrkL, both endogenous and expressed ASAP1 accumulated at CrkL-induced focal adhesions. An SH2-mutated CrkL, which cannot localize at focal adhesions, failed to recruit ASAP1 into focal adhesions. Thus, CrkL appears to be a lynchpin between ASAP1 and peripheral focal adhesions.

CrkL also binds to a Rap-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G, through its N-terminal SH3 domain and, thus, conveys C3G to focal adhesions. C3G activates a small GTPase Rap1 and regulates cell adhesion and spreading, indicating that the CrkL-C3G complex is a critical component of focal adhesions (4Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J.

On the other hand, ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are also members of the Ras-related small GTPases and function in the regulation of membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton (8Chavrier P.

Similar to other GTPases, the activity of Arfs is regulated positively by GEFs and negatively by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Recently, several Arf GAPs have been cloned and characterized and found to have phosphoinositide-dependent GAP activity toward Arfs (10Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R360-R362Google Scholar). ASAP1 (also called DEF-1, for differentiation enhancing factor-1), the prototype of the phosphoinositide-dependent Arf GAP family, is a multidomain protein with pleckstrin homology, Arf GAP, ankyrin repeat, proline-rich region, and SH3 domains. ASAP1 binds to phosphatidylinositol (4Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M.

Hu E. Harris D.F. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2330-2337Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, endogenous ASAP1 localizes in focal adhesions and, when overexpressed, ASAP1 affects cell spreading of NIH3T3 cells on fibronectin (14Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Google Scholar). Although the function of Arf in focal adhesions is not clear yet, the localization of ASAP1 and its effect on cell spreading suggests the importance of Arf signaling on the dynamics of focal adhesions. During our continual efforts to clarify the role of CrkL in the regulation of signal transduction, we found that the SH3 domain of CrkL binds to ASAP1. The data obtained from studies using platelets and COS7 cells overexpressing ASAP1 revealed that CrkL is a critical lynchpin between ASAP1 and focal adhesions. Blood from healthy volunteers, after obtaining written informed consent, was drawn by venipuncture into a one-tenth volume of 3.8% (w/v) trisodium citrate and gently mixed. Alternatively, buffy coat, provided by the Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center (Sapporo, Japan), was used instead of whole blood. Washed human platelets were prepared as described previously (7Oda A. Ochs H.D. Lasky L.A. Spencer S. Ozaki K. Fujihara M. Handa M. Ikebuchi K. Ikeda H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2633-26396Google Scholar) and suspended in a modified Hepes-Tyrode buffer (129 mm NaCl, 8.9 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmKCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm dextrose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 3 × 108 cells/ml with apyrase (2 units/ml) at 37 °C. Specific affinity-purified anti-ASAP1 antibody (642) was prepared as previously described (12Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Google Scholar). Anti-ASAP1, anti-phospho-FAK, and anti-paxillin (cross-reactive with Hic-5) monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Jackson, KY). Anti-CrkL and anti-C3G polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An anti-CrkL monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Technologies (Lake Placid, NY). An anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, thrombin, and other reagents were from Sigma. Platelets in suspension (0.5 ml) were lysed by the addition of an equal amount of lysis buffer (15 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.8 μg/ml leupeptin, 2% Triton X-100 (v/w), pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using the enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) methods were performed as previously described (7Oda A. Ochs H.D. Lasky L.A. Spencer S. Ozaki K. Fujihara M. Handa M. Ikebuchi K. Ikeda H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2633-26396Google Scholar). GST-CrkL N-terminal SH3 fusion protein was a gift from Dr. Brian J. Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University). Production of GST fusion proteins and binding experiments using cell lysates were performed as previously described (7Oda A. Ochs H.D. Lasky L.A. Spencer S. Ozaki K. Fujihara M. Handa M. Ikebuchi K. Ikeda H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2633-26396Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were isolated from sonicated bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were used to normalize the expression of the various GST fusion proteins. From platelet lysates, we precipitated proteins that bind to the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL. Following digestion by trypsin, the bound proteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS using a Voyager-DE/STR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The proteins were identified by comparison between the molecular weights determined by MALDI-TOF/MS and the theoretical peptide masses from the proteins registered in NCBInr. The Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton from thrombin-stimulated platelets was isolated as previously described (15Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20075-20081Google Scholar). An equal amount of lysis buffer was added to the platelet suspensions to solubilize the platelets. After 5 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g. The resulting pellet was washed twice in washing buffer. For one-dimensional SDS electrophoresis, the Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer. The full-length cDNA of a murine ASAP1β expression plasmid was constructed in the pCI (FLAG tag) vector. Human CrkL cDNA, a gift from John Groffen (Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA), was subcloned into pCXN2 with FLAG tag and designated as pCXN2-Flag-CrkL. SH2 mutant of CrkL, which was mutated on codon 38, CGC (Arg) to GTC (Val), was generated by PCR, subcloned into pCXN2 vector with FLAG tag, and designated as pCXN2-Flag-CrkLR38V. The expression vector of FLAG tag C3G (a gift from Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda) was described previously (4Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Google Scholar). To obtain cell lysates, COS7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of recombinant plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were harvested with SDS sample buffer and sonicated for SDS-PAGE analysis. Alternatively, the cells were harvested with the lysis buffer as described above for immunoprecipitation. Platelets from diluted platelet-rich plasma were allowed to spread on glass coverslips for 1 h at 37 ° or COS7 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Following treatment with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 15 min, the cells were permeabilized in 0.15% Triton X-100 for 1 min and blocked with Block Ace (Snow Brand, Tokyo) for 30 min. The samples were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and subjected to extensive washing. Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies and Alexa-conjugated phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Images were taken with an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) with a ×100 oil objective lens and processed by Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. Platelet proteins were precipitated by the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL, expressed as a GST fusion protein, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. A 140-kDa band was observed, which was consistently precipitated by GST-CrkL but not GST alone. A mass spectrometry analysis following trypsin digestion revealed that the 140-kDa band contained several peptides derived from the human homologue of mouse ASAP1 (KIAA1249 clone) (Fig.1 A). The anti-ASAP antibody consistently recognized the 140-kDa protein precipitated by GST-CrkL (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Furthermore, ASAP1 was also specifically immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates by anti-CrkL antibody, indicating the in vivo interaction of CrkL with ASAP1 (Fig. 1 B, right panels). We next examined whether ASAP1 translocates to the Triton X-100-insoluble pellets in activated platelets, which represent the operationally defined actin cytoskeleton (15Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20075-20081Google Scholar, 16Fox J.E. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 884-893Google Scholar), as reported for CrkL (5Oda A. Miyakawa Y. Druker B.J. Ishida A. Ozaki K. Ohashi H. Wakui M. Handa M. Watanabe K. Okamoto S. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 4303-4313Google Scholar). We found that ASAP1 translocated to the thrombin-activated actin cytoskeleton depending upon platelet aggregation (Fig. 1 C). We also confirmed and extended our previous observations that CrkL also translocates to aggregation-dependent Triton X-100-insoluble pellets (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that the ASAP1-CrkL complex may be involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton following platelet aggregation. In glass-activated spreading human platelets, most of ASAP1 was localized in the areas where stress fibers terminate (Fig.2 B). The ASAP1-rich structures were also enriched with CrkL, Hic-5, and phosphorylated FAK, suggesting that, in platelets, ASAP1 is accumulated at focal adhesions (Fig. 2,A, C, and D). This result is consistent with the previous report of ASAP1 localization in NIH3T3 cells (12Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Google Scholar). It should be noted that platelets express Hic-5, a focal adhesions protein, instead of paxillin (17Hagmann J. Grob M. Welman A. van Willigen G. Burger M.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2181-2188Google Scholar). As the spreading of platelets on glass coverslips is also an αIIbβ3 integrin-dependent process (18Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Google Scholar, 19Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Google Scholar, 20Broberg M. Eriksson C. Nygren H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2002; 139: 163-172Google Scholar), the data further suggest that the ASAP1-CrkL complex is involved in reorganization of the cytoskeleton following ligation of αIIbβ3 integrin. As we cannot express proteins in platelets, we further investigated the physiologic significance of the CrkL-ASAP1 interaction in ectopic expression systems. Wild-type CrkL and ASAP1 were overexpressed in COS7 cells. CrkL was purified from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting following SDS-PAGE analysis. FLAG-tagged CrkL and ASAP1 were present in the CrkL immunoprecipitate, and the immunizing peptide for the CrkL antiserum strongly inhibited the precipitation of both bands (Fig.3 A), suggesting that CrkL and ASAP specifically associate in COS7 cells. Both wild-type and SH2-mutated CrkL were coprecipitated with ASAP1, suggesting that the intact SH2 domain is not necessary for CrkL-ASAP1 interaction (Fig.3 B). Next, we examined the effects of CrkL overexpression on the localization of both endogenous ASAP1 and CrkL. In the cells where CrkL was not overexpressed, both CrkL and ASAP1, expressed at low levels, diffusely distributed as small dots, which were relatively enriched at the peripheral portion of the cells (Fig.4 A). However, on uncoated glass coverslips, CrkL overexpression led to the formation of peripheral focal adhesions, presumably through the CrkL-mediated increased avidity of integrin (21Uemura N. Salgia R. Ewaniuk D.S. Little M.T. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3343-3353Google Scholar, 22Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Google Scholar) to adhesive proteins in bovine serum adsorbed on glass coverslips. Both CrkL and endogenous ASAP1 exactly colocalized at these focal adhesions (Fig. 4 B). It was reported that the overexpression of ASAP1 led to destruction of focal adhesions in NIH3T3 cells cultured on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (14Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overexpression of ASAP1 and CrkL did not inhibit the formation of focal adhesions or colocalization of these proteins (Fig. 4 B). CrkL is known to accumulate at focal adhesions through its interaction with Cas or paxillin, via its SH2 domain (1ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 2Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 637-644Google Scholar, 3Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Google Scholar). In agreement with the critical role of the SH2 domain, the SH2-mutated CrkL did not induce the formation of peripheral focal adhesions or accumulation of ASAP1 at the structures (Fig. 4 C). The overexpression of ASAP1 alone did not induce peripheral focal adhesions and it was diffusedly distributed (Fig. 4 D) as was reported previously (14Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Google Scholar). It appeared that ASAP1 does not disrupt focal adhesions if enough CrkL is present to accommodate ASAP1. In other words, overexpressed ASAP1 may remove other CrkL ligands from focal adhesions. The prime candidate of such molecules is C3G (4Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Google Scholar), which is a ligand for CrkL and accumulates at focal adhesions, through its interaction with CrkL.Figure 4Fluorescence micrographs showing the localization of ASAP1 and CrkL in COS7 cells. COS7 cells were allowed to attach and grow on glass coverslips overnight and were transfected with expression vectors. After a further overnight incubation, the cells were fixed and stained for CrkL and ASAP1 as indicated. A, wild-type CrkL was overexpressed.B, both wild-type CrkL and ASAP1 were overexpressed.C, both SH2-mutated CrkL and ASAP1 were overexpressed.D, only ASAP1 was overexpressed and identified by a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) C3G binds to CrkL through specific interaction of the proline-rich domain of C3G with the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL (4Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Google Scholar). If ASAP1 binds to the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL in vivo, then the overexpression of C3G should compete with ASAP1 for binding to CrkL. The results shown in the Fig. 5 supported this hypothesis. The overepression of C3G inhibited co-precipitation of ASAP1 and CrkL (Fig. 5), suggesting that the binding of both proteins to CrkL may be mutually exclusive. Despite the recognized importance of Arf in cell biology (8Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Google Scholar, 9Randazzo P.A. Nie Z. Miura K. Hsu V.W. Sci. STKE. 2000; 59: 1-15Google Scholar), the role of Arf in platelet function has received surprisingly little attention. Our finding that ASAP1 is a novel CrkL ligand, which may be involved in αIIbβ3 signaling, should set the molecular basis for further studies on Arf and its GAPs in platelets. Mass spectrometry analyses following two-dimensional electrophoresis of platelet protein were performed, and the presence of a number of hitherto undescribed platelet proteins was reported (23O'Neill E.E. Brock C.J. von Kriegsheim A.F. Pearce A.C. Dwek R.A. Watson S.P. Hebestreit H.F. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 288-305Google Scholar,24Maguire P.B. Wynne K.J. Harney D.F. O'Donoghue N.M. Stephens G. Fitzgerald D.J. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 642-648Google Scholar). Our approach confirms that mass spectrometry is indeed a powerful approach to identify platelet proteins. Furthermore, our approach also employs a pull-down assay before mass spectrometry, thus enabling us to identify a novel protein-to-protein interaction. The mechanisms of accumulation of ASAP1 at focal adhesions were unclear. Our data suggest that CrkL is one of the carriers of ASAP1 to focal adhesions, not ruling out the possibility that adapters like Crk (1ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 2Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 637-644Google Scholar, 3Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Google Scholar) have similar roles in other situations. Recently, Liu et al. (25Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Google Scholar) reported that ASAP1 directly binds to FAK and suggest that ASAP1 may be a component of multimolecular complexes at focal adhesions. The overexpression of wild-type ASAP1 reportedly retarded the spreading of REF52 cells plated on fibronectin (25Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Google Scholar). The overexpression of a truncated variant of ASAP1 unable to bind to FAK resulted in a less pronounced inhibition of cell spreading (25Liu Y. Loijens J.C. Martin K.H. Karginov A.V. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2147-2156Google Scholar). These data suggest that while FAK is a major scaffolding protein for ASAP1, there must be focal adhesions proteins other than FAK responsible for localization of ASAP1. As CrkL binds to paxillin or Cas, and locates at focal adhesions (1ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 2Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 637-644Google Scholar, 3Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Google Scholar), the adapter may contribute to “FAK-independent” functions of ASAP1 at focal adhesions. Interestingly, it was recently reported that the overexpression of ASAP1 inhibited spreading of NIH3T3 cells, and the effect was independent of its Arf GAP activity (26Furman C. Short S.M. Subramanian R.R. Zetter B.R. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7962-7969Google Scholar). It is possible that physical replacement of C3G by ASAP1 is involved in such an effect. More recently, a RalBP1-binding protein was shown to interact with mouse ASAP1 (27Oshiro T. Koyama S. Sugiyama S. Kondo A. Onodera Y. Asahara T. Sabe H. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38618-38626Google Scholar). In the same report, the association of PAG2 (a human homologue of ASAP1) and POB1 was demonstrated. It was suggested that POB1 interacts with PAG2 through its proline-rich motif, similar to FAK, thereby regulating cell migration. Taken together, CrkL is a critical regulator of localization of ASAP1, likely through its interaction with focal adhesions proteins like paxillin or Cas, and, through cooperation with FAK and POB1, the adapter may be critically involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.

https://openalex.org/W2000359393,"The induction of heat shock protein gene expression in response to stress is critical for the ability of organisms to cope with and survive exposure to these stresses. However, most studies on HSF1-mediated induction of hsp70 gene expression have utilized immortalized cell lines and temperatures above the physiologically relevant range. For these reasons much less is known about the heat shock response as it occurs in mammalian cells within tissues in the intact organism. To gain insight into this area we determined the temperature thresholds for activation of HSF1 DNA binding in different mouse tissues. We have found that HSF1 DNA binding activity and hsp70 synthesis are induced in spleen cells at significantly lower temperatures relative to cells of other tissues, with a temperature threshold for activation (39 °C) that is within the physiological range for fever. Furthermore, we found that the lowered temperature set point for induction of the stress response in spleen is specific to T-lymphocytes residing within this tissue and is not exhibited by B-lymphocytes. This lowered threshold is also observed in T-lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes, suggesting that it is a general property of T-lymphocytes, and is seen in different mouse strains. Fever is an early event in the immune response to infection, and thus activation of the cellular stress response in T-lymphocytes by fever temperatures could serve as a way to give these cells enough time to express hsps in anticipation of their function in the coming immune response. The induced hsps likely protect these cells from the stressful conditions that can exist during the immune response, for example increasing their protection against stress-induced apoptosis.

The induced hsps likely protect these cells from the stressful conditions that can exist during the immune response, for example increasing their protection against stress-induced apoptosis. When cells are exposed to elevated temperature, they respond by rapidly increasing the expression of heat shock proteins (hsps), which act to protect essential cellular functions from the adverse effects of increased temperature (1Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Google Scholar, 2Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1743-1748Google Scholar, 3Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Weissman J.S. Adv.

This phenomenon, known as the cellular stress response, is mediated by a transcriptional regulatory protein called heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription which exhibits heat-inducible DNA binding activity. Upon exposure of cells to elevated temperature, HSF1 is converted from an inactive monomeric form to a trimeric DNA-binding form, which then interacts with specific sequences in the promoters of hsp genes and induces their transcription (5Christians E.S.

Our previous studies analyzing HSF1 activation in a limited set of mouse tissues in response to whole body hyperthermia at different temperatures revealed that the threshold temperature for HSF1 activation can vary between tissues. The temperature threshold for activation of HSF1 DNA binding in male germ cells is 35 °C, consistent with the known temperature sensitivity of this cell type (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Google Scholar). However, in the somatic testis cell types and liver cells of these heat-treated mice, HSF1 DNA binding was not activated until a temperature of ∼42 °C was reached (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Google Scholar, 13Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18745-18748Google Scholar). This is well above the temperature of most fevers, leading us to question whether any cell types in mammalian species exhibit HSF1 activation at lower temperatures (e.g. 39–40 °C) more consistent with the typical fever.To test this we repeated our experiment and analyzed HSF1 activation temperature thresholds in a larger group of mouse tissues, including lung, spleen, kidney, and heart. Similar to previous results on liver and somatic testis cells, lung, pancreas, and heart exhibited an HSF1 activation threshold of ∼42 °C. However, HSF1 DNA binding was activated in spleen beginning at a temperature of 39 °C, well within the range of normal febrile temperatures. This was associated with induction of hsp70 expression in this same temperature range. Two major cell types present in spleen are B-cells and T-cells. Interestingly, the lowered temperature threshold for HSF1 activation is exhibited by T-cells but not B-cells, the latter exhibiting activation at ∼42 °C. T-lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes also show this lowered threshold. Since appearance of fever is one of the first events associated with infection, activation of the cellular stress response in T-cells at febrile temperatures could serve to ratchet up the level of stress protection in these cells in anticipation of the coming immune response, ensuring their ability to function under the stressful conditions that can exist during this response.RESULTSTo determine whether there was any variation in the temperature set point for induction of the cellular stress response between different somatic cell types, we first compared the temperature profiles for activation of HSF DNA binding in cells of various mouse tissues. Mice were subjected to whole-body hyperthermia at various temperatures from 38 to 42 °C for 60 min. Measurements indicated that core body temperatures of the animals reached the temperature of the water bath within 15 min and thereafter stabilized at that temperature for the duration of the treatment. Following the treatments, tissues were collected and analyzed by gel shift assay employing a specific HSF-binding oligonucleotide probe. Most of the tissues tested, including heart, liver, and kidney, displayed an HSF activation profile very similar to that displayed by lung (Fig.1 A). In these tissues, significant HSF activation is not observed until temperatures of 41 °C are reached, with higher levels observed in animals treated at 42 °C. In contrast, spleen displayed an HSF activation profile that is shifted to significantly lower temperatures relative to the other tissues (Fig. 1 B). High levels of HSF DNA binding activity are observed in spleens of animals treated at a temperature of 39 °C, with similar levels present at 40 and 41 °C and diminishing levels at 42 °C.To verify that the HSF DNA binding activity induced in spleen at the lowered temperature threshold of 39 °C does in fact mediate a productive cellular stress response, we performed RT-PCR analysis to measure levels of hsp70 mRNA in total RNA preparations of lung and spleen of animals treated at the various temperatures. To allow a good comparison to the HSF DNA-binding profiles in each tissue, the samples of tissue used for the RT-PCR analysis were from the same animals used for the gel shift analysis whose results are shown in Fig. 1. hsp70 amplification products were quantitated and normalized to S16 ribosomal protein mRNA internal controls to facilitate accurate comparison of hsp70 mRNA levels between tissue samples. Very little induction of hsp70 mRNA is observed in lung at temperatures below 41 °C, with maximal induction at 42 °C (Fig. 2,A and C). However, significant induction of hsp70 mRNA is first observed in spleen at the temperature of 39 °C (8-fold), with similar levels at 40 °C (8.6-fold) and slightly higher levels at 41 °C (14.6-fold) and 42 °C (23-fold) (Fig. 2,B and C).We next determined whether the lowered temperature set point we observed for HSF activation in spleen was a general property of spleen cell types or whether it was specific to one or more of the cell types contained within this tissue. T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes were isolated from spleens of C3H/HeNCr mice, heated in vitro at various temperatures, and then extracts made from these cells were subjected to gel shift analysis. Significant HSF DNA binding is observed in B-lymphocytes only at temperatures of 41 °C or higher (Fig. 3 A). This temperature profile for activation of HSF DNA binding is very similar to that observed for cells of most somatic tissues (e.g. Fig.1 A). In contrast, purified T-lymphocytes exhibit a profile of HSF activation that is shifted to significantly lower temperatures relative to B-lymphocytes (Fig. 3 B). High levels of HSF DNA binding activity are induced in these cells by treatment at 39 °C, with slightly higher levels induced at 40 °C and decreasing levels at 41 °C.Figure 3Lowered HSF activation temperature in spleen is specific to T-lymphocytes. A and B, B-lymphocytes (A) and T-lymphocytes (B) were isolated from spleens of C3H/HeNCr mice, incubated in vitroat various temperatures from 37 to 42 °C for 60 min, and then extracts of these cells were subjected to gel shift analysis using a specific 32P-labeled HSF-binding oligonucleotide.

The results (Fig.4 A) show a similar profile of HSF activation at temperatures in the range of 39–41 °C, indicating that reduced HSF activation temperature in splenic T-lymphocytes is likely a general property and not mouse strain-dependent. Another possibility is that this temperature profile may be a property unique to T-lymphocytes found in the spleen, not shared by T-lymphocytes found outside this tissue. This possibility was tested by examining HSF activation temperature of CD4+ T-lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the HSF activation temperature profile of these cells is very similar to that observed for cells isolated from spleen (Figs. 3 B and4 A), suggesting that the phenomenon of lowered HSF activation temperature is a general property of T-lymphocytes.Figure 4Lowered HSF activation temperature of T-lymphocytes is not mouse strain-dependent and is also observed in T-lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes. Aand B, CD4+ T-lymphocytes were isolated from spleens (A) or lymph nodes (B) of BALB/c mice, incubatedin vitro at various temperatures from 37 to 42 °C for 60 min, and then extracts of these cells were subjected to gel shift analysis using a specific 32P-labeled HSF-binding oligonucleotide. Temperatures at which cells were incubated are indicated at top of panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our previous studies showed that mouse cells express two different members of an HSF protein family, HSF1 and HSF2, and demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of HSF1 is heat-inducible while that of HSF2 is not (37Shimizu M. Shimizu Y. Kodama Y. Infect. Immun. 1978; 21: 747-752Google Scholar). In most cell types studied to date, HSF1 DNA binding is activated only at temperatures of 41 °C and higher. Fig.5 shows that the DNA binding activity induced in purified T-lymphocytes by heat treatment at 39 °C is composed of HSF1 and not HSF2, as antibodies specific to HSF1 perturb this activity while antibodies to HSF2 do not. These results indicate that some mechanism specific to T-lymphocytes functions to lower the temperature set point for activation of HSF1 DNA binding in this cell type relative to other cell types.Figure 5HSF activated at lower temperature threshold in T-cells is composed of HSF1. Extracts of purified T-lymphocytes incubated at 39 °C were subjected to gel shift analysis in the absence (No Ab) or presence of polyclonal antibodies specific to HSF1 (α-HSF1) or HSF2 (α-HSF2).

We do not know the specific function of activation of the cellular stress response in T-cells at fever temperatures. However, in light of the known cytoprotective functions of hsps, one possibility is that hsp expression at fever temperatures provides T-lymphocytes with an enhanced ability to withstand the adverse cellular environments that can exist during an immune response. In support of this possibility, previous studies showed that elevation of hsp70 expression in T-cells by transfection decreases stress-induced apoptosis, and thus one possibility is that the mechanism we have uncovered could serve to protect T-cells against apoptosis during an immune response when they are often exposed to stressful environments (19Mosser D.D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Google Scholar). hsps also play essential roles as molecular chaperones in the folding, assembly, and transport of newly translated proteins (1Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Google Scholar, 2Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1743-1748Google Scholar, 3Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Weissman J.S. Adv.

Care Med. 2002; 30: S43-S50Google Scholar). Therefore, another possibility is that T-lymphocytes require higher levels of hsps to handle the large increase in protein synthesis that occurs in those T-cells that become activated and undergo rapid proliferation. Up-regulation of hsps could also be necessary to chaperone the receptors that function in signaling events between T-lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system (21Melnick J. Argon Y. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 243-250Google Scholar,22Robey E. Allison J.P. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 306-310Google Scholar).One or more of the mechanisms above could explain previous observations that fever temperatures enhance a number of important functional properties of T-lymphocytes, including mitogen- and cytokine-induced proliferation and cell-mediated responses (23Smith J.B. Knowlton R.P. Agarwal S.S. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 691-694Google Scholar, 24Saririan K. Nickerson D.A. Cell. Immunol. 1982; 74: 306-312Google Scholar, 25Duff G.W. Durum S.K. Yale J. Biol.

On a higher level, these mechanisms could contribute at least partially to the long known observation that the presence of fever increases the ability of organisms to mount an immune response (Refs. 31Armstrong C.

Therefore, fever-induced hsp expression in T-lymphocytes may represent an important molecular mechanism by which fever acts to boost the immune response of an organism.These results also indicate that cell type-dependent regulation of the temperature set point for activation of the cellular response may be a more widespread phenomenon than was previously thought. Our previous studies showed that male germ cell types of mouse testis activate HSF1 DNA binding at a threshold temperature of 35 °C, a temperature 7 °C lower than the temperature at which HSF1 is activated in cell types such as liver cells (42 °C) (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Google Scholar, 13Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18745-18748Google Scholar). These studies also revealed that somatic cell types present in the testis do not share the lowered HSF activation temperature exhibited by the male germ cell types of this tissue, and instead display an HSF temperature set point (42 °C) that is identical to that of other somatic cell types such as liver. On the basis of these results, we had hypothesized that alteration in the temperature set point for the cellular stress response is a property unique to male germ cell types and that all somatic cell types would exhibit the “normal” set point of 42 °C. However, the results presented in this paper show unequivocally that this is not the case and that the temperature set point for inducible hsp expression can also be differentially regulated in somatic cell types. Indeed, another study found that HSF1 DNA binding activity is induced in cells of the nervous system of rabbit, particularly the cerebellum, at temperatures in the fever range (43Brown I.R. Rush S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 52-57Google Scholar). The goal of future studies is to elucidate the mechanism(s) that regulate cell type-dependent differences in HSF activation temperature, which will also increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of heat-induced HSF activation itself. When cells are exposed to elevated temperature, they respond by rapidly increasing the expression of heat shock proteins (hsps), which act to protect essential cellular functions from the adverse effects of increased temperature (1Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Google Scholar, 2Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1743-1748Google Scholar, 3Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Weissman J.S. Adv.

Care Med. 2002; 30: S43-S50Google Scholar). This phenomenon, known as the cellular stress response, is mediated by a transcriptional regulatory protein called heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription which exhibits heat-inducible DNA binding activity. Upon exposure of cells to elevated temperature, HSF1 is converted from an inactive monomeric form to a trimeric DNA-binding form, which then interacts with specific sequences in the promoters of hsp genes and induces their transcription (5Christians E.S.

Fever represents a physiological example of elevated temperature in an organism. Our previous studies analyzing HSF1 activation in a limited set of mouse tissues in response to whole body hyperthermia at different temperatures revealed that the threshold temperature for HSF1 activation can vary between tissues. The temperature threshold for activation of HSF1 DNA binding in male germ cells is 35 °C, consistent with the known temperature sensitivity of this cell type (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Google Scholar). However, in the somatic testis cell types and liver cells of these heat-treated mice, HSF1 DNA binding was not activated until a temperature of ∼42 °C was reached (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Google Scholar, 13Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18745-18748Google Scholar). This is well above the temperature of most fevers, leading us to question whether any cell types in mammalian species exhibit HSF1 activation at lower temperatures (e.g. 39–40 °C) more consistent with the typical fever. To test this we repeated our experiment and analyzed HSF1 activation temperature thresholds in a larger group of mouse tissues, including lung, spleen, kidney, and heart. Similar to previous results on liver and somatic testis cells, lung, pancreas, and heart exhibited an HSF1 activation threshold of ∼42 °C. However, HSF1 DNA binding was activated in spleen beginning at a temperature of 39 °C, well within the range of normal febrile temperatures. This was associated with induction of hsp70 expression in this same temperature range. Two major cell types present in spleen are B-cells and T-cells. Interestingly, the lowered temperature threshold for HSF1 activation is exhibited by T-cells but not B-cells, the latter exhibiting activation at ∼42 °C. T-lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes also show this lowered threshold. Since appearance of fever is one of the first events associated with infection, activation of the cellular stress response in T-cells at febrile temperatures could serve to ratchet up the level of stress protection in these cells in anticipation of the coming immune response, ensuring their ability to function under the stressful conditions that can exist during this response. RESULTSTo determine whether there was any variation in the temperature set point for induction of the cellular stress response between different somatic cell types, we first compared the temperature profiles for activation of HSF DNA binding in cells of various mouse tissues. Mice were subjected to whole-body hyperthermia at various temperatures from 38 to 42 °C for 60 min. Measurements indicated that core body temperatures of the animals reached the temperature of the water bath within 15 min and thereafter stabilized at that temperature for the duration of the treatment. Following the treatments, tissues were collected and analyzed by gel shift assay employing a specific HSF-binding oligonucleotide probe. Most of the tissues tested, including heart, liver, and kidney, displayed an HSF activation profile very similar to that displayed by lung (Fig.1 A). In these tissues, significant HSF activation is not observed until temperatures of 41 °C are reached, with higher levels observed in animals treated at 42 °C. In contrast, spleen displayed an HSF activation profile that is shifted to significantly lower temperatures relative to the other tissues (Fig. 1 B). High levels of HSF DNA binding activity are observed in spleens of animals treated at a temperature of 39 °C, with similar levels present at 40 and 41 °C and diminishing levels at 42 °C.To verify that the HSF DNA binding activity induced in spleen at the lowered temperature threshold of 39 °C does in fact mediate a productive cellular stress response, we performed RT-PCR analysis to measure levels of hsp70 mRNA in total RNA preparations of lung and spleen of animals treated at the various temperatures.

Very little induction of hsp70 mRNA is observed in lung at temperatures below 41 °C, with maximal induction at 42 °C (Fig. 2,A and C). However, significant induction of hsp70 mRNA is first observed in spleen at the temperature of 39 °C (8-fold), with similar levels at 40 °C (8.6-fold) and slightly higher levels at 41 °C (14.6-fold) and 42 °C (23-fold) (Fig. 2,B and C).We next determined whether the lowered temperature set point we observed for HSF activation in spleen was a general property of spleen cell types or whether it was specific to one or more of the cell types contained within this tissue. T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes were isolated from spleens of C3H/HeNCr mice, heated in vitro at various temperatures, and then extracts made from these cells were subjected to gel shift analysis. Significant HSF DNA binding is observed in B-lymphocytes only at temperatures of 41 °C or higher (Fig. 3 A). This temperature profile for activation of HSF DNA binding is very similar to that observed for cells of most somatic tissues (e.g. Fig.1 A). In contrast, purified T-lymphocytes exhibit a profile of HSF activation that is shifted to significantly lower temperatures relative to B-lymphocytes (Fig. 3 B). High levels of HSF DNA binding activity are induced in these cells by treatment at 39 °C, with slightly higher levels induced at 40 °C and decreasing levels at 41 °C.To determine whether this lowered temperature threshold of HSF activation in T-lymphocytes could be specific to this strain of mice, we repeated this experiment using CD4+ T-lymphocytes isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice. The results (Fig.4 A) show a similar profile of HSF activation at temperatures in the range of 39–41 °C, indicating that reduced HSF activation temperature in splenic T-lymphocytes is likely a general property and not mouse strain-dependent. Another possibility is that this temperature profile may be a property unique to T-lymphocytes found in the spleen, not shared by T-lymphocytes found outside this tissue. This possibility was tested by examining HSF activation temperature of CD4+ T-lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Google Scholar). hsps also play essential roles as molecular chaperones in the folding, assembly, and transport of newly translated proteins (1Kregel K.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2177-2186Google Scholar, 2Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1743-1748Google Scholar, 3Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Weissman J.S. Adv.

Care Med. 2002; 30: S43-S50Google Scholar). Therefore, another possibility is that T-lymphocytes require higher levels of hsps to handle the large increase in protein synthesis that occurs in those T-cells that become activated and undergo rapid proliferation. Up-regulation of hsps could also be necessary to chaperone the receptors that function in signaling events between T-lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system (21Melnick J. Argon Y. Immunol.

Therefore, fever-induced hsp expression in T-lymphocytes may represent an important molecular mechanism by which fever acts to boost the immune response of an organism.These results also indicate that cell type-dependent regulation of the temperature set point for activation of the cellular response may be a more widespread phenomenon than was previously thought. Our previous studies showed that male germ cell types of mouse testis activate HSF1 DNA binding at a threshold temperature of 35 °C, a temperature 7 °C lower than the temperature at which HSF1 is activated in cell types such as liver cells (42 °C) (12Sarge K.D. Bray A.E. Goodson M.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 126Google Scholar, 13Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18745-18748Google Scholar). These studies also revealed that somatic cell types present in the testis do not share the lowered HSF activation temperature exhibited by the male germ cell types of this tissue, and instead display an HSF temperature set point (42 °C) that is identical to that of other somatic cell types such as liver. On the basis of these results, we had hypothesized that alteration in the temperature set point for the cellular stress response is a property unique to male germ cell types and that all somatic cell types would exhibit the “normal” set point of 42 °C. However, the results presented in this paper show unequivocally that this is not the case and that the temperature set point for inducible hsp expression can also be differentially regulated in somatic cell types. Indeed, another study found that HSF1 DNA binding activity is induced in cells of the nervous system of rabbit, particularly the cerebellum, at temperatures in the fever range (43Brown I.R. Rush S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 52-57Google Scholar). The goal of future studies is to elucidate the mechanism(s) that regulate cell type-dependent differences in HSF activation temperature, which will also increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of heat-induced HSF activation itself. Our results show that when an organism experiences fever-like temperatures, T-lymphocytes exhibit HSF1 activation while other cell types, including B-lymphocytes, do not. We do not know the specific function of activation of the cellular stress response in T-cells at fever temperatures. However, in light of the known cytoprotective functions of hsps, one possibility is that hsp expression at fever temperatures provides T-lymphocytes with an enhanced ability to withstand the adverse cellular environments that can exist during an immune response.

https://openalex.org/W2029015456,"Astroglial cells synthesize and release endozepines, neuropeptides that are related to the octadecaneuropeptide ODN. Glial cells also express PACAP/VIP receptors. We have investigated the possible effect of PACAP on the release of ODN-like immunoreactivity (ODN-LI) by cultured rat astrocytes. Administration of PACAP27 and PACAP38 induced a concentration-dependent increase in secretion of ODN-LI whereas VIP was approximately 1000-fold less potent. The maximum effect of PACAP38 occurred after 5 min, then gradually declined during the next 10 min. The stimulatory effects of PACAP and VIP were abrogated by the PACAP antagonist PACAP6-38. PACAP38 stimulated cAMP formation, activated polyphosphoinositide turnover, and provoked calcium mobilization from IP3-sensitive pools. The PKA inhibitor H89 suppressed PACAP-induced secretion of ODN-LI, whereas PLC inhibitor U73122 and the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine had no effect. In contrast, U73122 restored the stimulatory action of PACAP on ODN-LI release and cAMP formation during prolonged (15 min) incubation with the peptide, and this effect was prevented by PMA. The present results demonstrate that PACAP stimulates endozepine release through activation of PAC1 receptors coupled to the AC/PKA pathway. Our data also show that activation of the PLC/PKC pathway down-regulates the effect of PACAP on endozepine release."

The frog protein is fully active at 30 °C and inactive at 37 °C, leading to a temperature-sensitive behavior similar to that of the human mutant p53Ala143 and the murine mutant p53Val135. Using hybrid proteins between human and Xenopus expressed from artificial p53 minigenes, we have been able to demonstrate that change of conformation of the DNA-binding domain is the major determinant of this heat sensitivity. It has been reported that some human tumor-derived p53 mutants can engage in a physical association with p73, thus inhibiting its transactivating properties. The mechanism of this association remains to be elucidated. The nature of the mutant p53 that can engage in this association also remains controversial. Using the unique opportunity of the temperature sensitivity of Xenopus p53, we demonstrate that binding of and interference with p73 require a change of conformation in the p53 protein. This interaction occurs through the DNA-binding domain of p53 only when it is in a denatured state. These results reinforce the notion that mutant p53 with a conformational change can act as a down-regulator of the p73 pathway in human cancer and could confer a selective advantage to the tumor.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). Among the various biochemical activities linked to the p53 protein, its main function seems to be its ability to activate transcription from genes containing two contiguous monomers of the (Pu)3xC(A/T)(A/T)G(Py)3x sequence (2El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pientenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). DNA-binding sites for p53 are localized either in the promoter region or in introns of many target genes involved in either growth arrest or apoptosis (3Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 4Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The transcription domain of p53 is localized in the amino-terminal part of the protein (residues 1–42), whereas the DNA-binding domain is localized in the central region of the protein (residues 90–290) (5Soussi T. May P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 623-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The importance of this DNA-binding region is emphasized by the observation that more than 14,000 described point mutations of the p53 gene are clustered in this region (6Soussi T. Béroud C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Many of these mutations are correlated with loss of wild-type (wt)1 p53 function. One important feature of p53 is its flexibility (7Milner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 49-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The first line of evidence came from work with various monoclonal antibodies. Historically, it was reported that some p53 epitopes were either revealed or masked, depending on growth culture conditions (8Milner J. Nature. 1984; 310: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the central region of the p53 protein contains numerous cryptic epitopes that are revealed either after denaturation of the protein or in specific types of p53 mutants with altered folding such as p53His175 (9Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 10Ory K. Legros Y. Auguin C. Soussi T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3496-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11Legros Y. Meyer A. Ory K. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3689-3694PubMed Google Scholar). The second line of evidence comes from the discovery of temperature-sensitive p53 mutants that have a wild-type behavior at 30 °C but are inactive at 37 °C (12Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). After the initial discovery of the p53Val135 mutant in mice, several human p53 mutants were shown to have a similar behavior (13Hainaut P. Butcher S. Milner J. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This temperature sensitivity is often linked with a variation in protein conformation that changes the exposure of several epitopes. The third line of evidence concerns the function of the carboxyl-terminal domain that is involved in negative regulation of specific DNA binding of p53. It is generally admitted that this domain interacts with a specific domain of the central region of the protein and inhibits DNA binding (14Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Impairment of this interaction leads to stimulation of specific DNA binding. This flexibility of wild-type and mutant p53 is an important feature, as it has been demonstrated that some small molecules can be used to rescue mutant p53 and restore p53 function (15Hardy-Bessard A.C. Garay E. Lacronique V. Legros Y. Demarquay C. Houque A. Portefaix J.M. Granier C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The observation that monoclonal antibodies or small peptides directed against the amino or carboxyl terminus of mutant p53 can restore the activity of various p53 mutants suggests that there is important cross-talk between the various domains of the p53 protein. Unfortunately, the crystal structure of the whole p53 has not been elucidated, and there is no evidence concerning the possible function of the amino and carboxyl termini in the architecture of the p53 protein (17Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). Two additional p53 family members, p73 and p63, have recently been identified and characterized (18Yang A.N. Kaghad M. Wang Y.M. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar, 19Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). p73 and p63 both contain regions corresponding to p53 amino-terminal transactivation, central DNA binding, and carboxyl-terminal oligomerization domains (20Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Because of their structural similarities, p73 and p63 can bind to p53 consensus sequences, activate transcription of several p53 target genes, and induce apoptosis when overexpressed in cells. However, unlike the p53 gene, which is represented by a single polypeptide, the p73 and p63 genes are more complex and possess at least two major transcriptional promoters, which direct at least 6 products with different activities as transcription factors. All isotypes possess a fully functional DNA-binding domain and the carboxyl terminus oligomerization domain. The two alternate promoters generate isoforms lacking the amino-terminal transactivation domain. These isoforms, known as ΔNp73 and ΔNp63, are likely to act as dominant-negative regulators of their full-length counterparts. Several splicing variants generate different carboxyl termini, some of which contain a sterile alpha motif-like domain at the carboxyl terminus, known to be involved in protein-protein interactions (21Ikawa S. Nakagawara A. Ikawa Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Melino G. Wang J.Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although molecular analysis has failed to reveal any mutations in these two genes in human cancer, recent studies have described accumulation of p73 and p63 in various human tumors (21Ikawa S. Nakagawara A. Ikawa Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Melino G. Wang J.Y.

This association is believed to be mediated by a nonspecific interaction via the DNA-binding domain of both proteins. This association interferes with the transcriptional activity of p73 and p63 and their ability to induce apoptosis. Because p73 is phosphorylated in response to the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, binding of mutant p53 to p73 may affect sensitivity to this drug (29Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X.G. Gu J.J.

These data suggest that a dominant activity of specific mutant p53, associated with a defined genotype, could act via inactivation of the p73 and p63 pathways and could explain a gain in function of some p53 mutants. Although the association between wt p73 and mutant p53 has been repeatedly described, the identity of mutant p53 that could interact with p73 remains controversial. Several studies suggest that only mutant p53 that undergo a conformational change could bind to p73 (25Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar,28Strano S. Fontemaggi G. Costanzo A. Rizzo M.G. Monti O. Baccarini A. Del Sal G. Levrero M. Sacchi A. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 272: 18817-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the intragenic polymorphism at position 72 (Arg or Pro) could also modify mutant p53 behavior (27Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Brooks L.A. Irwin M.S. O'Nions J. Tidy J.A. James N. McGregor J.M. Harwood C.A. Yulug I.G. Vousden K.H. Allday M.J. Gusterson B. Ikawa S. Hinds P.W. Crook T. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the temperature sensitivity of wild-typeXenopus laevis p53 (Xp53) could be associated with a change in protein conformation (32Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Stürzbecher H.W. Ullrich S. Jenkins J. May P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wang Y. Farmer G. Soussi T. Prives C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar). At 37 °C, wild-type Xp53 is inactive and denatured, as this temperature is well above the permissive temperature for normal frogs (25 °C). This was demonstrated by the binding of hsp70 to the incorrectly folded Xp53 at 37 °C, whereas no binding could be detected at 32 °C (32Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Stürzbecher H.W. Ullrich S. Jenkins J. May P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of Xp53 is normal at 32 °C but is abolished at 37 °C (15Hardy-Bessard A.C. Garay E. Lacronique V. Legros Y. Demarquay C. Houque A. Portefaix J.M. Granier C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33Wang Y. Farmer G. Soussi T. Prives C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar). As this behavior is not linked to any mutation, such temperature sensitivity could be theoretically associated with any domain of the protein. The observation that cancer p53 mutations occur in the central domain of the protein suggests that this region could be an important determinant for such temperature sensitivity. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that other p53 domains could also be involved in this conformational change. To use this specific property of Xp53 as a tool to analyze the requirement of a change of conformation of human p53 for specific interactions, we first defined the region of Xp53 involved in this temperature sensitivity. We generated a series of hybrids between human and Xenopus p53. Our data indicate that the central DNA-binding domain is a key element in the change in p53 conformation in a similar way to that observed in human p53 mutant. By using either Xp53 or hybrid protein, we demonstrate that this conformational change of the DNA-binding domain is the only requirement for binding and interference with the activity of the wild-type form of p73α. These results reinforce the notion that mutant p53 with a conformational change can act as a down-regulator of the p73 pathway. Artificial p53 genes were constructed using a two-step strategy. In the first step, various virtual p53 genes were designed and analyzed for splicing using several online programs, such as Genscan and Geneview (34Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). Intronic sequences were derived from the natural human and Xenopus p53 genes. Once a gene with correct splicing was obtained, each cassette was synthesized using a combination of PCR and DNA synthesis. Each cassette was subcloned in pT7blue (Novagen) and sequenced on both strands for verification. Each wild-type artificial gene was then assembled in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA neo 3.1 (Invitrogen). The two wild-type genes pHC (human p53) and pXC (Xenopus p53) were controlled after transfection in Saos-2 cells, as described under “Results.” The entire sequence of these artificial genes is available on request. HDM2-luc, Bax-luc, PIG3-luc, and WAF-luc were generously provided by M. Oren, J. Reed, and B. Vogelstein. Recombinant baculovirus expressing human p73α was obtained by using the BaculoGold vector (BD Biosciences). The expression vector for human Ha-Tag p73 alpha was provided by D. Caput. Saos-2 and H1299 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glucose (4.5 g/l), l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate. The medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Both cell lines are devoid of endogenous p53 and do not express high levels of p73. H1299 cells were used for transient assays, whereas Saos-2 cells were used for long-term experiments. Sf9 insect cells were grown in TC100 medium (Life Science) at 28 °C. For the transactivation assay, H1299 and Saos-2 cells were plated in 24-well plates (respectively 5 × 104 and 105 cells per 1.5-cm well). After 24 h, cells were transfected using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE (Life Science). One μg of reporter gene and 0.05 μg of p53 plasmid were used. The luciferase activity was tested 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured using the MicroLumat LB96P (Berthold) with automated injection. Each transfection was repeated at least four times. For labeling and immunoprecipitation, 3 × 105 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and transfected the next day by the calcium phosphate procedure with 10 μg of plasmid. The precipitate was left on the cells for 15 h before washing twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and feeding with 5 ml of complete medium. Labeling was usually performed 48 h after transfection. Long-term transfection for cell growth arrest assay was performed as described by Ory et al. (10Ory K. Legros Y. Auguin C. Soussi T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3496-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 3.5 × 105Saos-2 cells were plated into 25-cm2 flasks and transfected on the following day by the calcium phosphate procedure using 1.7 μg of plasmid. Two days after transfection, the cells were divided into two flasks in medium containing 0.8 mg/ml geneticin (G418, Life Science). After 3–4 weeks, one flask was stained using Giemsa, whereas the other was assessed for p53 protein expression by immunocytochemistry using X77 or DO7 mAb, as described by Ory et al. (10Ory K. Legros Y. Auguin C. Soussi T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3496-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) DO7 recognizes both wild-type and mutant human p53, whereas X77 recognizes both human and Xenopusp53. The epitope is localized in the amino terminus of p53 for both antibodies. X77 also reacts strongly with human p73 and could not be used for the study of p53/p73 interaction (35Le Bras M. Delattre V. Bensaad K. Blandino G. Soussi T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1304-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). PAb240 is specific for human p53 with altered conformation. HR231 and X36 recognized both wild-type and mutant human or Xenopus p53, respectively. The epitope is localized in the carboxyl terminus of p53 for both antibodies. We have previously demonstrated that these two monoclonal antibodies are able to activate the specific DNA-binding activity of p53 (15Hardy-Bessard A.C. Garay E. Lacronique V. Legros Y. Demarquay C. Houque A. Portefaix J.M. Granier C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hsp70 mAb was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (clone W27: sc-24). The rabbit serum specific for Xp53 has already been described (32Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Stürzbecher H.W. Ullrich S. Jenkins J. May P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-Ha tag used for the detection of p73 was purchased from Babco. To establish stable cell lines, Saos-2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid by the calcium phosphate procedure in 100-mm Petri dishes. After 3 weeks of selection with G418 (0.8 mg/ml) at 37 °C, clones were pooled and used for subsequent studies. Immunocytochemistry analysis indicates that more than 50% of the cells express the protein of interest. For apoptosis analysis by FACS, only p53-expressing cells were tested. For p73 colony suppression assays, Saos-2 cells were plated and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method in the presence of BES (N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, sodium salt) (Sigma). The precipitates were left for 12 h, after which the medium was changed. 24 h after the transfection, cells were detached and replated in triplicate at 3 × 104/60-mm dish. Two days later, puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to each plate and maintained for 72 h. Two weeks later, colonies were fixed in methanol and stained with Giemsa solution followed by washing with water. H1299 cells (4 × 105 cells per 100-mm Petri dish) were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA corresponding to wt or chimeric p53s. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, adherent and floating cells were combined and washed in cold PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 1% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 10 min and washed in PBS. Cells were fixed for 7 min at −20 °C in 100% methanol, rehydrated in PBS for 10 min, and then stained for p53 with DO7 monoclonal antibody for p53His273, pHC and pHX3, X36 monoclonal antibody for pXC and pXH3, and a mouse purified IgG2b,κ (BD Biosciences) as isotype control in 0.1% PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice in 0.1% PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, Tween 20 and incubated with a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed twice in 0.1% PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, Tween 20 and treated with RNase A (500 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Samples were analyzed on a standard FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). p53 fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was measured by log amplification into the FL1 channel, and PI DNA fluorescence into the FL3 channel. Two files of 10,000 events were acquired for each sample; the first included all events based on a forward scatter threshold, whereas the second file included p53 fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive cells only, the gate being set on the corresponding isotype control. Apoptosis was calculated as the percentage of sub-G1 events of the total p53-negative or p53-positive population. DNA histograms of all p53-negative and p53-positive cells were analyzed using the MODFIT 2.0 cell cycle analysis program (Verity Software, Topersham, MA). Cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine (Expre35S35S, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Proteins were extracted with 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid) and protease inhibitors. After 30 min on ice, extracts were cleared for 30 min at 15,000 revolutions per minute at 4 °C. Cell lysates were precleared twice by adsorption with Protein G-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) and non-immune serum. In vivo-radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies for 2 h on ice. Antigen-antibody complexes were collected by using Protein G-Sepharose and washed three times in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the specific interaction with p73, whole-cell extracts were prepared using the Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40). Human p53 protein (Hp53) can be divided into five domains, each corresponding to specific functions (Fig. 1 A) (36Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). 1) The amino-terminal part 1–39 contains the acidic transactivation domain and the murine double minute protein-binding site. 2) Region 40–100 contains series repeated proline residues that are conserved in the majority of p53. 3) The central region (101–306) contains the DNA-binding domain. It is the target of 90% of p53 mutations found in human cancers. 4) The oligomerization domain (307–355) consists of a beta-strand, followed by an alpha-helix necessary for dimerization, as p53 is composed of a dimer of two dimers. A nuclear export signal is localized in this oligomerization domain. 5) The carboxyl terminus of p53 (356–393) contains 3 nuclear localization signals and a nonspecific DNA-binding domain that binds to damaged DNA. This region is also involved in down-regulation of DNA binding of the central domain. We constructed two artificial p53 minigenes to perform swapping experiments between human and Xenopus p53 (Fig.1 B). Five cassettes, each corresponding to a functional domain described above, were devised. For easy swapping, each cassette was designed as a unique exon flanked by an artificial intron. Unique restriction sites were introduced in each intron so that each p53 cassette could be easily moved from one construct to another. These two constructs allow many swapping experiments to generate various hybrid proteins. We first verified that the p53 expressed by these minigenes did not contain any alteration because of aberrant splicing. The two vectors, pHC and pXC, were transfected in Saos-2 cells. After 48 h, RNA was extracted and PCR amplification was performed using either human or Xenopus p53 primers. The cDNA was entirely sequenced on both strands. No alteration was detected, indicating that splicing occurred correctly in the 2 artificial genes (data not shown). During PCR amplification, only one product was observed in each case, indicating that no aberrant splices had occurred. The two proteins, Hp53 and Xp53, were well expressed by these two constructs and behaved as p53 expressed by their corresponding cDNA (data not shown, see also Fig. 2 D). The constructions used in the present study are summarized in Fig.1 B. Western blot and immunoprecipitation with mAb specific for various cassettes confirmed the identity of each protein (data not shown).Figure 2Conformational change of p53 construct with the DNA-binding domain of Xp53. Saos cells (5 × 105 in 60-mm Petri dish) were transfected with 10 μg of the various constructs. After transfection (48 h), cells were metabolically labeled for 3 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Extracts were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation:1, DO7; 2, X77; 3, PAb240.A and B, transfection performed at 32 °C and 37 °C, respectively. C, H1299 cells (4 × 105 in 60-mm Petri dish) were cotransfected with 5 μg of the indicated plasmid. Cells were incubated at either 30 or 37 °C and extracted 48 h after transfection. Unlabeled cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with p53 antibody, DO7 or X36 for human andXenopus p53, respectively. After immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a membrane that was probed with a specific hsp70 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The conformational change can be detected either by binding of monoclonal antibody PAb240 or by recognition by cellular chaperone hsp70. To address this point, proteins were labeled and immunoprecipitated after transient transfection in Saos-2 cells. Monoclonal antibody DO7 is specific for Hp53 (wild-type and mutant), PAb240 is specific for an epitope that is released in conformational mutant Hp53, and X77 recognizes both human and Xenopus p53. Immunoprecipitation of Xp53 expressed at 37 °C led to the detection of Xp53 (46 kDa) and coprecipitation of a 70-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B). This coprecipitation was not detected at 32 °C or when wild-type human p53 was expressed at either temperature (Fig. 2, A and B). Control experiments with the human mutant p53His175 indicated that it binds to hsp70 at both temperatures. This observation, previously described in 1989, led us to the hypothesis that the conformation of Xp53 is altered at 37 °C (32Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Stürzbecher H.W. Ullrich S. Jenkins J. May P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the 70-kDa protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation directed against p53 followed by Western blot with hsp70 antibody (Fig. 2 C). Using similar experimental conditions in H1299 cells, we showed that HX3 protein coprecipitates with hsp70 only at 37 °C, whereas XH3 did not show any interaction at either temperature (Fig. 2, B andC). Control immunoblot shows that a similar amount of each protein was used for each temperature (Fig. 2, D andE). These observations suggest that the central region of p53 is important for the conformational change of Xp53. The various constructs were cotransfected in the Saos-2 cell line with various reporter plasm"
https://openalex.org/W2010681190,"Nuclear receptors mediate gene activation through ligand-dependent interaction with coactivators. We previously cloned and characterized thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein, TRBP (NcoA6: AIB3/ASC-2/RAP250/PRIP/TRBP/NRC), as an LXXLL-containing coactivator that associates with coactivator complexes through its C terminus. To search for protein factors involved in TRBP action, we identified a distinct set of proteins from HeLa nuclear extract that interacts with the C terminus of TRBP. Analysis by mass spectrometric protein sequencing revealed a DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex including its catalytic subunit and regulatory subunits, Ku70 and Ku86. DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric nuclear phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that functions in DNA repair, recombination, and transcriptional regulation. DNA-PK phosphorylates TRBP at its C-terminal region, which directly interacts with Ku70 but not Ku86 in vitro. In addition, in the absence of DNA, TRBP itself activates DNA-PK, and the TRBP-stimulated DNA-PK activity has an altered phosphorylation pattern from DNA-stimulated activity. An anti-TRBP antibody inhibits TRBP-induced kinase activity, suggesting that protein content of TRBP is responsible for the stimulation of DNA-independent kinase activity. Furthermore, in DNA-PK-deficient scid cells, TRBP-mediated transactivation is significantly impaired, and nuclear localization of TRBP is altered. The activation of DNA-PK in the absence of DNA ends by the coactivator TRBP suggests a novel mechanism of coactivator-stimulated DNA-PK phosphorylation in transcriptional regulation.

Studies of coactivators in the past several years have significantly refined our model of ligand-induced interaction between the receptor ligand-binding domains and the coactivator LXXLL motifs. However, the role of receptor-bound coactivators in their interactions with the transcriptional complex is less clear, and it remains a current research focus. Coactivator actions appear to involve multiple cooperative mechanisms. The functional properties of coactivators include the following: direct protein-protein interactions with transcriptional complexes (1Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar); enzymatic activities of certain coactivators, such as histone acetyltransferase in CBP1 and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) family or arginine transmethylase in coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) (3McKenna N.J.

Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar); RNA interactions, with RNA recognition motifs such as in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-coactivator-1 (PGC-1), CoAA, and SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein (SHARP); and RNA alone such as steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA) (5Puigserver P.

Cell. 1999; 97: 17-27Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly important to understand how coactivator-targeted molecules, such as interacting proteins or enzyme substrates, are regulated by coactivators. We previously cloned and characterized thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein (TRBP) as a nuclear receptor coactivator (9Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar). TRBP, designated as NcoA6 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nomenclature committee, was concurrently identified by several groups as AIB3/ASC-2/RAP250/PRIP/TRBP/NRC (1Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar, 2McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar). TRBP is a high molecular weight, ubiquitously expressed coactivator. A single LXXLL motif is required for the ligand-dependent interaction with a number of nuclear receptors and subsequent transcriptional activation. The Ser-884 residue adjacent to the TRBP LXXLL motif was shown to regulate the selectivity of TRBP for different nuclear receptors (10Ko L. Cardona G.R. Iwasaki T. Bramlett K.S. Burris T.P. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 128-140Google Scholar). TRBP also coactivates multiple transcriptional factors including AP-1 and NF-κB (1Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar). In addition, gene amplification was observed for TRBP in human breast cancers (11Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C terminus of TRBP was shown to interact with coactivator CoAA (6Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar), CBP/p300, and DRIP complexes (9Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar). In a search for additional nuclear factors that might be targeted by TRBP, we identified a distinct set of TRBP-bound proteins using a mass spectrometric protein sequencing approach. Proteins identified include the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) components. DNA-PK is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the PI3K family (12Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem.

Previous biochemical and genetic studies revealed DNA-PK to be a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, and two regulatory subunits, Ku86 and Ku70. Although DNA-PK is known to be activated by DNA ends, recent compelling evidence suggests that its kinase activity can also be stimulated by protein interactions (17Schild-Poulter C. Pope L.

Supported by a large body of evidence, DNA-PK has been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation as well as in recombination and DNA repair (12Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 503-512Google Scholar, 13Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Google Scholar, 19Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A.

Acta. 2000; 1493: 41-47Google Scholar). DNA-PK is unique among nuclear protein kinases because it associates with DNA templates and phosphorylates a variety of protein factors that are important for transcriptional regulation. The identified in vitrosubstrates of DNA-PK include DNA-binding transcriptional factors such as c-Myc, c-Jun, Sp1, Oct-1, and nuclear receptors GR, progesterone receptor, tumor suppressor p53, HMG proteins, Ku subunits, as well as DNA-PKcs itself through autophosphorylation (12Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 503-512Google Scholar). The close relationship of DNA-PK with transcriptional regulation is also illustrated by its ability to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (22Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore R.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Google Scholar, 23Peterson S.R. Jesch S.A. Chamberlin T.N. Dvir A. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Dynan W.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Google Scholar), which might be important for coupled transcription and pre-mRNA processing (25Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). In addition, mouse cells with severe combined immune deficiency (scid) that lack functional DNA-PK showed the defects not only in DNA recombination and DNA repair (26Banga S.S. Hall K.T. Sandhu A.K. Weaver D.T. Athwal R.S. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 239-247Google Scholar) but also in Ku phosphorylation and transcriptional activation (21Sheppard H.M. Liu X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 41-47Google Scholar, 27Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Google Scholar). Thus, DNA-PK kinase activity might be essential for transcriptional control. We report here the identification of DNA-PK components as TRBP-interacting proteins. Through its C-terminal region, TRBP interacts with DNA-PK via a direct interaction with the regulatory subunit, Ku70. TRBP can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK in vitro. Our results also suggest that TRBP stimulates DNA-PK kinase activity in the absence of DNA ends. This DNA-independent activity may result in potentially altered substrate phosphorylation specificity. In addition, DNA-PK-deficient cells have altered TRBP nuclear localization and exhibit a defect in TRBP-mediated transcription activation. Our studies suggest a novel connection between coactivator-stimulated DNA-PK phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation. Human TRBP in pcDNA3 vector and its derived GST fusion fragments have been described previously (9Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-TRBPs were subcloned into SmaI/XhoI or EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences), as indicated in Fig. 1. Full-length human Ku70 and Ku80 were cloned by RT-PCR and inserted into theHindIII/XhoI sites of pcDNA3. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter luciferase reporter was generated by inserting MMTV promoter into PXP2 vector, and pCMV-GR was generated by inserting human GR into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 as described previously (6Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Ku 70 (Ab-4, clone N3H10), anti-Ku86 (Ab-2, clone 111), and anti-DNA-PKcs (Ab-4) antibodies were obtained from NeoMarkers. Polyclonal anti-TRBP antibodies were produced from two rabbits (TRBP-1652 and TRBP-1653) using the GST-TRBP-6 (aa 1641–2063) as antigen (Covance). The TRBP antibody was affinity-purified by Affi-Gel 10 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). The GST and GST fusion TRBPs were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts were isolated from a large quantity of HeLa or GH3 cells, approximately six 15-cm plates. Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT) with addition of 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor for 15 min on ice. The nuclei were then collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and extracted with buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 420 mmNaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) with the above protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatants containing nuclear extracts were further filtered with a 0.65 μm spin column (Millipore) to remove completely any insoluble cellular debris. This step is important to prevent nonspecific protein contamination in the subsequent binding assay. The binding assays were carried out with 5–10 μg of GST fusion proteins on beads plus 600–800 μg of freshly prepared nuclear extracts in 12 ml of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) with shaking at 4 °C overnight. Bound resins were washed three times with binding buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining (Bio-Rad). Protein bands of interest identified by preparative SDS-PAGE were carefully excised and washed with 50% acetonitrile according to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility protocol (28Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Google Scholar, 29Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Google Scholar). Sequence analysis performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility included the proteolytic digestion of peptides, analysis by microcapillary high pressure liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem ion trap mass spectrometry, and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry peptide sequence interpretation, which was facilitated with the Algorithm Sequest and programs developed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Multiple peptides determined by sequence analysis were matched to the known GenBankTMentries. In vitrobinding assays were performed by incubating GST resin (20 μl, 2 μg) and [35S]methionine-labeled, in vitrotranslated proteins (5 μl) produced by rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Proteins were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). Bound proteins were washed 3 times with binding buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. GST-TRBP resins (20 μl, 2–5 μg) were incubated with 200 μl of HeLa or GH3 nuclear extracts at 4 °C overnight in the binding buffer as above with additional protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting (ECL). Anti-DNA-PKcs and anti-Ku70 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from NeoMarkers. Phosphorylation of TRBP recombinant fragments in vitro by DNA-PK was assayed using the SigmaTECT DNA-dependent Protein Kinase Assay System from Promega with modifications. Briefly, DNA-PK enzyme purified from HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, with or without linear double strand (ds) DNA as activator, and with GST-TRBP fusion proteins as substrates. Labeled GST proteins were washed and resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Full-length GST-p53 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used as a positive control substrate for the DNA-dependent phosphorylation, and GST alone as an unphosphorylated protein was used as a negative control. When TRBP was measured for its stimulating activity, p53 peptide was used as a substrate. The amount of purified DNA-PK used (5–10 units) in each assay was titrated and determined with a biotinylated p53 peptide substrate prior to use. Alternatively, when endogenous DNA-PK from HeLa cell nuclear extracts was assayed, GST-TRBP-5 and -6 were preincubated with HeLa nuclear extracts, and washed beads containing TRBP bound DNA-PK were used in the assays. DNA-PK kinase activities were measured using the same SigmaTECT system in the presence or the absence of DNA, except a biotinylated p53 peptide was used as substrate. Phosphorylated p53 peptides were captured by the streptavidin-cellulose papers, and the papers were washed and counted in a scintillation counter. GST alone and GST-TRBP-3 were used as negative controls. TRBP antibodies were affinity-purified by Affi-Gel 10 chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Mouse cell lines SCSV3 (DNA-PK-deficient, scid) and SCH8-1 (scid plus human DNA-PK) were methanol-fixed and double-stained with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TRBP (1:50) and monoclonal anti-Ku70 (1:100, clone N3H10, NeoMarkers). Anti-rabbit Cy3- and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were applied at a dilution of 1:200. Images were obtained using a Nikon E800 fluorescent microscope. HeLa cells, mouse SCSV3 (DNA-PK −/−), and SCH8-1 (DNA-PK +/+) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/μl penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells in 24-well plates were transfected with MMTV-luc (0.1 μg), GR (0.01 μg), and TRBP (0.2 μg) plasmids per well using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with fresh medium containing the indicated concentrations of ligands and wortmannin 16–24 h after transfection. After another 24 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were assayed. Total amounts of DNA for each well were equalized by adding vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Data are shown as means of triplicate transfections ± S.E. Several lines of evidence support the identification of the C terminus of coactivator TRBP (aa 1641–2063) as a binding domain for the interactions with multiple nuclear proteins, including coactivator CBP/p300, DRIP complex component DRIP130 (9Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar), and coactivator activator CoAA (6Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar). In addition, the majority of the transcriptional activity of TRBP is mediated through its C terminus (9Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Google Scholar). To identify in vivo protein complexes in close contact with the TRBP C-terminal region, we carried out mass spectrometric analysis of nuclear proteins precipitated with immobilized recombinant TRBP fragments (Fig.1). HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with selected TRBP regions including its C terminus, and binding proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). Two overlapping recombinant TRBP-C fragments with different sizes (TRBP-5, aa 1237–2063, and TRBP-6, aa 1641–2063) were used, in order to detect the binding proteins in same size range of TRBP-C that might otherwise be obscured by size overlap. A number of proteins ranging from 70 to 400 kDa were observed. However, only the predominant bands were isolated for further microsequence analysis. The identified TRBP-associated proteins are p70, p80, p90, p100, p200, and p400. These proteins were carefully isolated from the preparative gel (Fig. 2 B), and their identities were determined by proteolytic peptide sequencing (Table I). Remarkably, among the six analyzed proteins, four of them belong to the DNA-PK complex, including DNA-PK catalytic subunit (p400), DNA-PK regulatory subunits, Ku 70 (p70) and Ku 86 (p80), and PARP (p100). The other two proteins were DNA topoisomerase I (p90) and NuMA (p200). The profiles of associated proteins for TRBP-5 and TRBP-6 were overlapping, particularly regarding DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku86. PARP was more closely associated with TRBP-6, although the reason is unclear. DNA-PK subunits were not found to be associated with other TRBP regions, suggesting that the binding of these proteins was specific to the C-terminal region of TRBP (Fig.2 A). The stoichiometry of Ku and TRBP-5 interaction is very high (Fig. 2 B), indicating Ku subunits might have higher affinities toward TRBP. In general, the number of the peptides sequenced to match to a GenBankTM accession number correlates with the reliability of the identity of a given protein (Table I). Data also revealed the presence of contaminating GST-TRBP, which was shown with a small number of peptides. It should be noted that proteins present in lower abundance may not be identified by this sequencing approach, yet may still bind to TRBP either directly or indirectly. Other approaches, such as the yeast-two hybrid screen, may be more suitable for the isolation of these proteins (6Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we conclude from our data that DNA-PK complexes interact with TRBP at its C terminus.Table IProteins interacting with the C terminus of TRBPSize (kDa)aProteins isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts were initially designated according to their apparent molecular sizes.Identified proteinsGenBank™ accession no.No. of peptidesbNumber of peptides sequenced that matched the respective proteins available in GenBank™.p400DNA-PK catalytic subunitsU47077.524TRBPD80033p200cMixture of NuMA and TCOF1.NuMACAA7766924TCOF12206473A11TRBPD800037GST1GTB3p100PARPA2972550TRBPD800039p90DNA topoisomerase IJ0325039TRBPD0008322GST1GTB12p80Ku86A3262660TRBPD0008317GST1GTB8p70Ku70P1295672TRBPD0008314a Proteins isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts were initially designated according to their apparent molecular sizes.b Number of peptides sequenced that matched the respective proteins available in GenBank™.c Mixture of NuMA and TCOF1. Open table in a new tab We decided to focus our current studies on DNA-PK and investigate its relationship with TRBP because the role of DNA-PK in transcriptional regulation is becoming increasingly appreciated (19Willis D.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15423-15433Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction of the DNA-PK complex with TRBP observed during peptide sequencing, we performed Western blot analysis using anti-DNA-PKcs and anti-Ku70 antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 A, recombinant GST fusion TRBPs were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract, and bound proteins were probed with indicated antibodies. These results suggest that DNA-PKcs and Ku70 interact with TRBP, but only at its C terminus. Similar results were obtained with anti-Ku86 antibody and with GH3nuclear extracts (not shown). Because regulatory subunits Ku70 and Ku86 often interact with proteins that regulate DNA-PK kinase activity (17Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. Giffin W. Kochan J.C. Ngsee J.K. Traykova-Andonova M. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16848-16856Google Scholar, 19Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar), an in vitroGST pull-down assay was carried out to compare the potential direct interactions of Ku subunits with TRBP. Interestingly, as shown in Fig.3 B, whereas interaction of TRBP with Ku 70 was very strong, interaction with Ku86 was absent. Negative controls including luciferase and GST alone did not yield signals. Notably, the strongest binding of TRBP was not to the full-length Ku70 but rather to fragments of Ku70. This may due to a regulated binding of full-length Ku70 with TRBP. These data confirm that TRBP interacts with DNA-PK, possibly through its Ku70 subunit. The data presented above indicated that TRBP might have a close relationship with DNA-PK. To understand this interaction further, we first examined the possibility that TRBP is a substrate of the kinase. Recombinant TRBP fragments were used as substrates in a DNA-PK kinase assay, as shown in Fig.4 A. Whereas the control GST alone was not phosphorylated, GST-TRBP C terminus was phosphorylated by DNA-PK. The GST-p53 was used as a positive control for DNA-dependent phosphorylation. Remarkably, the phosphorylation of TRBP-5 or TRBP-6, which overlaps at C terminus, was DNA-independent. The TRBP middle region (TRBP-3) can be phosphorylated but in a DNA-dependent manner. Other TRBP regions appeared not to be good substrates for DNA-PK (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that TRBP-C can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK in a DNA-independent manner. This differs from the phosphorylation of p53 or TRBP-3, which is largely DNA-dependent. A closer examination of the TRBP phosphorylation patterns revealed that the DNA-independent phosphorylation produced a slower migrating band than DNA-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 4, Aand B). Due to the smaller size of TRBP-6, which was more obvious for the upper band than TRBP-5, we compared phosphorylation patterns of TRBP-3 and TRBP-6 in assays shown in Fig. 4, Band C. The DNA-independent phosphorylation of TRBP-6 had two phosphorylation bands. Both phosphorylation bands can be inhibited by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor that blocks the kinase activity of DNA-PK, indicating the phosphorylation was DNA-PK-specific. The data suggest that the TRBP C terminus may, by itself, function as an activator to stimulate DNA-independent kinase activity. In addition, the TRBP-activated kinase may phosphorylate TRBP at different site(s) than the DNA-activated kinase to yield a band with slower mobility on the gel. This indicates that there is a potential differential substrate specificity of DNA-PK and, depending on the activator, is either TRBP or linear DNA ends. Compared with DNA ends, TRBP might be a unique stimulator of DNA-PK. We reached this conclusion by excluding mechanisms that might stimulate DNA-PK other than TRBP. TRBP itself did not exert any kinase activity, as a smaller amount of DNA-PK enzyme was not able to produce the signal (Fig. 4 C). Similar to ds DNA, supercoiled plasmid DNA did not produce a lower mobility band (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the phosphorylation site(s) might be different for the protein activator. We also washed GST-TRBP resin with high salt to prevent any protein contamination in the assay. In addition, we compared assays with pretreatment of TRBP resin with DNase or RNase to prevent potential bacterial nucleic acid contamination during the isolation of GST fusion protein. In any case, however, nonspecific DNA contamination would not produce a lower mobility band. Thus, these results are all consistent with our conclusion that TRBP protein is responsible, at least in part, for the DNA-independent activation of DNA-PK. To this end, we sought further evidence for TRBP-stimulated activity of DNA-PK. In TRBP-stimulated kinase assays, a biotinylated p53 peptide was used as a substrate, which can be separated from TRBP on streptavidin-cellulose paper before quantitation. As shown in Fig.5 A, the TRBP C terminus, including TRBP-5 and TRBP-6, was able to stimulate kinase activities in the absence of DNA, although the kinase was also stimulated in the presence of DNA. When anti-TRBP antibodies, but not when anti-Ku70 or anti-Ku86 antibodies, were included in the assay, DNA-independent activities were significantly blocked (Fig.5 B). However, the antibodies had much less or almost no effect on the DNA-dependent activities in the same assay. Furthermore, in assays comparing the preimmune serum derived from the same rabbit with two anti-TRBP antibodies (1652 and 1653), we consistently showed that anti-TRBPs, but not preimmune sera, blocked DNA-independent activities, and DNA-dependent activities were not affected (Fig. 5 C). Collectively, these results indicate that TRBP at its C-terminal region may contain a specific domain or motif, which is able to stimulate DNA-PK kinase activity by interacting with the DNA-PK complex in the absence of DNA as an activator. Unexpectedly, during the course of studies with the antibodies that might affect DNA-PK, we discovered that an anti-DNA-PKcs antibody alone was able to activate DNA-PK in the absence of any activators. Fig.6 showed that the combination of this antibody and TRBP protein can produce a robust DNA-independent activity that is compar"

To understand the basic mechanisms underlying this complex pathway, identification of genes that are differentially expressed during neural differentiation is an important approach. P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC)1 cells derived from a mouse embryo have been used extensively as a model system for in vitro neural differentiation (1McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 342-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Exposure of aggregated P19 cells with retinoic acid (RA) results in the differentiation of cells with many fundamental phenotypes of mammalian nervous system (3Gerard B. William J.R. Min Y. David I.G. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). During the early stages of neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, the mammalian homologues of several Drosophila gene products such as Motch, Mash-1, Wnt-1, and transduction-like enhancers of split are expressed (4Johnson J.E.

Moreover, a number of proteins including retinoic acid receptors, retinoid X receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor, and transcription factors such as Oct-3/4, Brn-2, and Bdm-1 have been identified (8Jonk L.J. de Jonge M.E.

Perhaps a limited number of RA- and aggregation-responsive genes trigger the neuronal differentiation pathway of P19 cells. Recently we found that a transcriptional corepressor, a component of COP9 signalosome, Trip15/CSN2, was highly expressed at the early stage of neural differentiation of RA-treated P19 cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat Trip15/CSN2 gene is completely identical with those of mouse and human homologues (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTMaccession no. AB081072; Ref. 11Akiyama H. Sugiyama A. Uzawa K. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Tashiro F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 140: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of sense rat Trip15/CSN2 RNA was sufficient to convert P19 cells into neurons, but not glial cells in the absence of RA, only after the aggregation treatment, accompanying the down-regulation of Oct-3/4 transcript, which maintains the undifferentiated state of P19 cells. Thus, the induction of Trip15/CSN2 prior to down-regulation of Oct-3/4 gene expression is required for the commitment of P19 cells to neuronal lineage. Trip15/CSN2 was originally identified as a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-interacting protein and acts as a transcriptional corepressor (12Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trip15/CSN2 interacts with a subset of nuclear hormone receptors such as DAX-1, ecdysone receptor, chicken ovalbumin promoter transcription factor 1 (COUP-TF1), its Drosophila homologue Seven-up, Fushi-tarazu-F1 (Ftz-F1), and TRs, but not with retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors (13Dressel U.

Trip15/CSN2 is conserved in a wide range of organisms and was also identified as a component of a 26 S proteasome lid-like complex termed COP9 signalosome (CSN; Refs.15Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K.

Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In animals, the CSN complex is localized in the nucleus and possesses a kinase activity that specifically phosphorylates transcriptional regulators such as p105, IκBα, c-Jun, and p53 (18Naumann M.

Although the mutual interaction between Trip15-nuclear receptor complex and CSN complex is still unknown, these facts indicate that the CSN complex participates in various signal transduction pathways. The proteasome-COP9 complex-initiation factor 3 domain in the C-terminal region of Trip15/CSN2 stabilizes protein-protein interaction within the CSN complex (21Kim T. Hofmann K. von Arnim A.G.

The N-terminal region of Trip15/CSN2 has been reported to be sufficient for the effector functions of Trip15/CSN2. In fact, Trip15/CSN2 associates with its binding partners, such as TR and DAX-1, through its N-terminal region (12Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol.

Considering the importance of Trip15/CSN2 in neuronal differentiation, we tried to find out novel molecules that bind to Trip15/CSN2 and possibly act as new downstream targets or regulators of Trip15/CSN2. We used the N-terminal region of rat Trip15/CSN2 as a bait for the yeast two-hybrid screening of RA-treated P19 cell cDNA library. Five of 17 positive cDNA clones have been turned out to be mouseNif3l1 (NGG1-interacting factor 3-like 1) gene.Nif3l1 cDNA was isolated through a suppression subtractive hybridization between the spermatogonia- and spermatocyto-derived cell lines and possesses a high homology to yeast Nif3 (Ngg1-interacting factor 3) gene (25Tascou S. Uedelhoven J. Dixkens C. Nayernia K. Engel W. Burfeind P. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 330-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse Nif3l1gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein consisted of 376 amino acids and is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals. Expression of Nif3l1 transcript is detected throughout mouse embryonic development (25Tascou S. Uedelhoven J. Dixkens C. Nayernia K. Engel W. Burfeind P. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 330-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the real biological function of Nif3l1 is still unknown. Yeast Nif3 was originally identified in yeast two-hybrid screening as a NGG1-interacting protein (26Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). NGG1 was isolated based on its requirement for the full inhibition of transcriptional activation by GAL4 protein in glucose media (27Brandl C.J. Furlanetto A.M. Martens J.A. Hamilton K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5255-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Independently, ADA3/NGG1 was isolated based on the ability of mutations to suppress the toxic effects of overexpression of the viral activator VP16 in yeast (28Pina B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, ADA3/NGG1 was involved in transcriptional activation and repression (26Martens J.A. Genereaux J. Saleh A. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15884-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Brandl C.J. Martens J.A. Margaliot A. Stenning D. Furlanetto A.M. Saleh A. Hamilton K.S. Genereaux J.

Alternation deficiency in activation (ADA) proteins have been found to be required for transcriptional activation by a number of yeast activators (28Pina B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N.

In yeast, ADA3/NGG1 is found as multisubunit complexes containing three to four additional ADA proteins and different TAFs and Spt (30Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, the majority of ADA3/NGG1 protein also seems to be complexed with Spt and TAF or TAF-like factors, making up several types of complexes (37Martinez E. Kundu T.K. Fu J. Roeder R.G.

Recently, genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated a crucial role of ADA complex in the transactivation function of mammalian nuclear hormone receptors (42Anafi M. Yang Y.F. Barlev N.A.

In this study, we show that the cytoplasmic Nif3l1 protein could be translocated into the nuclei by the association with Trip15/CSN2 and that it synergized the transcriptional repression activity of Trip15/CSN2. In addition, Nif3l1 implicates in neural differentiation of P19 cells, perhaps through the down-regulation of Oct-3/4 transcript, which suppresses neurogenic genes including Mash-1 to maintain the undifferentiated state of P19 cells. Considering these results and the expression of Nif3l1 in early developing brain, it seems likely that both Nif3l1 and Trip15/CSN2 play an important role in neural differentiation. Mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). Cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. To induce neural differentiation, 1 × 106 P19 cells aggregated in 10-cm bacteriological grade dishes were cultivated in 10 ml of α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS and 5 × 10−7m all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma) for 4 days. Cell aggregates were then suspended with mild pipetting and transferred to tissue culture dishes. The cells were cultivated in RA-free α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS for additional 3 days to induce β-tubulin type III-positive neurons and for 7 days to induce glial fibrially acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial cells. COS-7 cells were obtained from Japanese Cancer Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FCS. Male and female ICR mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan) and allowed to mate to produce offspring at the experimental animal facility (Tokyo University of Science). All mouse were kept under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 22–24 °C. Standard laboratory feed (MR standard, Nousan Ltd, Kanagawa, Japan) and tap water were given ad libitum. Mouse care and handling conformed to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat Trip15/CSN2 full-length cDNA (amino acids 1–443) and its fragment covering amino acids 1–275 were inserted into pAS2–1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in frame with the coding sequence for GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and used for yeast two-hybrid screening as bait vectors. A RA-treated P19 cell cDNA library was constructed using plasmid pACT-2 (Clontech). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from the P19 cells treated with 5 × 10−7m RA for 12 h, and cDNA was prepared by a cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene, Toyobo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). cDNA fragments digested with XhoI and EcoRI were inserted into pACT-2 in frame with the coding sequence for the GAL4 activation domain. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described for the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2 Protocol (Clontech). Briefly, competent Y153 yeast tester strain (His−, Leu−, Trp−) containing the His3 and LacZ genes linked to the GAL4 promoter were cotransformed with the bait and library plasmids, and colonies were selected on His−, Leu−, and Trp− plate with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. The colonies were confirmed to be truly positive for His and β-galactosidase (β-gal) production. Full-length mouse Nif3l1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using total P19 cell RNA and the primers corresponding to mouse Nif3l1 cDNA (24Freilich S. Oron E. Kapp Y. Nevo-Caspi Y. Orgad S. Segal D. Chamovitz D.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1187-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The primers used are as follows: 5′-primer, 5′-GAA AGA GCT TCT GCG ACT GG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CAC AGC CGT TTC AAT CCA GG-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the EcoRV site of pGEM-5zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid was designated as pGEM-5zf(+)-Nif3l1. To prepare GST-Trip15/CSN2 fusion proteins, Trip15/CSN2 cDNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) in frame with the coding sequence for GST. The plasmid was designated as a pGEX-Trip15/CSN2. pGEX-Trip15/CSN2 was introduced into Escherichia coli JM109, and the fusion protein synthesized was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described by Kaelin et al. (46Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Cell. 1992; 72: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed three times with the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and subsequently 5 μg of the purified fusion protein were incubated with 2% glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 500 μl for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. GST encoded in the vector was also prepared under the same conditions and immobilized as a control. The beads preloaded with GST-Trip15/CSN2 fusion proteins were washed three times with the binding buffer, and 35S-labeled Nif3l1 proteins synthesized by the RiboMaxTM Large Scale RNA production system (Promega) were then added. The beads were rocked continuously for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 500 μl of the binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 15 μl of the SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) and electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed, dried up, and exposed to the x-ray film. Flag-tagged Nif3l1 expression vector was constructed by the insertion of blunt-endedNcoI-SalI ORF fragment of pGEM-5zf(+)-Nif3l1 into the blunt-ended EcoRI-SalI site of pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). Full-length rat Trip15/CSN2 cDNA clone was transferred from pGEM-7zf(+) (Promega) to pACT2 after cleavage withEcoRI and XhoI. HA-tagged Trip15/CSN2 expression vector was constructed by the insertion of blunt-endedXhoI-BglII ORF fragment of pACT2-Trip15/CSN2 into the blunt-ended BamHI-EcoRV site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation studies, COS-7 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-Trip15/CSN2 and/or pFlag-CMV2-Nif3l1 by lipofection with DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of TNM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was incubated with 2% anti-Flag M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The affinity gels were washed three times with 1 ml of TNM buffer and suspended in 15 μl of the SDS sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The affinity gels were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a Clear Blot Membrane (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4-buffered saline, 0.02% Tween 20) containing 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution, Sigma), anti-Flag antibody (1:400 dilution, Sigma), or anti-rat Trip15/CSN2 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Ref. 11Akiyama H.

After washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution, Sigma). Signals were visualized with the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Total RNAs were extracted from P19 cells and various mouse tissues by the acidic guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (47Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 20 μg total RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (AmershamBiosciences), and hybridized with 32P-labeled 0.6-kbEcoRI-DraI fragment of pGEM-5zf(+)-Nif3l1, 2.1-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment of pGEM-rTrip15/CSN2 (11Akiyama H.

Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The PO gene, also called 36B4 (51Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), was used as an internal control gene, because its expression level has been shown to be invariant during RA-induced differentiation of P19 cells (6Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Developed x-ray films were scanned in a Macintosh Performa 6410, and the expression levels of RNAs were quantified using Image 1.62 ppc program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Tet-controlled Nif3l1 expression in P19 cells was performed using the Tet-OffTM gene expression system (Clontech). At the first step, P19 cells were transfected with a pTet-Off vector using DOTAP and cultivated in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) for selection. Resulting G418-resistant colonies were then screened by the transient transfection with a pTRE2-Luc vector (Clontech) to isolate the best P19 Tet-Off cells exhibiting a low background and high Tet-dependent induction of luciferase (Luc) by the withdrawal of Tet. The selected P19 Tet-Off cell line was designated as R13. pTRE2-sense and -antisense Nif3l1 expression vectors were constructed by the insertion of blunt-endedNcoI-SalI ORF fragment of pGEM5zf(+)-Nif3l1 into the blunt-ended HindIII-SalI andSalI-EcoRV sites of pTRE2 (Clontech), respectively. At the second step, R13 cells were transfected with pTRE2-sense Nif3l1 or pTRE2-antisense Nif3l1 together with pTK-Hyg (Clontech) and cultivated in the presence of 400 μg/ml hygromycin (Wako) and 2 μg/ml Tet (Sigma) for selection. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were then screened for the induction of sense and antisenseNif3l1 RNAs in the absence of Tet by Northern blot and RT-PCR. The cell lines that express sense and antisense Nif3l1RNA after Tet removal thus obtained were designated as R13NifS and R13NifA, respectively. P19 cells were cultivated in a Lab-Tek II Chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cell samples were incubated in Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(−)) containing 10% normal rabbit serum for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with antibodies against β-tubulin III (1:1000 dilution, Sigma) or GFAP (1:400 dilution, Sigma) in the same solution described above. After washing with PBS(−), the samples were incubated with a biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG+IgA+IgM (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) as a secondary antibody and followed by the incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei). Visualization of the signal was carried out using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. For Western blot analysis, cells were collected, lysed in the SDS sample buffer without bromphenol blue and 2-mercaptoethanol, and sonicated for 4 s. The resulting lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. After protein concentration was determined by BCA kit (Pierce), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration) was added. Aliquots of 20 μg of cell lysate were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a Clear Blot Membrane (Atto). The membrane were blocked in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-β-tubulin type III antibody (1:1000 dilution, Sigma) or anti-GFAP antibody (1:400 dilution, Sigma).

https://openalex.org/W2070250072,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc13p is a single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding protein that protects telomeres and maintains telomere length. A mutant allele of CDC13, cdc13–1, causes accumulation of single-stranded TG1–3 DNA near telomeres along with a G2/M cell cycle arrest at non-permissive temperatures. We report here that when the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA is masked by its binding proteins, such as S. cerevisiae Gbp2p or Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tcg1, the growth arrest phenotype of cdc13–1 is rescued. Mutations on Gbp2p that disrupt its binding to the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA render the protein unable to complement the defects ofcdc13–1. These results indicate that the presence of a single-stranded TG1–3 tail in cdc13–1 cells serves as the signal for the cell cycle checkpoint. Moreover, the binding activity of Gbp2p to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA appears to be associated with its ability to restore the telomere-lengthening phenotype in cdc13–1 cells. These results indicate that Gbp2p is involved in modulating telomere length. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc13p is a single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding protein that protects telomeres and maintains telomere length. A mutant allele of CDC13, cdc13–1, causes accumulation of single-stranded TG1–3 DNA near telomeres along with a G2/M cell cycle arrest at non-permissive temperatures. We report here that when the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA is masked by its binding proteins, such as S. cerevisiae Gbp2p or Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tcg1, the growth arrest phenotype of cdc13–1 is rescued. Mutations on Gbp2p that disrupt its binding to the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA render the protein unable to complement the defects ofcdc13–1. These results indicate that the presence of a single-stranded TG1–3 tail in cdc13–1 cells serves as the signal for the cell cycle checkpoint. Moreover, the binding activity of Gbp2p to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA appears to be associated with its ability to restore the telomere-lengthening phenotype in cdc13–1 cells. These results indicate that Gbp2p is involved in modulating telomere length. Telomeres are the structure at the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes (1Blackburn E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5919-5921Google Scholar, 2Zakian V.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 141-172Google Scholar). In most organisms, the telomeric DNA is composed of short, tandem repeated sequences with a strand rich in guanine residues (G-strand) running 5′ to 3′ toward the end of telomere. For example, the telomeric sequences in the brewers yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae are ∼250–300 base pair-long TG1–3/C1–3A repeats. Sequences of ciliate telomeres reveal that the G-strand extends beyond the duplex region, creating a short single-stranded 3′-overhang (3Henderson E.R. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 345-348Google Scholar, 4Klobutcher L.A. Swanton M.T. Donini P. Prescott D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3015-3019Google Scholar, 5Pluta A.F. Kaine B.P. Spear B.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 8145-8154Google Scholar). In yeast, longer G-strand DNA with varying lengths, presumably an intermediate during telomere replication, is detected during late S phase (6Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Google Scholar, 7Wellinger R.J. Ethier K. Labrecque P. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 423-433Google Scholar). Telomeres are essential for the maintenance of chromosome integrity. Telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation by nucleases, facilitate complete replication of chromosomes, and differentiate linear chromosome ends from broken ends (1Blackburn E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5919-5921Google Scholar, 2Zakian V.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 141-172Google Scholar). Several single-stranded telomeric DNA binding proteins, includingOxytricha α and β subunits (8Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 195-205Google Scholar, 9Price C.M. Cech T.R.

Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Google Scholar), have been identifiedin vitro. Among these proteins, Oxytricha α and β subunits have been well characterized because of the abundance of telomeres in this organism. The α subunit binds to the G4T4G4T4single-stranded end of the telomere, and the β subunit is required for making the terminus-specific binding (8Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 195-205Google Scholar, 18Fang G. Gray J.T. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 870-882Google Scholar, 19Fang G. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6056-6060Google Scholar).Oxytricha α- and β-like-binding proteins represent a novel type of DNA-binding protein because their binding is extremely salt-resistant. The binding of other single-stranded telomeric binding proteins to telomeric DNA is relatively salt-sensitive. A protein Pot1 that shares partial sequence homology with the Oxytricha α subunit has been identified from human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (17Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Google Scholar). Mutation in S. pombe POT1 causes loss of telomeric DNA and circulation of chromosomes. In S. cerevisiae, Cdc13p binds specifically to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA in vitro and affects telomere function in vivo (10Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Google Scholar, 11Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13760-13765Google Scholar, 20Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, even though Cdc13p does not share sequence similarity with the ciliate proteins or Pot1, the binding regions of Cdc13p and ciliate proteins that interact with single-stranded telomeric DNA are conserved (22Horvath M.P. Schweiker V.L. Bevilacqua J.M. Ruggles J.A. Schultz S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 963-974Google Scholar,23Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Google Scholar). A mutation allele of CDC13, cdc13–1, causes yeast cells to arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and accumulate single-stranded TG1–3 DNA at telomeres (20Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Google Scholar). Various types of DNA damages, including x-ray, UV, and chemical mutagens, induce DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest (24Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Google Scholar, 25Schiestl R.H. Reynolds P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1882-1896Google Scholar, 26Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1997; 145: 45-62Google Scholar). Presumably, these damages on DNA were processed by cellular nucleases to generate single-stranded DNA, which could then serve as the signal for DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest (20Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Google Scholar,29Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Google Scholar). Here, we show that S. cerevisiae Gbp2p and S. pombe Tcg1 rescue the growth arrest of cdc13–1 cells and that their single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding activity is required for their complementation. Our results suggest that the appearance of single-stranded telomeric DNA in cdc13–1cells is the signal that induces the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint. Moreover, we also provide evidence that Gbp2p is involved in modulating telomere length. Yeast strain W13a (MATa cdc13-1 his7 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 trp1-289) and the wild-type CDC13version of W13a, strain 4053-5-2a, were used as the hosts in complementation tests (provided by L. Hartwell, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). Strain YEM1α (MATa his3-11 trp1-1 leu2::pLexAop6-LEU2 ura3-1::URA3- pLexAop8-LacZ) was used in the two-hybrid method (30Qi H. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1777-1788Google Scholar). Plasmids pTHA, pTHA-CDC13 (expressesCDC13 under the control of PGK1 promoter; Ref.11Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13760-13765Google Scholar) and pGAL-GBP2 (expresses GBP2 under the control ofGAL1 promoter; Ref. 12Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4906-4913Google Scholar) were described previously. To express S. cerevisiae HRB1 in S. cerevisiae, HRB1 was first PCR amplified with primers HRB15 (5′-CCCATGGGTGATGATCATGGTTAT-3′) and HRB13 (5′-AGGCCTAGAGGCGTTTAGCGATCG-3′) using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The ∼1.1-kbp HRB1 PCR fragment was cloned directly into pGEM-T (Promega) to generate pGEM-HRB1. To construct GAL1 promoter-driven HRB1, theNcoI-StuI HRB1 DNA-containing fragment from pGEM-HRB1 was ligated into the NcoI- andSmaI-digested pSH380. 1S. Hahn, unpublished data. DNA fragments used in two-hybrid analysis were subcloned into pEG202 (Ampr HIS3 2μ) or pJG4–5 (Ampr TRP1 2μ) (31Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). To construct pJG-GBP2, the GBP2 fragment was first PCR amplified with primers GBP25 (5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGAGAGAGAGCTA-3′) and GBP23 (5′-GCCTCGAGGTTGGTGCTTAGGAATTA-3′). To clone S. pombe genes that complement the cdc13–1temperature-sensitive phenotype, an S. pombe cDNA library (32Becker D.M. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1968-1972Google Scholar) was transformed into W13a. Transformants were plated, incubated at 25 °C for 16 h, and then at 30 °C for 4 days. A total of 72 colonies grew at 30 °C from ∼120,000 transformants. DNAs from these 72 colonies were prepared and transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue. Plasmid DNAs were prepared and transformed back into W13a to retest their temperature sensitivity at 30 °C. Only one clone grew at 30 °C after the retransformation of purified plasmids. A 1.4-kbp HindIII-HindIII DNA insert within this complementing plasmid, pDB-TCG1, was subcloned intoHindIII-digested pVZ1 to generate pVZ-TCG1. The sequence of this DNA was determined by the exonuclease III deletion method and sequenced using Sequenase (Upstate Biotechnology). To construct pGST-TCG1, the TCG1 fragment was first PCR amplified with primers TCG5 (5′-CGAATTCATGATGTCCGCTGAGGAAAC-3′) and TCG3 (5′-CGTCGACTTAGGCAGTTATAGCACTAG-3′). A PCR-amplified ∼1.0-kbp DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated with the EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-1 to generate pGST-TCG1. PCR-based site-specific mutagenesis was applied to generate mutations on the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of GBP2. Mutations on residues Arg-161 and Arg-259 of Gbp2p were changed to Ala on plasmid pMAL-GBP2 to generate pMAL-GBP2R161A and pMAL-GBP2R259A, respectively. The mutation pMAL-GBP2R161A, R259A was generated by conducting a second mutagenesis on plasmid pMAL-GBP2R259A by changing Arg-161 to Ala. A similar approach was applied to generate mutations on pGAL-GBP2R161A, pGAL-GBP2R259A, and pGAL-GBP2R161A, R259A. All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To purify glutathioneS-transferase (GST) 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; RRM, RNA recognition motif -fused Tcg1, a 1000-ml culture of E. coli harboring pGST-TCG1 was grown at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.8 and induced with the addition of 1 mm IPTG. The cells were grown at 30 °C for another 3 h before being harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmDTT, 50 mm NaOAc, 20% glycerol, and 1× protease inhibitors (Calbiochem)) and sonicated to release the cell contents. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to get rid of soluble cell fractions. The pellet was then extracted with sonication buffer with 0.25% Tween 20 and 0.1 mm EGTA to obtain GST-Tcg1 fusion protein. Purified protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaOAc, 50% glycerol), aliquoted, and frozen by dry ice-ethanol bath. To purify maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused Gbp2p, 100 ml culture ofE. coli harboring pMBP-GBP2, was grown at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.5 and induced with the addition of 1 mm IPTG. The cells were grown at 30 °C for another 16 h before being harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sonication buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitors (Calbiochem)) and sonicated to release the cell contents. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain total cell-free extracts. 0.5 ml of amylose-agarose (New England Biolabs) was added to the total cell-free extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed and eluted with 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 100 mm maltose, and 20% glycerol. Purified protein was aliquoted and frozen by a dry ice-ethanol bath. Gbp2p with different point mutations were purified using similar procedures. Oligonucleotide TG43 (5′-GTGGTGGGTGGGTGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTG-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and subsequently purified from a 10% sequencing gel after electrophoresis. To perform the assays, Gbp2p, its mutants, orE. coli extracts harboring Tcg1 in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μg of heat-denatured poly(dI-dC)) was mixed with 5 nm of 32P-labeled TG43 DNA in a total volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then loaded directly onto an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel already pre-run at 125 V for 10 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 125 V for 105 min. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. Yeast cells CDC13/pSH380 or cdc13–1cells harboring plasmid pSH380, pGAL-GBP2, pGAL-GBP2R161A, pGAL-GBP2R259A, or pGAL-GBP2R161A, R259A were grown in YC-Leu in the presence of 2% glucose at 25 °C for 2 days. Cells were then washed with water, resuspended in YC-Leu medium with 3% galactose, and continued to grow at 30 °C for another 6 h. DNA from these cells was prepared, digested with XhoI, and separated on 1% agarose gels. Single-stranded telomere tails were determined by nondenaturing Southern hybridization as described previously (6Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Google Scholar). To determine the telomere length, DNA fragments were transferred to a Hybond N+ paper (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for hybridization using a random primed C1–3A/TG1–3 DNA probe (12Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4906-4913Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, a cdc13–1mutation causes yeast cells to arrest at the G2/M phase and accumulate single-stranded TG1–3 DNA at telomeres at non-permissive temperatures (20Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Google Scholar). Analogous to what is caused by various types of DNA damage, the accumulated single-stranded telomeric DNA may serve as the signal for cell cycle arrest incdc13–1 cells (20Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Google Scholar, 29Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Google Scholar). In this scenario, it is conceivable that single-stranded telomeric binding proteins in excess amount could mask the single-stranded DNA present incdc13–1 cells at the non-permissive temperature and prevent the G2/M arrest. To test this possibility, genes encoding single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding proteins were expressed in cdc13–1 cells to see if they rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 1). It has been reported that S. cerevisiae Gbp2p binds specifically to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA in vitro (12Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4906-4913Google Scholar, 13Konkel L.M.C. Enomoto S. Chamberlain E.M. McCune-Zierath P. Iyadurai S.J.P. Berman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5558-5562Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 a,cdc13–1 cells could not grow at 30 °C, whereas the same cells expressing GBP2 grew to colonies. Expression ofGBP2 cannot complement the cdc13–1 phenotype at 37 °C and was not sufficient to complement the cdc13Δmutation (data not shown). Another single-stranded TG1–3DNA-binding protein, the product of S. pombe TCG1(thirteen complementation gene, GenBankTM accession number AY007252), also complementscdc13–1. Similar to Gbp2p, TCG1 encodes a protein with two RRM motifs that binds single-stranded TG1–3 DNA (Fig. 1, b and c). Plasmid harboring TCG1 rescued the growth defect ofcdc13–1 at 30 °C but could not complementcdc13–1 at 33 °C (Fig. 1 d). It should be noted that the above complementation is specific to single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding proteins because other RRM-containing proteins that do not bind single-stranded telomeric DNA, including Ssb1p, Pub1p, or Hrb1p, did not complement the growth defect of cdc13–1at 30 °C (Fig. 1 a, and data not shown). Gbp2p contains two RRM motifs. The RRM motif, an ∼90-amino acid module, is used for RNA binding in many RNA-binding proteins (33Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Google Scholar). The signature of the RRM motif is the two consensus sequences, RNP1 and RNP2, located about 30 amino acids apart in the RRM domain (Fig. 2 a). These two conserved regions are involved in making contacts with RNA. In U1 small nuclear RNP, the Arg residue in RNP1 forms a salt bridge with the phosphate of U1 RNA, whereas residues in RNP2 form hydrogen bonds with the RNA (34Jessen T.-H. Oubridge C. Teo C.H. Pritchard C. Nagai K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3447-3456Google Scholar). We changed both Arg-161 and Arg-259, the conserved Arg residues within the two RRM motifs of Gbp2p, to Ala (Fig.2 a), and tested the effect on the single-stranded TG1–3 binding activity in a gel mobility shift assay using purified mutant proteins (Fig. 2, b and c). The results indicate that the R259A mutation greatly reduced the binding of Gbp2p to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA, whereas the R161A mutation only partially inactivated Gbp2p. Mutation on a non-conserved residue, Arg-127, did not affect the binding activity (data not shown). These results indicate that Arg-161 and Arg-259 are important for binding to a single-stranded TG1–3 DNA. Each Gbp2p binding mutant was tested for efficiency in complementing the growth defect of cdc13–1 cells. The experiments were conducted in the presence of glucose or galactose, becauseGBP2 expression was driven by the GAL1 promoter. As shown in Fig 3 a, whereas wild-type GBP2 complemented cdc13–1 even under the non-inducing condition (−Leu + Glc, 30 °C) andgbp2R161A complemented only under the inducing conduction (−Leu + Gal, 30 °C), neithergbp2R259A nor gbp2R161A, R259A was able to complement cdc13–1 at 30 °C. These results suggested that complementation depends on the single-stranded telomeric DNA binding activity. We investigated the effect of mutant or wild-type Gbp2p on thecdc13–1-associated telomere-lengthening phenotype (35Grandin N. Reed S.I. Charbonneau M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 512-527Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae, middle repetitive sequences known as Y′ elements are found in the subtelomeric regions of most chromosomes. As shown in Fig. 3 b, in CDC13/pSH380 cells aXhoI digest produces a ∼1.3 kbp fragment from the ends of Y′-bearing chromosomes that contains ∼950 bp of Y′ and the terminal tract of ∼350 bp of TG1–3/C1–3A DNA. However, the length of Y′-bearing telomeres in cdc13–1cells appeared to be longer and more heterogeneous. Expression of the wild-type GBP2 or gbp2R161A, but notgbp2R259A or gbp2R161A, R259A, suppressed telomere lengthening incdc13–1 cells. Expressing Gbp2p in wild-type cells or cells with gbp2Δ or gbp2Δ cdc13–1 mutations did not affect the telomere length (data not shown). The effect of expressing Gbp2p on the accumulation of single-stranded telomeric DNA in cdc13–1 cells at 30 °C was also evaluated. Thecdc13–1 cells, but not the wild-type cells, accumulate abnormally high levels of single-stranded telomeric DNA at 30 °C (Fig. 3 c). By taking the single-stranded TG1–3DNA level in cdc13–1 cells at 30 °C as 100%, the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA level in wild-typeCDC13 cells, cdc13–1 cells overexpressing wild-type GBP2, R161A, R259A, or R161A/R259A mutants is 26%, 45%, 50%, 102%, and 91%, respectively. Thus, expressing the wild-type Gbp2p or R161A mutant moderately decreased the levels of single-stranded telomeric DNA, whereas R259A or R161A/R259A mutants of Gbp2p did not have this effect. These results demonstrate that the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding activity of Gbp2p is required for suppressing the telomere lengthening ofcdc13–1 cells and affecting the accumulation of single-stranded telomeric tails. The presence of single-stranded DNA has been speculated as being the signal for the DNA-damage checkpoint (29Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Google Scholar) because it is present at the replication fork when replication is incomplete. Moreover, single-stranded DNA is a common intermediate in many repair pathways, including double-strand break repair, excision repair, and recombination repair (36Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Google Scholar, 37Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Google Scholar, 38Stahl F. Cell. 1996; 87: 965-968Google Scholar). Here we have shown that expressing two single-stranded TG1–3 binding proteins, S. cerevisiae Gbp2p and S. pombe Tcg1, complemented the defects of cdc13–1 cells. In addition, the single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding activity of Gbp2p is required for this complementation. Because the cell cycle defect in cdc13–1is dependent on the DNA-damage checkpoint, our results strongly suggest that the presence of single-stranded TG1–3 DNA incdc13–1 at a non-permissive temperature sends the signal for the DNA damage checkpoint. In wild-type cells, the binding of Cdc13p to the telomeric tail may convey a message to sensor proteins of the DNA-damage checkpoint, thus marking telomeres different from broken DNA ends. In cdc13–1 cells, masking the arrest signal with other single-stranded TG1–3 DNA binding activity is necessary at non-permissive temperatures to circumvent the chromosome-surveillance mechanism and prevent cell cycle arrest. A group of RRM-containing proteins that bind to single-stranded telomeric DNA has been identified in several organisms. For examples, human hnRNP A1, A2/B1, D, and E proteins and mouse hnRNP A2/B1 bind specifically to G-strand telomeric DNA (14McKay S.J. Cooke H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6461-6464Google Scholar, 15McKay S.J. Cooke H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1387-1391Google Scholar, 16Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Gbp2p and Nsr1p each have two RRMs and bind specifically to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA in vitro (12Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A.

For instance, mouse cells deficient in hnRNP A1 have telomeres shorter than those of cells expressing a normal level of hnRNP A1, suggesting a role for hnRNP A1 in telomere maintenance (39LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-Davis Y. Bani M.-R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 19: 199-202Google Scholar). Therefore, these RRMs containing telomeric DNA-binding proteins might function both in RNA metabolism and at telomeres. However, how these proteins affect telomeres remains unclear (16Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these proteins exert their influence through interaction with telomere-associated proteins. For example, the association between hnRNP A1 or D proteins and the telomerase might affect telomere maintenance (39LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-Davis Y. Bani M.-R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 19: 199-202Google Scholar, 40Eversole A. Maizels N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Google Scholar).
