https://openalex.org/W2005115557,"The solitary wave is a localized hydrodynamic phenomenon that can occur because of a balance between nonlinear cohesive and linear dispersive forces in a fluid. It has been shown theoretically, and observed experimentally, that some solitary waves have properties analogous to those of elementary particles, and the waves have therefore been named solitons. During a measurement program in the Andaman Sea near northern Sumatra, large-amplitude, long internal waves were observed with associated surface waves called tide rips. Using theoretical results from the physics of nonlinear waves, it is shown that the internal waves are solitons and their interactions with surface waves are described."

In the absence of added selenium, no volatile selenium compounds were detected. All samples were evaluated without the addition of nutrients and in the presence of air or nitrogen. The methylation process may be an important step in the detoxification process for microorganisms exposed to high concentrations of selenium."
https://openalex.org/W2074078282,"Van't Hoff's predictions of the mineral sequences to be expected on the evaporation of seawater are based on an oversimplified system. New computer calculation that include calcium-bearing phases are in better agreement with natural occurrences, removing discrepancies that have plagued evaporite geologists for nearly a century. A new hydrologic model that combines equilibrium batch evaporation with fractionation between successive batches is proposed to account for the mineral sequences observed in such classic deposits as the German Zechstein."
https://openalex.org/W2036516899,"In this article the economic development potentials of Cucurbita species (buffalo gourd and others), Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba), Euphorbia lathyris (gopher plant), and Parthenium argentatum (guayule) are discussed. All of these plants may become important sources of oils or rubber."
https://openalex.org/W1970862756,"In their report, Matti E. Rasanen et al. state that there is a tidal origin for the sedimentary sequences they studied in the western Amazon region (1). Their interpretation of these sequences in Acre, Brazil, as tidal, on the basis of a relatively small data set, implies
the existence of a marine connection between the Caribbean Sea and the southern Atlantic Ocean. Background information
and earlier work suggests that this conclusion
is not the best explanation of the sediments in Acre. The sedimentary history and paleogeography of this area are more complex than Rasanen et al. or S. David Webb, in his
Perspective (2), suggest."
https://openalex.org/W2000479718,It is proposed that human comfort could be provided in otherwise chilly surroundings by filling the occupied space with electromagnetic energy of centimeter wavelength. Very considerable reductions in the consumption of energy required for the heating of buildings should result from the lowering of interior temperatures thereby permitted.

https://openalex.org/W2076109580,"A full 12-hour synthesis at 6-centimeter wavelength with the Very Large Array confirms the major features previously reported for the double quasar 0957+561. In addition, the existence of radio jets apparently associated with both quasars is demonstrated. Gravitational lens models are now favored on the basis of recent optical observations, and the radio jets place severe constraints on such models. Further radio observations of the double quasar are needed to establish the expected relative time delay in variations between the images."
