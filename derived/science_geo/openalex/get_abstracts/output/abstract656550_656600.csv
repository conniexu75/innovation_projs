https://openalex.org/W3043954734,"The incidence of 2019 novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has created a medical emergency throughout the world. Various efforts have been made to develop the vaccine or effective treatments against the disease. The discovery of crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease has made the in silico identification of its inhibitors possible. Based on its critical role in viral replication, the viral protease can prove to be a promising “target” for antiviral drug therapy. We have systematically screened an in-house library of 15,754 natural and synthetic compounds, established at International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi. The in silico search for potential viral protease inhibitors resulted in nine top ranked ligands (compounds 1–9) against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) based on docking scores, and predictive binding energies. The in silico studies were updated via carrying out the docking, and predictive binding energy estimation, with a recently reported crystal structure of main protease (PDB ID: 6Y2F) at a better resolution i.e., 1.95 Å. Compound 2 (molecular bank code AAA396) was found to have highest negative binding energy of −71.63 kcal/mol for 6LU7. While compound 3 (molecular bank code AAD146) exhibited highest negative binding energy of -81.92 kcal/mol for 6Y2F. The stability of the compounds- in complex with viral protease was analyzed by Molecular Dynamics simulation studies, and was found to be stable over the course of 20 ns simulation time. Compound 2, and 3 were predicted to be the significant inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) among the nine short listed compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3041199125,"The emergence and fast global spread of COVID-19 has presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vaccine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83–3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44–99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72–69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76–80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics."

The dramatic lifestyle changes and stressors associated with this pandemic pose a threat to mental health and have the potential to exacerbate risk factors for suicide. We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess Google Trends data representing searches in the United States for 18 terms related to suicide and known suicide risk factors following the emergence of COVID-19. Although the relative proportion of Google searches for suicide-related queries was lower than predicted during the early pandemic period, searches for the following queries representative of financial difficulty were dramatically elevated: “I lost my job” (226%; 95%CI, 120%-333%), “laid off” (1164%; 95%CI, 395%-1932%), “unemployment” (1238%; 95%CI, 560%-1915%), and “furlough” (5717%; 95%CI, 2769%-8665%). Searches for the Disaster Distress Helpline, which was promoted as a source of help for those impacted by COVID-19, were also remarkably elevated (3021%; 95%CI, 873%-5169%). Google searches for other queries representative of help-seeking and general mental health concerns were moderately elevated. It appears that some indices of suicidality have fallen in the United States in this early stage of the pandemic, but that COVID-19 may have caused an increase in suicide risk factors that could yield long-term increases in suicidality and suicide rates."

We find that, among strategies which end with population immunity, strict age-targeted mitigation strategies have the potential to greatly reduce mortalities and ICU utilization for natural parameter choices."
https://openalex.org/W3045462301,"We present a simple but accurate algorithm to calculate the flow and shear rate profile of shear thinning fluids, as typically used in biofabrication applications, with an arbitrary viscosity-shear rate relationship in a cylindrical nozzle. By interpolating the viscosity with a set of power-law functions, we obtain a mathematically exact piecewise solution to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The algorithm is validated with known solutions for a simplified Carreau-Yasuda fluid, full numerical simulations for a realistic chitosan hydrogel as well as experimental velocity profiles of alginate and chitosan solutions in a microfluidic channel. We implement the algorithm in an easy-to-use Python tool, included as Supplementary Material, to calculate the velocity and shear rate profile during the printing process, depending on the shear thinning behavior of the bioink and printing parameters such as pressure and nozzle size. We confirm that the shear stress varies in an exactly linear fashion, starting from zero at the nozzle center to the maximum shear stress at the wall, independent of the shear thinning properties of the bioink. Finally, we demonstrate how our method can be inverted to obtain rheological bioink parameters in-situ directly before or even during printing from experimentally measured flow rate versus pressure data."
https://openalex.org/W3044136529,"Introduction Despite interventions by low and middle-income countries toward the achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on promoting mental health and well-being of their populace by the year 2030, suicidal behaviours continue to be major causes of premature mortality, especially among young people. This study examined the prevalence and predictors of suicidal behaviours among in-school adolescents in Mozambique. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study of 1918 in-school adolescents using data from the 2015 Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) of Mozambique. The outcome variables (suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicidal attempt) were measured with single items in the survey. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using chi-square test of independence and binary logistic regression respectively. Results are presented as Adjusted Odds Ratios for the binary logistic regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results The prevalence of suicidal behaviours 12 months prior to the survey were 17.7%, 19.6% and 18.5% for suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicidal attempt respectively. Adolescents who experienced anxiety had higher odds of suicidal ideation [AOR = 1.616, 95%CI = 1.148–2.275], suicidal plan [AOR = 1.507, 95%CI = 1.077–2.108], and suicidal attempt [AOR = 1.740, 95%CI = 1.228–2.467]. Adolescents who were physically attacked in school were also more likely to ideate [AOR = 1.463, 95%CI = 1.115–1.921], plan [AOR = 1.328, 95%CI = 1.020–1.728], and attempt [AOR = 1.701, 95%CI = 1.306–2.215] suicide. Having close friends was, however, an important protective factor against suicidal ideation [AOR = 0.694, 95%CI = 0.496–0.971], plan [AOR = 0.625, 95%CI = 0.455–0.860], and attempt [AOR = 0.529, 95%CI = 0.384–0.729]. Peer support also reduced the risk of suicidal ideation [AOR = 0.704, 95%CI = 0.538,0.920] and plan [AOR = 0.743, 95%CI = 0.572,0.966] among the in-school adolescents. Conclusion Suicidal behaviours constitute major public health challenges among in-school adolescents in Mozambique. The behaviours are predominant among adolescents who are physically attacked and those who experience anxiety. Conversely, having close friends serves as a protective factor against suicidal behaviours. To ensure that Mozambique meets the SDG target of promoting the mental health of all by the year 2030, the Government of Mozambique and educational authorities should urgently design and implement innovative interventions and strengthen existing ones that seek to address physical attacks and anxiety among in-school adolescents. School administrations should also incorporate programmes that seek to congregate students and offer platforms for social interaction and cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W3045051526,"The extraordinary population growth of the 20th century will subside in the 21st century, followed by depopulation, constituting the first population decline phase in human history in Japan and other developed countries. The drivers of land-use change during the population decline phase are expected to differ from those of the population growth phase; however, research on land-use drivers during the decline phase is limited. Identifying these drivers is necessary to develop effective management plans for biodiversity and ecosystem services in the decline phase. First, we calculated the probability of farmland abandonment in Hokkaido, a Japanese food production area, from 1973–2009 and divided the period into the population growth phase (1978–1997) and the decline phase (1997–2009). We examined various geographical and social factors that were assumed to alter the land use during these two phases. Geographical and social conditions are key factors in determining the probability of farmland abandonment, but their influences varied between the two phases. The farmlands located on geographically uncultivable sites, such as marginal, underproductive, narrow, and steep land, were abandoned during these phases; however, social conditions, such as the distance from densely inhabited districts (DIDs) and the population, exerted opposite effects during these two phases. Farmland abandonment occurred near DIDs (i.e., urban areas) during the population growth phase, whereas farmland abandonment occurred far from DIDs and sparsely populated farmlands during the decline phase. Farmland abandonment was strongly affected by government policy during the population growth phase, but the policy weakened during the decline phase, which triggered farmland abandonment throughout Hokkaido. The geographical and social drivers found in the present study may provide new insights for other developed countries experiencing depopulation problems."
https://openalex.org/W3044124663,"Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is a newly emerging virus in the swine industry, first reported recently in 2016. PCV3 assembles into a 2000 bp circular genome; slightly larger than PCV1 (1758–1760 bp), PCV2 (1766–1769 bp) and PCV4 (1770 bp). Apart from being associated with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), PCV3 has been isolated from pigs with clinical signs of reproductive failures, myocarditis, porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) and neurologic disease. Given that PCV3 is increasingly reported in countries including Thailand and U.S. with whom Malaysia shares trade and geographical relationship; and that PCV3 is associated with several clinical presentations that affect productivity, there is a need to study the presence and molecular characteristics of PCV3 in Malaysian swine farms. Twenty-four commercial swine farms, three abattoirs and retail shops in Peninsular Malaysia were sampled using convenience sampling method. A total of 281 samples from 141 pigs, including 49 lung archive samples were tested for PCV3 by conventional PCR. Twenty-eight lung samples from wild boar population in Peninsular Malaysia were also included. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed for maximum likelihood phylogeny relationship and pairwise distances. Results revealed that PCV3 is present in Peninsular Malaysia at a molecular prevalence of 17.02%, with inguinal lymph nodes and lungs showing the highest molecular detection rates of 81.82% and 71.43% respectively. Despite wide reports of PCV3 in healthy animals and wild boars, no positive samples were detected in clinically healthy finishers and wild boar population of this study. PCV3 strain A1 and A2 were present in Malaysia, and Malaysian PCV3 strains were found to be phylogenetically related to Spanish, U.S. and Mexico strains."
https://openalex.org/W3044953755,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an effective treatment for B cell malignancies, with emerging potential for the treatment of other hematologic cancers and solid tumors. The strength of the promoter within the CAR cassette will alter CAR-polypeptide levels on the cell surface of the T cell–impacting on the kinetics of activation, survival and memory cell formation in T cells. In addition to the CAR, promoters can be used to drive other genes of interest to enhance CAR T cell function. Expressing multiple genes from a single RNA transcript can be effectively achieved by linking the genes via a ribosomal skip site. However, promoters may differ in their ability to transcribe longer RNAs, or could interfere with lentiviral production, or transduction frequencies. In this study we compared the ability of the strong well-characterized promoters CMV, EF-1, hPGK and RPBSA to drive functional expression of a single RNA encoding three products: GFP, CAR, plus an additional cell-survival gene, Mcl-1. Although the four promoters produced similarly high lentiviral titres, EF-1 gave the best transduction efficacy of primary T cells. Major differences were found in the ability of the promoters to drive expression of long RNA encoding GFP, CAR and Mcl-1, highlighting promoter choice as an important consideration for gene therapy applications requiring the expression of long and complex mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W3044533275,"The natural product nobiletin is a small molecule, widely studied with regard to its therapeutic effects, including in cancer cell lines and tumors. Recently, nobiletin has also been shown to affect circadian rhythms via their enhancement, resulting in protection against metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that nobiletin's anti-oncogenic effects, such as prevention of cell migration and formation of anchorage independent colonies, are correspondingly accompanied by modulation of circadian rhythms. Concurrently, we wished to determine whether the circadian and anti-oncogenic effects of nobiletin differed across cancer cell lines. In this study, we assessed nobiletin's circadian and therapeutic characteristics to ascertain whether these effects depend on cell line, which here also varied in terms of baseline circadian rhythmicity. Three cell culture models where nobiletin's effects on cell proliferation and migration have been studied previously were evaluated: U2OS (bone osteosarcoma), which possesses robust circadian rhythms; MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), which has weak circadian rhythms; and MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma), which is arrhythmic. We found that circadian, migration, and proliferative effects following nobiletin treatment were subtle in the U2OS and MCF7 cells. On the other hand, changes were clear in MDA-MB-231s, where nobiletin rescued rhythmicity and substantially reduced oncogenic features, specifically two-dimensional cell motility and anchorage-independent growth. Based on these results and those previously described, we posit that the effects of nobiletin are indeed cell-type dependent, and that a positive correlation may exist between nobiletin's circadian and therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3045346211,"Background To date, the missed diagnosis rate of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was high, and there has been limited development of a rapid, simple, and effective way to screen the disease. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning approach to achieve rapid detection of possible abnormalities in chest radiographs suggesting PH for screening patients suspected of PH. Methods We retrospectively collected frontal chest radiographs and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) value measured by Doppler transthoracic echocardiography from 762 patients (357 healthy controls and 405 with PH) from three institutes in China from January 2013 to May 2019. The wohle sample comprised 762 images (641 for training, 80 for internal test, and 41 for external test). We firstly performed a 8-fold cross-validation on the 641 images selected for training (561 for pre-training, 80 for validation), then decided to tune learning rate to 0.0008 according to the best score on validation data. Finally, we used all the pre-training and validation data (561+80 = 641) to train our models (Resnet50, Xception, and Inception V3), evaluated them on internal and external test dataset to classify the images as having manifestations of PH or healthy according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC). After that, the three deep learning models were further used for prediction of PASP using regression algorithm. Moreover, we invited an experienced chest radiologist to classify the images in the test dataset as having PH or not, and compared the prediction accuracy performed by deep learing models with that of manual classification. Results The AUC performed by the best model (Inception V3) achieved 0.970 in the internal test, and slightly declined in the external test (0.967) when using deep learning algorithms to classify PH from normal based on chest X-rays. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the best model for prediction of PASP value was smaller in the internal test (7.45) compared to 9.95 in the external test. Manual classification of PH based on chest X-rays showed much lower AUCs compared to that performed by deep learning models both in the internal and external test. Conclusions The present study used deep learning algorithms to classify abnormalities suggesting PH in chest radiographs with high accuracy and good generalizability. Once tested prospectively in clinical settings, the technology could provide a non-invasive and easy-to-use method to screen patients suspected of having PH."
https://openalex.org/W3044003631,"Introduction In the past decade, new diagnostic methods and strategies have appeared, HIV testing efforts and the generalization of antiretroviral therapy may have influenced the number of opportunistic diagnoses and mortality of HIV-infected patients. To test this hypothesis we compiled data on the top opportunistic infections and causes of early death in the HIV cohort of French Guiana. Methods HIV-infected persons followed in Cayenne, Kourou, and Saint Laurent du Maroni hospitals from 2010 to 2019 were studied. Annual incidence of different opportunistic infections and annual deaths are compiled. For patients with opportunistic infections we calculated the proportion of early deaths. Results At the time of analysis, among 2 459 patients, (treated and untreated) 90% had a viral load <400 copies, 91% of the patients in the cohort were on antiretroviral treatment, and 94.2% of patients on treatment for over 6 months had undetectable viral loads. Only 9% of patients had CD4 counts under 200 per mm3. Histoplasmosis clearly remained the most frequent (128 cases) opportunistic infection among HIV-infected persons followed by cerebral toxoplasmosis (63 cases) and esophageal candidiasis (41 cases). Cryptococcal meningitis was ranked 5th most frequent opportunistic infection as was tuberculosis (31 cases). The trend for a sharp decline in early deaths continued (3.9% of patients). Conclusions Despite the successes of antiretrovirals, patients presenting with advanced HIV are still common and they are still at risk of dying. Improved diagnosis, and notably systematic screening with appropriate tools are still important areas of potential progress."
https://openalex.org/W3044827964,"Parasitic infections remain widespread in developing countries and constitute a major public health problem in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It is prevalent among children under 5 years and pregnant women; however, studies among the later high risk group is limited in the northern part of Ghana. Here, we evaluated the prevalence and associated factors of parasitic infections among pregnant women at first antenatal care visit in northern Ghana.This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bolgatanga Regional Hospital, Upper East Region-Ghana. A total of 334 consecutive consenting pregnant women were included. Questionnaires were administered to obtain socio-demographic data. Venous blood, stool and urine samples were collected for parasite identification using microscopy. Factors associated with parasitic infections were evaluated using regression models. Statistical analysis was performed using R.Parasitic infections identified were giardiasis (30.5%), P. falciparum malaria (21.6%) and schistosomiasis (0.6%). Polyparasitic infection was identified in 6.6% of the population. Increasing age [Age of 20-29 years: AOR = 0.16, 95% CI (0.06-0.38); Age of 30-39 years: AOR = 0.21, 95% CI (0.08-0.50); Age >39 years: AOR = 0.30, 95% CI (0.11-0.83)] was associated with lower odds whiles presence of domestic animals [AOR = 1.85, 95% CI (1.01-3.39)], being in the second trimester of pregnancy [AOR = 2.21, 95% CI (1.17-4.19)], having no formal education [AOR = 3.29, 95% CI (1.47-7.35)] and basic education as the highest educational level [AOR = 6.03, 95% CI (2.46-10.81)] were independent predictors of increased odds of giardiasis. Similarly, having no formal education [AOR = 2.88, 95% CI (1.21-8.79)] was independently associated with higher odds of P. falciparum malaria. The use of insecticide treated net (ITN) [AOR = 0.43, 95% CI (0.21-0.89)] and mosquito repellent [AOR = 0.09, 95% CI (0.04-0.21)] were independent predictors of lower odds of P. falciparum malaria.Giardiasis and P. falciparum malaria are common among pregnant women in northern Ghana. The major associated factors of giardiasis are lack of or low level of formal education, the presence of domestic animals and being in the second trimester of pregnancy. Increasing age confers protection against giardiasis. Likewise, lack of formal education is an associated factor for P. falciparum malaria among pregnant women in northern Ghana. The use of ITN and mosquito repellents reduce the risk of P. falciparum malaria. Given the possible role of parasitic infections in adverse pregnancy outcomes, our findings highlight the need for regular screening and treatment of infected women in the northern parts of Ghana. Public health education and improving socio-economic status could help reduce the risk of parasitic infections among pregnant women in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3044069777,"Regulatory agencies around the world have been using flexible requirements for approval of new drugs, especially for cancer drugs. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is mostly the first agency to approve new drugs worldwide, mainly due to the faster terms of the accelerated pathway and breakthrough therapy designation. Surrogate endpoints and preliminary data (e.g. single-arm and phase 2 studies) are used for these new approvals, however larger effect sizes are expected. We aim to compare FDA Accelerated vs Regular Pathway approvals and Breakthrough therapy designations (BTD) for lung cancer treatments between 2006 and 2018 regarding study design, sample size, outcome measures and effect size. We assessed the FDA database to collect data from studies that formed the basis of approvals of new drugs or indications for lung cancer spanning from 2006 to 2018. We found that accelerated pathway approvals are based on significantly more single-arm studies with small sample sizes and surrogate primary endpoints. However, effect size was not different between the pathways. A large proportion of studies used to support regular pathway approvals also showed these characteristics that are related to low quality and uncertain evidence. Compared to other approvals, BTD were more frequently based on single-arm studies. There was no significant difference in use of surrogate endpoints or sample size. 44% of BTD were based on studies demonstrating large effect sizes, proportionally more than approvals not receiving this designation. In conclusion, based on the indicators of evidence quality we extracted, criteria’s for granting accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation seen not clear. Faster approvals are in the majority full of uncertainties which should be viewed with caution and the patient have to be communicated to allow shared decision making. Post-marketing validation is essential."
https://openalex.org/W3044806657,"The purpose of this study was to describe the temporal evolution of quantitative lung lesion features on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with common and severe types of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Records of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were reviewed retrospectively from 24 January 2020 to 15 March 2020. Patients were classified into common and severe groups according to the diagnostic criteria of severe pneumonia. The quantitative CT features of lung lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, and the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), consolidation volume (PCV) and total lesion volume (PTV) were determined in both lungs. PGV, PCV and PTV were analyzed based on the time from the onset of initial symptoms in the common and severe groups. In the common group, PTV increased slowly and peaked at approximately 12 days from the onset of the initial symptoms. In the severe group, PTV peaked at approximately 17 days. The severe pneumonia group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV compared with the common group. These features started to appear in Stage 2 (4–7 days from onset of initial symptoms) and were observed in all subsequent stages (p<0.05). In severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, PGV, PCV and PTV began to significantly increase in Stage 2 and decrease in Stage 5 (22–30 days). Compared with common SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the patients in the severe group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV as well as a later peak time of lesion and recovery time."
https://openalex.org/W3044502928,"Xanthoceras sorbifolia, a medicinal and oil-rich woody plant, has great potential for biodiesel production. However, little study explores the link between gene expression level and metabolite accumulation of X. sorbifolia in response to cold stress. Herein, we performed both transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of X. sorbifolia seedlings to investigate the regulatory mechanism of resistance to low temperature (4 °C) based on physiological profile analyses. Cold stress resulted in a significant increase in the malondialdehyde content, electrolyte leakage and activity of antioxidant enzymes. A total of 1,527 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 895 were upregulated and 632 were downregulated. Annotation of DEGs revealed that amino acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and the citrate cycle (TCA) were strongly affected by cold stress. In addition, DEGs within the plant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and TF families of ERF, WRKY, NAC, MYB, and bHLH were transcriptionally activated. Through metabolomic analysis, we found 51 significantly changed metabolites, particularly with the analysis of primary metabolites, such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. Moreover, there is an overlap between transcript and metabolite profiles. Association analysis between key genes and altered metabolites indicated that amino acid metabolism and sugar metabolism were enhanced. A large number of specific cold-responsive genes and metabolites highlight a comprehensive regulatory mechanism, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the highly complex regulatory program under cold stress in X. sorbifolia."

National guidelines endorse provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) to increase testing coverage, but PITC is rarely provided in Sierra Leone. In response, a Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC) was implemented to improve PITC coverage amongst adult inpatients.Ten hospitals received the intervention between October 2017 and August 2018; there were no control facilites. Each hospital aimed to improve PITC coverage to ≥ 95% of eligible patients. Staff received training on PITC and QIC methods and a package of PITC best practices and tools. They then worked to identify additional contextually-appropriate interventions, conducted rapid tests of change, and tracked performance using shared indicators and time-series data. Supportive supervision bolstered QI skills, and quarterly meetings enabled diffusion of innovations while spurring friendly competition.Baseline PITC coverage was 4%. The hospital teams tested diverse interventions using QI methods, including staff training; data review meetings; enhanced workflow processes and supervision; and patient education and sensitization activities Nine hospitals reached and sustained the 95% target, and all saw rapid and durable improvement, which was sustained for a median of six months. Of the 5,238 patients tested for HIV, 311 (6%) were found to be HIV-positive and were referred for treatment. HIV rapid test kit stockouts occurred during the project period, limiting PITC services in some cases.The intervention led to swift and sustained improvement in inpatient PITC coverage and to the diagnosis of hundreds of people living with HIV. Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation plans to take the initiative to national scale, with close attention to the issue of test kit stockouts."
https://openalex.org/W3044819412,"Aims To assess the impact of a culturally modified, motivationally targeted, individually-tailored intervention on postpartum physical activity (PA) and PA self-efficacy among Hispanic women. Methods Estudio PARTO was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Western Massachusetts from 2013–17. Hispanic women who screened positive for gestational diabetes mellitus were randomized to a Lifestyle Intervention (LI, n = 100) or to a comparison Health and Wellness (HW, n = 104) group during late pregnancy. Exercise goals in LI were to meet American College of Obstetrician & Gynecologists guidelines for postpartum PA. The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) and the Self-Efficacy for Physical Activity Questionnaire were administered at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum. Results Compared to baseline levels, both groups had significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA at 6 months and one year postpartum (i.e., LI: mean change = 30.9 MET-hrs/wk, p = 0.05; HW: 27.6 MET-hrs/wk, p = 0.01), with only LI group experiencing significant increases in vigorous PA (mean change = 1.3 MET-hrs/wk, p = 0.03). Based on an intent-to-treat analysis using mixed effects models, we observed no differences in pattern of change in PA intensity and type over time between intervention groups (all p > 0.10). However, there was the suggestion of a greater decrease in sedentary activity in the LI group compared to the HW group (β = -3.56, p = 0.09). Conclusions In this randomized trial among high-risk Hispanic women, both groups benefitted from participation in a postpartum intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3045431318,"Background Previous research on public stigma towards people with mental disorders has mostly targeted adult samples and focused on depression, schizophrenia or mental disorders in general. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate predictors of stigmatizing attitudes towards different mental disorders (including less researched ones) in a representative sample of adolescents and young adults. Methods Data from the Swiss Youth Mental Health Literacy and Stigma Survey were used (analytical sample: n = 4,932). Each participant was randomly presented with one of five vignettes (depression; alcohol abuse; depression and alcohol abuse combined; schizophrenia; social anxiety). The structure of stigmatizing attitudes was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression models, implemented within a structural equation framework, were used to study predictors for the identified latent variables. Results A three-factor model for stigmatizing attitudes–consisting of ‘dangerous/unpredictable’, ‘weak-no-sick’, and ‘social distance’ factors–best fitted the data. Female gender was associated with less stigmatizing attitudes. Associations in opposite directions with different latent factors were found for educational and migration background. Exposure to mental disorders (being personally affected, personally having received professional help or knowing someone close who has received treatment for a mental disorder) was either not or was negatively associated with stigmatizing attitudes. In contrast, current mental health symptoms (heightened levels of psychological distress, problematic alcohol use) were generally not or were positively associated with stigmatizing attitudes. Even though the included predictors had some predictive value, the variance explained by the models was rather small (the adjusted R2 varied between 0.03 and 0.26). Conclusions The current study indicates that contact with someone who has received treatment for a mental disorder might be an important component of programs aiming to decrease stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders, since this exposure variable predicted lower levels of stigmatizing attitudes. Furthermore, the findings suggest that target-group interventions for specific subgroups need to be considered, as the process leading to stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental disorders appears to differ between specific sociodemographic subgroups."

We previously reported that inducible whole-body Memo1 KO (cKO) mice displayed a syndrome of premature aging and disturbed mineral metabolism partially recapitulating the phenotype observed in Klotho or Fgf23-deficient mouse models. Here, we aimed at delineating the contribution of systemic mineral load on the Memo1 cKO mouse phenotype. We attempted to rescue the Memo1 cKO phenotype by depleting phosphate or vitamin D from the diet, but did not observe any effect on survival. However, we noticed that, by contrast to Klotho or Fgf23-deficient mouse models, Memo1 cKO mice did not present any soft-tissue calcifications and displayed even a decreased serum calcification propensity. We identified higher serum magnesium levels as the main cause of protection against calcifications. Expression of genes encoding intestinal and renal magnesium channels and the regulator epidermal growth factor were increased in Memo1 cKO. In order to check whether magnesium reabsorption in the kidney alone was driving the higher magnesemia, we generated a kidney-specific Memo1 KO (kKO) mouse model. Memo1 kKO mice also displayed higher magnesemia and increased renal magnesium channel gene expression. Collectively, these data identify MEMO1 as a novel regulator of magnesium homeostasis and systemic calcification propensity, by regulating expression of the main magnesium channels."
https://openalex.org/W3043929364,"Recently, concerns have been raised over the potential impacts of commercial relationships on editorial practices in biomedical publishing. Specifically, it has been suggested that certain commercial relationships may make editors more open to publishing articles with author conflicts of interest (aCOI). Using a data set of 128,781 articles published in 159 journals, we evaluated the relationships among commercial publishing practices and reported author conflicts of interest. The 159 journals were grouped according to commercial biases (reprint services, advertising revenue, and ownership by a large commercial publishing firm). 30.6% (39,440) of articles were published in journals showing no evidence of evaluated commercial publishing relationships. 33.9% (43,630) were published in journals accepting advertising and reprint fees; 31.7% (40,887) in journals owned by large publishing firms; 1.2% (1,589) in journals accepting reprint fees only; and 2.5% (3,235) in journals accepting only advertising fees. Journals with commercial relationships were more likely to publish articles with aCOI (9.2% (92/1000) vs. 6.4% (64/1000), p = 0.024). In the multivariate analysis, only a journal's acceptance of reprint fees served as a significant predictor (OR = 2.81 at 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.6). Shared control estimation was used to evaluate the relationships between commercial publishing practices and aCOI frequency in total and by type. BCa-corrected mean difference effect sizes ranged from -1.0 to 6.1, and confirm findings indicating that accepting reprint fees may constitute the most significant commercial bias. The findings indicate that concerns over the influence of industry advertising in medical journals may be overstated, and that accepting fees for reprints may constitute the largest risk of bias for editorial decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3044009897,"Apple trees grafted on different rootstock types, including vigorous rootstock (VR), dwarfing interstock (DIR), and dwarfing self-rootstock (DSR), are widely planted in production, but the molecular determinants of tree branch architecture growth regulation induced by rootstocks are still not well known. In this study, the branch growth phenotypes of three combinations of 'Fuji' apple trees grafted on different rootstocks (VR: Malus baccata; DIR: Malus baccata/T337; DSR: T337) were investigated. The VR trees presented the biggest branch architecture. The results showed that the sugar content, sugar metabolism-related enzyme activities, and hormone content all presented obvious differences in the tender leaves and buds of apple trees grafted on these rootstocks. Transcriptomic profiles of the tender leaves adjacent to the top buds allowed us to identify genes that were potentially involved in signaling pathways that mediate the regulatory mechanisms underlying growth differences. In total, 3610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through pairwise comparisons. The screened data suggested that sugar metabolism-related genes and complex hormone regulatory networks involved the auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CK), abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) pathways, as well as several transcription factors, participated in the complicated growth induction process. Overall, this study provides a framework for analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying differential tree branch growth of apple trees grafted on different rootstocks."
https://openalex.org/W3044498615,"Introduction We evaluated the effectiveness of kaolin-impregnated hemostatic gauze use in preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) for patients with hemodynamic instability due to severe pelvic fractures. Materials and methods Between May 2014 and October 2018, 53 of 75 patients who underwent PPP due to hemodynamic instability induced by pelvic fracture were enrolled. Their medical records were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. QuikClot combat gauze (hydrophilic gauze impregnated with kaolin) and general surgical tape were used in 21 patients, while general surgical tape was used in the remaining 32 patients. Results As there were differences in the characteristics of patients between the hemostatic gauze (HG) group and control group, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to adjust for age, sex, and lactate levels. After PSM, the clinical characteristics between the two groups became similar. There were no differences in the rates of mortality and hemorrhage-induced mortality between the two groups. However, the packed red blood cell (RBC) requirement for an additional 12 hours in the HG group was significantly lower than that in the control group (4.1 ± 3.5 vs. 7.6 ± 6.1 units, p = 0.035). The lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays tended to be shorter in the HG group than in the control group (11.6 vs. 18.5 days, p = 0.1582; 30.8 vs. 47.4 days, p = 0.1861, respectively). Conclusions The use of HG during PPP did not reduce hemorrhage-induced mortality, but did reduce the need for additional packed RBC transfusions in patients with hemodynamic instability due to severe pelvic fractures."
https://openalex.org/W3044512285,"To reduce the danger for firefighters and ensure the safety of firefighters as much as possible, based on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) the fire sensor multi-sensor information fusion detection system is investigated.According to previous studies, the information sources and information processing methods for the design of this study are first explained. Then, the basic structure and flowchart of the research object in this study are designed. Based on the structure diagram and flowchart, the BPNN is selected to fuse the feature layers in this study, and the fuzzy control is selected to fuse the decision layers in this study. The multi-sensor information fusion detection system collects information for the sensors first, processes the collected information, and sends it to the processor of the robot. The processor analyzes and processes the received signal, and transmits the obtained information to the control terminal through the wireless communication system.Through the tests in this study, it is found that when the number of hidden layer nodes of the BPNN is 7, the optimal training result is obtained. On this basis, the test of BPNN in this study is performed. The test results show that after 127 iterations, the error of the BPNN reaches the lowest target value, indicating that the BPNN achieves an excellent level of accuracy. The trained BPNN has a running time of 0.0276 s and a mean square error of 0.0013. The smaller the mean square error value is, the higher the accuracy of the BPNN is, which shows that the BPNN meets the high precision requirements of this study.The research on the multi-sensor information fusion detection system of fire robots in this study can provide theoretical support for the research on forest fire detection in China. Since the proposed BPNN-based robot is applied to the inspection and processing of forest remaining fire, the results are applicable to the forests of various countries, with a wide range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W3044174568,"Objectives The main objectives of the study are to estimate HIV prevalence, active syphilis prevalence, and correlates of co-infection with HIV in Zambia, among recently sexually active individuals aged 15 to 59 years old. Methods We used data from the 2016 Zambia Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (ZAMPHIA), a national household survey that included biomarker testing for HIV and syphilis. Chembio DPP® Syphilis Screen and Confirm Assay was used to distinguish between active and older syphilis infections. This is the first time Chembio DPP® has been used in a national survey. Log-binominal modelling was utilized to understand the risk of acquiring HIV/active syphilis co-infection using select socio-demographic and sexual behavior variables. Multivariable analysis compared those with co-infection and those with no infection. All reported results account for the complex survey design and are weighted. Results A total of 19,114 individuals aged 15–59 years responded to the individual interview and had a valid syphilis and/or HIV test. The prevalence for those sexually active in the 12 months preceding ZAMPHIA 2016 was 3.5% and 13% for active syphilis and HIV, respectively. The prevalence of HIV/active syphilis co-infection was 1.5%. Factors associated with higher prevalence of co-infection versus no infection among females included, but were not limited to, those living in urban areas (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.8, 4.8), those had sexual intercourse before age 15 years (aPR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1, 2.9), and those who had two or more sexual partners in the 12 months preceding the survey (aPR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.6, 4.7). Conclusion These findings show high prevalence for both mono-infection with HIV and syphilis, as well as co-infection with HIV/active syphilis in Zambia. There is a need for better screening and partner services, particularly among those engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors (e.g., engaging in transactional sex)."
https://openalex.org/W3044905336,"By conventional measures, it is often remarked that Central and South America is one of the fastest aging geographic regions in the world. In recent years, however, scholars have sought to problematize the orthodox measures and concepts employed in the aging literature. By not taking dynamic changes in life expectancy into account, measures which hold chronological age constant (e.g. defining a boundary to old age at 60 or 65) represent a very narrow view of population aging. Furthermore, such constant measures may misrepresent differences between territories when performing a comparative analysis. Prospective measures based on the number of years until death present an alternative approach which can adapt to dynamic changes in life expectancy and differences over time and space. The objective of this paper, then, is to apply the new ‘prospective’ measures of aging to the territories of Central and South America. We calculate prospective median age; an alternative old-age threshold based on the age at which remaining life expectancy is 15 years, and calculate prospective old-age dependency ratio for 1950–2100 using estimated and projected life tables from the latest iteration of the UN’s World Population Prospects. These new measures present a very different view of aging in Central and South America. While there are significant differences across countries, the pace and scale of aging are considerably slower and diminished when compared to standard, orthodox measures based on fixed chronological ages. Applying these new measures can not only serve to present a more realistic view of aging which maps onto demographic reality but can also serve to reconceptualize and reframe the issue as something which is far more manageable (e.g. through institutional reform) than is often perceived to be."
https://openalex.org/W3044268973,"When people judge the weight of two objects of equal mass but different size, they perceive the smaller one as being heavier. Up to date, there is no consensus about the mechanisms which give rise to this size-weight illusion. We recently suggested a model that describes heaviness perception as a weighted average of two sensory heaviness estimates with correlated noise: one estimate derived from mass, the other one derived from density. The density estimate is first derived from mass and size, but at the final perceptual level, perceived heaviness is biased by an object's density, not by its size. Here, we tested the models' prediction that weight discrimination of equal-size objects is better in lifting conditions which are prone to the size-weight illusion as compared to conditions lacking (the essentially uninformative) size information. This is predicted because in these objects density covaries with mass, and according to the model density serves as an additional sensory cue. Participants performed a two-interval forced-choice weight discrimination task. We manipulated the quality of either haptic (Experiment 1) or visual (Experiment 2) size information and measured just-noticeable differences (JNDs). Both for the haptic and the visual illusion, JNDs were lower in lifting conditions in which size information was available. Thus, when heaviness perception can be influenced by an object's density, it is more reliable. This discrimination benefit under conditions that provide the additional information that objects are of equal size is further support for the role of density and the integration of sensory estimates in the size-weight illusion."
https://openalex.org/W3044829334,"We present the results of a study investigating whether there is an effect of Anodal-Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (A-tDCS) on working memory (WM) performance. The relative effectiveness of A-tDCS on WM is investigated using a 2-back test protocol using two commonly used memory visual stimuli (shapes and letters). In a double-blinded, randomised, crossover, sham-controlled experiment, real A-tDCS and sham A-tDCS were applied separately to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) of twenty healthy subjects. There was a minimal interval of one week between sham and real A-tDCS sessions. For the letters based stimulus experiment, 2-back test recall accuracy was measured for a set of English letters (A-L) which were presented individually in a randomised order where each was separated by a blank interval. A similar 2-back protocol was used for the shapes based stimuli experiment where instead of letters, a set of 12 geometric shapes were used. The working memory accuracy scores measured appeared to be significantly affected by memory stimulus type used and by the application of A-tDCS (repeated measures ANOVA p<0.05). A large effect size (d = 0.98) and statistical significance between sham and real A-tDCS WM scores (p = 0.01) was found when shapes were used as a visual testing stimulus, while low (d = 0.38) effect size and insignificant difference (p = 0.15) was found when letters were used. This results are important as they show that recollection different stimuli used in working memory can be affected differently by A-tDCS application. This highlights the importance of considering using multiple methods of WM testing when assessing the effectiveness of A-tDCS."
https://openalex.org/W3045026569,"Surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy with temozolomide remain the mainstay for treatment of glioblastoma. However, many patients are not candidates for surgical resection given inaccessible tumor location or poor health status. Furthermore, despite being first line treatment, temozolomide has only limited efficacy.The development of injectable hydrogel-based carrier systems allows for the delivery of a wide range of chemotherapeutics that can achieve high local concentrations, thus potentially avoiding systemic side effects and wide-spread neurotoxicity. To test this modality in a realistic environment, we developed a diblock copolypeptide hydrogel (DCH) capable of carrying and releasing paclitaxel, a compound that we found to be highly potent against primary gliomasphere cells.The DCH produced minimal tissue reactivity and was well tolerated in the immune-competent mouse brain. Paclitaxel-loaded hydrogel induced less tissue damage, cellular inflammation and reactive astrocytes than cremaphor-taxol (typical taxol-carrier) or hydrogel alone. In a deep subcortical xenograft model of glioblastoma in immunodeficient mice, injection of paclitaxel-loaded hydrogel led to local tumor control and improved survival. However, the tumor cells were highly migratory and were able to eventually escape the area of treatment.These findings suggest this technology may be ultimately applicable to patients with deep-seated inoperable tumors, but as currently formulated, complete tumor eradication would be highly unlikely. Future studies should focus on targeting the migratory potential of surviving cells."

The maintenance energy requirements (MER) were estimated for adult dogs of different sizes (3 kg, 15 kg, 30 kg, and 50 kg) and the daily amounts of food intake were estimated for each type of food. The costs were calculated per day, per 1000 kcal of metabolizable energy of product and per kg of metabolic weight of the animal. Fourteen complete and balanced homemade diets were formulated, and in each proposed group, two diets with different protein sources were used. Under the conditions of the present study, it was possible to conclude that homemade diets were more expensive than dry maintenance diets and dry therapeutic diets, while commercial wet diets were more expensive in all of the scenarios."

We sought to assess oncologists' practices, concerns, and perceptions regarding Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and the NPOP.Using a purposive total sampling approach, oncologists who had previously ordered NGS for at least one tumor sample through the NPOP were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Questions assessed the following: expectations for the NPOP, procedural requirements, applicability of testing results, and the summative utility of the NPOP. Interviews were assessed using an open coding approach. Thematic analysis was conducted to evaluate the completed codebook. Themes were defined deductively by reviewing the direct responses to interview questions as well as inductively by identifying emerging patterns of data.Of the 105 medical oncologists who were invited to participate, 20 (19%) were interviewed from 19 different VA medical centers in 14 states. Five recurrent themes were observed: (1) Educational Efforts Regarding Tumor DNA Sequencing Should be Undertaken, (2) Pathology Departments Share a Critical Role in Facilitating Test Completion, (3) Tumor DNA Sequencing via NGS Serves as the Most Comprehensive Testing Modality within Precision Oncology, (4) The Availability of the NPOP Has Expanded Options for Select Patients, and (5) The Completion of Tumor DNA Sequencing through the NPOP Could Help Improve Research Efforts within VHA Oncology Practices.Medical oncologists believe that the availability of tumor DNA sequencing through the NPOP could potentially lead to an improvement in outcomes for veterans with metastatic solid tumors. Efforts should be directed toward improving oncologists' understanding of sequencing, strengthening collaborative relationships between oncologists and pathologists, and assessing the role of comprehensive NGS panels within the battery of precision tests."

The axial/radial residual deformation and energy dissipation characteristics of sandstone at different cyclic stress stages were analyzed in detail. By combining the mathematical statistics, fluctuation coefficients of the residual strain and energy dissipation, and correlation coefficients of axial/radial residual strain and energy dissipation were defined to describe the process. It was determined that these newly defined physical variables were closely related to the elastic-plastic state (or instability failure state) of the rock."
https://openalex.org/W3044356348,"Enzymatic assays based on bacterial 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are the method of choice for quantification of total bile acids (BAs) in serum. Although non-specific, it is generally considered precise and robust. The aim of this study was to investigate how changes in the BA spectrum might affect the reliability of the method. We measured standard solutions of twenty-three human and murine BAs using a commercial enzymatic assay and compared the measured vs. expected concentrations. Additionally, total BA concentrations in rat and human cholestatic samples with an abnormal BA spectrum were measured using an enzymatic assay, and a more specific LC-MS/MS method. We observed a great variability in the response of individual BAs in the enzymatic assay. Relative signal intensities ranged from 100% in glycocholic acid (reference) to only 20% in α-muricholic acid. The enzymatic assay markedly underestimated the BA concentrations in both human and rat cholestatic sera when compared to the LC-MS/MS assay. Our study indicated that the performance of an enzymatic assay largely depends on the BA spectrum, and the total concentration of BAs can be markedly underestimated. Samples with an atypical BA spectrum (viz. in rodents) should preferably be measured by other methods."
https://openalex.org/W3044474951,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is influenced by host genetics, sex, and the gut microbiota. Using a genetically susceptible mouse model of CRC induced via inoculation with pathobiont Helicobacter spp. and demonstrating variable tumor incidence, we tested the ability of the Th17-enhancing commensal Candidatus Savagella, more commonly denoted as Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB), to influence the incidence and severity of colitis-associated CRC in male and female mice. To document the composition of the gut microbiota during CRC development and identify taxa associated with disease, fecal samples were collected before and throughout disease development and characterized via 16S rRNA sequencing. While there were no significant SFB-dependent effects on disease incidence or severity, SFB was found to exert a sex-dependent protective effect in male mice. Furthermore, SFB stabilized the GM against Helicobacter-induced changes post-inoculation, resulting in a shift in disease association from Helicobacter spp. to Escherichia coli. These data support sex-dependent SFB-mediated effects on CRC risk, and highlight the complex community dynamics within the GM during exposure to inflammatory pathobionts."
https://openalex.org/W3044475451,"We have previously demonstrated that endothelial targeting of gold nanoparticles followed by external beam irradiation can cause specific tumor vascular disruption in mouse models of cancer. The induced vascular damage may lead to changes in tumor physiology, including tumor hypoxia, thereby compromising future therapeutic interventions. In this study, we investigate the dynamic changes in tumor hypoxia mediated by targeted gold nanoparticles and clinical radiation therapy (RT). By using noninvasive whole-body fluorescence imaging, tumor hypoxia was measured at baseline, on day 2 and day 13, post-tumor vascular disruption. A 2.5-fold increase (P<0.05) in tumor hypoxia was measured two days after combined therapy, resolving by day 13. In addition, the combination of vascular-targeted gold nanoparticles and radiation therapy resulted in a significant (P<0.05) suppression of tumor growth. This is the first study to demonstrate the tumor hypoxic physiological response and recovery after delivery of vascular-targeted gold nanoparticles followed by clinical radiation therapy in a human non-small cell lung cancer athymic Foxn1nu mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W3044642358,"A comprehensive analysis of crystallographic data of 565 high-resolution protein homodimers comprised of over 250,000 residues suggests that amino acids form two groups that differ in their tendency to distort or symmetrize the structure of protein homodimers. Residues of the first group tend to distort the protein homodimer and generally have long or polar side chains. These include: Lys, Gln, Glu, Arg, Asn, Met, Ser, Thr and Asp. Residues of the second group contribute to protein symmetry and are generally characterized by short or aromatic side chains. These include: Ile, Pro, His, Val, Cys, Leu, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Ala and Gly. The distributions of the continuous symmetry measures of the proteins and the continuous chirality measures of their building blocks highlight the role of side chain geometry and the interplay between entropy and symmetry in dictating the conformational flexibility of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3045205575,"Surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy remains a commonly performed procedure in the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the unique patient population in the Middle East we decided to perform a review of the procedures performed in our hospital over a two-year period.Single centre, retrospective observational study. All tracheostomies performed between January 2016 and January 2018 were included in the study. The primary outcome was the rate of tracheostomy complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent factors associated with complications and decannulations.One hundred sixty-four patients were included in the study. Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed in 99 patients (60.4%). Complications occurred in thirty-eight patients (23%). Higher Left ventricular ejection fraction (OR = 0.94, 95%CI: [0.898-0.985]) and percutaneous tracheostomy (OR = 0.107, 95%CI: [0.029-0.401]) were associated with lower complications. Good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (OR = 4.1, 95%CI: [1.3-13.3]) and downsized tracheostomy tube (OR = 6.5, 95%CI: [2.0-21.0]) were associated with successful decannulations. Successful decannulation was associated with lower hospital mortality when compated to those who could not be decannulated (3.2% vs 33.3% p < 0.0001).In our older population with high comorbidities, percutaneous tracheostomies were associated with less complications than surgical tracheostomies. Patients with poor premorbid functional status and those who could not have their tracheostomy tube sucessfuly downsized were less likely to be decannulated, and had a higher mortality. This data enables physicians to inform the families of the added risks involved with tracheostomy in this patient group."
https://openalex.org/W3045228630,"Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are states in which the electrical activity of the brain reacts steadily to repeated auditory stimuli. They are known to be useful for testing the functional integrity of neural circuits in the cortex, as well as for their capacity to generate synchronous activity in both human and animal models. Furthermore, abnormal gamma oscillations on ASSR are typically observed in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Changes in neural synchrony may reflect aberrations in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. However, GABA’s impact and effects related to ASSR are still unclear. Here, we examined the effect of a GABAa receptor antagonist, (+)-bicuculline, on ASSR in free-moving rats. (+)-Bicuculline (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, sc) markedly and dose-dependently reduced ASSR signals, consistent with current hypotheses. In particular, (+)-bicuculline significantly reduced event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) at 2 and 4 mg/kg between 10 and 30 minutes post-dose. Further, bicuculline (2 and 4 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently increased baseline gamma power. Furthermore, the occurrence of convulsions was consistent with the drug’s pharmacokinetics. For example, high doses of (+)-bicuculline such as those greater than 880 ng/g in the brain induced convulsion. Additionally, time-dependent changes in ERSP with (+)-bicuculline were observed in accordance with drug concentration. This study partially unraveled the contribution of GABAa receptor signals to the generation of ASSR."
https://openalex.org/W3044650694,"In 2011 Yale New Haven Hospital, in response to high utilization of acute care services and widespread patient and health care personnel dissatisfaction, set out to improve its care of adults living with sickle cell disease. Re-organization components included recruitment of additional personnel; re-locating inpatients to a single nursing unit; reducing the number of involved providers; personalized care plans for pain management; setting limits upon access to parenteral opioids; and an emphasis upon clinic visits focused upon home management of pain as well as specialty and primary care. Outcomes included dramatic reductions in inpatient days (79%), emergency department visits (63%), and hospitalizations (53%); an increase in outpatient visits (31%); and a decrease in costs (49%). Providers and nurses viewed the re-organization and outcomes positively. Most patients reported improvements in pain control and life style; many patients thought the re-organization process was unfair. Their primary complaint was a lack of shared decision-making. We attribute the contrast in these perspectives to the inherent difficulties of managing recurrent acute and chronic pain with opioids, especially within the context of the imbalance in wellness, power, and privilege between persons living with sickle cell disease, predominantly persons of color and poor socio-economic status, and health care organizations and their personnel."
https://openalex.org/W3045360888,"As the main actuator of high-speed running, the ostrich feet are highly capable of cushioning and shock absorption. In this study, based on the elastic modulus scales and assembly order of the 3rd toe soft tissues and the functions of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, we designed fourteen bio-inspired feet. The impact process on loose sand was simulated on the finite element software Abaqus. Also the stress distributions and deformations of each component of the bio-inspired feet were clarified. With the peak acceleration as the index, the cushioning performances of the bio-inspired feet were compared on both loose sand and solid ground through height-variable impact tests. The 15-15-15 HA (hardness unit) bio-inspired foot showed lower peak acceleration and thereby better cushioning performance, but larger deformation, less-uniform stress distribution and thereby lower stability than the 15-35-55 HA bio-inspired foot. In fact, the silicon rubbers with different hardness degrees (which simulate the elasticity modulus scales of the digital cushions, fascia and skin) and the spring mechanism (which simulates the functions of the MTP joint) work as an ""integrated system"" of cushioning and shock absorption."
https://openalex.org/W3045447326,"Coptidis alkaloids are the primary active components of Coptis chinensis Franch. Clinical and pharmacodynamic studies have confirmed that Coptidis alkaloids have multiple therapeutic effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor effects, and they are usually used to treat various inflammatory disorders and related diseases. Mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) were isolated from BALB/c mice. Immune-mediated destruction of BMCs was induced by interferon (IFN) -γ. High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/ mass spectrometry was used to analyze the ingredients of the aqueous extract from Coptis chinensis Franch. The results confirmed that Coptidis alkaloids were the predominant ingredients in the aqueous extract from Coptis chinensis. The functional mechanism of Coptidis alkaloids in inhibiting immune-mediated destruction of BMCs was studied in vitro. After Coptidis alkaloid treatment, the percentages of apoptotic BMCs and the proliferation and differentiation of helper T (Th) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells were measured by flow cytometry. The expression and distribution of T-bet in BMCs were observed by immunofluorescence. Western blotting analysis was used to assay the expression of key molecules in the Fas apoptosis and Jak/Stats signaling pathways in BMCs. We identified five alkaloids in the aqueous extract of Coptis chinensis. The apoptotic ratios of BMCs induced by IFN-γ were decreased significantly after Coptidis alkaloid treatment. The levels of key molecules (Fas, Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-8) in Fas apoptosis signaling pathways also decreased significantly after treatment with low concentrations of Coptidis alkaloids. Coptidis alkaloids were also found to inhibit the proliferation of Th1 and Th17 cells and induce the differentiation of Th2 and Treg cells; further, the distribution of T-bet in BMCs was decreased significantly. In addition, the levels of Stat-1, phospho-Stat-1 and phospho-Stat-3 were also reduced after Coptidis alkaloid treatment. These results indicate that Coptidis alkaloids extracted by water decoction from Coptis chinensis Franch could inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes, attenuate the apoptosis of BMCs, and suppress the immune-mediated destruction of the BMCs induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W3045485252,"Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic neuropathy, both hallmarks of glaucoma, have been shown to involve N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of Philanthotoxin (PhTX)-343 in NMDA-induced retinal injury to alleviate ensuing visual impairments. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three; Group I was intravitreally injected with phosphate buffer saline as the control, Group II was injected with NMDA (160 nM) to induce retinal excitotoxic injury, while Group III was injected with PhTX-343 (160 nM) 24 h prior to excitotoxicity induction with NMDA. Rats were subjected to visual behaviour tests seven days post-treatment and subsequently euthanized. Rat retinas and optic nerves were subjected to H&E and toluidine blue staining, respectively. Histological assessments showed that NMDA exposure resulted in significant loss of retinal cell nuclei and thinning of ganglion cell layer (GCL). PhTX-343 pre-treatment prevented NMDA-induced changes where the RGC layer morphology is similar to the control. The numbers of nuclei in the NMDA group were markedly lower compared to the control (p<0.05). PhTX-343 group had significantly higher numbers of nuclei within 100 μm length and 100 μm2 area of GCL (2.9- and 1.7-fold, respectively) compared to NMDA group (p<0.05). PhTX-343 group also displayed lesser optic nerve fibres degeneration compared to NMDA group which showed vacuolation in all sections. In the visual behaviour test, the NMDA group recorded higher total distance travelled, and lower total immobile time and episodes compared to the control and PhTX-343 groups (p<0.05). Object recognition tests showed that the rats in PhTX-343 group could recognize objects better, whereas the same objects were identified as novel by NMDA rats despite multiple exposures (p<0.05). Visual performances in the PhTX-343 group were all comparable with the control (p>0.05). These findings suggested that PhTX-343 inhibit retinal cell loss, optic nerve damage, and visual impairments in NMDA-induced rats."
https://openalex.org/W3044446967,"Introduction Many arboviruses of public health significance are maintained in zoonotic cycles with complex transmission pathways. The presence of serum antibody against arboviruses in vertebrates provides evidence of their historical exposure but reveals nothing about the vector-reservoir relationship. Moreover, collecting blood or tissue samples from vertebrate hosts is ethically and logistically challenging. We developed a novel approach for screening the immune status of vertebrates against Ross River virus that allows us to implicate the vectors that form the transmission pathways for this commonly notified Australian arboviral disease. Methods A micro-plaque reduction neutralisation test (micro-PRNT) was developed and validated on koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) sera against a standard PRNT. The ability of the micro-PRNT to detect RRV antibodies in mosquito blood meals was then tested using two mosquito models. Laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti were fed, via a membrane, on sheep blood supplemented with RRV seropositive and seronegative human sera. Aedes notoscriptus were fed on RRV seropositive and seronegative human volunteers. Blood-fed mosquitoes were harvested at various time points after feeding and their blood meals analysed for the presence of RRV neutralising antibodies using the micro-PRNT. Results There was significant agreement of the plaque neutralisation resulting from the micro-PRNT and standard PRNT techniques (R2 = 0.65; P<0.0001) when applied to RRV antibody detection in koala sera. Sensitivity and specificity of the micro-PRNT assay were 88.2% and 96%, respectively, in comparison with the standard PRNT. Blood meals from mosquitoes fed on sheep blood supplemented with RRV antibodies, and on blood from RRV seropositive humans neutralised the virus by ≥50% until 48 hr post feeding. The vertebrate origin of the blood meal was also ascertained for the same samples, in parallel, using established molecular techniques. Conclusions The small volumes of blood present in mosquito abdomens can be used to identify RRV antibodies and therefore host exposure to arbovirus infection. In tandem with the accurate identification of the mosquito, and diagnostics for the host origin of the blood meal, this technique has tremendous potential for exploring RRV transmission pathways. It can be adapted for similar studies on other mosquito borne zoonoses."
https://openalex.org/W3044469649,"To provide a preliminary assessment of the current clinical practice for the treatment of post-traumatic headache following concussion in military primary health care settings.Headache is one of the most common symptoms post-concussion; however, little is known of the current clinical practices of primary care providers (on the treatment of post-traumatic headache), particularly in military settings.Study participants were primary care providers (n = 65) who treated active duty Service members suffering from post-traumatic headache at two military installations. Qualitative data gathered via semi-structured interviews were used to describe provider practices and experience in treating patients with post-traumatic headache.Some patterns of care across primary care providers treating post-traumatic headache were consistent with the Department of Defense-recommended clinical recommendation (e.g., recommendation of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment [89.4%]; engaging in follow-up care [100%]). Differences existed in timing of follow-up from initial visit [16.9% reporting within 24 hours; 21.5% reporting within 48-72 hours; and 26.2% reporting more than 1 week], the factors contributing to the type of care given (e.g., symptomatology [33.0%], injury characteristic [24.2%], patient characteristic [13.2%]) and the need for referral to higher level of care (e.g., symptomatology [44.6%], treatment failure [25.0%]). These variations may be indicative of individualized treatment which would be compliant with best clinical practice.The results of this study demonstrate the current clinical practice in military primary care settings for the treatment of post-traumatic headache which can potentially inform and improve implementation of provider training and education."
https://openalex.org/W3044488395,"To identify abnormalities of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by conducting a voxel-based analysis of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion images.This prospective study included 23 OCD patients (nine males, 14 females; age 21-62 years; mean ± SD 37.2 ± 10.7 years) diagnosed based on DSM-IV-TR criteria and 64 healthy controls (27 males, 37 females; age 20-64 years; mean ± SD 38.3 ± 12.8 years). Subjects were recruited from October 2011 to August 2017. Imaging was performed on a 3T scanner. Quantitative rCBF maps generated from pCASL images were co-registered and resliced with the three-dimensional T1-weighted images, and then spatially normalized to a brain template and smoothed. We used statistical nonparametric mapping to assess the differences in rCBF and gray matter volume between the OCD and control groups. The significance level was set at the p-value <0.05 with family-wise error rate correction for multiple comparisons.Compared to the control group, there were significant rCBF reductions in the right putamen, right frontal operculum, left midcingulate cortex, and right temporal pole in the OCD group. There were no significant between-group differences in the gray matter volume.The pCASL imaging noninvasively detected physiologically disrupted areas without structural abnormalities in OCD patients. The rCBF reductions observed in these regions in OCD patients could be associated with the pathophysiology of OCD."
https://openalex.org/W3044536310,"It has been suggested that the intergenerational associations in gestational age at delivery are considerably affected by temporal changes in the environmental conditions. We explored whether changing environment affects familial resemblance of gestational age at delivery. Understanding how correlation changes in different settings allows to design better studies aimed to detect genes and environmental factors involved in the parturition process. The Swedish Medical Birth Register was used to retrieve births during 1973–2012. In total, 454,433 parent-child, 2,247,062 full sibling, 405,116 maternal half-sibling and 469,995 paternal half-sibling pairs were identified. A decreasing trend in correlation, associated with increasing age gaps, was observed among all siblings, with the largest drop for full siblings, from ρ = 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31, 0.33) for full siblings with one-year gap to ρ = 0.16 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.22) for full siblings with age gap above 20 years. A variation in association between full siblings born up to two years apart was observed; estimate ρ = 0.28 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.3) in 1973, and ρ = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.38) in 2012. Observed variability in the association in gestational age at delivery between the relatives with respect to their birth year or age gap suggests the existence of temporally changing environmental factors."

However, research on over-indebtedness is scarce although millions of European citizens in all socioeconomic positions are over-indebted. Prior studies suggested that over-indebtedness is associated with poor physical and mental health.Investigate the association between over-indebtedness and antidepressant use in Germany.A cross-sectional survey among debt advice agencies' clients was conducted in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in 2017 (OID). Data were merged with the first wave of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to examine antidepressant use in the previous 7 days (OID: n = 699; DEGS1: n = 7115).Prevalence of antidepressant use was higher in the over-indebted (12.3%) than the general population (5.0%). The over-indebted were significantly more likely to use antidepressants than the general population even after controlling for other socioeconomic, demographic and health factors (adjusted odds ratio 1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.35-2.48).Stakeholders in health care, debt counselling, research and social policy should consider the link between over-indebtedness and mental illness to advance the understanding of health inequalities and to help those who have mental health and debt problems."
https://openalex.org/W3044715304,"Are darker-skinned workers discriminated against in the labor market? Studies using survey data have shown that darker skin tone is associated with increased labor market disadvantages. However, it is hard to refute the possibility that other factors correlated with skin tones might affect employment outcomes. To overcome this inherent limitation, we use a natural experiment: we utilize changes in one's own skin tone, generated by exposure to the sun, to explore the effect of skin tone on the tendency to be employed. We find that those people whose skin tone becomes darker by exposure to the sun (but not others) are less likely to be employed when the UV radiation in the previous three weeks in the area in which they reside is greater. These within-person findings hold even when controlling for the week, the year, the region, demographic characteristics and the occupation and industry one is employed in."
https://openalex.org/W3045225576,"Background A systematic assessment was done to examine the effect of HIV interventions among MSM in Dhaka, Bangladesh. MSM were defined as males having sex with males but did not sell sex in the last year. MSM are hidden, marginalized and stigmatized population groups not only in Bangladesh but also globally. In 2010, HIV interventions for MSM were expanded in 40 districts of Bangladesh through 65 drop-in-centres (DICs) and peer outreach workers. Methods Data from two surveys on MSM in Dhaka in 2010 (baseline) and 2013 (midline) were used to analyse the effect of ongoing HIV prevention services. Both surveys used time location sampling to randomly select MSM for risk behaviour interviews. Two outcome variables were considered; condom use in the last anal sex act and consistent condom use during anal sex in the last month. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine factors associated with condom use. Results Condom use significantly increased at the midline than baseline (p<0.001 for both). Multivariate analysis showed that having comprehensive knowledge of HIV and participation in HIV prevention programme were positively associated with both last time and consistent condom use. MSM who had comprehensive knowledge of HIV were 1.9 times (95% CI: 1.3–2.8, p = 0.002) and 2.1 times (95% CI: 1.4–3.2, p<0.001) more likely to use condoms than those who did not have comprehensive knowledge of HIV. The likelihood of using condoms among MSM was more than double at the midline than the baseline (p<0.01 for both). However, odds of condom use was significantly lower among those who perceived themselves to be at risk or were not able to assess their own risk of HIV. Conclusion To sustain positive changes in HIV risk behaviours, HIV prevention programmes for MSM need to be continued and strengthened."
