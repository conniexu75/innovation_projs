https://openalex.org/W2026075546,"Focal adhesion of leukocytes to the blood vessel lining is a key step in inflammation and certain vascular disease processes. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of blood neutrophils. A full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for ELAM-1 has now been isolated by transient expression in COS cells. Cells transfected with the ELAM-1 clone express a surface structure recognized by two ELAM-1 specific monoclonal antibodies (H4/18 and H18/7) and support the adhesion of isolated human neutrophils and the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Expression of ELAM-1 transcripts in cultured human endothelial cells is induced by cytokines, reaching a maximum at 2 to 4 hours and decaying by 24 hours; cell surface expression of ELAM-1 protein parallels that of the mRNA. The primary sequence of ELAM-1 predicts an amino-terminal lectin-like domain, an EGF domain, and six tandem repetitive motifs (about 60 amino acids each) related to those found in complement regulatory proteins. A similar domain structure is also found in the MEL-14 lymphocyte cell surface homing receptor, and in granule-membrane protein 140, a membrane glycoprotein of platelet and endothelial secretory granules that can be rapidly mobilized (less than 5 minutes) to the cell surface by thrombin and other stimuli. Thus, ELAM-1 may be a member of a nascent gene family of cell surface molecules involved in the regulation of inflammatory and immunological events at the interface of vessel wall and blood."

https://openalex.org/W2022298315,"Rapid phylogenetic identification of single microbial cells was achieved with a new staining method. Formaldehyde-fixed, intact cells were hybridized with fluorescently labeled oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Because of the abundance of rRNA in cells, the binding of the fluorescent probes to individual cells is readily visualized. Phylogenetic identification is achieved by the use of oligonucleotides (length 17 to 34 nucleotides) that are complementary to phylogenetic group-specific 16S rRNA sequences. Appropriate probes can be composed of oligonucleotide sequences that distinguish between the primary kingdoms (eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaebacteria) and between closely related organisms. The simultaneous use of multiple probes, labeled with different fluorescent dyes, allows the identification of different cell types in the same microscopic field. Quantitative microfluorimetry shows that the amount of an rRNA-specific probe that binds to Escherichia coli varies with the ribosome content and therefore reflects growth rate."

https://openalex.org/W2077813193,"A scanning ion-conductance microscope (SICM) has been developed that can image the topography of nonconducting surfaces that are covered with electrolytes. The probe of the SICM is an electrolyte-filled micropipette. The flow of ions through the opening of the pipette is blocked at short distances between the probe and the surface, thus, limiting the ion conductance. A feedback mechanism can be used to maintain a given conductance and in turn determine the distance to the surface. The SICM can also sample and image the local ion currents above the surfaces. To illustrate its potential for imaging ion currents through channels in membranes, a topographic image of a membrane filter with 0.80-micrometer pores and an image of the ion currents flowing through such pores are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2021673452,"In the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), two specific oligonucleotide primers are used to amplify the sequences between them. However, this technique is not suitable for amplifying genes that encode molecules where the 5' portion of the sequences of interest is not known, such as the T cell receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulins. Because of this limitation, a novel technique, anchored polymerase chain reaction (A-PCR), was devised that requires sequence specificity only on the 3' end of the target fragment. It was used to analyze TCR delta chain mRNA's from human peripheral blood gamma delta T cells. Most of these cells had a V delta gene segment not previously described (V delta 3), and the delta chain junctional sequences formed a discrete subpopulation compared with those previously reported."

https://openalex.org/W2033436103,"The molecules with which the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor interacts to elicit the biochemical reactions responsible for cell proliferation have not been identified. Antisera directed against specific PDGF receptor peptides coprecipitated a phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase and the PDGF receptor. Immunoprecipitates from PDGF-stimulated cells contained 10 to 50 times as much PI kinase as those from unstimulated cells. Mutation of the PDGF receptor by deletion of its kinase insert region resulted in a receptor markedly less effective than the wild type in eliciting cell proliferation and defective in PDGF-stimulated PI kinase, but still capable of PDGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These data show that the PDGF receptor is physically associated with a PDGF-sensitive PI kinase that is distinct from tyrosine kinase and is not required for PDGF-induced PI hydrolysis. The finding that the mutant PDGF receptor missing the kinase insert domain elicited known early biochemical responses to PDGF, but did not associate with or regulate PI kinase, suggests a novel role for the receptor-associated PI kinase in the transmission of mitogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2019647633,"The 50 amino acid form of TGF-alpha is cleaved from a conserved integral membrane glycoprotein by a protease that, in many tumor cells, appears to be limiting. To test whether the membrane-bound precursor has biological activity in the absence of processing, we introduced amino acid substitutions at the proteolytic cleavage sites. BHK cells transfected with expression vectors containing these altered sequences do not secrete detectable levels of mature TGF-alpha into the medium, but express high levels of proTGF-alpha at the cell surface. Coincubation of these BHK cells with A431 cells demonstrates that membrane-bound proTGF-alpha may bind to EGF receptors on the surface of contiguous cells, induce receptor autophosphorylation, and thereby produce a rapid rise in A431 intracellular calcium levels. Thus, proTGF-alpha can be biologically active in the absence of processing, a fact that may have implications for the integral membrane precursors of related growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2001375090,"An inhibitor has been identified in the conditioned medium of hamster cells and hamster-human hybrids that suppresses neovascularization in vivo in the rat cornea. Inhibitory activity was tightly linked to the presence of an active cancer suppressor gene in transformants and revertants, in segregating hybrids, and in temperature-limited transformants. It copurified with a approximately 140 kd glycoprotein. Polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified preparation recognized a 140 kd protein in conditioned medium and was able to adsorb out all antiangiogenic activity. These results define the control of the activity of an inhibitor of neovascularization as one function of the cancer suppressor gene active in BHK21/cl13 cells and simultaneously identify a new inhibitor of angiogenesis, a process vital to the growth of solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2077483002,"Mouse 3T3 cell lines capable of constitutively synthesizing an RNA complementary to the messenger RNA encoding TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, were constructed by transfection with appropriate plasmid constructs. Many of the lines were down-modulated for TIMP messenger RNA levels and secreted less TIMP into the culture medium. In comparison to noninvasive, nontumorigenic controls, these cells not only were invasive in a human amnion invasion assay, but also were tumorigenic and metastatic in athymic mice. These results indicate that TIMP suppresses oncogenicity, at least in immortal murine 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035178191,"A strategy, termed homolog-scanning mutagenesis, was used to identify the epitopes on human growth hormone (hGH) for binding to its cloned liver receptor and eight different monoclonal antibodies (Mab's). Segments of sequences (7 to 30 residues long) that were derived from homologous hormones known not to bind to the hGH receptor or Mab's, were systematically substituted throughout the hGH gene to produce a set of 17 chimeric hormones. Each Mab or receptor was categorized by a particular subset of mutant hormones that disrupted binding. Each subset of the disruptive mutations mapped within close proximity on a three-dimensional model of hGH, even though the residues changed within each subset were usually distant in the primary sequence. The mapping analysis correctly predicted those Mab's which could or could not block binding of the receptor to hGH and further suggested (along with other data) that the folding of these chimeric hormones is like that of hGH. By this analysis, three discontinuous polypeptide determinants in hGH—the loop between residues 54 and 74, the central portion of helix 4 to the carboxyl terminus, and to a lesser extent the amino-terminal region of helix 1—modulate binding to the liver receptor. Homolog-scanning mutagenesis should be of general use in identifying sequences that cause functional variation among homologous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1980897291,"Peptides that are antigenic for T lymphocytes are ligands for two receptors, the class I or II glycoproteins that are encoded by genes in the major histocompatibility complex, and the idiotypic alpha/beta chain T-cell antigen receptor. That a peptide must bind to an MHC molecule to interact with a T-cell antigen receptor is the molecular basis of the MHC restriction of antigen-recognition by T lymphocytes. In such a trimolecular interaction the amino-acid sequence of the peptide must specify the contact with both receptors: agretope residues bind to the MHC receptor and epitope residues bind to the T-cell antigen receptor. From a compilation of known antigenic peptides, two algorithms have been proposed to predict antigenic sites in proteins. One algorithm uses linear motifs in the sequence, whereas the other considers peptide conformation and predicts antigenicity for amphipathic alpha-helices. We report here that a systematic delimitation of an antigenic site precisely identifies a predicted pentapeptide motif as the minimal antigenic determinant presented by a class I MHC molecule and recognized by a cytolytic T lymphocyte clone."

https://openalex.org/W2086606537,"The patch-clamp technique was used to examine the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and its second messenger guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) on an amiloride-sensitive cation channel in the apical membrane of renal inner medullary collecting duct cells. Both ANP (10-11M) and dibutyryl guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (10-4M) inhibited the channel in cell-attached patches, and cGMP (10-5M) inhibited the channel in inside-out patches. The inner medullary collecting duct is the first tissue in which ANP, via its second messenger cGMP, has been shown to regulate single ion channels. The results suggest that the natriuretic action of ANP is related in part to cGMP-mediated inhibition of electrogenic Na+ absorption by the inner medullary collecting duct."
https://openalex.org/W2081969062,"Antisense RNA-mediated inhibition of gene expression was used to investigate the biological function of the c-raf-1 gene in a radiation-resistant human squamous carcinoma cell line, SQ-20B. S1 nuclease protection assays revealed that transfection of full-length raf complementary DNA in the antisense orientation (AS) leads to a specific reduction (greater than tenfold) of steady-state levels of the endogenous c-raf-1 sense (S) transcript in SQ-20B cells. In nude mice, the malignant potential of SQ-20B cells transfected with raf (S) was significantly increased relative to that of SQ-20B cells transfected with raf (AS). SQ-20B cells containing transfected raf (S) maintained a radiation-resistant phenotype as compared to those cells harboring the AS version, which appeared to have enhanced radiation sensitivity. These data indicate that the reduced expression of endogenous c-raf-1 is sufficient to modulate the tumorigenicity and the radiation-resistant phenotype of SQ-20B cells, thus implicating c-raf-1 in a pathway important to the genesis of this type of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2010819361,"The Epstein-Barr virus gp350/220 envelope protein mediates virus attachment to the EBV/C3dg receptor (CR2) of human B lymphocytes. Synthetic peptides corresponding to two regions in gp350/220, which have a similar amino acid sequence with the complement C3dg protein, were used to identify a receptor binding epitope. A peptide corresponding to the N terminus of gp350/220, EDPGFFNVE, bound to purified CR2 and to CR2 positive but not CR2 negative B and T lymphoblastoid cell lines. Soluble monomeric gp350/220 peptide blocked CR2 binding to immobilized EBV, while multimeric forms of the N-terminal gp350/220 peptide conjugated to albumin efficiently blocked recombinant gp350/220 and C3dg binding to B cells as well as EBV-induced B cell proliferation and transformation. These studies indicate that the N-terminal region of gp350/220 plays a crucial role in mediating the earliest stages of EBV infection of B cells and provides a molecular basis for the restricted host cell EBV tropism."
https://openalex.org/W2020142217,"A defect in regulation of a chloride channel appears to be the molecular basis for cystic fibrosis (CF), a common lethal genetic disease. It is shown here that a chloride channel with kinetic and regulatory properties similar to those described for secretory epithelial cells is present in both T and B lymphocyte cell lines. The regulation of the channels by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase in transformed B cells from CF patients is defective. Thus, lymphocytes may be an accessible source of CF tissue for study of this defect, for cloning of the chloride channel complex, and for diagnosis of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W1892497973,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a heritable deficiency of the LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95 family of leukocyte alpha beta heterodimers (the leukocyte integrins). We have studied the defect in patients who synthesize an aberrantly small form of the beta subunit common to all three proteins. S1 nuclease protection showed the presence of a 90-nucleotide mismatch in RNA from patients and relatives, correlating with inheritance of the disease. Use of the Taq polymerase chain reaction to amplify this region of RNA after first strand cDNA synthesis and sequencing showed an in-frame deletion of 90 nucleotides in the extracellular domain. Thus, this highly conserved region, 63% and 53% identical in amino acid sequence to two other beta subunits of the integrin family, is required for association of the beta subunit with alpha subunits. The 90-nucleotide region corresponds to a single exon present in both the normal and patient genome. The patient DNA has a single G to C substitution in the 5' splice site. This results in the direct joining of nonconsecutive exons in an unusual type of abnormal RNA splicing. A small amount of normally spliced message, detected by S1 nuclease protection and Taq polymerase chain reaction, encodes a normal sized beta subunit which is surface-expressed and accounts for the low levels of leukocyte integrin expression observed in these patients, and hence the moderate phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2067432163,"Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycophospholipid (GPI) membrane anchor covalently attached to the COOH-terminus of the protein. A hydrophobic domain located at the COOH-terminus is required for anchor attachment; DAF molecules lacking this domain are secreted. Replacement of the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain with a signal peptide that normally functions in membrane translocation, or with a random hydrophobic sequence, results in efficient and correct processing, producing GPI-anchored DAF on the cell surface. The structural requirements for GPI anchor attachment and for membrane translocation are therefore similar, presumably depending on overall hydrophobicity rather than specific sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1551846348,"Abstract The effects of galanin and somatostatin on insulin release, membrane potential, and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) were investigated using beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Whereas insulin release was measured in a column perifusion system, membrane potential and [Ca2+]i were measured with the fluorescent indicators bisoxonol (bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)trimethineoxonol) and quin 2, in cell suspensions in a cuvette. Galanin (16 nM) and somatostatin (400 nM) suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin release in parallel to promoting repolarization and a reduction in [Ca2+]i. The reduction in [Ca2+]i comprised an initial nadir followed by a slow rise and the establishment of a new steady state level. The slow rise in [Ca2+]i was abolished by 50 microM D-600, a blocker of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. Both peptides suppressed insulin release even when [Ca2+]i was raised by 25 mM K+. Under these conditions the inhibition of insulin release was partly reversed by an increase in the glucose concentration. Addition of 5 mM Ca2+ to a cell suspension, incubated in the presence of 20 mM glucose and either galanin, somatostatin, or the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (10 nM), induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i, this effect disappearing subsequent to the addition of D-600. The effects of galanin, somatostatin, and clonidine on [Ca2+]i were abolished in beta-cells treated with pertussis toxin. In accordance with measurements of [Ca2+]i, treatment with pertussis toxin reversed the inhibitory effect of galanin on insulin release. The inhibitory action of galanin and somatostatin on insulin release is probably accounted for by not only a repolarization-induced reduction in [Ca2+]i and a decreased sensitivity of the secretory machinery to Ca2+, but also by a direct interaction with the exocytotic process. It is proposed that these effects are mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1542933458,"Abstract Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa is the most prominent Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-binding adhesion receptor on platelets. By affinity chromatography on an immobilized RGD peptide, we have investigated the possible existence of other platelet-associated adhesion receptors that bind RGD peptides. When an octyl glucoside extract of surface-radioiodinated platelets was applied to an affinity matrix of KYGRGDS-coupled Sepharose 4B, a 160-kDa-labeled protein (P160) and GPIIb-IIIa bound and were specifically eluted by soluble GRGDSP peptide, but not by the variant GRGESP peptide. Furthermore, a dodecapeptide corresponding to fibrinogen gamma 400-411 eluted only GPIIb-IIIa but not P160 from the RGD affinity matrix. Characterization of P160 by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by the O'Farrell gel electrophoresis system indicated that P160 is a component of platelet GPIc. GoH3, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the alpha subunit of the very late antigen-6, failed to immunoprecipitate P160 from the RGD eluate, indicating that it did not contain the very late antigen-6 alpha subunit. In immunoblots, P160 reacted specifically with a polyclonal anti-peptide antibody recognizing the alpha subunit of the vitronectin receptor (VnR), but not with the monoclonal anti-GPIIb antibody PMI-1, suggesting that P160 is the alpha subunit of platelet VnR. This possibility was further substantiated by the complete identity between the determined amino-terminal sequence of P160 and the known sequence of the VnR alpha subunit. Moreover, direct association of P160 with a beta subunit having an apparent molecular weight similar to that of GPIIIa was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with LM609, an anti-VnR complex monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that the VnR complex is present on platelets and may play a functional role in platelet adhesive reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1513555169,"Abstract GMP-140 is an integral membrane glycoprotein of apparent Mr = 140,000 located in secretory storage granules of platelets and vascular endothelial cells. When these cells are activated, GMP-140 redistributes from the membrane of the granules to the plasma membrane. To gain insight into the potential function of GMP-140, we examined aspects of its structure and biosynthesis. The amino acid composition of platelet GMP-140 revealed elevated numbers of cystinyl (6.1%), prolinyl (7.2%), and tryptophanyl (2.1%) residues. GMP-140 contained 28.8% carbohydrate by weight, distributed among N-acetylneuraminic acid, neutral sugar, and N-acetylglucosamine residues. Enzymatic removal of N-linked oligosaccarides reduced the protein's apparent Mr by more than 50,000. The biosynthesis of GMP-140 in HEL cells, which share biochemical features with megakaryocytes, was studied by pulse-chase labeling with [35S]cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation. HEL cells synthesized a heterogeneous GMP-140 precursor of 98-125 kDa which converted to a mature 140-kDa form within 40-60 min. Removal of high mannose oligosaccarides by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment reduced the apparent Mr of the precursor but not the mature protein. Tunicamycin-treated HEL cells synthesized three to four precursors of 80-92 kDa, suggesting the possibility of heterogeneity of GMP-140 at the protein level. Exposure of activated platelets to proteases followed by Western blotting indicated that most of the mass of GMP-140 was located on the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane. Our studies indicate that GMP-140 is a cysteine-rich, heavily glycosylated protein with a large extracytoplasmic domain. These features are compatible with a receptor function for the molecule when it is exposed on the surface of activated platelets and endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1552386679,"Rat Leydig cells possess functional high affinity receptors for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). CRF inhibited human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-induced androgen production in cultured fetal and adult Leydig cells in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no effect on basal testosterone secretion. Comparable inhibitory effects of CRF were observed in the presence or absence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. CRF treatment caused a marked reduction of steroid precursors of the androgen pathway (from pregnenolone to testosterone) during gonadotropin stimulation, but it did not influence their basal levels. The inhibitory action of CRF on hCG-induced steroidogenesis was fully reversed by 8-bromo-cAMP but was not affected by pertussis toxin. The action of CRF was rapid; and it was blocked by coincubation with anti-CRF antibody. CRF caused no changes in hCG binding to Leydig cells, and in contrast to other target tissues, CRF did not stimulate cAMP production, indicating that CRF receptors are not coupled to Gs in Leydig cells. These studies have demonstrated that CRF-induced inhibition of the acute steroidogenic action of hCG is exerted at sites related to receptor/cyclase coupling or cAMP formation. The inhibitory effects of CRF in the Leydig cell do not occur through the Gi unit of adenylate cyclase, but could involve pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein(s). These observations demonstrate that CRF has a novel and potent antireproductive effect at the testicular level. Since CRF is synthesized in the testis and is present in Leydig cells, it is likely that locally produced CRF could exert negative autocrine modulation on the stimulatory action of luteinizing hormone on Leydig cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1530872596,"Abstract We report here the application of a genetic approach to identify and isolate human DNA sequences controlling the expression of a GDP-L-fucose: beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase [alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase). Mouse L cells were chosen as host cells for this scheme since they express the necessary substrate and acceptor molecules for surface display of blood group H Fuc alpha 1----2 G al linkages constructed by (alpha-1,2) fucosyltransferases. However, they do not express cell surface blood group H structures nor detectable (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase activity. We therefore asked if (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase activity could be expressed and detected in these cells after transfection with human DNA sequences. These cells were transfected with genomic DNA isolated from a human cell line (A431) that expresses (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase. A panning procedure and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were used to isolate a mouse transfectant cell line that expresses cell surface H Fuc alpha 1----2 Gal linkages and a cognate (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase. Southern blot analysis showed that the genome of this cell line contains several hundred kilobase pairs of human DNA. Genomic DNA from this primary transfectant was used to transfect mouse L cells, and several independent, H-expressing secondary transfectants were isolated by immunological selection. Each expresses an (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the genome of each secondary transfectant contains common, characteristic human DNA restriction fragments. These results show that transfected human DNA sequences determine expression of the (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferases in the mouse transfectants, that these sequences represent a single locus, and that they are within or linked to specific human restriction fragments identifiable in each secondary transfectant. These sequences may represent a human (alpha-1,2)fucosyltransferase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1848295934,"We have studied the phosphorylation state of the insulin receptor during receptor-mediated endocytosis in the well-differentiated rat hepatoma cell line Fao. Insulin induced the rapid internalization of surface-iodinated insulin receptors into a trypsin-resistant compartment, with a 3-fold increase in the internalization rate over that seen in the absence of insulin. Within 20 min of insulin stimulation, 30-35% of surface receptors were located inside the cell. This redistribution was half-maximal by 10.5 min. Similar results were obtained when the loss of surface receptors was measured by 125I-insulin binding. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of internalized insulin receptors was measured by immunoprecipitation with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Immediately after insulin stimulation, 70-80% of internalized receptors were tyrosine phosphorylated. Internalized receptors persisted in a phosphorylated state after the dissociation of insulin but were dephosphorylated prior to their return to the plasma membrane. After 45-60 min of insulin stimulation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the internal receptor pool decreased by 45%, whereas the phosphorylation of surface receptors was unchanged. These data suggest that insulin induces the internalization of phosphorylated insulin receptors into the cell and that the phosphorylation state of the internal receptor pool may be regulated by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1501423905,"The uterine milk proteins (UTMP) are a pair of structurally related basic glycoproteins that when newly synthesized carry phosphorylated mannosyl residues on their carbohydrate chains. They are the major proteins secreted by ovine endometrium under the influence of progesterone. RNA from a late pregnant ewe endometrium was isolated for use in in vitro translation assays and for constructing cDNA libraries. Translation experiments, initially with total cellular RNA and subsequently with RNA selected by hybridization with a specific cDNA, demonstrated the production of two polypeptides (Mr = 47,000 and 55,000) that were precipitated with antiserum to the UTMP. With microsomal membranes in the translation assay, there was increased production of an Mr = 57,000 form that was protected from protease digestion. Antibody screening of a cDNA library in λgt11 identified a short clone representing the 3′ terminus of the mRNA that was shown by epitope selection experiments to be UTMP specific. This clone was then used to screen a λgt10 library. A longer clone (1.3 kilobases) was isolated and sequenced but lacked the 5′ terminus to the mRNA. The latter sequence was obtained directly from the mRNA. Interesting features of the UTMP mRNA sequence, which was 1,352 bases long and contained a 1,287-base open reading frame, were two strong start codons, two potential sites for N-glycosylation and a repeat of 21 bases, six bases apart, that resulted in a repeat of seven amino acids. The inferred amino acid sequence agreed closely with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence obtained directly from the UTMP and clearly placed the UTMP in the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors. However, we have been unable to demonstrate inhibitory activity toward any serine protease so far tested."
https://openalex.org/W2114946077,"msDNA is a peculiar molecule consisting of a branched RNA linked to single-stranded DNA via a 2′, 5′ phosphodiester bond. A cell-free system, utilizing cells permeablized with phenethyl alcohol, was established to study the synthesis of msDNA in M. xanthus. Permeablized cells labeled with [α-32P]dCTP in the presence of ddGTP, ddATP, or ddTTP produce a band that migrates at the same postion as the full-sized msDNA in an polyacrylamide gel. However, when this band is treated with ribonuclease A prior to gel electrophoresis, it results in many different-sized bands. This indicates that during the labeling, intermediates are produced in which single-stranded DNAs of various lengths are associated with a compensatory length of RNA such that the total length for each intermediate is identical. These results provide evidence for the previously proposed model in which msDNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase using a folded RNA precursor as a primer as well as a template. Furthermore, we found that there is a precise coupling mechanism of reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H."
https://openalex.org/W1487821532,"Abstract DNA fragments containing the adenovirus 2 major late or simian virus 40 early promoters were attached to a solid support via a biotin-streptavidin linkage at one end of the fragment, upstream of the RNA start site. Templates immobilized in this manner were incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts to form preinitiation complexes containing RNA polymerase II and accessory proteins required for faithful in vitro transcription. These complexes did not require ATP or dATP for assembly, were sensitive to 0.25% Sarkosyl, and were stable to extensive washing. Their incubation with specific combinations of nucleoside triphosphates resulted in the initiation of RNA chain polymerization in situ, while addition of the remaining nucleoside triphosphates was necessary to produce a full length runoff RNA. Transcriptional activity associated with preinitiation complexes was purified approximately 300-fold, relative to the unfractionated nuclear extract. The use of immobilized template permits considerable flexibility in experimental design, as substrates and inhibitors can be added and washed out of the reaction at each step. We exploited this property of the system to dissect the temporal substrate requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis. It is known from prior work that at least one step in the promoter-dependent RNA synthesis reaction requires an adenosine nucleotide that is hydrolyzable at the beta, gamma-position. This requirement is independent of the initiating nucleotide and can be satisfied by dATP, which is not ordinarily incorporated into the RNA product. We show here that the beta, gamma-hydrolyzable adenosine nucleotide must be present simultaneously with the initiating nucleoside triphosphates. No reaction occurred when complexes were incubated with dATP, washed to remove dATP, and incubated subsequently with the two initiating nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1529086445,"Abstract The inhibitory effect of the lipopeptide antibiotic amphomycin on the mechanism of mannosylphosphoryldolichol biosynthesis by calf brain rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes has been studied extensively. Calf brain rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes when incubated with varying concentrations of GDP-mannose in the presence and absence of amphomycin showed no significant difference in apparent Km for GDP-mannose (1.08 and 1.37 microM, respectively). However, the Vmax was reduced to 0.17 pmol/mg protein/min in the presence of amphomycin as compared with 1.86 pmol/mg protein/min in its absence. On the other hand, when mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthase activity was measured in the presence of amphomycin and as a function of dolichylmonophosphate (Dol-P) concentrations, the shape of the substrate velocity curve changed from a rectangular hyperbola to a sigmoid. The Hill coefficients (n) for this reaction were calculated to be 2.02 and 1.22 in the presence and absence of the antibiotic and the corresponding Km values for Dol-P were found to be 333 and 47.3 microM, respectively. In separate experiments when radiolabeled antibiotic was reacted with Dol-P in the presence of Ca2+, a complex was formed. The complex formation was dependent on both Ca2+ in the reaction mixture and fatty acid residue on the antibiotic. Similar complex formation was also observed with undecaprenylmonophosphate. No such complex, however, was formed with dolichylpyrophosphate, with undecaprenylpyrophosphate, or with their free alcohols (dolichol or undecaprenol). Furthermore, when an equimolar mixture of Dol-P and phosphatidylserine was reacted with the antibiotic under identical conditions, the complex formation was observed selectively with Dol-P. These data demonstrated that amphomycin interacted with the active site of the glycosyl-carrier lipid (Dol-P), thereby preventing its participation at the enzymatic reaction."

We report the existence and purification of porin heterotrimers between the ompC, ompF, and phoE porin gene products. Separation was achieved using a high resolution anion exchange column. The amount of each heterotrimer species present depended on the level of expression of the subunits and was consistent with random mixing of trimer subunits. A strong effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on the chromatography of porin was also detected. These results imply that assembly of porin trimers occurs between subunits synthesized on different polysomes and that subunit contacts between the porin subunits occur in conserved regions of the primary sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1519312524,"We have shown that restricted calorie intake retards age-associated loss in androgen responsiveness of the rat liver. Sustained androgen receptivity delays age-dependent decline in the synthesis of the androgen-inducible α2u globulin and derepression of the androgen-repressible senescence marker protein (SMP-2). Quantitation of mRNAs for α2u globulin and SMP-2 in the liver of animals of various ages maintained on either ad libitum or restricted diets revealed that, although the 27-month-old ad libitum-fed rat had only 5% as much α2u mRNA as the 6-month-old rat; the mRNA level was as high as 45% in the 27-month-old food-restricted rat. Conversely, the 27-month-old food-restricted rat had a much reduced amount (45%) of SMP-2 mRNA compared to the age-matched control that was allowed unlimited access to food. Furthermore, we have correlated the effect of dietary restriction on age-dependent changes in specific gene expression with the hepatic level of the immunoreactive cytoplasmic androgen-binding (CAB) protein. We observed that senescence in the male causes a substantial decrease in the circulating level of testosterone. However, dietary restriction does not retard the rate of decline in the plasma level of the male hormone during aging. These results indicate that age-dependent changes in the expression of androgen-responsive genes (α2u globulin and SMP-2) reflect changing androgen sensitivity and that food restriction may directly influence the androgen receptivity of the liver.— Chatterjee, B.; Fernandes, G.; Yu, B.

https://openalex.org/W1505180504,"Abstract Three endonucleases from murine plasmacytoma cells that specifically nick DNA which was heavily irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light were resolved by Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography. Two of these, UV endonucleases I and II, were purified extensively. UV endonuclease I appears to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 43 kDa; UV endonuclease II has an S value of 2.9 S, with a corresponding molecular mass estimated at 28 kDa. Both enzymes act as a class I AP endonuclease, cleaving phosphodiester bonds via a beta-elimination mechanism, so as to form an unsaturated deoxyribose at the 3' terminus. Both have thymine glycol DNA glycosylase activity and their substrate specificities generally appear to be overlapping but not identical. UV endonuclease I acts on both supercoiled and relaxed DNAs, whereas II acts only on supercoiled DNA. Both enzymes are active in EDTA, but have different optima for salt, pH, and Triton X-100. Each enzyme is also present in cultured diploid human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1533370146,"Abstract alpha 2-Macroglobulin, one of the major plasma proteinase inhibitors with Mr = 720,000, is known to inhibit proteinases of all four classes through the (Barrett, A. J., and Starkey, P. M. (1973) Biochem. J. 133, 709-724), but the proteinase binding site of alpha 2-macroglobulin has not been identified precisely. We localized bound proteinase molecules on the electron microscopic images of alpha 2-macroglobulin, using anti-proteinase IgG. Serratial Mr = 56,000 proteinase produced by Serratia marcescens was chosen as the antigenic probe in this study because its affinity to specific antibodies was retained in its bound state to alpha 2-macroglobulin. Dimers of alpha 2-macroglobulin/Mr = 56,000 proteinase complexes cross-linked with anti-Mr = 56,000 proteinase IgG were prepared and subjected to electron microscopic observations. The electron microscopic image of alpha 2-macroglobulin complexed with Mr = 56,000 proteinase had four straight arms with an overall shape looking like the character H. From the way anti-Mr = 56,000 proteinase IgG linked two alpha 2-macroglobulins, it was concluded that the proteinase existed in the midregion of one of the arms. This result helps us to form a more concrete view of the trap mechanism in that one of the arms of alpha 2-macroglobulin wraps the trapped proteinase and holds it isolated from high molecular weight substrates in the surrounding medium."
https://openalex.org/W1538432793,"We have utilized immunoaffinity chromatography as a means of efficiently isolating a stable yeast DNA primase from the DNA primase-DNA polymerase complex, allowing identification of the polypeptides associated with this DNA primase activity and comparison of its enzymatic properties with those of the larger protein complex. A mouse monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing the DNA polymerase subunit was used to purify the complex. Stable DNA primase was subsequently separated from the complex in high yield. The highly purified protein fraction which bound to the DNA polymerase antibody column consisted of polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 180, 86, 70, 58, 49, and 47 kDa. DNA primase activity eluted with a fraction containing only the 58-, 49-, and 47-kDa polypeptides. Partial chemical cleavage analysis of these three proteins demonstrated that the 49- and 47-kDa polypeptides are structurally related while the 58-kDa protein is unrelated to the other two. A DNA primase inhibitory monoclonal antibody was able to inhibit the activity of the purified DNA primase as well as the activity of the enzyme in the larger complex. In immunoprecipitation experiments, all three polypeptides were found in the immune complex. Thus, these three polypeptides are sufficient for DNA primase activity. In reactions using ribonucleotide substrates and natural as well as synthetic DNA templates, the purified DNA primase exhibited the same precise synthesis of unit length oligomers as did the larger protein complex and was able to extend these RNA oligomers by one additional unit length. An examination of the effects of deoxynucleotides on these DNA primase-catalyzed reactions revealed that the yeast DNA primase is an RNA-polymerizing enzyme and lacks significant DNA-polymerizing activity under the conditions tested."
https://openalex.org/W1635556700,"Abstract The reversibility of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor self-phosphorylation reaction was studied using highly purified receptor from A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. Self-phosphorylation is inhibited by the reaction product ADP in a dose-dependent manner exhibiting an IC50 approximately 2 microM. In addition, phosphorylated EGF receptor can be rapidly dephosphorylated in the presence of ADP. The dephosphorylation reaction results in equimolar production of ATP and loss of phosphate from the receptor. The reverse reaction is dependent on time and ADP exhibiting a t1/2 of 15 s and a Km(ADP) = 0.40 +/- 0.14 microM. The dephosphorylation reaction can be effectively inhibited by an exogenous peptide substrate for the forward reaction, i.e., the src-peptide (a synthetic peptide corresponding to one of the self-phosphorylation sites in p60v-src). This suggests that the dephosphorylation reaction is intrinsic to the EGF receptor. The equilibrium constant, K, for the self-phosphorylation reaction was estimated to be 0.5-1.6 using kinetic and reactant/product concentration analyses. Assuming that the standard free energy change, delta G0, for ATP hydrolysis is -9.5 kcal/mol, an observed delta G0 for hydrolysis of the EGF receptor phosphotyrosine bond was calculated to be -9 to -10 kcal/mol. These results indicate that the EGF receptor self-phosphorylation reaction, which appears important in the regulation of EGF receptor function, is readily reversible and that the phosphotyrosine bond formed by this reaction is of relatively high energy."
https://openalex.org/W1526759719,"Abstract The enzymes mediating the conversion of thyroxine to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine have proved difficult to purify and characterize biochemically. In this report we describe the successful expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes of type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. Oocytes injected with rat liver mRNA and then incubated for 5 days demonstrated a progressive increase in 5'-deiodinase activity. This activity: (a) manifested a Km for 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine of 0.24 microM, (b) was sensitive to inhibition by 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, and (c) was associated with the membrane fraction of oocyte homogenates. Size fractionation of the mRNA by agarose gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions resulted in the identification of a 1.5-2.0-kilobase fraction capable of inducing type I 5'-deiodinase activity. This oocyte assay system should provide a mechanism for identifying cDNA(s) encoding the enzymes involved in the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1547781203,"Thirteen monoclonal antibodies which react with the major capsid protein (VP1) of simian virus 40 (SV40) have been isolated. Of these, five neutralized viral infectivity when added in sufficient concentration. Seven of the antibodies reacted with denatured VP1 and also recognized fragments generated by protease or cyanogen bromide cleavage. The region of VP1 recognized by all seven antibodies was mapped within a nine-amino-acid segment located in the carboxyl portion of the protein (from amino acid positions 312 to 321). This region is likely to protrude from the surface of the protein as judged by high hydrophilicity and low hydropathy predicted from the amino acid sequence and lack of secondary structure by contrast with the rest of the protein for which predominantly β-sheet structure is predicted. Competition between these antibodies and synthetic peptides for binding to virus particles confirmed that the continuous epitope is contained within the nine-amino-acid sequence. Competition between the different monoclonal antibodies suggested that the continuous epitope was also part of more complex discontinuous epitopes recognized by some of the other antibodies. These results support a model in which a segment of the carboxyl-terminal portion of VP1 protrudes from the surface of the virus to form an antigenic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2129081532,"Abstract In pancreatic acini, cGMP can be increased by secretagogues such as cholecystokinin (CCK), cholinergic agents, and bombesin, whose actions on enzyme secretion are believed to be mediated by protein kinase C. However, the role of cGMP in acinar cell function has been unclear. A recent paper by Rogers et al. (Rogers, J., Hughes, R.G., and Matthews, E. K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3713-3719) reported that two analogues of cGMP, N2,O2-dibutyl guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (Bt2cGMP) and 8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8Br-cGMP), at concentrations in the nanomolar range, inhibited the stimulation of amylase secretion caused by CCK-8, bethanechol, bombesin, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Rogers et al. also reported that sodium nitroprusside inhibited the stimulation of enzyme secretion caused by CCK-8 or TPA. These authors concluded that cGMP inhibits protein kinase C-mediated secretion in pancreatic acini. In the present study we attempted to confirm the findings of Rogers et al., We found, however, that Bt2cGMP inhibited CCK-8-stimulated amylase release only at concentrations of the nucleotide above 10 microM. Moreover, there was a close correlation between the ability of Bt2cGMP to inhibit CCK-8-stimulated amylase release and its ability to inhibit binding of 125I-CCK-8. Bt2cGMP, at concentrations as high as 3 mM, did not alter the stimulation of amylase release caused by carbachol, bombesin, TPA, or A23187. 8Br-cGMP, at concentrations up to 1 mM, did not inhibit the stimulation of amylase release caused by CCK-8 or TPA. At concentrations above 0.1 mM, 8Br-cGMP augmented the stimulation of amylase release caused by CCK-8, carbachol, bombesin, or TPA. Sodium nitroprusside, at a concentration that causes a 60-fold increase in cGMP, did not inhibit the stimulation of amylase release caused by CCK-8, carbachol, bombesin, or TPA. Our results do not confirm the findings of Rogers et al. and indicate that cGMP does not inhibit protein kinase C-mediated secretion in pancreatic acini."
https://openalex.org/W1560053869,"We have raised antisera against Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and domains Ia and III to study the structure-function relationships of PE. Anti-PE antibody (AbPE) was shown to abolish the ADP-ribosylation activity of PE. However, neither antidomain Ia antibody nor antidomain III antibody inhibited the ADP-ribosylation activity of PE. This suggests that the inhibition of ADP-ribosylation by AbPE results from the binding of AbPE to the region between domains Ia and III. Since the binding of AbPE to PE did not inhibit NAD hydrolysis in the absence of elongation factor 2, the inhibitory effect of AbPE on ADP-ribosylation may be due to steric hindrance rather than a direct action on the catalytic function. Thus, the interface between domain Ia and III may be the site of entry of elongation factor 2 during ADP-ribosylation. The antibodies were also used to study both the inhibitory effects of PE on protein synthesis and its cytotoxic activity. Either AbPE or antidomain Ia antibody, but not antidomain III antibody, was able to reverse the inhibition of protein synthesis by PE and to block its cytotoxicity. In addition, rabbits immunized with domain Ia acquired tolerance against 100 micrograms of PE injected subcutaneously. These results suggest that domain Ia is the cell-binding domain of PE and may be used for vaccination against PE-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1578842212,"We have constructed both homoduplex and heteroduplex restriction fragment templates that contained mutations in the G + C-rich region of dyad symmetry in the Escherichia coli thr operon attenuator and have studied their termination properties in an in vitro transcription system. We found that the DNA sequence of the template strand determines the transcription termination efficiency. We also constructed two double mutant heteroduplex templates to examine the role of possible complementary base pairs between the nontranscribed DNA strand and the nascent RNA in the transcription bubble. There was no indication that the potential DNA-RNA interactions in the G + C-rich region are involved in transcription termination. Taken together, our results are consistent with and extend those obtained by Ryan and Chamberlin (Ryan, T., and Chamberlin, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4690-4693) for the trp operon attenuator and argue strongly against models that propose that DNA hairpin formation in the nontranscribed DNA strand or pairing of the nascent RNA with the nontranscribed DNA strand are important for transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W1602288205,"Abstract We isolated from the Rauscher erythroleukemia cell line (Red 5), a subclone (Red 5-1.5), which contains erythropoietin (epo) binding sites and demonstrates an epo-dependent erythroid differentiation. One class of high affinity binding sites was detected with a Kd (+/- S.D.) of 0.43 +/- 0.09 nM and a mean density/cell of 1200 +/- 311. The cell-associated 125I-epo was displaced by nonlabeled epo but not by other hormones or factors. The 125I-epo binding to Red 5-1.5 cells was maximal within 3 h at 15 degrees C and 1 h at 37 degrees C and proportional to cell number. The addition of epo increased [3H] uridine incorporation into RNA by 6 h and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 60 h followed by 59Fe incorporation into protein, cell proliferation, and formation of hemoglobin-containing colonies. The incorporation of 59Fe into protein demonstrated a linear dose response (from 0.002 to 1.5 units of epo/ml) beginning 60 h after addition of the hormone to the cultures, and there was a dose-dependent increase (from 0.1 to 1.0 unit of epo/ml) in the formation of hemoglobin-containing colonies. We concluded that the binding of 125I-epo to Red 5-1.5 suggests the presence of specific epo receptors. The sequence of the epo-induced proliferation and differentiation events is similar to primary erythroid cultures but requires longer epo exposure. Receptor occupancy correlates with the induced biological response."
https://openalex.org/W1509323731,"Members of the rat alpha 2u globulin gene family are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Using a DNase I footprinting assay, we find that expressing tissues (liver, lachrymal, and salivary gland) contain nuclear proteins that interact specifically with two sites in the third intron of a cloned gene. These sequences are similar to a CCAAT-like sequence in the 5'-flanking region of the gene and the binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. Extracts of nonexpressing tissues (kidney, testis, brain, and spleen) do not show footprinting activity at these sites. Whereas hepatic expression of alpha 2u globulin is restricted to normal adult males, nuclear extracts of liver from all animals (adult and juvenile, male and female, intact and hypophysectomized) produce similar footprints. Footprints by extracts of lachrymal and salivary glands, tissues that express a subset of alpha 2u globulin genes distinct from the hepatic set, are also similar to the liver activity. The findings suggest that the third intron of an alpha 2u globulin gene contains sites that interact with tissue-specific factors to establish the potential for hormonal and developmental control of expression."
