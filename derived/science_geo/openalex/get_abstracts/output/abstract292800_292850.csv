https://openalex.org/W1964621123,The dissipation of tidal energy in Jupiter's satellite Io is likely to have melted a major fraction of the mass. Consequences of a largely molten interior may be evident in pictures of Io's surface returned by Voyager I.
https://openalex.org/W2093228741,"The male of Calopteryx maculata (Beauvois) (Odonata) uses its penis not only to transfer sperm to the female but also to remove sperm deposited in the female's sperm storage organs from previous matings. Apparently, no such sperm removal function has previously been attributed to the intromittent organ of any animal."
https://openalex.org/W2065634395,"Pyrolyzates similar to natural crude oils were generated from organic-rich shales by hydrous pyrolysis. With this type of pyrolysis it is possible to make more sophisticated correlations between crude oils and their source rocks, evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of a source rock, and elucidate the variables involved in the natural oil-generating process."
https://openalex.org/W2095420325,"The global distribution of fluorocarbon-12 and fluorocarbon-11 is used to establish a relatively fast interhemispheric exchange rate of 1 to 1.2 years. Atmospheric residence times of 65 to 70 years for fluorocarbon-12 and 40 to 45 years for fluorocarbon-l1 best fit the observational data. These residence times rule out the possibility of any significant missing sinks that may prevent these fluorocarbons from entering the stratosphere. Atmospheric measurements of methyl chloroform support an 8-to 10-year residence time and suggest global average hydroxyl radical (HO) concentrations of 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) molecules per cubic centimeter. These are a factor of 5 lower than predicted by models. Additionally, methyl chloroform global distribution supports Southern Hemispheric HO levels that are a factor of 1.5 or more larger than the Northern Hemispheric values. The long residence time and the rapid growth of methyl chloroform cause it to be a potentially significant depleter of stratospheric ozone. The oceanic sink for atmospheric carbon tetrachloride is about half as important as the stratospheric sink. A major source of methyl chloride (3 x 10(12)grams per year), sufficient to account for nearly all the atmospheric methyl chloride, has been identified in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1988039360,Training pigeons with random presentations of a tone and food proactively interferes with the acquisition of autoshaped keypecking to a lighted key. The interference effect is context-specific (observed only when testing for autoshaping occurs in the initial training environment). An interpretation based on blocking by background cues is suggested by the data.
https://openalex.org/W2001263818,"On the basis of an analysis of historic worldwide emissions and removal mechanisms for carbon tetrachloride, a possible precursor for stratospheric ozone destruction, it has been demonstrated that the present atmospheric loading and distribution of carbon tetrachloride is primarily attributable to man-made emissions and no natural sources need be invoked to explain its presence in the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2057997241,"Changes in the ground elevation observed before and immediately after the 1971 San Fernando, California, earthquake are consistent with a theoretical model in which fault zone rocks are strain-softening after peak stress. The model implies that the slip rate of the fault increased to about 0.1 meter per year near the focus before the earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2085191054,"Nitrate labeled with (13)N ((13)NO(3)(-)) was produced in a cyclotron by the (16)O(p, alpha)(13)N reaction with protons having energies of 14.5 million electron volts. The (13)NO(3)(-) was used as a tracer for direct quantitative measurements of denitrification rates in soils from flooded rice fields. The (13)N technique provides a new tracer method for the measurement of denitrification rates in natural systems over short time intervals, without changing the concentration of NO(3)(-)in the system."
https://openalex.org/W2085824183,The Kafue lechwe (Kobus leche kafuensis) exhibits lekking behavior in which a number of males occupy small territories clustered together in discrete areas where females go for mating. Similar behavior in antelope is known only in the Uganda kob (Kobus kob thomasi). Lechwe lekking occurs only during a main rutting season although some breeding occurs throughout the year.

https://openalex.org/W2092706527,"The recent confirmation of the discovery of a satellite of the minor planet 532 Herculina indicates that other similar anomalous sightings are probably also due to satellites, which must therefore be numerous and commonplace. There are now 23 candidate satellites for eight minor planets, and no one of these minor planets occulting a star has failed to show evidence of at least one secondary event. Such companions are gravitationally stable but apparently have rapid tidal evolution rates."
https://openalex.org/W2027281197,"The lightcurves of the asteroids 49 Pales and 171 Ophelia bear a striking resemblance to those of eclipsing binary stars. This evidence suggests that these asteroids are binary objects. Asteroids belonging to the Themis dynamical family have unusual lightcurves, possibly due to satellite events; these unusual lightcurves suggest that multiple objects may be formed during the disruption of asteroids in collisional events."

https://openalex.org/W1992119655,"A microbially mediated carbon-nitrogen cycle involving a newly isolated facultatively methylotrophic pseudomonad is described. The new isolate utilizes formamide as its sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. Other organisms involved in the proposed cycle are cyanogenic plants; phytopathogenic fungi, which convert cyanogenic glycosides to formamide; and nitrifying microorganisms. This cycle may be quantitatively important in view of the large variety of cyanogenic plants known to exist."
https://openalex.org/W2006936934,"The average activity of xenon-133 within and at approximately 100 kilometers from Albany, New York, from April to July 1975 was 2.6 picocuries per cubic meter of air. The source was gaseous effluents from boiling water reactors located in the northeastern United States. Its 5.29-day half-life makes xenon-133 an appropriate isotope to observe for the study of regional and hemispheric dispersion of pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W2079477659,"Highly turbid bottom water at the margin of the Sohm Abyssal Plain was identified by its temperature, salinity, and oxygen content as originating upslope on the continental rise. The fact that the particulate concentrations were one to two orders of magnitude higher than are normally found in deep ocean waters suggests a turbidity current as the agent bringing this water downslope."

https://openalex.org/W2097037072,"A particle which bears every indication of being a charmed meson has been found in e/sup +/e/sup -/ collisions at SLAC. The particle has a mass of 1.865 GeV, a lifetime somewhat longer than the psi particles, and is neutral. Evidence for a second charmed meson produced in association with the first has also been found. According to theory, there should also be a charged charmed meson at about the same mass as the neutral particle and a second charged meson at about 2 GeV, neither of which has been found. The evidence presented thus far, however, lend credence to the charm model. (SDF)"
