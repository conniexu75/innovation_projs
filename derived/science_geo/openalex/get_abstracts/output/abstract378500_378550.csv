https://openalex.org/W2142805768,"Background Recent declines in honey bees for crop pollination threaten fruit, nut, vegetable and seed production in the United States. A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007–08 growing seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm). Conclusions/Significance The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined."

This, in combination with its biochemical and genetic tractability, has made Hfx. volcanii a key model organism, not only for the study of halophilicity, but also for archaeal biology in general.We report here the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Hfx. volcanii DS2, the type strain of this species. The genome contains a main 2.848 Mb chromosome, three smaller chromosomes pHV1, 3, 4 (85, 438, 636 kb, respectively) and the pHV2 plasmid (6.4 kb).The completed genome sequence, presented here, provides an invaluable tool for further in vivo and in vitro studies of Hfx. volcanii."

It is well established that hypoacetylation of histone proteins by histone deacetylases is involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency by repressing viral transcription. Although histone methylation is involved in the organization of chromatin domains and plays a central epigenetic role in gene expression, the role of histone methylation in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency has not been clarified. Here we present evidence that histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9) methyltransferase G9a is responsible for transcriptional repression of HIV-1 by promoting repressive dimethylation at H3K9 and for the maintenance of viral latency. We observed that G9a significantly inhibited basal, as well as, the induced HIV-1 gene expression by tumor necrosis factor-α or Tat. Mutant G9a, however, lacking the SET domain responsible for the catalytic activity of histone methyltransferase, did not show such an effect. When G9a expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA, HIV-1 replication was augmented from cells transiently transfected with a full-length HIV-1 clone. Moreover, a specific inhibitor of G9a, BIX01294, could reactivate expression of HIV-1 from latently infected cells such as ACH-2 and OM10.1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the presence of G9a and H3K9 dimethylation on nucleosome histones in the vicinity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter. These results suggest that G9a is responsible for the transcriptional quiescence of latent HIV-1 provirus and provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanism by which HIV-1 latency is maintained.

IntroductionIn eukaryotic cells, transcriptional activity of each gene is largely regulated at the epigenetic level, in which biochemical modifications of chromatin-associated proteins such as histones play critical roles (1Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar). The DNA-associated histones conform an octamer configuration containing two copies of each core histone protein including H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The N-terminal region of these histone proteins is unstructured and, thus, considered to be in a highly dynamic structure (3Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). Histone tails protrude out from the globular center of the nucleosome where they may interact with other nuclear factors (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 4Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tails are subjective to a variety of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (4Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar, 6Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J.

Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar). These modifications affect the affinity of other nuclear proteins in binding to the histone tail and, thus, regulate the nature of histone-protein complexes associated with each chromatin region. The ability of nuclear proteins to specifically associate with certain histone modifications is the basis of the histone code postulate (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). According to this idea, nuclear proteins appear to function in activating or inhibiting transcription or, similarly, serve to maintain a specific chromatin structure.Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1human immunodeficiency virus type 15-aza-CdR5-aza-2′-deoxycytidineDNMTDNA methyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseHMThistone methyltransferaseHP1heterochromatin protein 1SAHAsuberoylanilide hydroxamic acidSETSu(var)3-9 enhancer-of-zeste and trithoraxSuv39Hsuppressor of variegation 3-9 homologTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αLTRlong terminal repeatsiRNAshort interference RNACMVcytomegalovirusChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationMMTVmurine mammary tumor virusELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHTLV-1human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1. gene expression is the major determinant of viral replication leading to disease progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). After HIV-1 infection, integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA is incorporated into nucleosomes and the transcriptional activity of its long terminal repeat (LTR) is under the control of local nucleosomal structure (8Colin L. Van Lint C. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Marcello A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Verdin E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that epigenetic modifications of the nucleosomal structure (called “Nuc-1”) near the viral mRNA start site may play regulatory roles in induction of LTR-driven transcription and viral expression (10Verdin E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The compaction of HIV-1 proviral DNA and its permissiveness for viral transcription are directly dependent on histone post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and methylation (8Colin L. Van Lint C. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E.

These distinct modifications serve to recruit various regulatory protein complexes toward HIV-1 LTR and eventually up-regulate or down-regulate HIV-1 gene expression and viral replication. Activation of HIV-1 gene expression by cytokines and virally encoded transactivator Tat is also accompanied by histone acetylation, leading to loss or rearrangement of Nuc1 (8Colin L. Van Lint C. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Marcello A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Verdin E. J.

Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In contrast to productively infected cells, latently infected cells harbor the proviral HIV-1 genome integrated into the silent chromatin allowing persistence of transcriptionally inactive proviruses (8Colin L. Van Lint C. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Marcello A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although evidence has been accumulated to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in viral promoter activation, as described above, the identity of cellular chromatin modifiers and the biochemical mechanism involved in the repression of the HIV-1 promoter is still unclear.Previous studies have shown that the presence of histone deacetylases (HDACs) at the vicinity of the HIV LTR is correlated with transcriptional repression leading to viral latency (15Coull J.J. Romerio F. Sun J.M. Volker J.L. Galvin K.M. Davie J.R. Shi Y. Hansen U. Margolis D.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 16Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H.

HDAC1 mediates chromatin remodeling resulting in both LTR promoter activity and viral production repression. Negative transcription factors such as Ying Yang protein 1 (15Coull J.J. Romerio F. Sun J.M. Volker J.L. Galvin K.M. Davie J.R. Shi Y. Hansen U. Margolis D.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), p50 homodimer (16Williams S.A. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Verdin E. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and C-promoter binding factor (17Tyagi M. Karn J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have been shown to mediate HDAC1 recruitment to the LTR and, consequently, inhibit transcription from the viral promoter. We also reported that activator protein 4 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDAC molecules and is involved in the maintenance of viral latency (18Imai K. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12495-12505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Others observed that drugs that inhibit HDAC activity such as trichostatin A, butyric acid, and valproic acid, could effectively induce HIV transcription in latently infected cells (12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 13Sheridan P.L. Mayall T.P. Verdin E. Jones K.A.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that epigenetic silencing is involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 transcriptional latency.In addition to histone acetylation, histone Lys methylation also plays an epigenetic role in the organization of chromatin domains and the regulation of gene expression (6Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21Jenuwein T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3121-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Methylation of histones at Lys and Arg residues play both positive and negative roles in transcriptional regulation. For example, methylation of at Lys4 and Arg17 of histone H3 is generally associated with active genes, whereas methylation of H3 at Lys9 (H3K9me) and Lys27 (H3K27me) has been associated with inactive genes (21Jenuwein T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3121-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It was also noted that H3K9me exhibited more definitive transcriptional repression over H3K27me (21Jenuwein T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3121-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The repressive methylation of H3K9 has been detected at the promoter regions of many silenced genes, together with increased DNA methylation and reduced histone acetylation (23Baylin S.B. Ohm J.E.

Two recent reports (28Marban C. Suzanne S. Dequiedt F. de Walque S. Redel L. Van Lint C. Aunis D. Rohr O. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 29du Chéné I. Basyuk E.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the histone methyltransferase (HMT) Suppressor of variegation 3–9 Homolog (Suv39H) 1, which is primarily involved in Lys9 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3), is responsible for HIV-1 transcriptional silencing. Although H3K9 methylation is known to play a crucial role in chromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing, the molecular mechanism of H3K9 methylation and another HMT on HIV-1 gene repression has yet to be clarified.In addition to Suv39H1, there are at least four other mammalian H3K9 HMTs, including Suv39H2, a close relative of Suv39H1, G9a, G9a-like protein (GLP)/EuHMTase1, and SETDB1/ERG-associated protein with SET domain (ESET) (21Jenuwein T.

These proteins commonly contain a SET (Suv39, enhancer of zeste, trithorax) domain that is responsible for catalytic action (6Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J.

Among these HMTs, G9a is a key enzyme responsible for H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in mammals as disruption of the G9a gene resulted in a drastic decrease in H3K9 methylation primarily in the silenced region within euchromatin (30Tachibana M.

Interestingly, in vitro experiments revealed that G9a exhibited a 10–20-fold stronger HMT activity toward H3K9 compared with Suv39H1 (30Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar).In this study we investigated the role of G9a in HIV-1 gene expression. We demonstrate that G9a is responsible for the maintenance of chromatin-mediated HIV-1 silencing through histone modification of H3K9me2. Biological and therapeutic implications are discussed.DISCUSSIONThe ability of HIV-1 to establish latent infection is considered momentous for AIDS progression (8Colin L. Van Lint C. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Marcello A. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Elucidating the transcriptional silencing mechanism of HIV-1 provirus in latently infected cells is crucial in understanding the pathophysiological process of HIV-1 infection and to further develop novel therapies. Viral latency involves certain chromatin modifications, in particular those of histone proteins, leading to proviral quiescence. It is well established (15Coull J.J. Romerio F. Sun J.M. Volker J.L.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12495-12505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that proviral quiescence is crossly associated with HDAC recruitment to HIV-1 LTR. In addition, although H3K9 trimethylation is triggered by Suv39H1 and is known to be associated with gene silencing (6Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21Jenuwein T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3121-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), the role of histone methylation by G9a in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency, however, has not yet been elucidated. Because the extent of histone methylation by another HMT G9a is much greater that Suv39H1 (30Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), we explored the effect of H3K9me2 on the transcriptional activity of latent HIV-1 proviral chromatin. We found that G9a is overexpressed, HIV-1 gene expression was greatly suppressed, whereas G9a knockdown mediated by siRNA strikingly augmented HIV-1 transcription, thus, vital replication. Moreover, when cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 were treated with BIX01294, a specific inhibitor of G9a, H3K9 dimethylation was down-regulated and reactivated HIV-1 transcription and viral replication in the latently infected cells. These findings were confirmed by ChIP assays. These results suggest that G9a is responsible for the maintenance of transcriptional quiescence of latent HIV-1 provirus.Although accumulating evidence suggests that HDACs are critical regulators of HIV-1 latency, du Chéné et al.

However, by using a general HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A, HIV-1 promoter activity was stimulated nearly 40-fold indicating that HDAC-mediated repression of the HIV-1 promoter involves more than one HDAC species (29du Chéné I.

Considering the same authors observed that knockdown of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) γ, a heterochromatin packaging protein that specifically recognizes tri- or dimethylated histone H3, could stimulate HIV-1 transcription over 70-fold (29du Chéné I.

In contrast, Mateescu et al. (51Mateescu B. Bourachot B. Rachez C. Ogryzko V. Muchardt C. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported that H3K9 methylation and HP1β, but not HP1γ, were associated with latent HIV-1 proviral DNA upon ChIP analyses and that knockdown of HP1β reactivated latent HIV-1 gene expression, whereas HP1γ knockdown suppressed HIV-1 transcription. Thus, the effect of HP1 in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency is still controversial.Another HMT catalyst, G9a, primarily located at the silenced euchromatin (21Jenuwein T.

Thus, it is suggested that when the gene, such as HIV-1 provirus, is silenced by the recruitment of G9a and, subsequently, with dimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me2), which was then recognized by a heterochromatin protein complex containing HP1 and HDACs (33Shi Y.

https://openalex.org/W1971434116,"Obesity represents a state of chronic, low grade inflammation and is associated with infiltration of increased numbers of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Diet-induced obesity leads to an increase in non-inflammatory M1-like ATMs displaying the CD11c surface marker. We assessed the function of CD11c-positive ATMs when insulin resistant high fat diet (HFD) mice become insulin-sensitive after switching from HFD to normal chow (NC). HFD mice rapidly become insulin-sensitive in all major insulin-target tissues, including muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, after the diet switch. In adipose tissue the CD11c-positive macrophages remain constant in number despite the presence of insulin sensitivity, but these macrophages now assume a new phenotype in which they no longer exhibit increased inflammatory pathway markers. Adipose tissue markers of apoptosis and necrosis were elevated on HFD and remain high after the HFD --> NC diet switch. Furthermore, ATM accumulation preceded detectable adipocyte necrosis at the early phase of HFD. Together, these results indicate that 1) CD11c-positive M1-like ATMs can exhibit phenotypic plasticity and that the polarization of these cells between inflammatory and non-inflammatory states is well correlated to the presence of absence of insulin resistance, and 2) adipocyte necrosis and apoptosis can be dissociated from ATM accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2071668615,"Little is known about the rate at which protein turnover occurs in living tendon and whether the rate differs between tendons with different physiological roles. In this study, we have quantified the racemization of aspartic acid to calculate the age of the collagenous and non-collagenous components of the high strain injury-prone superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and low strain rarely injured common digital extensor tendon (CDET) in a group of horses with a wide age range. In addition, the turnover of collagen was assessed indirectly by measuring the levels of collagen degradation markers (collagenase-generated neoepitope and cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen). The fractional increase in D-Asp was similar (p = 0.7) in the SDFT (5.87 x 10(-4)/year) and CDET (5.82 x 10(-4)/year) tissue, and D/L-Asp ratios showed a good correlation with pentosidine levels. We calculated a mean (+/-S.E.) collagen half-life of 197.53 (+/-18.23) years for the SDFT, which increased significantly with horse age (p = 0.03) and was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that for the CDET (34.03 (+/-3.39) years). Using similar calculations, the half-life of non-collagenous protein was 2.18 (+/-0.41) years in the SDFT and was significantly (p = 0.04) lower than the value of 3.51 (+/-0.51) years for the CDET. Collagen degradation markers were higher in the CDET and suggested an accumulation of partially degraded collagen within the matrix with aging in the SDFT. We propose that increased susceptibility to injury in older individuals results from an inability to remove partially degraded collagen from the matrix leading to reduced mechanical competence."
https://openalex.org/W2052316443,"The Yellowstone caldera contains the most numerous and diverse geothermal systems on Earth, yielding an extensive array of unique high-temperature environments that host a variety of deeply-rooted and understudied Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. The combination of extreme temperature and chemical conditions encountered in geothermal environments often results in considerably less microbial diversity than other terrestrial habitats and offers a tremendous opportunity for studying the structure and function of indigenous microbial communities and for establishing linkages between putative metabolisms and element cycling. Metagenome sequence (14-15,000 Sanger reads per site) was obtained for five high-temperature (>65 degrees C) chemotrophic microbial communities sampled from geothermal springs (or pools) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) that exhibit a wide range in geochemistry including pH, dissolved sulfide, dissolved oxygen and ferrous iron. Metagenome data revealed significant differences in the predominant phyla associated with each of these geochemical environments. Novel members of the Sulfolobales are dominant in low pH environments, while other Crenarchaeota including distantly-related Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales populations dominate in suboxic sulfidic sediments. Several novel archaeal groups are well represented in an acidic (pH 3) Fe-oxyhydroxide mat, where a higher O2 influx is accompanied with an increase in archaeal diversity. The presence or absence of genes and pathways important in S oxidation-reduction, H2-oxidation, and aerobic respiration (terminal oxidation) provide insight regarding the metabolic strategies of indigenous organisms present in geothermal systems. Multiple-pathway and protein-specific functional analysis of metagenome sequence data corroborated results from phylogenetic analyses and clearly demonstrate major differences in metabolic potential across sites. The distribution of functional genes involved in electron transport is consistent with the hypothesis that geochemical parameters (e.g., pH, sulfide, Fe, O2) control microbial community structure and function in YNP geothermal springs."
https://openalex.org/W2058613034,"Structural and functional analyses of nucleosomes containing histone variant H2A.Z have drawn a lot of interest over the past few years. Important work in budding yeast has shown that H2A.Z (Htz1)-containing nucleosomes are specifically located on the promoter regions of genes, creating a specific chromatin structure that is poised for disassembly during transcription activation. The SWR1 complex is responsible for incorporation of Htz1 into nucleosomes through ATP-dependent exchange of canonical H2A-H2B dimers for Htz1-H2B dimers. Interestingly, the yeast SWR1 complex is functionally linked to the NuA4 acetyltransferase complex in vivo. NuA4 and SWR1 are physically associated in higher eukaryotes as they are homologous to the TIP60/p400 complex, which encompasses both histone acetyltransferase (Tip60) and histone exchange (p400/Domino) activities. Here we present work investigating the impact of NuA4-dependent acetylation on SWR1-driven incorporation of H2A.Z into chromatin. Using in vitro histone exchange assays with native chromatin, we demonstrate that prior chromatin acetylation by NuA4 greatly stimulates the exchange of H2A for H2A.Z. Interestingly, we find that acetylation of H2A or H4 N-terminal tails by NuA4 can independently stimulate SWR1 activity. Accordingly, we demonstrate that mutations of H4 or H2A N-terminal lysine residues have similar effects on H2A.Z incorporation in vivo, and cells carrying mutations in both tails are nonviable. Finally, depletion experiments indicate that the bromodomain-containing protein Bdf1 is important for NuA4-dependent stimulation of SWR1. These results provide important mechanistic insight into the functional cross-talk between chromatin acetylation and ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2A variants."
https://openalex.org/W2068125862,"Troubled sleep is a commonly cited consequence of adolescent drug use, but it has rarely been studied as a cause. Nor have there been any studies of the extent to which sleep behavior can spread in social networks from person to person to person. Here we map the social networks of 8,349 adolescents in order to study how sleep behavior spreads, how drug use behavior spreads, and how a friend's sleep behavior influences one's own drug use. We find clusters of poor sleep behavior and drug use that extend up to four degrees of separation (to one's friends' friends' friends' friends) in the social network. Prospective regression models show that being central in the network negatively influences future sleep outcomes, but not vice versa. Moreover, if a friend sleeps ≤7 hours, it increases the likelihood a person sleeps ≤7 hours by 11%. If a friend uses marijuana, it increases the likelihood of marijuana use by 110%. Finally, the likelihood that an individual uses drugs increases by 19% when a friend sleeps ≤7 hours, and a mediation analysis shows that 20% of this effect results from the spread of sleep behavior from one person to another. This is the first study to suggest that the spread of one behavior in social networks influences the spread of another. The results indicate that interventions should focus on healthy sleep to prevent drug use and targeting specific individuals may improve outcomes across the entire social network."
https://openalex.org/W2001847316,"The AKT/PKB kinase is a key signaling component of one of the most frequently activated pathways in cancer and is a major target of cancer drug development. Most studies have focused on its activation by Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) mediated Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) activation or loss of Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN). We have uncovered that growth factors binding to RTKs lead to activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1 (also known as ACK or TNK2), which directly phosphorylates AKT at an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine 176 in the kinase domain. Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT localizes to the plasma membrane and promotes Thr308/Ser473-phosphorylation leading to AKT activation. Mice expressing activated Ack1 specifically in the prostate exhibit AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and develop murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPINs). Further, expression levels of Tyr176-phosphorylated-AKT and Tyr284-phosphorylated-Ack1 were positively correlated with the severity of disease progression, and inversely correlated with the survival of breast cancer patients. Thus, RTK/Ack1/AKT pathway provides a novel target for drug discovery."

We gathered data from a culling program of yellow-legged gulls killed by two methods: by the use of raptors or by shooting at random. We compared both data sets to assess whether birds of prey killed randomly or by relying on specific individual features of the prey. We carried out a meticulous post-mortem examination of individuals, and analysing multiple prey characteristics simultaneously we show that raptors did not hunt randomly, but rather preferentially predate on juveniles, sick gulls, and individuals with poor muscle condition. Strikingly, gulls with an unusually good muscle condition were also predated more than expected, supporting the mass-dependent predation risk theory. This article provides a reliable example of how natural selection may operate in the wild and proves that predators mainly prey on substandard individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2056045775,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone produced by fat and the liver that plays an important role in lipid metabolism. FGF21 expression is induced by peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor alpha in response to physiological conditions requiring increased fatty acid oxidation. Retinoic acid receptor-related receptor alpha (RORalpha) is another nuclear receptor that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism as well as in regulation of the circadian rhythm. In this study we demonstrate that RORalpha directly regulates the expression and secretion of FGF21. A canonical ROR response element was identified in the proximal promoter of the FGF21 gene and shown to exhibit functional activity. Overexpression of RORalpha in HepG2 cells resulted in increased expression and secretion of FGF21. Suppression of RORalpha expression caused a decrease in FGF21 expression and secretion, suggesting that RORalpha contributes to the basal expression of FGF21. These data suggest that one mechanism by which RORalpha regulates lipid metabolism may be by modulation of FGF21 secretion. Furthermore, this study identifies a clear link between RORalpha, a key regulator of the mammalian clock, and FGF21, an important hormone regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis."

PS-341 (also called Bortezomib or Velcade) is the first proteasome inhibitor approved for newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma and is currently being tested in many clinical trials against other types of cancers. One proposed mechanism by which PS-341 exerts its anticancer effect is inactivation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through prevention of IκBα degradation. In this study, we show that PS-341 at concentrations that effectively inhibited the growth of human cancer cells, instead of increasing IκBα stability, paradoxically induced IκBα degradation. As a result, PS-341 facilitated p65 nuclear translocation and increased NF-κB activity. Moreover, IκBα degradation by PS-341 occurred early before induction of apoptosis and could not be inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor or caspase-8 silencing; however, it could be prevented with calpain inhibitors, calcium-chelating agents, calpain knockdown, or calpastatin overexpression. In agreement, PS-341 increased calpain activity. These data together indicate that PS-341 induces a calpain-mediated IκBα degradation independent of caspases.

It is well known that IκBα ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome leading to nuclear translocation of p65 and an increase in NF-κB DNA binding are the primary mechanisms of NF-κB activation in cells upon stimulation (9Aggarwal B.B.

PS-341 either as a single drug or in combination with other agents has been demonstrated to be active in inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells in vitro and in inhibiting the growth of lung tumors in animal models (6Schenkein D.P. Clin. Lung Cancer. 2005; 7: S49-S55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Scagliotti G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2006; 58: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To date, PS-341 is the only proteasome inhibitor to be evaluated in clinical trials against lung cancer and to show activity when used both as a single agent and in combination regimens (7Scagliotti G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2006; 58: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which PS-341 induces apoptosis or growth arrest in lung cancer, particularly the role of NF-κB in these events, remain unclear. Therefore, we have been interested in studying how PS-341 induces apoptosis in human cancer cells, particularly lung cancer cells. This study particularly focused on the role of NF-κB inhibition in PS-341-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. Unexpectedly, we found that PS-341, instead of preventing IκBα degradation, induces calpain-dependent IκBα degradation in human lung cancer cells and other types of cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that PS-341-induced IκBα degradation results in NF-κB activation and impacts cell responses to PS-341-induced apoptosis. Thus, this study suggests a novel mechanism underlying PS-341-mediated biological functions and a novel strategy to enhance the anticancer efficacy of PS-341.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). PS-341 as a proteasome inhibitor theoretically should stabilize IκBα protein through inhibition of proteasome activity. When examining the effects of PS-341 on IκBα degradation in two human lung cancer cell lines, we surprisingly found that PS-341 decreased IκBα levels while increasing p-IκBα levels in a time-dependent fashion. In H157 cells, PS-341 substantially increased p-IκBα levels at 1 h followed by a great decrease in IκBα levels after 2 h. In H460 cells, a drastic p-IκBα increase was accompanied by a substantial reduction of IκBα levels after a 2-h treatment. In both cell lines, the IκBα reduction was sustained up to 12 h (Fig. 1A). By measuring the 20 S proteasome activity, we found that PS-341, under the same experimental conditions, effectively inhibited the 20 S proteasome activity starting from 0.5 h post-treatment in both tested cell lines (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we examined the effects of different concentrations of PS-341 on modulation of IκBα levels. As presented in Fig. 1C, PS-341 at all the tested concentrations (i.e. 25–1000 nm) decreased IκBα levels in both cell lines albeit without an apparent dose-dependent relationship in H157 cells. Accordingly, we detected increased levels of p-IκBα in both cell lines. In the other two lung cancer cell lines, PS-341 also effectively reduced the levels of IκBα (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we examined the effects of PS-341 on IκBα degradation in other types of solid tumor cell lines, including prostate (DU145), cervical (HeLa), breast (MCF-7), and head and neck cancer (SqCC/Y1), to determine whether IκBα reduction by PS-341 is a common phenomenon. In agreement with the findings in lung cancer cell lines, PS-341 at both low (50 nm) and high (1000 nm) concentrations decreased IκBα levels while increasing p-IκBα levels in all of the tested cell lines (Fig. 2A). Similar results were also obtained in several myeloma (U226, B226, and RPM/8226) cell lines (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Induction of IκBα degradation by PS-341 in other types of cancer cells lines (A and B) and by other proteasome inhibitors in human lung cancer cells (C). A, given cell lines were treated with low (50 nm) or high (1000 nm) concentrations of PS-341 for 10 h. B, given cell lines were treated with 50 nm PS-341 for 8 h. C, given cell lines were treated with the indicated concentrations of MG132, epoxomycin (EPO), or ALLN for 8 h. After the aforementioned treatments, the cells were then subjected to preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis. ΔIκBα, cleaved IκBα; LE, longer exposure; CF, cleaved fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, we determined whether other proteasome inhibitors exerted similar effects as PS-341 in modulation of IκBα levels. We used three proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomycin, and ALLN in this experiment and found that all these agents increased p-IκBα levels and decreased IκBα levels in both H157 and H460 cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, it appears that reduction of IκBα levels is a common phenomenon for proteasome inhibitors. We noted that a short form of a protein band could be detected in the Western blot analysis for IκBα from cells exposed to either PS-341 (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2, A and B) or other proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 2C). This short form of protein appeared or was increased as the IκBα levels were decreased. Given that IκBα can be cleaved by a calpain-dependent mechanism (19Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Schaecher K. Goust J.M. Banik N.L. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is very likely that this short form of protein is a cleaved form of IκBα. Thus, it appears that inhibition of proteasome with either PS-341 or other inhibitors reduced IκBα through promotion of its cleavage. We also examined the effects of cisplatin and docetaxel, two cancer chemotherapeutic agents, on IκBα levels in our cell systems in comparison with PS-341. Under the tested conditions, we found that only PS-341, but not cisplatin and docetaxel, increased p-IκBα levels and decreased IκBα levels with increased levels of cleaved fragment (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that IκBα degradation is unique to PS-341 treatment. IκBα has been shown to be degraded through proteasome-independent mechanisms (e.g. caspase or calpain protease) (19Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Schaecher K. Goust J.M. Banik N.L. Neurochem.

Vandenabeele P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In our study, we noted that cleavage of PARP, a hallmark of apoptosis, was detected only at 8 h after PS-341 treatment, which was far later than IκBα reduction (after 1 h) (Fig. 1A). Moreover, strong cleavage of IκBα was detected in DU145 and MCF-7 cells, in which PARP cleavage was minimally detected or not detected, whereas relatively weak IκBα cleavage was detected in 293FT, HeLa, and SqCC/Y1 cells in which PARP was strongly cleaved (Fig. 2A). These results together suggest that the observed IκBα cleavage is unlikely due to caspase activation. Indeed, in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, which at the tested concentration abolished PS-341-induced caspase-3 activation (supplemental Fig. S2), PS-341 still effectively induced IκBα reduction in both H157 and H460 cells (Fig. 3A). A previous study suggested that caspase-8 is involved in IκBα cleavage (23Calvaruso G. Giuliano M. Portanova P. De Blasio A. Vento R. Tesoriere G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 287: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, we also specifically addressed whether caspase-8 is involved in mediating PS-341-induced IκBα degradation through inactivating caspase-8 by knocking down caspase-8 expression. As presented in Fig. 3A (lower panel), knockdown of caspase-8 failed to prevent PS-341-induced IκBα reduction, indicating that caspase 8 is not involved in IκBα degradation induced by PS-341. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that PS-341 induces a caspase-independent IκBα proteolysis. In addition, we determined whether the trypsin-like protease and cysteine protease inhibitor, leupeptin, could prevent PS-341-induced IκBα degradation. As presented in Fig. 3A, PS-341-induced IκBα reduction could not be prevented by leupeptin in either H157 or H460 cells, indicating that PS-341 decreases IκBα levels independent of leupeptin-sensitive proteases as well. Finally, we investigated whether PS-341 induces IκBα degradation through a calpain-mediated mechanism. To this end, we first examined whether the presence of calpain inhibitors abolished the ability of PS-341 to induce IκBα degradation. As presented in Fig. 3B, the presence of either EST or PD150506 prevented IκBα from reduction induced by PS-341 in both H157 and H460 cells. In agreement, another calpain inhibitor calpeptin inhibited PS-341-induced IκBα reduction in H460 cells as well. Furthermore, we silenced the expression of the calpain regulatory subunit, which is a common regulatory subunit for both μ-calpain (calpain 1) and m-calpain (calpain 2) (24Saez M.E. Ramirez-Lorca R. Moron F.J. Ruiz A. Drug Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and we examined its effect on PS-341-induced IκBα degradation. We assumed that knockdown of the calpain regulatory subunit would inhibit both μ-calpain and m-calpain activity. In agreement with the effects of the calpain inhibitors, as discussed above, knockdown of calpain regulatory subunit abolished the ability of PS-341 to reduce IκBα levels (Fig. 3C). These results clearly indicate that PS-341 induces calpain-dependent IκBα proteolysis. It is known that calpains are calcium-dependent cysteine proteases (24Saez M.E. Ramirez-Lorca R. Moron F.J. Ruiz A. Drug Discov. Today. 2006; 11: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we further looked at the impact of calcium depletion on PS-341-induced IκBα degradation. The presence of the calcium-chelating agent BAPTA or EGTA alone in part prevented IκBα reduction by PS-341; however, the co-presence of both EGTA and BAPTA abolished the ability of PS-341 to decrease IκBα levels (Fig. 3D). These results again support the critical role of calpains in mediating PS-341-induced IκBα degradation. Moreover, we determined whether PS-341 indeed increases calpain activity. As presented in Fig. 4, A and B, PS-341 significantly increased the proteolytic hydrolysis of the calpain-specific fluorogenic substrate, t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethylcoumarin, exhibiting increased fluorescence. These results indicate that PS-341 increases intracellular calpain activity. In the presence of the calpain inhibitor PD150606, PS-341 did not increase calpain activity (i.e. fluorescence intensity) (Fig. 4C), indicating the specificity of the assay for calpain activity. This result provides another piece of evidence supporting involvement of calpain in PS-341-induced IκBα degradation. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying proteasome inhibition-induced calpain activation, we further examined whether PS-341 modulates the levels of calpastatin, a well known endogenous calpain inhibitor (25Wendt A. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), because proteasome inhibition was reported to reduce calpastatin levels (26Delobel P. Leroy O. Hamdane M. Sambo A.V. Delacourte A. Buée L. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In Western blotting, we detected multiple sizes (e.g. ∼110, 70, and 40 kDa) of calpastatin, which are identical to published observations (27Grynspan F. Griffin W.B. Mohan P.S. Shea T.B. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nadimpalli R. Nath R. Mohan P. Nixon R.A. Talanian R.V. Keegan M. Herzog L. Allen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). siRNA-mediated silencing of calpastatin substantially reduced the levels of these proteins, indicating that they are all specific calpastatin proteins. Meanwhile, IκBα levels were drastically reduced in calpastatin-silenced cells (Fig. 5A). PS-341 treatment decreased the levels of calpastatin accompanied by an increase in p-IκBα levels and reduction of IκBα in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Enforced expression of ectopic calpastatin increased basal levels of IκBα and prevented IκBα from degradation by PS-341 (Fig. 5C). Collectively, these results indicate that calpastatin inhibition is involved in mediating IκBα proteolysis by PS-341. Given that inhibition of the proteasome with different proteasome inhibitors increases p-IκBα levels, we then asked whether IκBα phosphorylation is required for proteasome inhibition-initiated IκBα degradation. To address this issue, we took advantage of SRIκBα, which carries serine-to-alanine mutations at residues 32 and 36 and thus cannot be phosphorylated at Ser-32 and Ser-36. We first infected two lung cancer cell lines H460 and H157 with Ad-SRIκBα and then treated cells with either PS-341 or MG132 to determine whether PS-341 or MG132 could still induce SRIκBα degradation. For up to 12 h of treatment, neither PS-341 nor MG132 decreased the levels of SRIκBα; instead, both agents increased the levels of SRIκBα (Fig. 6A). Accordingly, we noted that the endogenous IκBα levels were not reduced or only slightly reduced (Fig. 6A). Thus, these results clearly indicate that IκBα phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36 is required for proteasome inhibition-initiated IκBα degradation. Since IκBα degradation is an essential step for p65 nuclear translocation and subsequent NF-κB activation (9Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 21Hu X. Cytokine. 2003; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we then questioned whether IκBα reduction by PS-341 resulted in NF-κB activation. To this end, we analyzed p65 localization in cells treated with PS-341 using immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Fig. 6B, we primarily detected p65 staining in the cytoplasm in DMSO-treated H460 or H157 cells. However, a strong nuclear staining of p65 was detected in PS-341-treated H460 or H157 cells, indicating that PS-341 induces p65 nuclear translocation in these cell lines. Moreover, we examined NF-κB activity in both H460 and H157 cell lines treated with PS-341 and found that PS-341 increased NF-κB luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). c-FLIP, survivin, and COX-2 are NF-κB-regulated genes (9Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 29Kawakami H. Tomita M. Matsuda T. Ohta T. Tanaka Y. Fujii M. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Mori N. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PS-341 increased the levels of these proteins; however, the effects of PS-341 on increasing the levels of these proteins were abolished or attenuated in cells infected with Ad-SRIκBα (supplemental Fig. S3). These results clearly indicate that PS-341 modulates the expression of these proteins through an IκBα degradation- or NF-κB activation-dependent mechanism. Taken together with the above findings, we conclude that PS-341 increases NF-κB activity. Moreover, we further analyzed the effects of PS-341 on p65 nuclear translocation in more cancer cell lines. Consistently, PS-341 induces p65 nuclear translocation in every tested cell line (supplemental Fig. S4). These data again support the notion that PS-341 activates NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB is generally associated with apoptosis resistance, although it can be pro-apoptotic under certain conditions (8Karin M. Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar, 9Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 22Lamkanfi M.

Therefore, we investigated the impact of IκBα degradation on PS-341-induced apoptosis. To do this, we compared the effects of PS-341 on cell survival and apoptosis in the absence and presence of a calpain inhibitor. As presented in Fig. 7A, the calpain inhibitor PD150606 itself had a very weak effect on decreasing cell numbers. The combination of PS-341 with PD150606 was much more potent than PS-341 alone in decreasing cell numbers in both tested cell lines. Consistently, the combination of PS-341 with PD150606 caused the most apoptotic cells compared with PS-341 alone in both cell lines (Fig. 7B). For example, in H460 cells, PS-341 alone induced 13% apoptosis; however, the combination of PS-341 and PD150606 caused more than 40% apoptosis (Fig. 7B). Thus, it is clear that the presence of PD150606 substantially enhances the effect of PS-341 on induction of apoptosis, implying that inhibition of calpain activation may augment the anticancer activity of PS-341. Although inhibition of IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation is a putative mechanism for action of PS-341, no study has been done to demonstrate this mechanism in lung cancer cells. Our efforts in this regard have generated surprising results that instead of inhibiting IκBα degradation PS-341 actually potently decreases IκBα levels and results in NF-κB activation. These findings are consistent with three previous studies demonstrating that PS-341 as well other proteasome inhibitors induce IκBα degradation and activate NF-κB in endometrial carcinoma cell lines (33Dolcet X. Llobet D. Encinas M. Pallares J. Cabero A. Schoenenberger J.A. Comella J.X. Matias-Guiu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22118-22130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the HepG2 liver cancer cell line (23Calvaruso G. Giuliano M. Portanova P. De Blasio A. Vento R. Tesoriere G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 287: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and multiple myeloma cells (34Hideshima T. Ikeda H. Chauhan D. Okawa Y. Raje N. Podar K. Mitsiades C. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Carrasco R.D. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2009; 114: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We also found that PS-341 decreased IκBα levels in other types of cancer cell lines, including myeloma, prostate, cervical, breast, and head and neck cancer cells. One previous study shows that PS-341 indeed increases IκBα levels in human glioblastoma multiforme cells (35Yin D. Zhou H. Kumagai T. Liu G. Ong J.M. Black K.L. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it seems that induction of IκBα degradation by PS-341 is likely to be a common event in many types of cancer cells. It is known that activated IκB kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylates IκBα on serines 32 and 36, leading to subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα. Our results clearly show that PS-341 induces IκBα phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36 accompanied with reduction of IκBα levels. Moreover, we found that PS-341 failed to induce degradation of the IκBα mutant, SR-IκBα, in which serines 32 and 36 are mutated to alanines; rather, it increased the levels of SR-IκBα (Fig. 6A). Thus, we conclude that PS-341 induces phosphorylation-dependent IκBα degradation. This finding is in agreement with previous work demonstrating that PS-341 and other proteasome inhibitors induce IKK-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in other types of cancer cell lines through detection of phosphorylated IKKs and inhibition of IKKs with small molecules or siRNA (33Dolcet X. Llobet D. Encinas M. Pallares J. Cabero A. Schoenenberger J.A. Comella J.X. Matias-Guiu X. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We assume that PS-341 may induce an IKK-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in lung cancer cells as well. Before this study, it was unclear why PS-341 as a proteasome inhibitor induces IκBα degradation. It is worth mentioning that other proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 were also shown to induce IκBα degradation in colon cancer (36Németh Z.H. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Deitch E.A. Szabó C. Vizi E.S. Haskó G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and endometrial carcinoma cells (33Dolcet X. Llobet D. Encinas M. Pallares J. Cabero A. Schoenenberger J.A.

Our own data demonstrate that the proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomycin, and ALLN increase IκBα phosphorylation and decrease IκBα levels in human lung cancer cells as well. Thus, it is likely that proteasome inhibition is associated with PS-341-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. IκBα can also be degraded by proteases (e.g. calpain) or caspases (21Hu X. Cytokine. 2003; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Lamkanfi M. Declercq W. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in addition to proteasome. A recent study shows that PS-341 induces IκBα degradation involving caspase-8 in HepG2 cells (23Calvaruso G. Giuliano M. Portanova P. De Blasio A. Vento R. Tesoriere G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 287: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates that PS-341 induces IκBα degradation or proteolysis independent of caspase activation, including caspase-8 activation based on the following facts. First, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation apparently occurred much earlier (at 2 h) than PARP cleavage (at 8 h) (Fig. 1A). Second, strong IκBα cleavage occurred in the cell lines where PARP cleavage was not detected or only minimally detected (Fig. 2A). Third, the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK failed to prevent PS-341-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 3A). Finally, inactivation of caspase-8 by siRNA-mediated knockdown of caspase-8 did not inhibit PS-341-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 3A, lower panel). It has been documented that IκBα can undergo calpain-mediated proteolysis, which is parallel to the ubiquitination-proteasome mechanism (19Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Calpain-mediated IκBα proteolysis generates an ∼30-kDa cleaved IκBα intermediate in a previous report (19Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In our study, we also detected an ∼30-kDa cleaved band of IκBα in cells exposed to PS-341 or other proteasome inhibitors (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The presence of the calpain inhibitor EST, calpeptin, or PD150606 abolished the ability of PS-341 to induce IκBα degradation (Fig. 3B). In addition, knockdown of the calpain regulatory subunit with a calpain regulatory siRNA abolished the ability of PS-341 to decrease IκBα levels (Fig. 3C). Consistently, the calcium chelators EGTA and BAPTA inhibited PS-341-induced IκBα degradation as well (Fig. 3D) because calpains are calcium-dependent proteases. Moreover, we detected increased calpain activity in cells exposed to PS-341 (Fig. 4). Together, these results clearly indicate that PS-341 induces IκBα proteolysis through a calpain-dependent mechanism. Thus, it is likely that inhibition of the proteasome may favor calpain activation, leading to IκBα degradation. It is well known that calpain activity is negatively regulated by its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (25Wendt A. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that proteasome inhibition induced calpastatin degradation, leading to calpain activation and subsequent Tau protein degradation in neuroblastoma cells (26Delobel P. Leroy O. Hamdane M. Sambo A.V. Delacourte A. Buée L. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that knockdown of calpastatin substantially decreased IκBα levels, further supporting the notion that calpain can cause IκBα degradation. Importantly, PS-341 decreased the levels of calpastatin accompanied with IκBα degradation (Fig. 5B). Consistently, overexpression of an exogenous calpastatin elevated basal IκBα levels and prevented IκBα from degradation by PS-341 (Fig. 5C). Thus, it appears that proteasome inhibition down-regulates or inhibits calpastatin, leading to calpain activation and subsequent IκBα degradation. Because NF-κB regulates the expression of multiple anti-apoptotic genes, its activation is often associated with apoptosis resistance (9Aggarwal B.B.

Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Carrasco R.D. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2009; 114: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we have also shown that PS-341 induces p65 nuclear translocation and increases NF-κB activity (Fig. 5) in our cell systems. Moreover, PS-341 increased the expression of survivin, c-FLIP, and COX-2, all of which are NF-κB-regulated genes (9Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 29Kawakami H. Tomita M. Matsuda T. Ohta T. Tanaka Y. Fujii M. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Mori N. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Importantly, suppression of IκBα degradation by expressing SR-IκBα abrogated the increase of these proteins by PS-341 (supplemental Fig. S3), furthering the notion that PS-341 activates NF-κB in our cell systems. In endometrial carcinoma cells, NF-κB activation does not mediate cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors because neither IKKα nor IKKβ small hairpin RNA protected cells from death induced by these inhibitors (33Dolcet X. Llobet D. Encinas M. Pallares J. Cabero A. Schoenenberger J.A. Comella J.X. Matias-Guiu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22118-22130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In multiple myeloma cells, inhibition of IKKβ enhances PS-341-induced cytotoxicity (34Hideshima T. Ikeda H. Chauhan D. Okawa Y. Raje N. Podar K. Mitsiades C. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Carrasco R.D. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2009; 114: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In human lung cancer cells, we found that the presence of a calpain inhibitor (e.g. PD150606), which inhibits PS-341-induced IκBα degradation, substantially enhanced the effects of PS-341 on decreasing cell survival and inducing apoptosis (Fig. 7), implying that IκBα degradation consequently confers cell resistance to undergo apoptosis, presumably through activation of NF-κB. Thus, our findings in this regard may suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing the anticancer activity of PS-341 by preventing calpain activation. In summary, we report a novel finding that PS-341 induces calpain-dependent IκBα degradation in human lung cancer as well other types of cancer cells. As a result, PS-341 activates NF-κB, which can confer apoptotic resistance and counteract the apoptosis inducing activity of PS-341. Thus, prevention of calpain-dependent IκBα degradation will substantially augment the apoptosis inducing activity of PS-341. We are grateful to Dr. L. W. Chung for providing Ad-SRIκBα and to Dr. H.

https://openalex.org/W1977999433,"In the last decades, few mechanistically novel therapeutic agents have been developed to treat mental and neurodegenerative disorders. Numerous studies suggest that targeting BDNF and its TrkB receptor could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of brain disorders. However, the development of potent small ligands for the TrkB receptor has proven to be difficult. By using a peptidomimetic approach, we developed a highly potent and selective TrkB inhibitor, cyclotraxin-B, capable of altering TrkB-dependent molecular and physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity, neuronal differentiation and BDNF-induced neurotoxicity. Cyclotraxin-B allosterically alters the conformation of TrkB, which leads to the inhibition of both BDNF-dependent and -independent (basal) activities. Finally, systemic administration of cyclotraxin-B to mice results in TrkB inhibition in the brain with specific anxiolytic-like behavioral effects and no antidepressant-like activity. This study demonstrates that cyclotraxin-B might not only be a powerful tool to investigate the role of BDNF and TrkB in physiology and pathology, but also represents a lead compound for the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat brain disorders."

In the silkworm, more than 100 gene mutation systems are related to aberrant color patterns. The melanism (mln) is a rare body color mutant that exhibits an easily distinguishable phenotype in both larval and adult silkworms. By positional cloning, we identified the candidate gene of the mln locus, Bm-iAANAT, whose homologous gene (Dat) converts dopamine into N-acetyldopamine, a precursor for N-acetyldopamine sclerotin in Drosophila. In the mln mutant, two types of abnormal Bm-iAANAT transcripts were identified, whose expression levels are markedly lower than the wild type (WT). Moreover, dopamine content was approximately twice as high in the sclerified tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate) of the mutant as in WT, resulting in phenotypic differences between the two. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses showed that other genes involved in the melanin metabolism pathway were regulated by the aberrant Bm-iAANAT activity in mln mutant in different ways and degrees. We therefore propose that greater accumulation of dopamine results from the functional deficiency of Bm-iAANAT in the mutant, causing a darker pattern in the sclerified regions than in the WT.

More recently, there has been much interest among biologists in the molecular mechanisms underlying the great diversity of insect colors and color patterns. Melanin, the dark pigment found in melanophores, is an important class of insect pigments (2Wright T.R. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3Wittkopp P.J.

Dopa serves as the precursor of dopa melanin (which is black) and is converted to dopa melanin by the activities of the Yellow, Yellow-f 1 and Yellow-f 2 proteins (12Han Q. Fang J. Ding H. Johnson J.K. Christensen B.M. Li J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dopamine serves as the precursor of dopamine melanin (black or brown in color and a major pigment of the insect cuticle), the change being caused by the catalytic action of phenol oxidases (1True J.R.

Alternatively, dopamine can reversibly convert to N-β-alanyldopamine (NBAD, 3The abbreviations used are: NBADN-β-alanyldopamineEBONYN-β-alanyldopamine synthetaseAANATarylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferaseWTwild-typeSSRsimple sequence repeatRTreverse transcriptionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. yellowish) by NBAD synthetase (EBONY) and NBAD hydrolase. NBAD deposited in the cuticle of an insect causes a yellow coloration. Finally, a family of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferases (AANATs) convert dopamine into N-acetyldopamine, a precursor of the colorless N-acetyldopamine sclerotin (2Wright T.R. Adv.

In addition, the activities of AANAT and melatonin display day/night fluctuations in the head tissues of the silkworm (Bombyx mori) and in cockroach (Periplaneta americana) (18Itoh M.T. Hattori A.

Silkworm, B. mori, is an important economic insect and lepidopteran molecular model (22Goldsmith M.R. Shimada T. Abe H. Annu. Rev.

More than 100 of these are related to body color and body markings (23Lu C. Dai F. Xiang Z. Sci. Agric. Sin. 2003; 36: 968-975Google Scholar), and they are distributed over all of the silkworm linkage groups except the 27th and 28th. Therefore, silkworm provides an excellent model for studying the genetic and molecular mechanisms that generate varied pigment patterns. Recently, the candidate genes of some color pattern mutants such as ch, so (7Futahashi R. Sato J. Meng Y. Okamoto S. Daimon T. Yamamoto K. Suetsugu Y. Narukawa J. Takahashi H. Banno Y. Katsuma S.

Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have been cloned. However, the molecular bases of many other mutations are still unknown. The mln (melanism) is a rare body color mutant that exhibits a clearly recognizable phenotype both in larval and adult B. mori. It is regulated by a single recessive gene and has been mapped at 41.5 cM on the 18th linkage in the silkworm genetic linkage map. In the recessive homozygote of the mln mutant, the larval head, anal plate, thoracic legs, and sieve plates of the spiracles are black. In the adult, the body, wings, and integument are also black instead of the normal color pattern (Fig. 1). Excess melanin appears to accumulate in the mln mutant. However, the candidate gene responsible has not been identified previously. In the present study, we fine mapped the mln locus and identified the candidate gene responsible, Bm-iAANAT. In addition, we found differences between Dazao and Dazao-mln in their gene sequences and transcription levels of Bm-iAANTA and investigated the differences in their expression patterns of other key genes involved in the melanin metabolism pathway. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that the Bm-iAANAT gene plays an essential role in the pigment metabolism in silkworm and that the abnormal Bm-iAANAT is responsible for the mln mutant. The melanism mutant strain Dazao-mln (near isogenic line of mln), wild-type (WT) strain Dazao and C108 were obtained from the silkworm gene bank in Southwest University. The silkworms were reared on mulberry leaves under a photoperiod of 12 h/12 h light/dark at 25 °C during the experiments. Two silkworm strains, C108 (+mln/+mln) and Dazao-mln (mln/mln) were used for preliminary mapping. A single-pair cross between a female (C108) and a male (Daza-mln) produced the F1 offspring. For linkage analysis, 20 BC1F progeny (10 wild-type and 10 melanism offspring) from the cross (C108 × Dazao-mln) ♀ × Dazao-mln were used, although another backcross, Dazao-mln♀ × (C108 × Dazao-mln) was used for recombination analysis. SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers were obtained from the published SSRs linkage map (26Miao X.X. Xub S.J. Li M.H. Li M.W. Huang J.H. Dai F.Y. Marino S.W. Mills D.R. Zeng P. Mita K. Jia S.H.

Eugenics. 1944; 12: 172-175Crossref Google Scholar). Based on the results of the preliminary SSR mapping, we analyzed the upstream and downstream sequences close to the tightly linked SSR marker of the mln locus. This program requires the silkworm 9× assembly genome database (29Consortium I.S.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), BLAST (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), and primer 5.0. We used the predicted gene fragments as query sequences to search the NCBI database with the BLASTp program and found the homolog and ortholog genes that have been shown to be involved in the pigmentation pathway in other species. We then designed primers as new markers based on the genome sequences of the predicted candidate gene. The genome fragment of candidate gene that exhibited polymorphism between the parents was used for fine mapping. The primers are shown in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. The total RNAs were extracted from Dazao and Dazao-mln on day 4 of the 5th instar. The primers (supplemental Table 3) for the full-length cDNA of the candidate gene were designed according to the sequence in GenBank (21Tsugehara T. Iwai S. Fujiwara Y. Mita K. Takeda M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 147: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (Takara) and sequenced. To investigate the expression patterns, we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyze total RNAs isolated from the whole body of several developmental stages (from day 3 of the 4th instar larvae to eclosion of the adult). Total RNAs were purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and subjected to cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers and a Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten silkworm tissues were sampled on day 4 of the 5th instar larvae of Dazao, including the silk gland, midgut, malpighian tubule, fat body, testis, ovary, head, integument, hemocyte, and trachea and used to investigate the pattern of spatial expression. The primers designed for RT-PCR are shown in supplemental Tables 4. The BmActin3 gene was used as an internal control. The expression levels of the candidate gene in sclerified (anal plate, thoracic legs, and head) and less sclerified tissues (epidermis) of the Dazao larvae were detected using quantitative RT-PCR. We performed the quantitative RT-PCR using the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with a SYBR Premix EX Taq kit (Takara) to detect the expression levels of the Bm-iAANAT gene in both Dazao (WT) and Dazao-mln (mutant) at the same developmental stages and in the same sampled tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate). The quantitative RT-PCR primers used are shown in supplemental Tables 5. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (silkworm microarray probe ID: sw22934) was used as an internal control. Referring to the melanin metabolism pathway in D. melanogaster (2Wright T.R. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 127-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3Wittkopp P.J. Carroll S.B. Kopp A.

The sw22934 was used as an internal control. Dopamine was extracted from the strain-specific phenotype tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate: total quantity, 200 mg.) on day 2 of 4th instar mln and WT. The tissues were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 1.2 m HCl containing 5 mm ascorbic acid in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min and then added to 0.5 ml chloroform and shaken before further centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were analyzed by HPLC. Chromatography was performed on a Waters 1525 binary HPLC equipped with a Waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector and a SymmetryShield RP18 (5 μm, 4.6 × 150-mm) column. The flow velocity of the mobile phases (69.5 mm KH2PO4, 5.5 mm K2HPO4 (pH 5.8):methanol (Sigma; chromatography pure) 98:2) was 1 ml/min, isocratic elution. The column elution was monitored at 280 nm. The standard sample was dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma, supplemental Fig. 2). To determine the chromosomal location of the mln locus, we performed genetic linkage analysis. First, using the microsatellite (SSR) markers on the 18th linkage in the silkworm SSR molecular linkage map, we roughly mapped the mln mutation using 372 BC1M individuals. The preliminary mapping showed that the marker S1807 was tightly linked with the mln locus (Fig. 2). We analyzed the upstream and downstream sequences (∼300 kb on each side) of S1807 in the silkworm database (31Duan J. Li R. Cheng D. Fan W. Zha X. Cheng T. Wu Y. Wang J. Mita K. Xiang Z. Xia Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D453-D456Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Within ∼100 kb upstream of the S1807 marker, we found two genes (BGIBMGA008538 and BGIBMGA008539) encoding AANAT which plays an important role in the synthesis of N-acetyldopamine in the pigmentation pathway of D. melanogaster. We designed primer sets based on the sequences of the two genes to detect the genomes of Dazao-mln and C108. One pair of primers, named P3C, from BGIBMGA008538, displayed a smaller amplification product in Dazao-mln than in C108 and showed the same polymorphism between Dazao-mln and its recurrent parent, Dazao. We used P3C as a new marker for fine mapping. The result suggested that there was no recombination between P3C and the mln locus (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the sequences amplified by the primers of P3C are partly located on the exon of the BGIBMGA008538, which has been previously identified as Bm-iAANAT (GenBank accession number NM_001079654.1). Therefore, we concluded that the Bm-iAANAT gene was the candidate gene for the melanism (mln) mutant. Cloning and comparing the sequences of the P3C-amplified region in Dazao, C108, and Dazao-mln, we found that it was 410 bp and 506 bp in the Dazao-mln and wild-type strains (C108, Dazao), respectively. The mutation deleted 96 bp and inserted another 29-bp fragment compared with the WT (Fig. 3A). In addition, we cloned the complete Bm-iAANAT cDNA sequences of the WT and mln mutant. A significant amount of a 1460-bp fragment was amplified from the WT (Fig. 3B). Compared with the genome assembly data, it was apparent that Bm-iAANAT has 5 exons encoding 261 amino acids. However, two types of abnormal transcript, type 1 cDNA (1253 bp) and type 2 cDNA (1407 bp), were amplified in the Dazao-mln mutant (Fig. 3B). As shown schematically in Fig. 3C, the type 1 cDNA lacked almost the whole 4th exon except for the first 2 bp and causes a premature TAG stop codon not found in the WT. Type 2 lacked the last 67 bp of the 4th exon, and recruited a 15-bp length intron sequence. The termination codon of type 2 was located on the 3′-untranslated region of the normal transcript (Fig. 3C). Thus, type 1 and type 2 both encoded for potentially aberrant proteins and destroyed the acetyltransferase 1 domain compared with the WT (Fig. 3D). Temporal expression patterns of the Bm-iAANAT gene were detected in the whole body of Dazao during the developmental period from the 3rd day of the 4th instar larvae to eclosion of the adult (Fig. 4, A and B). The semi-RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of Bm-iAANAT fluctuated during the development period. It was expressed normally during the 3rd day of the 4th instar larvae (intermolt), turned off at the beginning of the fourth molting stage (from 0 to 16 h), and then reappeared in the postmolt stage (24 h later) (Fig. 4A). Relatively high expression levels were maintained during most of the 5th instar larval period, and no expression was detected at the commencement of the wandering stage. A sharp increase followed at the end of the wandering stage (W2.5 day), which is opposite to the change of a 20E titer at the same time (32Mizoguchi A. Dedos S.G. Fugo H. Kataoka H. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2002; 127: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The greatest expression appeared on the seventh (P7) and eighth (P8) day following pupation (Fig. 4B). To investigate the spatial expression patterns of the Bm-iAANAT gene, we also used semi-RT-PCR to analyze total RNA in samples of 10 silkworm tissues from 4th day 5th instar larvae of Dazao. The results showed that the Bm-iAANAT gene is expressed in the head, silk gland, and integument. The highest level of expression was found in the head. In other tissues, its expression was very low or nearly undetectable (Fig. 4C). To examine the relationship between the expression of Bm-iAANAT and the body regions where the mln strain exhibited a different color compared with the WT, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR analysis using cDNA prepared from the less sclerified epidermis and the more sclerified head, thoracic legs, and anal plate of 5th instar Dazao larvae. The Bm-iAANAT was found to be expressed at higher levels in sclerified tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate) than in less sclerified tissue (epidermis) (Fig. 4D). In other words, high expression of Bm-iAANAT correlated with the black-colored regions but not with the non—black-colored region in the mln mutant. We compared the expression of Bm-iAANAT between Dazao-mln and Dazao at several developmental stages, including the 4th day of the 5th instar larva (V4), the 2nd day of pupation (P2), and at the eclosion of the adult (M0), when Bm-iAANAT normally showed its highest activity. The amplified sequences were shared by the three types of Bm-iAANAT cDNA. The result of the semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the level of expression of the two transcripts in the mln mutant was lower than that of the normal transcript in Dazao (Fig. 5A). As a more rigorous test, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR analysis with the same materials and showed that the level of expression of normal Bm-iAANAT in WT is about 10–20 times higher than that of the two transcripts in the mln mutant (Fig. 5B). In addition, the expression level of Bm-iAANAT in Dazao was also higher than that in the mln mutant in the regions which exhibit obvious phenotypic differences between WT and mln (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate) (Fig. 5C). To test how other genes involved in the melanin metabolism pathway respond to Bm-iAANAT level changes, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR analysis to detect the expression levels of several genes (Pale, DdC, Yellow, and ebony) in the regions with different Dazao and Dazao-mln coloration (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate). The results show that expression of Pale, DdC, and Yellow in these regions were all higher in Dazao than in Dazao-mln, whereas the expression of ebony was lower in Dazao than in Dazao-mln, except in the head (Fig. 6A). In the adult moth, the expression of all four of the above genes was higher in Dazao than in Dazao-mln, the ratios of relative expression levels (Dazao-mln/Dazao) of DdC and ebony being 0.471 and 0.573, respectively (Fig. 6B). The result of a reversed phase HPLC revealed that the content of dopamine in the mln mutant (143.233 ± 11.821 μg/g) was ∼2 times higher than that in the WT (72.953 ± 2.022 μg/g) (Fig. 7). Therefore, we concluded that a greater accumulation of dopamine resulted from the functional deficiency of Bm-iAANAT in the mutant and that the excessive dopamine was converted into dopamine melanin, causing the darker color pattern of the sclerified regions in the mln mutant compared with the WT. In this study, we fine map the candidate gene of the mln mutant using SSR markers and material from the silkworm genome database. We confirmed the results using the Dazao and the near isogenic line Dazao-mln obtained by backcrossing to a Dazao strain for more than 20 generations. This provided a powerful combination of genetic material with which to map the candidate gene. In the fine mapping, we focused on the Bm-iAANAT gene. By cloning the transcripts of the WT (Dazao) and mln mutant (Dazao-mln), we found that two abnormal transcripts were present in the Dazao-mln compared with the WT (Dazao). The exact sequence change of Bm-iAANAT genes in the mutant strongly suggested that it would be responsible for the mln mutation. At the beginning of 4th molting stage, the titer of ecdysteroid (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E), the major active molting hormone, increased rapidly and reached a peak at about the 14th h and dropped sharply 20 h later, and then the 4th larval molting process was completed (33Kiguchi K. Agui N. J. Insect Physiol. 1981; 27: 805-812Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Suzuki Y. Matsuoka T. Iimura Y. Fujiwara H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of Bm-iAANAT seemed to be suppressed by the 20E in the same manner as has been found in Drosophila (35Rauschenbach I.Y. Adonyeva N.V. Alekseev A.A. Chentsova N.A. Gruntenko N.E. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2008; 178: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The situation was consistent with those of other melanin synthesis enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, Yellow, EBONY), which are known to be regulated by ecdysteroid titer during the molting process (4Hiruma K. Riddiford L.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2009; 39: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The expression of Bm-iAANAT reached a peak at the 7th (P7) and 8th (P8) day after pupation, when the moth cuticle and scales covering the wing and body were formed. Generally, the massively high expression levels of the Bm-iAANAT gene occurred once the new epidermis had formed and pigmentation and exocuticle secretion began. Furthermore, the spatial expression analysis revealed that Bm-iAANAT was expressed heavily in the sclerified tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate) where the black coloration occurs in the mln strain. We therefore concluded that the abundant Bm-iAANAT expression promotes accumulation of the NADA necessary for cuticle sclerotization and that the consumption of dopamine follows the same course as in Drosophila. In the mln mutant, the two types of abnormal Bm-iAANAT transcript could not code the functional enzyme, and the expression levels of Bm-iAANAT were much lower than that in Dazao (WT) (Fig. 5). Consequently, the excess dopamine could not be consumed in the sclerified tissues, producing the black pigment (dopamine melanin). This presumption was confirmed by measuring the dopamine levels, which were two times higher in the mln mutant than that in WT (Fig. 7). Therefore, the corresponding sclerified parts of the larva (head, thoracic legs, anal plate, sieve plates of the spiracle, and claw hook of prolegs), the body color (tentacles, veins, dorsal plate, and thoracic legs), and the scales of the adult in the mln mutant are blacker or more buffy colored than in Dazao (WT). It is therefore intriguing that the abnormal pigmentation appears only in certain parts of the body (the sclerified regions) rather than more generally. Furthermore, other genes involved in the melanin metabolic pathway were also regulated by the loss of function of Bm-iAANAT in the mln mutant (Fig. 6C). The expression of pale, Yellow, and, especially, Ddc were all suppressed by the accumulation of dopamine in three particular tissues (head, thoracic legs, and anal plate) in Dazao-mln larva. However, ebony was up-regulated in the thoracic legs and anal plate, resulting from the excess dopamine, and extra NBAD generated. This may explain the buffy colors occurring in the thoracic legs and anal plate of the mutant (Figs. 1A, 6, A and C, and supplemental Fig. 1). However, we do not know why the ebony was down-regulated in the head. In the adult stage, all of the four key genes were down-regulated in the mln mutant, and we speculate that Ddc, pale, and Yellow were also suppressed by the accumulation of dopamine (Figs. 1B, 6, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 1). However, the lower expression of ebony may be due to less NBAD being needed to produce a yellow color in the mln mutant (9Koch P.B. Behnecke B. Weigmann-Lenz M. Ffrench-Constant R.H. Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to test this hypothesis. In summary, several lines of evidence suggest that Bm-iAANAT is responsible for the mutant silkworm color pattern, mln. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a role for Bm-iAANAT in the color pattern besides its activity in synthesizing melatonin in the silkworm (18Itoh M.T. Hattori A. Nomura T. Sumi Y. Suzuki T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In general, the body color patterns of insects are determined by complicated genetic pathways, and recently many studies have looked in detail at this phenomenon. There is no doubt that elucidating the molecular basis of these color pattern mutants will be useful in illuminating the development and evolution of insect coloration.

Both GCLC and GLCM are controlled transcriptionally by a variety of cellular stimuli, including oxidative stress. This study addresses post-translational control of GCL activity, which increased rapidly in human lymphocytes following oxidative stress. Activation of GCL occurred within minutes of treatment and without any change in GCL protein levels and coincided with an increase in the proportion of GCLC in the holoenzyme form. Likewise, GCLM shifted from the monomeric form to holoenzyme and higher molecular weight species. Normal rat tissues also showed a distribution of monomeric and higher molecular weight forms. Neither GCL activation, nor the formation of holoenzyme, required a covalent intermolecular disulfide bridge between GCLC and GCLM. However, in immunoprecipitation studies, a neutralizing epitope associated with enzymatic activity was protected following cellular oxidative stress. Thus, the N-terminal portion of GCLC may undergo a change that stabilizes the GCL holoenzyme. Our results suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between low and high activity forms of GCL and is altered by transient oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W2032087664,"Triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis, membrane lipid biosynthesis, and lipid turnover are largely interlinked processes. In yeast, TAG is mobilized by three TAG lipases named Tgl3p, Tgl4p, and Tgl5p, which are localized to lipid particles/droplets. These TAG lipases posses a conserved GXSXG motif that is characteristic of hydrolytic enzymes. Here, we demonstrated that the yeast TAG lipase Tgl4p, the functional ortholog of the adipose TAG lipase, ATGL, catalyzes multiple functions in lipid metabolism. An extended domain and motif search analysis revealed that Tgl4p bears not only a lipase consensus domain but also a conserved motif for calcium-independent phospholipase A(2). We show that Tgl4p exhibits TAG lipase, steryl ester hydrolase, and phospholipase A(2) activities, but surprisingly it also catalyzed the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid (PA). Heterologous overexpression of Tgl4p in Pichia pastoris increased total phospholipid and specifically PA synthesis. Moreover, deletion of TGL4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed an altered pattern of phosphatidylcholine and PA molecular species. Altogether, our data suggest that yeast Tgl4p functions as a hydrolytic enzyme in lipid degradation but also contributes to fatty acid channeling and phospholipid remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1975706205,"ErbB family of the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase plays an important role in the progression of human cancers including breast cancer. Finding protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) that can specifically regulate the function of ErbB should help design novel therapies for treatment. By performing a small interfering RNA screen against 43 human PTPs, we find that knockdown of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9 significantly increases ErbB2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line. In addition, knockdown of PTPN9 expression also enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of the ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Conversely, increasing expression of PTPN9 wild type (WT) inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR. To test whether ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9, PTPN9 WT, and a substrate trapping mutant (PTPN9 DA) are overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared with vector control, expression of PTPN9 WT significantly inhibits whereas expression of PTPN9 DA dramatically enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR, respectively. In contrast, expression of PTPN9 WT or DA mutant does not affect tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB3 and Shc. Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pulldown experiments show that tyrosol-phosphorylated ErbB2 or EGFR is preferentially associated with PTPN9 DA compared with PTPN9 WT, indicating that ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9. Furthermore, PTPN9 WT expression specifically impairs EGF-induced STAT3 and STAT5 activation, and inhibits the cell growth in soft agar. Last, PTPN9 WT expression also reduces invasion and MMP2 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data suggest PTPN9 as a negative regulator of breast cancer cells by targeting ErbB2 and EGFR and inhibiting STAT activation."
https://openalex.org/W1984129808,"Because issues of cost and bioavailability have hampered the development of gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides to combat infectious diseases, short linear peptides with high microbial cell selectivity have been recently considered as antibiotic substitutes. A new type of short antimicrobial peptide, designated temporin-SHf, was isolated and cloned from the skin of the frog Pelophylax saharica. Temporin-SHf has a highly hydrophobic sequence (FFFLSRIFa) and possesses the highest percentage of Phe residues of any known peptide or protein. Moreover, it is the smallest natural linear antimicrobial peptide found to date, with only eight residues. Despite its small size and hydrophobicity, temporin-SHf has broad-spectrum microbicidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, with no hemolytic activity. CD and NMR spectroscopy combined with restrained molecular dynamics calculations showed that the peptide adopts a well defined non-amphipathic alpha-helical structure from residue 3 to 8, when bound to zwitterionic dodecyl phosphocholine or anionic SDS micelles. Relaxation enhancement caused by paramagnetic probes showed that the peptide adopts nearly parallel orientations to the micelle surface and that the helical structure is stabilized by a compact hydrophobic core on one face that penetrates into the micelle interior. Differential scanning calorimetry on multilamellar vesicles combined with membrane permeabilization assays on bacterial cells indicated that temporin-SHf disrupts the acyl chain packing of anionic lipid bilayers, thereby triggering local cracks and microbial membrane disintegration through a detergent-like effect probably via the carpet mechanism. The short length, compositional simplicity, and broad-spectrum activity of temporin-SHf make it an attractive candidate to develop new antibiotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1985888246,"Effectors of the type III secretion systems (T3SS) are key elements in the interaction between many Gram-negative pathogens and their hosts. SlrP is an effector that is translocated into the eukaryotic host cell through the two virulence-associated T3SS of Salmonella enterica. We found previously that this effector is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for mammalian thioredoxin. Here, we identified ERdj3, an endoplasmic reticulum lumenal chaperone of the Hsp40/DnaJ family, as a new target for SlrP. Experiments with truncated forms of ERdj3 showed that domain II was essential for the interaction with SlrP. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation demonstrated that, in transfected HeLa cells, SlrP was partially located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The presence of SlrP interfered with the binding of ERdj3 to a denatured substrate. Taken together, these data suggest that the role of SlrP in the interaction between Salmonella and the host cell is exerted through the modulation of the function of two independent targets: thioredoxin in the cytosol, and ERdj3 in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2023454012,"Missense mutations represent the most common cause of many genetic diseases including cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency. Many of these mutations result in misfolded proteins, which lack biological function. The presence of chemical chaperones can sometimes alleviate or even restore protein folding and activity of mutant proteins. We present the purification and characterization of eight CBS mutants expressed in the presence of chemical chaperones such as ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, or trimethylamine-N-oxide. Preliminary screening in Escherichia coli crude extracts showed that their presence during protein expression had a significant impact on the amount of recovered CBS protein, formation of tetramers, and catalytic activity. Subsequently, we purified eight CBS mutants to homogeneity (P49L, P78R, A114V, R125Q, E176K, P422L, I435T, and S466L). The tetrameric mutant enzymes fully saturated with heme had the same or higher specific activities than wild type CBS. Thermal stability measurements demonstrated that the purified mutants are equally or more thermostable than wild type CBS. The response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulation or thermal activation varied. The lack of response of R125Q and E176K to both stimuli indicated that their specific conformations were unable to reach the activated state. Increased levels of molecular chaperones in crude extracts, particularly DnaJ, indicated a rather indirect effect of the chemical chaperones on folding of CBS mutants. In conclusion, the chemical chaperones present in the expression medium were able to fully restore the activity of eight CBS mutants by improving their protein folding. This finding could have direct implications for the development of a therapeutical approach to pyridoxine unresponsive homocystinuria."

Only a few human proteins have been identified as transporters of GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and/or GSH conjugates (GS-X). Human epithelial MDA1586, A549, H1975, H460, HN4, and H157 cell lines were exposed to 2',5'-dihydroxychalcone, which induces a GSH efflux response. A real-time gene superarray for 84 proteins found in families that have a known role in GSH, GSSG, and/or GS-X transport was employed to help identify potential GSH transporters. ABCG2 was identified as the only gene in the array that closely corresponded with the magnitude of 2',5'-dihydroxychalcone (2',5'-DHC)-induced GSH efflux. The role of human ABCG2 as a novel GSH transporter was verified in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactose-inducible gene expression system. Yeast expressing human ABCG2 had 2.5-fold more extracellular GSH compared with those not expressing ABCG2. GSH efflux in ABCG2-expressing yeast was abolished by the ABCG2 substrate methotrexate (10 microM), indicating competitive inhibition. In contrast, 2',5'-DHC treatment of ABCG2-expressing yeast increased extracellular GSH levels in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum 3.5-fold increase in GSH after 24 h. In addition, suppression of ABCG2 with short hairpin RNA or ABCG2 overexpression in human epithelial cells decreased or increased extracellular GSH levels, respectively. Our data indicate that ABCG2 is a novel GSH transporter."

Here the environment and accessibility of side chains within amyloid fibrils formed in vitro from beta(2)m with a long straight morphology are probed by site-directed spin labeling and accessibility to modification with N-ethyl maleimide using 19 site-specific cysteine variants. Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of these fibrils reveals a core predominantly organized in a parallel, in-register arrangement, by contrast with other beta(2)m aggregates. A continuous array of parallel, in-register beta-strands involving most of the polypeptide sequence is inconsistent with the cryoelectron microscopy structure, which reveals an architecture based on subunit repeats. To reconcile these data, the number of spins in close proximity required to give rise to spin exchange was determined. Systematic studies of a model protein system indicated that juxtaposition of four spin labels is sufficient to generate exchange narrowing. Combined with information about side-chain mobility and accessibility, we propose that the amyloid fibrils of beta(2)m consist of about six beta(2)m monomers organized in stacks with a parallel, in-register array. The results suggest an organization more complex than the accordion-like beta-sandwich structure commonly proposed for amyloid fibrils."

Furthermore, we elucidated the crystal structure of XfPrxQ C47S in which Ser-47 and Cys-83 lie ∼12.3 Å apart. Therefore, significant conformational changes are required for disulfide bond formation.

Furthermore, we elucidated the crystal structure of XfPrxQ C47S in which Ser-47 and Cys-83 lie ∼12.3 Å apart. Therefore, significant conformational changes are required for disulfide bond formation. In fact, circular dichroism data indicated that there was a significant redox-dependent unfolding of α-helices, which is probably triggered by the peroxidatic cysteine oxidation. Finally, we proposed a model that takes data from this work as well data as from the literature into account. IntroductionThe Gram-negative, xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is the etiological agent of economically important diseases in citrus and many other plant species. The 9a5c strain of X. fastidiosa, which has been linked to citrus variegated chlorosis, was the first plant pathogenic bacterium whose genome was completely sequenced (1Simpson A.J. Reinach F.C.

Citrus variegated chlorosis is the major problem faced by the Brazilian citrus industry and is responsible for significant losses in orange production (2Amaro A.A. Maia M.L.

X. fastidiosa also imposes severe economic damage for other countries of the American continent because other strains of this bacterium provoke Pierce disease in grapevines, phony peach disease, and leaf scorch diseases in almond and oleander (3Hendson M. Purcell A.H. Chen D. Smart C. Guilhabert M. Kirkpatrick B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). During infection by microorganisms, one of the first plant responses is the production of oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite (4Wrzaczek M. Brosché M.

To counteract the release of these oxidants, microorganisms have developed defenses such as antioxidant enzymes. In the X. fastidiosa genome, five genes encode homologous proteins involved in hydroperoxide decomposition: catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 2The abbreviations used are: GPxglutathione peroxidaseBcpbacterioferritin comigratory proteinCHPcumene hydroperoxideDTT1,4-dithiothreitolESI-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectrometryHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHRPhorseradish peroxidaseNEMN-ethylmaleimidePrxperoxiredoxinTBHPt-butyl hydroperoxideTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineTrxthioredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductasePDBProtein Data Bank.

All of them except GPx protein were identified in the whole cell extract and extracellular fraction of the citrus-isolated strain 9a5c (7Smolka M.B. Martins-de-Souza D. Martins D. Winck F.V.

Proteomics. 2003; 3: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Among the antioxidant proteins of X. fastidiosa, AhpC and PrxQ are members of a very large and ubiquitous family of cysteine-based peroxidases designated as peroxiredoxin (Prx). Prx enzymes are non-heme peroxidases with a catalytic activity toward hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and various organic hydroperoxides that is endowed by reactive cysteine residues. Prxs are widely distributed and are found in the majority of the pathogenic bacteria. In Escherichia coli, Prx proteins are among the 10 most abundant cellular proteins (8Link A.J. Robison K. Church G.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1259-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and in other bacteria, Prxs were characterized as species-specific antigens (9Yamaguchi R. Matsuo K. Yamazaki A. Takahashi M. Fukasawa Y. Wada M. Abe C. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Torian B.E. Flores B.M. Stroeher V.L. Hagen F.S. Stamm W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Prxs have been classified into two groups, 2-Cys Prx and 1-Cys Prx, based on the mechanism of catalysis. The 2-Cys Prx group can be further divided into typical 2-Cys Prx and atypical 2-Cys Prx, according to the localization of the additional cysteine involved in catalysis (12Netto L.E. de Oliveira M.A. Monteiro G. Demasi A.P. Cussiol J.R. Discola K.F. Demasi M. Silva G.M. Alves S.V. Faria V.G. Horta B.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol.

All groups share a common initial step of catalysis; the oxidation of a conserved reactive cysteine (the so-called peroxidatic cysteine) to a sulfenic acid intermediate (Cys-SOH) with the reduction of the hydroperoxide substrate to the correspondent alcohol. The fate of the sulfenic acid intermediate is distinct among the Prx groups. In typical 2-Cys Prx enzymes, the sulfenic acid reacts with a second cysteine residue located in the C terminus of the other subunit (the so-called resolving cysteine), resulting in the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. In contrast, the resolution reaction in atypical 2-Cys Prx enzymes occurs inside the same subunit, resulting in an intramolecular disulfide bond formation. The 1-Cys Prx enzymes do not contain a resolving cysteine, and their sulfenic acid cysteine is stabilized by the active site micro-environment of the polypeptide backbone. The catalytic cycle is completed when disulfide or sulfenic acid is reduced. For most Prxs, this reduction is carried out by Trx (14Poole L.B. Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Besides this classification, several others were proposed based on amino acid sequence similarity (15Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 16Trivelli X. Krimm I. Ebel C. Verdoucq L. Prouzet-Mauléon V. Chartier Y. Tsan P. Lauquin G. Meyer Y. Lancelin J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14139-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Later on, another classification based on both amino acid sequence and structural similarities was proposed and provided insights on the evolution of proteins within the Trx superfamily, which includes Prxs (17Copley S.D. Novak W.R. Babbitt P.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13981-13995Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Among the four Prx classes, class 1 is the most ancestral from which the other three classes arose. However, they are the least characterized class. Here, we will adopt the systems proposed by Copley et al. (17Copley S.D. Novak W.R. Babbitt P.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13981-13995Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and for clarity the relationship between the various classifications is presented in Table 1. Additionally, GPx enzymes are included in Table 1 because these proteins present the Trx fold and also are cysteine-based thiol-dependent peroxidases (18Rouhier N. Jacquot J.P. Free Radic. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Historically, all classes of Prxs have been considered only moderately reactive because their catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) toward hydroperoxides as determined by steady-state kinetics were in the 105 m−1 s−1 range. In contrast, selenocysteine-containing GPx (∼108 m−1 s−1) and heme-containing catalases (∼106 m−1 s−1) presented considerably higher values (20Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). More recently with the development of new assays, Prx enzymes were considered as reactive as selenium- and heme-containing proteins (21Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol.

Biochem. 2007; 44: 83-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, it should be mentioned that only class 3 Prx and class 4 Prx (composed mostly of typical 2-Cys Prx but also 1-Cys Prx proteins) were analyzed by these assays, and consequently, the catalytic efficiencies for enzymes of the other Prx classes remain to be determined.Class 1 Prx (Table 1) include, among other proteins, Bcp and PrxQ proteins with homologs present in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to unicellular eukaryotes and plants (24Jeong W.

Knaff D.B. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Among all Prxs, proteins belonging to class 1 can be considered the least reactive Prxs toward hydroperoxides (23Trujillo M. Ferrer-Sueta G. Thomson L. Flohé L. Radi R. Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44: 83-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Despite this, the biological importance of these proteins comes from the observations that bcp deletion in E. coli rendered cells hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide, TBHP, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide (24Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and expression of prxq in Arabidopsis thaliana was stimulated by hydrogen peroxide, TBHP, and diamide (30Horling F. Lamkemeyer P. König J. Finkemeier I. Kandlbinder A. Baier M. Dietz K.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, bcp expression was induced in the bacterium Frankia sp. during the formation of symbiosis with the plant, Alnus glutinosa (31Hammad Y. Maréchal J. Cournoyer B. Normand P. Domenach A.M. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PrxQ proteins were further categorized into two subfamilies as follows: PrxQα proteins that have the two catalytic cysteine residues (peroxidatic and resolving cysteines) with four-residue spacing, and PrxQβ proteins that do not have a cysteine vicinal to the peroxidatic cysteine (25Wakita M. Masuda S. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Ohta H. Takamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27792-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Here, we structurally and functionally characterized a class 1 Prx enzyme from X. fastidiosa named here as XfPrxQ, including the evaluation of its kinetic properties by means of new methodologies currently available. This study represents the first determination of the second-order rate constants for the reaction of a class 1 Prx enzyme with hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite. Through this analysis, it was possible to observe that XfPrxQ reactivity toward hydroperoxides is comparable with the most reactive enzymes (class 3 Prx, class 4 Prx, GPx, and catalases). Furthermore, the catalytic cycle of XfPrxQ was elucidated by multiple approaches such as x-ray crystallography, CD, site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and mass spectrometry. Moreover, by the identification of Trx, among other thiols, as the reducing substrate, we were able to reconstitute in vitro the pathway involved in hydroperoxide decomposition. Finally, we propose a model for the redox-dependent structural changes in PrxQβ proteins that is consistent with all of the data presented here as well as information from the literature.DISCUSSIONClass 1 Prx enzymes (Table 1) are poorly characterized, with crystal structures being elucidated only very recently. This study represents a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of XfPrxQ as a representative enzyme of class 1 Prx. Of the four cysteine residues of XfPrxQ (Cys-23, Cys-47, Cys-83, and Cys-101), three of them are conserved among PrxQβ orthologs (Cys-47, Cys-83, and Cys-101). Here, we unequivocally established that peroxidatic Cys-47 and resolving Cys-83 form an intramolecular disulfide bond in the oxidized state.Functional studies with XfPrxQ mutant proteins indicated the role of Cys-47 as the peroxidatic cysteine. Additional approaches were necessary to identify Cys-83 as the resolving cysteine of XfPrxQ, including mass spectrometry approaches (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table SII). This study is the first experimental demonstration of intramolecular disulfide bond formation in solution by a protein member of the PrxQβ subfamily, providing unequivocal evidence that XfPrxQ follows the atypical 2-Cys Prx mechanism.Compared with class 4 Prx from X. fastidiosa (XfAhpC), high concentrations of thiol compound (2 mm) were required to detect DTT-dependent peroxidase activity of XfPrxQ, suggesting that disulfides in class 1 Prx are very stable. Again, this finding is consistent with the proposal that the recycling step of Prx reduction limits the catalytic cycle (21Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10583-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol.

Biophys. 2007; 467: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This result can explain why DTT-dependent peroxidase activity of XfPrxQ C83S was higher than wild-type XfPrxQ activity (Fig. 3A) even though they have similar second-order rate constants of the reaction with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 6, A and B). It could also explain, for example, why DOT5 (nuclear thiol peroxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a class 1 Prx protein, has a markedly lower DTT-dependent antioxidant activity of glutamine synthetase protection than those of the other yeast isoenzymes belonging to class 3 Prx and 4 Prx (29Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Therefore, it was relevant to identify in this work that the Trx system of X. fastidiosa composed by XfTsnC and XfTrxR, but not other thiol-reducing systems, is the biological reducing system of XfPrxQ (Fig. 3 and supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). In agreement with this finding, DTT-dependent peroxidase activities of other class 1 Prx enzymes were also greatly stimulated by Trx proteins (25Wakita M. Masuda S. Motohashi K.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Bisubstrate steady-state kinetics analysis of XfPrxQ resulted in catalytic efficiencies in the range of 103 to 104 m−1 s−1 (Table 2), which would indicate that this peroxidase is only moderately reactive when compared with GPx and catalases (20Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated that class 3 Prx and class 4 Prx proteins (Table 1) are also highly reactive toward hydroperoxides, and the apparent ambiguity between these studies was resolved with the proposal that reduction of Prxs is the rate-limiting step (21Parsonage D.

Similarly, by competitive kinetic studies with HRP, the second-order rate constants of XfPrxQ were shown to be high for hydrogen peroxide (in the 107 m−1 s−1 range) and for peroxynitrite (106 m−1 s−1 range). These are the first determinations of second-order rate constants of the reaction of a reduced class 1 Prx enzyme and hydroperoxides, and the results have changed the paradigm that class 1 Prx enzymes present moderate reactivities within the Prx family of enzymes. Instead, these values demonstrate that class 1 Prx proteins are as reactive toward hydroperoxides as class 3 Prx, class 4 Prx, GPx, and catalases (21Parsonage D. Youngblood D.S. Sarma G.N. Wood Z.A.

Here, we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation of LATS2 expression by tristetraprolin (TTP). Our results show that the expression level of LATS2 is inversely correlated with TTP expression in human cancer cell lines. Overexpression of TTP reduced the expression level of LATS2. Conversely, treatment with small interfering RNA against TTP increased the expression level of LATS2 through stabilization of LATS2 mRNA and suppressed the proliferation of A549 human lung cancer cells. LATS2 mRNA contains AU-rich elements (AREs) within the 3′-untranslated region, and TTP destabilized a luciferase mRNA containing LATS2 ARE. In addition, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that TTP directly bound to the ARE of LATS2 mRNA.

Although the ability of TTP to promote enhanced degradation of several ARE-containing mRNAs is now recognized, the spectrum of targets that are sensitive to TTP regulation is not fully appreciated. In this study, we investigated the role of TTP in the regulation of LATS2 gene expression in human cancer cells and identified for the first time that TTP promotes the degradation of LATS2 mRNA through binding to the 3′-UTR of LATS2. Our data demonstrate that LATS2 mRNA contains several AREs within the 3′-UTR and that TTP operates its destabilizing activity through direct binding to LATS2 AREs. These results establish LATS2 mRNA as a physiological target of TTP and suggest that the TTP regulation of LATS2 transcript stability may modulate the effect of this protein on cell proliferation.

Transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Promega) and mixed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and the chemiluminescent signal was measured in a Wallac Victor 1420 multilabel counter. Firefly luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase in each sample. All luciferase assays reported here represent at least three independent experiments, each consisting of three wells per transfection. RNP complexes were immunoprecipitated after reverse cross-linking between target RNA and proteins as described previously (33Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods. 2002; 26: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 293-EBNA cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of pcDNA6/V5-TTP and psiCHECK-LATS2-wtARE-3/4 or psiCHECK-LATS2-mARE-3/4. At 24 h after transfection, the cell suspension was incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 0.25 m glycine (pH 7.0), and cells were sonicated in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). RNP complexes were immunoprecipitated using protein G-agarose beads preincubated with 1 μg of anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) or 1 μg of isotype control (Sigma). After cross-linking reversion at 70 °C for 45 min, RNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitates and treated with DNase I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from the RNA, and the Renilla luciferase gene was amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase- and Renilla luciferase-specific primers (Up, ACGTGCTGGACTCCTTCATC; and down, GACACTCTCAGCATGGACGA). TTP proteins in the immunoprecipitated samples were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody. The biotinylated RNA probes for the wild type (LATS2-ARE-w3/w4, 5′-UUCAAAUUAGUAUGAUUCCUAUUUAAAGUGAUUUAUAUUUGAGUAAAAAGUUCAA-3′) and mutant (LATS2-ARE-m3/w4, 5′-UUCAAAUUAGUAUGAUUCCUAGCAAAGUGAUUUAUUUGAGUAAAAAGUUCAA-3′) were synthesized by Samchully Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Seoul). A mutant RNA probe in which two AUUUA pentamers were each substituted with AGCA was used as a negative control. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from A549 cells or pcDNA6/V5-TTP-transfected 293-EBNA cells using NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce). RNA EMSA was performed using the Lightshift® chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 20 fmol of biotinylated RNA was combined with 5 μg of cytoplasmic protein from cell extract in binding buffer. For the supershift EMSA, rabbit anti-human TTP polyclonal antibody (ab36558, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or control antibody (I-5381, Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture. After the addition of antibodies, reaction mixtures were incubated overnight on ice. The reaction mixtures were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Gels were transferred to nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 100 V and 4 °C for 1 h. The RNAs were cross-linked to the membrane and detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase binding and chemiluminescence. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare), and probed with appropriate dilutions of rabbit anti-human TTP polyclonal antibody or anti-human LATS2 antibody (k-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Films were exposed at multiple time points to ensure that the images were not saturated. For RNA kinetic analysis, we used actinomycin D and assessed LATS2 mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using ABI Prism 7900 HT by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of SYBR Green dye (Qiagen). Specificities of each primer pair were confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR primer pairs were as follows: qLATS2, AAGAGCTACTCGCCATACGCCTTT and AGCTTTGGCCATTTCTTGCTCCAG; qVEGF, ATCTTCAAGCCATCCTGTGTGC and TGCGCTTGTCACATTTTTCTTG; qc-myc, ACCACCAGCAGCGACTCTGA and TCCAGCAGAAGGATGATCCAGACT; qcyclin D, CAAAATGCCAGAGGCGGAG and CTTGATCACTCTGGAGAG; qCOX-2, TTCAAATGAGATTATGGGAAAAT and AGATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATCTT; and qc-fos, ACGCAGACTACGAGGCGTCA and TTCACAACGCCAGCCCTGGA. For statistical comparisons, p values were determined using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. Previously, we prepared Colo320/TTP, a stable transfectant derivative of Colo320 that overexpresses TTP, and reported that VEGF expression was reduced by overexpression of TTP (32Lee H.H. Son Y.J. Lee W.H. Park Y.W. Chae S.W. Cho W.J. Kim Y.M. Choi H.J. Choi D.H. Jung S.W. Min Y.J. Park S.E. Lee B.J. Cha H.J. Park J.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 126: 1817-1827Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). While we were searching for genes with expression levels changed by TTP overexpression, we found that the LATS2 expression level was also reduced in Colo320/TTP cells compared with that in Colo320 cells (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting the possibility that TTP negatively regulates the expression of LATS2 in cancer cells. To determine whether LATS2 expression is inversely correlated with endogenous TTP expression, we analyzed the expression of LATS2 and TTP in five human cancer cell lines: PA1, NT2, HepG2, 293-EBNA, and A549. We found that cell lines with high TTP expression levels (HepG2 and A549) showed low expression levels of LATS2 and that those with low TTP expression levels (293-EBNA and PA1) showed relatively high expression levels of LATS2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting an inverse correlation between TTP expression and LATS2 expression in human cancer cell lines except one, NT2. We next examined other human cancer cells lines to determine whether overexpression of TTP could reduce LATS2 expression. For this purpose, a TTP expression vector (pcDNA6/V5-TTP) was transfected into PA1 cells, and as a negative control, PA1 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA6/V5 empty vector. Overexpression of TTP in pcDNA/TTP-transfected PA1 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D, left panels). Expression of LATS2 was significantly reduced in pcDNA/TTP-transfected PA1 cells compared with that in empty vector-transfected PA1 cells (Fig. 1, D, left panel, and E). To test whether down-regulation of TTP affects LATS2 expression, we used siRNA against TTP to reduce the expression level of TTP in A549 cells. Down-regulation of TTP by treatment with siRNA significantly increased the expression level of LATS2 (Fig. 1, D, right panel, and F). However, treatment with nonspecific siRNA (scRNA) did not decrease the expression level of endogenous TTP, and it did not induce a change in LATS2 expression. These results indicate that the expression of LATS2 is associated with the decrease in TTP expression observed in human cancer cells. To determine whether the decreased expression of LATS2 resulted from changes in the stability of LATS2 mRNA, the half-life of this mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in A549 cells treated with siRNA against TTP (A549/TTP siRNA) or control siRNA (A549/scRNA). Reduced expression of TTP protein in A549/TTP siRNA cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). In the control A549 and A549/scRNA cells, the half-life of LATS2 mRNA was <30 min. However, in the A549/TTP siRNA cells, LATS2 mRNA was stable until 3 h after actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating that the reduced expression of TTP contributes to an increase in LATS2 levels through stabilization of LATS2 mRNA. TTP protein regulates mRNA stability through binding to the AREs within the mRNA 3′-UTR (29Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hau H.H.

Cha H.J. Park J.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 126: 1817-1827Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 1832-bp-long human LATS2 3′-UTR revealed the presence of six pentameric AUUUA (ARE) motifs (Fig. 3A). To determine whether down-regulation of LATS2 expression by TTP is mediated through the LATS2 mRNA 3′-UTR, we used a luciferase reporter gene linked to the LATS2 3′-UTR fragment containing all six AREs, Frag-ARE-1–6, in plasmid psiCHECK. When 293-EBNA cells with a low expression level of TTP were transfected to overexpress TTP (Fig. 3B), the luciferase activity was inhibited (Fig. 3C). However, the luciferase activity was not inhibited by transfection of the empty vector into 293-EBNA cells (Fig. 3C). On the contrary, when A549 cells with a high expression level of TTP were treated with siRNA against TTP to down-regulate TTP expression (Fig. 2A), the luciferase activity was significantly increased (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the 3′-UTR of LATS2 mRNA is important for TTP-mediated down-regulation of LATS2 expression. Our next goal was to determine the regions within the LATS2 3′-UTR that are important for the TTP inhibitory effect. We first used luciferase genes linked to various deletion mutants of the LATS2 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A). Whereas TTP decreased the luciferase activity of the luciferase reporter gene cloned upstream of Frag-ARE-1–6 (containing all six AREs) by 83.5%, LATS2 3′-UTR fragments Frag-ARE-1 (containing ARE1) and Frag-ARE-5/6 (containing ARE5 and ARE6) abrogated the inhibitory effect of TTP on reporter gene activity (12.5 and 45.5% inhibition, respectively) (Fig. 3E). However, LATS2 3′-UTR fragments Frag-ARE-1/2 (containing ARE1 and ARE2), Frag-ARE-1–4 (containing ARE1–ARE4), and Frag-ARE-3–6 (containing ARE3–ARE6) responded to TTP similarly although slightly less than the whole Frag-ARE-1–6 construct (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that ARE2, ARE3, and/or ARE4 within the LATS2 3′-UTR is responsible for the inhibitory effect of TTP. To determine which AREs are essential for the inhibitory effect of TTP, we prepared oligonucleotides Oligo-ARE-2 (containing ARE2) and Oligo-ARE-3/4 (containing ARE3 and ARE4) (Fig. 3A). Although Oligo-ARE-2 did not respond to TTP, Oligo-ARE-3/4 did (54% inhibition) (Fig. 3E). Oligo-ARE-3/4 contains two ARE motifs, and to determine which of them is responsible for the response to TTP, we prepared single or double mutants of these motifs (Fig. 3A). Both the double mutant and the ARE3 mutant prevented the TTP inhibitory effect (Fig. 3E), strongly suggesting that LATS2 ARE3 is involved in TTP binding and inhibitory activity. To determine whether TTP interacts with ARE3 of the LATS2 3′-UTR, 293-EBNA cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP and psiCHECK2-Oligo-ARE-3w/4w (wild-type ARE3 and ARE4) or psiCHECK2-Oligo-ARE-3m/4w (mutant ARE3 and wild-type ARE4). After immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 or control antibody, the presence of TTP was determined by Western blotting using anti-TTP antibody (Fig. 4A). Total RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates, and the presence of luciferase mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using PCR primers specific to the luciferase gene. The amplified PCR product was observed in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with psiCHECK2-Oligo-ARE-3w/4w and pcDNA6/V5-TTP (Fig. 4A). However, PCR product was not detected in samples from cells transfected with psiCHECK2-Oligo-ARE-3m/4w or pcDNA/TTP (Fig. 4A). PCR product was also not detected in immunoprecipitates obtained using control antibody. These results demonstrate that TTP interacts specifically with LATS2 ARE3. To confirm the interaction of TTP with ARE3 of the LATS2 3′-UTR, RNA EMSA was conducted using a biotinylated RNA probe containing wild-type or mutant ARE3 of LATS2. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 293-EBNA cells transfected with pcDNA/TTP to overexpress TTP and were incubated with the biotinylated RNA probe containing wild-type or mutant ARE3 of LATS2. When RNA EMSA was conducted using the wild-type LATS2 ARE3 probe, two dominant probe-protein complexes were observed (Fig. 4B). However, mutation of LATS2 ARE3 prevented the formation of these complexes. These complexes were reduced, and a high molecular weight antibody complex was formed by preincubation of the reaction mixture with anti-V5 antibody but not with control antibody (Fig. 4B). The results confirmed that LATS2 ARE3 is essential for TTP binding. However, these results were obtained using ectopically overexpressed TTP protein. Thus, our next goal was to demonstrate the association between endogenous TTP and LATS2 ARE3. For this purpose, we used A549 cells with a high expression level of TTP (Fig. 1B). When the wild-type LATS2 ARE3 probe was mixed with cytoplasmic extracts from A549, a dominant probe-protein complex was observed (Fig. 4C). However, the mutant LATS2 ARE3 probe failed to form the complex. Formation of the LATS2 ARE3 probe-protein complex was reduced by preincubation of the reaction mixture with anti-TTP antibody but not with control antibody. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that repression of LATS2 occurs through direct interaction of TTP with ARE3 of LATS2 mRNA. To determine whether down-regulation of TTP affects the growth of cells, we analyzed the growth of A549 cells after siRNA treatment. Treatment with TTP siRNA reduced the expression of TTP (Fig. 1C) and increased the"
https://openalex.org/W2074267449,"The recent crystal structure of the ATP-gated P2X4 receptor revealed a static view of its architecture, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the P2X channels activation are still unknown. By using a P2X2 model based on the x-ray structure, we sought salt bridges formed between charged residues located in a region that directly connects putative ATP-binding sites to the ion channel. To reveal their significance for ion channel activation, we made systematic charge exchanges and measured the effects on ATP sensitivity. We found that charge reversals at the interfacial residues Glu(63) and Arg(274) produced gain-of-function phenotypes that were cancelled upon paired charge swapping. These results suggest that a putative intersubunit salt bridge formed between Glu(63) and Arg(274) contributes to the ion channel function. Engineered cysteines E63C and R274C formed redox-dependent cross-links in the absence of ATP. By contrast, the presence of ATP reduced the rate of disulfide bond formation, indicating that ATP binding might trigger relative movement of adjacent subunits at the level of Glu(63) and Arg(274), allowing the transmembrane helices to open the channel."

For most living organisms, heme is an essential cofactor of enzymes such as cytochromes, catalases, and peroxidases (1Sutak R. Lesuisse E. Tachezy J. Richardson D.R. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 261-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The importance of heme resides in the unique properties of its iron center, including the capacities to undergo electron transfer, perform acid-base reactions, and interact with various coordinating ligands (2Kumar S. Bandyopadhyay U. Toxicol. Lett. 2005; 157: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has emphasized another role for heme, as a signaling molecule that regulates the function of key proteins implicated in diverse cellular processes (3Hou S. Reynolds M.F. Horrigan F.T.

Once internalized, heme is incorporated into bacterial proteins or degraded to release iron for incorporation into iron-sulfur proteins or for endogenous heme synthesis (8Wandersman C. Stojiljkovic I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and other heme-synthesizing bacteria, heme b is further processed to heme d by the activity of the heme hydroperoxidase II (the catalase KatE) (9Obinger C. Maj M. Nicholls P. Loewen P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); both heme forms are required for activity of the cytochrome bd oxidase (10Poole R.K. Hatch L.

Few intracellular heme-binding proteins have been described in prokaryotes. In E. coli, CcmE is a heme chaperone that binds heme transiently in the periplasm and delivers it to newly synthesized and exported c-type cytochrome (15Uchida T. Stevens J.M. Daltrop O. Harvat E.M.

The opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus (GBS)) is an asymptomatic inhabitant of the intestine and vagina but a leading cause of invasive infection in newborns and immunocompromised adults (21Doran K.S. Nizet V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GBS does not synthesize heme and is catalase-negative. However, GBS uses exogenous heme and menaquinone in an aerobic environment to activate a GBS membrane respiratory chain involving a cytochrome bd oxidase, needed for full virulence. The shift from fermentation to respiration metabolism results in increased biomass and improved survival (11Yamamoto Y. Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. Lamberet G. Gruss A. Gaudu P. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although GBS can assimilate free heme or hemoglobin-bound heme (11Yamamoto Y. Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. Lamberet G. Gruss A.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), little is known about its molecular mechanisms for heme acquisition and utilization. Our goal is to identify GBS proteins responsible for heme homeostasis. To this purpose, we used heme affinity chromatography to enrich for heme-binding proteins from bacterial lysates. Several potential heme-binding proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF. Here, we present the characterization of one of these proteins, the ubiquitous alkyl hydroxyperoxide reductase (AhpC), and show that it is a heme-binding protein. The conserved alkyl hydroxyperoxide reductase AhpC belongs to the family of peroxiredoxins (Prx) (23Fujii J. Ikeda Y. Redox Rep. 2002; 7: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). AhpC is a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin that, when coupled with a disulfide reductase as an electron donor, acts on hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and organic hydroperoxides to generate their corresponding alcohols (24Matsumura T. Okamoto K. Iwahara S. Hori H. Takahashi Y. Nishino T. Abe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Prxs are also implicated in regulatory functions, as mainly reported in eukaryotes, such as transcription, apoptosis, and cellular signaling (25Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K.

In Helicobacter pylori, AhpC was shown to oligomerize and acquire protein chaperone activity in oxidative stress conditions (28Chuang M.H. Wu M.S. Lo W.L. Lin J.T. Wong C.H. Chiou S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2552-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Using genetic, biochemical, and spectrophotometric approaches, we show for the first time that a bacterial AhpC protein has heme-binding and heme protection capacities. Because AhpC belongs to a family of highly conserved peroxidases, our findings could have significance in other prokaryotes and provide an additional role for this already multifunctional protein. Characteristics of relevant strains and plasmids are described in supplemental Table S1. GBS strain NEM316, whose genome sequence is known, belongs to the capsular serotype III strain (GBS) and was isolated from a case of fatal septicemia (29Gaillot O. Poyart C. Berche P. Trieu-Cuot P. Gene. 1997; 204: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The GBS ahpC insertion mutant was constructed by inserting, in the same transcriptional orientation as ahpC, the promoterless and terminatorless kanamycin resistance cassette aphA-3 (30Trieu-Cuot P. Courvalin P. Gene. 1983; 23: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) within DNA segments encompassing the 5′ and 3′ ends of ahpC and ahpF, respectively, inactivating both genes (supplemental Fig. S1A). Three amplicons were generated using oligonucleotide pairs O1-O2, O3-O4, O5-O6 and then ligated after digestion with the appropriate enzymes (see supplemental Table S2). The resulting EcoRI-PstI fragment was cloned into pG+host5 (31Maguin E. Prévost H. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and the recombinant vector was introduced by electroporation into GBS NEM316. The double crossover events leading to the expected gene replacements were screened and obtained as described previously (32Biswas I. Gruss A. Ehrlich S.D. Maguin E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3628-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Structure of the chromosomal insertion was verified using PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) and DNA sequencing (data not shown). Note that for the clarity of the text, the ahpCF mutant described here was named ahpC throughout this study. GBS was grown at 37 °C in rich M17 liquid broth (Difco) supplemented with 1% glucose, after inoculation by precultures grown in M17 with 0.2% glucose. GBS respiration metabolism was activated by supplementing medium with 1 μm hemin (from a stock solution of 10 mm hemin chloride dissolved in 50 mm NaOH; Fluka) and 10 μm vitamin K2 (Sigma) and growing in a rotary shaker (200 rpm) as described previously (11Yamamoto Y.

Gruss A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. When needed, antibiotics were used as follows: 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin for E. coli; 5 μg/ml erythromycin and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol for GBS. Bacteria were grown overnight without aeration. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and lysed with glass beads (Fastprep, MP Biomedicals). Cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The lysate was mixed with hemin-conjugated agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C on a spinning wheel. Agarose was washed three times by centrifugation with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Following the last washing, agarose beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged 5 min at 18,000 × g. Supernatants were processed for SDS-PAGE. The GBS AhpC (GBS1874) open reading frame was amplified from NEM316 using (O7, O8) oligonucleotide primers (supplemental Table S2) and cloned into the E. coli expression plasmid Champion pET100 directional TOPO (pET100/D-TOPO) vector (Invitrogen), giving rise to a hexahistidine N-terminal fusion protein expression vector, pHis-AhpC. Mutant His-AhpCC47A,C165A was obtained by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (35Urban A. Neukirchen S. Jaeger K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2227-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), using the overlapping O9, O10 and O11, O12 primers for introducing C47A and C165A point mutations, respectively, in the AhpC sequence. The product was cloned into pET100/D-TOPO vector (supplemental Table S1). All plasmids were verified by sequencing. E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with pHis-AhpC was grown to A600 = 0.6, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted at 3,500 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, containing 20 mm imidazole (binding buffer), and disrupted with glass beads (Fastprep, MP Biomedicals). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. His-tagged proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using His-Select affinity gel (Sigma) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the soluble fraction was mixed with resin and incubated on a spinning wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was then centrifuged and washed three times with binding buffer. Purified proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, containing 150 mm imidazole, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and finally stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Lowry assay method (Bio-Rad). A recombinant AhpC with an N-terminal HA tag (MYPYDVPDYA) extension (HA-AhpC) was generated by successive PCRs (35Urban A. Neukirchen S. Jaeger K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2227-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, two rounds of PCR were performed to obtain overlapping DNA fragments encoding the HA-AhpC fusion. First, the AhpC coding sequence and promoter regions were amplified with oligonucleotide pairs O8-O13 and O15-O16, respectively, using GBS genomic DNA as template. Both O13 and O15 include half of the HA peptide sequence (supplemental Table S2, see italics). These fragments were then used as templates for a second round of PCR to expand the HA sequence using O8-O14 and O16-O17 oligonucleotide pairs. The resulting overlapping PCR products were annealed and amplified with oligonucleotide pairs O12-O15 (supplemental Table S2). The pHA-AhpC plasmid (supplemental Table S1) was obtained by cloning the final PCR product into pCR-BLUNT vector (Invitrogen). The entire ahpCF operon was also amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotide primers O16-O18 (supplemental Table S2) and cloned into the pCR-BLUNT vector (Invitrogen) giving rise to the pAhpCF vector (supplemental Table S1). The GBS AhpC (GBS1874) open reading frame was amplified from NEM316 genomic DNA using O21 and O22 oligonucleotide primers (supplemental Table S2), including the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pMAL-c4X (New England Biolabs) using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites generating a plasmid encoding the fusion of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the N terminus of AhpC (pMAL-AhpC) (supplemental Table S1). The plasmid was verified by sequencing and transformed into the E. coli TOP10 strain (supplemental Table S1). Purification of MBP-AhpC was performed on bacteria lysed as described for His-AhpC isolation (see above). MBP-AhpC protein was purified on amylose resin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (binding buffer) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (New England Biolabs). Elution of the MBP-AhpC protein was performed with 10 mm maltose in binding buffer. Hemin binding to AhpC was identified in SDS-PAGE, as described previously (36Moore R.W. Welton A.F. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Smalley J.W. Charalabous P. Birss A.J. Hart C.A. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2001; 8: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of purified His-tagged protein was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a 2-fold molar excess of hemin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with Laemmli sample buffer without dithiothreitol and without heating. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Hemin peroxidase activity was detected by staining the gel in a tetramethylbenzidine- and H2O2-containing solution (Sigma). His-AhpC-Hemin complex was prepared by incubating 50 μg of purified His-AhpC with a 2-fold excess of hemin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, free hemin was removed by chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 gel filtration column (Sigma). Hemin content of the complex was determined by the pyridine hemochrome assay as described previously (38Tong Y. Guo M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 735-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hemin binding affinities of His-AhpC and variants were determined by adding 0.5 to 1-μl increments of a 200 μm hemin solution to cuvettes containing test samples, in 100 μl of 10 μm His-AhpC in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or reference sample without protein. Spectra were measured from 350 to 700 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer Libra S22 (Biochrom). Absorbance at 414 nm was plotted against hemin concentration, and data were fitted to a one-binding site model, which accounts for the protein concentration to determine the dissociation constant (39Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1, A414=0.5⋅ϵ414⋅(CH+Kd+Bmaxϵ414−((CH+Kd+Bmax/ϵ414)2−4⋅CH⋅Bmax/ϵ414)1/2)(Eq. 1) A414 is the absorbance at 414 nm; CH is the concentration of heme added in the sample and reference cuvettes; Bmax is the absorbance of the maximal binding; and ϵ414 is the extinction coefficient of AhpC bound heme. The extinction coefficient of bound heme was calculated (ϵ414 = 83 mm−1·cm−1) from the absorbance at 414 nm of 7.0 μm of the purified complex according to the following equation: A414 = ϵ414·l·c (where l is the path length (1 cm) and c is the concentration of the protein complex). Curves were fitted to a one-binding site model with the equation described above using the nonlinear regression function of GraphPad Prism 4 software. AhpC-hemin complex in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was excited with a 406.7-nm line of an Innova Kr+ laser (Coherent, Palo Alto). Spectra were recorded at 20 °C using a U1000 spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, France) equipped with an ultrasensitive back-thinned CCD detector. Radiant powers of 10 milliwatt were used to avoid photoreduction of the oxidized sample. The peroxide reductase activity of recombinant His-AhpC free or in complex with hemin was measured by following the decrease at 340 nm within 10 min at 25 °C due to NADPH oxidation in a UV-visible spectrophotometer Libra S22 (Biochrom). Each assay was performed using 10 μm His-AhpC or 10 μm His-AhpC-hemin complex in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.5 mm EDTA, containing 5 μm thioredoxin (Sigma), 0.5 μm thioredoxin reductase (Sigma), and 150 μm NADPH (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm−1·cm−1). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm H2O2 (28Chuang M.H. Wu M.S. Lo W.L. Lin J.T. Wong C.H. Chiou S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2552-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Background enzymatic activity was measured in the same conditions without thioredoxin reductase. Values are expressed in units (μmol of NADPH·min−1). Immunoblotting was performed on bacterial lysates of strains transformed with the indicated expression vectors as reported previously (41Lechardeur D. Xu M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was followed with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Liquid-Phase oxygen electrode unit DW1, Hansatech Instruments). The electrode was calibrated as recommended by the manufacturer, using air-saturated 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at 37 °C, assuming an oxygen concentration of 217 μm. Sodium dithionite was added to zero the electrode. S. agalactiae WT and ahpC late exponential phase cultures, prepared in aerobic fermentation or respiration conditions, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and resuspended in the same buffer at A600 = 1.0. One-ml volume of the bacterial suspension was transferred to a sealed cuvette equipped with the oxygen electrode. The bacterial suspension was then air-saturated by stirring for about 6 min at 37 °C, and after capping of the chamber, the maximum oxygen consumption rate was measured following the addition of 10 mm glucose, which was injected using a Hamilton microliter syringe through a capillary hole. Hemin intracellular accumulation was assessed in vivo by following activity of the Enterococcus faecalis hemin-catalase (KatA) cloned under control of the kanamycin resistance gene (aphA-3) constitutive promoter PaphA-3 (pLUMB5, supplemental Table S1) (42Frankenberg L. Brugna M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 148: 6351-6356Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Diluted cultures transformed with the pLUMB5 plasmid were grown overnight under static conditions in M17 containing 1% glucose and supplemented or not with hemin. KatA expression in saturated cultures was followed on immunoblots with a polyclonal anti-KatA antibody (42Frankenberg L. Brugna M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 148: 6351-6356Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Catalase activity of pLUMB5 transformed bacteria was determined on whole cells incubated with 50 μm H2O2 with the spectrophotometric FOX1 method based on ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange as described previously (43Wolff S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Absorption was measured at 560 nm. H2O2 concentrations in samples were calculated from a calibration curve with known concentrations of H2O2. Comparative intensities of the Soret band peaks were determined for hemin complexed or not with 20 μm AhpC or bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid-free, Sigma) in the presence of H2O2. The Soret band peak absorption is 385 nm for free hemin and 414 nm for AhpC or BSA-bound hemin. Absorption values were measured as a function of time following addition of 800 μm H2O2. The data were normalized by subtracting the zero time point value to subsequent time points. We used hemin-agarose affinity chromatography to identify hemin-binding proteins in Streptococcaceae. We initially identified proteins from Lactococcus lactis lysates that bound to hemin-conjugated agarose. Among the proteins identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, a protein band migrating at around 20 kDa was identified as AhpC (data not shown). AhpC is a member of a highly conserved protein family and shares 71% identity with the NEM316 protein encoded by gbs1874 (supplemental Fig. S1C). In GBS and numerous bacteria, ahpC is clustered with ahpF (see supplemental Fig. S1A), the gene coding for the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpF) subunit, which functions as an electron donor to regenerate AhpC (44Guimarães B.G. Souchon H. Honoré N. Saint-Joanis B. Brosch R. Shepard W. Cole S.T. Alzari P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We selected the GBS AhpC protein for study for the following reasons. (i) It shows 38% amino acid sequence identity with HBP23, a rat liver protein recently identified on the basis of its affinity for hemin but whose function remains unknown (supplemental Fig. S1C) (45Iwahara S. Satoh H. Song D.X. Webb J. Burlingame A.L. Nagae Y. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13398-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 46Immenschuh S. Iwahara S. Satoh H. Nell C. Katz N. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13407-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). (ii) AhpC plays a major role in oxidative stress resistance especially against organic peroxides, which could have relevance for infection. (iii) The AhpC amino acid sequence includes two cysteine-proline (CP) motifs belonging to the catalytic and resolving domains of the enzyme, which are potentially involved in binding hemin as described for several proteins (supplemental Fig. S1C) (for review see Ref. 3Hou S. Reynolds M.F. Horrigan F.T. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Acc. Chem. Res. 2006; 39: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent work also emphasizes the multifunctional aspects of this enzyme, as it is described as a protein chaperone in H. pylori and in yeast (25Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K.

Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13407-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The AhpC open reading frame was expressed as an N-terminal His-tagged protein and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (supplemental Fig. S2A), yielding a distinct protein band of around 23 kDa that binds to hemin-agarose (Fig. 1A, 1st lane). When 50 μm His-AhpC was preincubated with hemin, resin binding was inhibited as a function of the hemin concentration (Fig. 1A), suggesting that AhpC interaction with hemin was specific and noncovalent. In line with this result, the His-AhpC-hemin complex could be reconstituted in vitro and was characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy. The spectrum of the complex at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1B) revealed a Soret band at 414 nm and β/α bands at 535 and 566 nm, respectively, consistent with ferric hexacoordinate low spin binding through the hemin iron center (38Tong Y. Guo M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 735-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reduction of the complex with dithionite (47Frawley E.R. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10201-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) resulted in a shift of the Soret band from 414 to 426 nm although oxidation with ammonium persulfate did not, suggesting that AhpC is bound to ferric hemin in our experimental conditions (supplemental Fig. S2"
https://openalex.org/W2035223999,"This work addresses the biogenesis of heme-copper terminal oxidases in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiont of soybean. B. japonicum has four quinol oxidases and four cytochrome oxidases. The latter include the aa3- and cbb3-type oxidases. Although both have a CuB center in subunit I, the subunit II proteins differ in having either a CuA center (in aa3) or a covalently bound heme c (in cbb3). Two biogenesis factors were genetically studied here, the periplasmically exposed CoxG and ScoI proteins, which are the respective homologs of the mitochondrial copper-trafficking chaperones Cox11 and Sco1 for the formation of the CuB center in subunit I and the CuA center in subunit II of cytochrome aa3. We could demonstrate copper binding to ScoI in vitro, a process for which the thiols of cysteine residues 74 and 78 in the ScoI polypeptide were shown to be essential. Knock-out mutations in the B. japonicum coxG and scoI genes led to loss of cytochrome aa3 assembly and activity in the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas the cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase apparently remained unaffected. This suggests that subunit I of the cbb3-type oxidase obtains its copper cofactor via a different pathway than cytochrome aa3. In contrast to the coxG mutation, the scoI mutation caused a decreased symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity. We hypothesize that a periplasmic B. japonicum protein other than any of the identified CuA proteins depends on ScoI and is required for an effective symbiosis.

https://openalex.org/W2006639721,"MDM2 plays a major role in cancer development and progression via both p53-dependent and -independent functions. One of its p53-independent functions is the induction of the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of p21(Waf1). The present study was designed to characterize the mechanism(s) by which MDM2 induces p21(Waf1) degradation. We first determined the regions of MDM2 required for p21(Waf1) degradation using pulldown assays and Western blotting and then examined the mechanisms using limited proteolysis and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. We found that the MDM2-p21(Waf1) interaction depended on the central domain of MDM2 and that nuclear localization of both proteins was necessary for p21(Waf1) degradation. Specifically, amino acids 226-250 of MDM2 were required for p21(Waf1) binding and degradation, and amino acids 251-260 were necessary for p21(Waf1) degradation. The latter region induced a conformation change in p21(Waf1), increasing its interaction with the C8 subunit of the proteasome, leading to its degradation. When MDM2 lacked either segment (aa 226-250 or aa 251-260), its capacity to promote p21(Waf1) degradation and cell cycle progression was significantly reduced. In summary, the present study elucidated a previously unknown mechanism by which MDM2 promotes the degradation of an intact protein (p21(Waf1)) through an ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation pathway. Because MDM2 also increases the degradation of other proteins in a ubiquitin-independent manner, this mechanism may underlie part of its tumorigenic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1983699942,"Bartonella quintana is a re-emerging pathogen and the causative agent of a variety of disease manifestations in humans including trench fever. Various typing methods have been developed for B. quintana, but these tend to be limited by poor resolution and, in the case of gel-based methods, a lack of portability. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been used to study the molecular epidemiology of a large number of pathogens, including B. henselae, a close relative of B. quintana. We developed a MLST scheme for B. quintana based on the 7 MLST loci employed for B. henselae with two additional loci to cover underrepresented regions of the B. quintana chromosome. A total of 16 B. quintana isolates spanning over 60 years and three continents were characterized. Allelic variation was detected in five of the nine loci. Although only 8/4270 (0.002%) of the nucleotide sites examined were variable over all loci, these polymorphisms resolved the 16 isolates into seven sequence types (STs). We also demonstrate that MLST can be applied on uncultured isolates by direct PCR from cardiac valve tissue, and suggest this method presents a promising approach for epidemiological studies in this highly clonal organism. Phylogenetic and clustering analyses suggest that two of the seven STs form a distinct lineage within the population."
https://openalex.org/W2024709969,"ACSL3 is a member of the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family that plays key roles in fatty acid metabolism in various tissues in an isozyme-specific manner. Our previous studies showed that ACSL3 was transcriptionally up-regulated by the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) in HepG2 cells, accompanied by reduced cellular triglyceride content and enhanced β-oxidation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the OSM-induced activation of ACSL3 gene transcription in HepG2 cells. We showed that OSM treatment resulted in a coordinated elevation of mRNA levels of ACSL3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). The effect of OSM on ACSL3 mRNA expression was inhibited by cellular depletion of PPARδ. By utilizing a PPARδ agonist, L165041, we demonstrated that activation of PPARδ led to increases in ACSL3 promoter activity, mRNA level, and protein level in HepG2 cells. Analysis of the ACSL3 promoter sequence identified two imperfect PPAR-responsive elements (PPRE) located in the ACSL3 promoter region −944 to −915, relative to the transcription start site. The up-regulation of ACSL3 promoter activity by PPARδ was abolished by deletion of this PPRE-containing region or mutation to disrupt the binding sites. Direct interactions of PPARδ with ACSL3-PPRE sequences were demonstrated by gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, we provided in vivo evidence showing that activation of PPARδ by L165041 in hamsters increased ACSL3 mRNA and protein levels in the liver.

Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although there is no report on membrane association of ACSL3, this isozyme has been found in the subcellular fraction of lipid droplets in the human hepatocyte HuH7 cells (11Fujimoto Y. Itabe H. Kinoshita T. Homma K.J. Onoduka J. Mori M. Yamaguchi S. Makita M. Higashi Y. Yamashita A. Takano T. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1280-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as well as in lipid droplets from lipolytically stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In rats, ACSL3 mRNA was shown to be highly expressed in brain and testis, and to a lesser extent in other organs such as adipose tissue, lung, kidney, heart, muscle, or liver (8Mashek D.G. Li L.O. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2004-2010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This tissue-specific expression pattern of ACSL3 mRNA was recently confirmed at the protein level in hamsters (9Wu M. Liu H. Chen W. Fujimoto Y. Liu J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By utilizing a highly specific antibody developed against the C-terminal region of hamster ACSL3, we have shown that the ACSL3 protein is abundant in brain and testis, detectable in liver and adipose tissue, barely seen in muscle, and untraceable in the heart (9Wu M. Liu H. Chen W. Fujimoto Y. Liu J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the initial study of rat ACSL3, it was proposed that the expression of ACSL3 in brain was developmentally regulated because its mRNA level in adult brain was only ∼10% of the maximum of 15 days after birth (5Fujino T. Kang M.J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this regulation in the brain have remained elusive. Although it is unclear what functional role ACSL3 plays during brain development, this enzyme has been shown to promote β-oxidation of FAs in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Our previous studies showed that the transcription of ACSL3 along with ACSL5 was activated by the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) in HepG2 cells (13Zhou Y. Abidi P. Kim A. Chen W. Huang T.T. Kraemer F.B. Liu J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using a specific inhibitor to the upstream kinase of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), we further demonstrated that the ERK signaling pathway was activated by OSM in HepG2 cells and in OSM-treated livers of hamsters. This activation was critically required for OSM to induce ACSL3 transcription. The increased expression of ACSL3 was associated with a decreased cellular TG content and an enhanced FA β-oxidation in OSM-treated cells. Moreover, depletion of ACSL3 by specific small interference RNA (siRNA) transfection abolished the OSM effects on FA metabolism. That cell culture data, coupled with the hypolipidemic effects of OSM observed in hamster experiments (13Zhou Y. Abidi P. Kim A. Chen W. Huang T.T. Kraemer F.B. Liu J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), led us to speculate that the increased ACSL3 expression in liver might contribute to the reductions of plasma and hepatic-free FAs and TG in OSM-treated animals. Recent studies in our laboratory further demonstrated that expressions of ACSL3 mRNA and protein in liver were specifically increased after feeding hamsters with a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet, providing the first in vivo evidence for the regulated expression of ACSL3 in liver tissue (9Wu M. Liu H. Chen W. Fujimoto Y. Liu J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Altogether, these recent new findings suggest that despite the low expression level, ACSL3 may play an important regulatory role in FA and TG metabolism in liver, a major organ in lipid metabolism of mammals. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nutritional sensors and have profound roles in FA metabolism (14Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 15Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 16Latruffe N. Vamecq J. Biochimie. 1997; 79: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Three subtypes, PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ/β, have been identified with distinct tissue distribution and biological activities. PPARs contain a signature type II zinc finger DNA binding motif and a hydrophobic ligand binding domain. When PPARs are activated by ligands, they heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) and then bind to specific sequences on the DNA referred to as PPAR response elements (PPREs) to activate the transcription of target genes. PPARα is expressed in liver, heart, muscle, and kidney where it stimulates FA catabolism. PPARγ is highly enriched in adipocyte and macrophage. It is the primary member of this family involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipid storage, and glucose homeostasis. In contrast to the other two family members, PPARδ is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues including liver and its function in lipid metabolism has recently begun to gain intensive interest (14Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The facts that dietary fatty acids are natural activators of PPARs and that fatty acyl-CoAs, the products of ACSL family enzymes, are substrates for most downstream metabolic pathways led us to hypothesize the existence of an intrinsic molecular link between ACSL and PPARs. Consistent with this hypothesis, PPARα has been identified as the molecular mediator for fenofibrate-stimulated expression of ACSL1 mRNA in rat hepatocytes, Fa-32 hepatoma cells, and in liver and adipose tissue through a PPRE motif embedded in the ACSL1 promoter region (17Schoonjans K. Watanabe M. Suzuki H. Mahfoudi A. Krey G. Wahli W. Grimaldi P. Staels B. Yamamoto T. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19269-19276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the regulatory mechanism for ACSL3 expression in liver tissue, we asked whether PPAR was involved in the OSM-induced activation of ACSL3 gene transcription. Here, we show that OSM induced coordinated increases in ACSL3 and PPARδ mRNA expression in HepG2 cells, whereas the mRNA expression of PPARα and PPARγ was not affected by OSM treatment. Through a battery of molecular and cellular assays we demonstrate, for the first time, that ACSL3 is a molecular target of PPARδ in liver cells and PPARδ is involved in the OSM-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ACSL3. PPARδ regulates ACSL3 gene transcription through its binding to two imperfect PPRE motifs that are located in close proximity in the region −944 to −915 relative to the transcription start site (TSS). Finally, we provide in vivo evidence demonstrating that the hepatic expression of ACSL3 mRNA and protein were increased by ligand-mediated activation of PPARδ in hamsters. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO), 1 mm streptomycin, and 1 mm penicillin. Rabbit antibody against hamster ACSL3 was generated as described previously (9Wu M. Liu H. Chen W. Fujimoto Y. Liu J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anti-PPARδ (sc-7197) and anti-histone deacetylase (sc-7872) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal anti-β-actin and anti-γ-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma. PPARα agonist WY-14643 was obtained from Sigma and PPARγ agonist 15d-PGJ2 and PPARδ agonist L165041 were obtained from AXXORA (La Jolla, CA). The plasmid (PPRE)3-tk-luc was generously provided by Dr. Jun-ichi Abe, University of Rochester School of Medicine. A series of unidirectional deletion constructs of human ACSL3 gene promoter luciferase reporters were made using the phACSL3Luc plasmid as the template, which contains a DNA fragment 3600 bp upstream of the TSS of the ACSL3 gene (18Minekura H. Kang M.J. Inagaki Y. Suzuki H. Sato H. Fujino T. Yamamoto T.T. Gene. 2001; 278: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The desired promoter region was amplified by PCR. The gel-purified PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) initially and subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at the KpnI and XhoI sites. The PPRE mutant reporter (PPREmu) was generated using the pACSL3-1116 plasmid as template, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the respective oligonucleotides as described below. The mutated nucleotides are in bold and underlined: PPREMU1F, 5′-GGCTGGCTCAGGAAGGCAGGGTTTCACCTACTTAAGGAAAAG-3′; PPREMU1R, 5′-CTTTTCCTTAAGTAGGTGAAACCCTGCCTTCCTGAGCCAGCC-3′; PPREMU2F, 5′-GGGTTTCACCTACTTAAGGAAACCAACACAGGCAAACTAAAC-3′; PPREMU2R, 5′-GTTTAGTTTGCCTGTGTTGGTTTCCTTAAGTAGGTGAAACCC-3′. The nucleotide sequence and correct orientation of each deletion or mutation reporter was verified by DNA sequencing. ACSL3 promoter reporters of wild-type, deletion, and mutation were cotransfected with a control Renilla luciferase expression vector (pRL-SV40) to normalize for transfection efficiency in a DNA ratio of 200:1. To measure OSM or agonist effects, 1 day post-transfection, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with OSM (100 ng/ml) or PPARδ agonist L165041 (25 μm) for 16 h prior to cell lysis for dual luciferase activity measurements. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity in each sample. Three to five separate transfections were conducted for each reporter in which 3–6 wells were used for each condition. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells or hamster livers using UltraspecTM total RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories). Two μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using random primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed on the cDNA using an ABI Prism 7900-HT Sequence Detection System. Human ACSL3, PPARα, PPARγ, PPARδ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pre-developed TaqMan Assay Reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used to assess mRNA expression in HepG2 cells with or without treatment. The relative ACSL3 and CPT1A mRNA levels in hamster livers were measured with SYBR PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) using hamster-specific primers (9Wu M. Liu H. Chen W. Fujimoto Y. Liu J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All values are reported as mean ± S.D. of triple measurements of each cDNA sample. Pre-designed siRNAs targeted to human PPARδ mRNA (catalog number AM51331; ID 5465), PPARα mRNA (catalog number AM51331; ID 5348), and Silencer Negative control siRNA with a scrambled sequence (catalog number 4618G) were obtained from Ambion. Another PPARδ siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon (catalog number L-003435-00-005; ID 5467). For promoter activity analyses, HepG2 cells in suspension were mixed with siRNA in the SilencerTM siRNA transfection reagent for 10 min according to the vendor's instructions and plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. Twenty-four h later, cells were transfected with phACSL3Luc and pRL-SV40. Transfectants were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h prior to the addition of L165041 at a concentration of 10 μm. Cells were harvested 24 h later for measuring dual luciferase activities. For real time PCR, 1 × 105 cells were mixed with siRNA in the Silencer siRNA transfection reagent for 10 min and plated in 12-well plates. After 2 days, transfected cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum overnight and then treated with OSM overnight prior to cell lysis. The coding region of human PPARδ cDNA was amplified by PCR from a full-length cDNA clone (ID 3630487) obtained from Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL. The amplified cDNA product was gel-purified using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax topo TA vector (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pHis-PPARδ. The sequence and orientation of the insert were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression of His-tagged PPARδ in HepG2 cells after transient transfection was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-His antibody. ACSL3 protein expression in HepG2 cells and hamster livers was assessed by Western blot analysis using a rabbit antibody recognizing the C-terminal region of the hamster ACSL3. This anti-ACSL3 antibody also specifically recognized ACSL3 of human, mouse, and rat origins (9Wu M. Liu H. Chen W. Fujimoto Y. Liu J. Lipids. 2009; 44: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PPARδ protein expression in nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells was detected by rabbit anti-PPARδ antibody (sc-7197) from Santa Cruz. The specific immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL plus kit (GE Healthcare) and quantified with the Kodak Molecular Imaging Software (Kodak). HepG2 cells were untreated or treated with 25 μm L165041 for 24 h. The cell lysate preparation and ACSL3 activity assay were conducted as previously described (13Zhou Y. Abidi P. Kim A. Chen W. Huang T.T. Kraemer F.B. Liu J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared as described (19Li H. Chen W. Zhou Y. Abidi P. Sharpe O. Robinson W.H. Kraemer F.B. Liu J. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 820-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide, designated as ACSL3-PPRE, was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Human recombinant proteins RXRα (catalog number 31133) was obtained from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) and PPARδ (catalog number 10007451) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The identities of PPARδ and RXRα were confirmed by Western blots using rabbit anti-PPARδ polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-7197) and rabbit anti-RXRα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-553), respectively (data not shown). For visualizing band shift, 150 ng of PPARδ and 50 ng of RXRα recombinant proteins were incubated together with labeled ACSL3 probe in a binding buffer containing 0.75 mm EDTA, 18 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol in a final volume of 20 μl. For supershift assays, 1 μg of anti-PPARδ antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-7197x) was used. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts, each binding reaction was composed of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 30 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl. The nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.4 to 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled ACSL3-PPRE (1 × 105 cpm) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× TBE buffer at 30 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and visualized on a PhosphorImager. For competition assays, 100× unlabeled ACSL3-PPRE, ACSL3-PPREmu, or PPRE (a double-stranded nucleotide containing a consensus PPRE sequence motif), or a nonspecific oligonucleotide containing a Sp1 binding site, was added to the reaction mixture. The sense sequences of electrophoretic mobility shift assay probe and competitors are as follows: ACSL3-PPREwt, 5′-GAAGGCAACCTTTCACCTACTTAAGGAAAAGTTCACAGGC-3′; ACSL3-PPREmu, 5′-GAAGGCAGGGTTTCACCTACTTAAGGAAACCAACACAGGC-3′; PPRE, 5′-GGGCGAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAAGG-3′; and nonspecific, 5′-TTTGAAAATCACCCCACTGCAAACTCCTCCCCCTGCT-3′. The mutated nucleotides are bold and underlined. The ChIP assays were conducted according to the described protocol using aliquots of lysate obtained from 2 × 107 HepG2 cells (20Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 1.42% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were lysed and the chromatin was sheared to an average length of 0.2–1 kb by the sonication method for 15 min in an ultrasonic water bath. Samples were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with 2 μg of rabbit anti-PPARδ antibody (sc-7197X) or rabbit IgG as negative control. Immunocomplexes were isolated by binding to protein A-agarose beads after extensive washing with the immunoprecipitation buffer. Chelex 100 slurry was added to the washed beads, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant contained the sheared chromatin. An aliquot of the sheared chromatin was used in the PCR as a control for the amount of input DNA used in precipitations and diluted 10-fold prior to PCR. The bound and the input DNA were analyzed by PCR with primers that amplify a 164-bp fragment of the human ACSL3 promoter region −1020 to −857, relative to the TSS. The sequences of ChIP primers are: ACSL3-ChIP primer forward, 5′-CAAGTTCTGGCGGCTTCCTG-3′; ACSL3 ChIP primer reverse, 5′-CCCAGTACTAGTAGGATTGGTCTC-3′. In the ChIP assay, a 238-bp promoter fragment corresponding to the −3600 to −3363 region of the ACSL3 promoter upstream sequence lacking a PPRE motif was also PCR amplified as a negative control. Sequences of the control primers are: ACSL3-ChIP primer 1 forward, 5′-GATCTAGCTGGGATTGTTGATGAAGG-3′; and ACSL3 ChIP primer 1 reverse, 5′-CTATTCTGAAAATCCTAGGGCCC-3′. The PCR conditions included a denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and extended at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Intensities of the PCR products were scanned and quantified with the Kodak Image Station 1000 System. Additionally, real time quantitative PCR was performed using the two primer sets and chromatin DNA contained in the immunoprecipitates. Eighteen male Golden Syrian hamsters with body weights of 100–120 g were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. Hamsters were housed (3 animals/cage) under controlled temperature (72 °F) and lighting (12 h light/dark cycle). Animals had free access to autoclaved water and normal rodent chow diet. L165041 was dissolved in a vehicle containing 0.25% carboxyl methylcellulose sodium and 5% Triton X-100 at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (21Choi K.C. Lee S.Y. Yoo H.J. Ryu O.H. Lee K.W. Kim S.M. Baik S.H. Choi K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After an acclimatization period of 7 days, hamsters were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group was given a daily dose of 10 mg/kg of L165041 intraperitoneally, and the other group was given an equal volume of vehicle intraperitoneally. The treatment lasted for 7 days. Overnight fasting serum was collected before and after the drug treatment. Four h after the last drug treatment, all animals were sacrificed. Livers were immediately removed, cut into small pieces, and stored at −80 °C for RNA and protein isolations. To measure serum total cholesterol (TC) and TG levels, blood samples (0.2 ml) were collected from the retro-orbital plexus using heparinized capillary tubes under anesthesia (2–3% isoflurane and 1–2 liters/min of oxygen) after a 16-h fast (5 p.m. to 9 a.m.) before and after drug treatments. Serum was isolated at room temperature and stored at −80 °C. Standard enzymatic methods were used to measure TC and TG by using commercially available kits purchased from Stanbio Laboratory (TX). Each sample was assayed in duplicate. Animal use and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Significant differences between control and treatment groups or between wild-type and mutated vectors were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post test where applicable. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To explore a possible role of PPARs in OSM-induced activation of ACSL3 gene transcription, we first examined the mRNA levels of PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ along with ACSL3 in HepG2 cells without and with OSM treatments of 8 and 24 h by real time RT-PCR assay (Fig. 1A). OSM at a concentration of 50 ng/ml increased ACSL3 mRNA 1.8-fold and PPARδ mRNA 2.2-fold at 8 h. At 24 h, OSM increased ACSL3 mRNA 2.6-fold and PPARδ mRNA 3.7-fold. By contrast, the changes in PPARα mRNA fluctuated during the OSM treatment with a reduction at 8 h and returned to the baseline at 24 h; and the mRNA expression of PPARγ was only slightly elevated by OSM treatment to 1.4-fold of control after 24 h. These results demonstrated that among the three subtypes of PPARs, PPARδ mRNA expression appeared to be coordinately induced with ACSL3 mRNA expression by OSM in HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis to detect ACSL3 and PPARδ protein expression in control and OSM-treated cells showed that both ACSL3 and PPARδ protein levels were increased by the OSM treatment (Fig. 2B), thereby confirming the results of mRNA analysis. Actin was used as a protein loading control for total cell lysate and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was a control for nuclear extracts, both of which were not affected by the OSM treatment.FIGURE 2Activation of PPARδ leads to increased ACSL3 expression.A, HepG2 cells were treated with different doses of L165041 for 16 h.

https://openalex.org/W2017329606,"The appearance of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere via oxygenic photosynthesis required strict anaerobes and obligate phototrophs to cope with the presence of this toxic molecule. Here we show that in the anoxygenic phototroph Rubrivivax gelatinosus, the terminal oxidases (cbb(3), bd, and caa(3)) expand the range of ambient oxygen tensions under which the organism can initiate photosynthesis. Unlike the wild type, the cbb(3)(-)/bd(-) double mutant can start photosynthesis only in deoxygenated medium or when oxygen is removed, either by sparging cultures with nitrogen or by co-inoculation with strict aerobes bacteria. In oxygenated environments, this mutant survives nonphotosynthetically until the O(2) tension is reduced. The cbb(3) and bd oxidases are therefore required not only for respiration but also for reduction of the environmental O(2) pressure prior to anaerobic photosynthesis. Suppressor mutations that restore respiration simultaneously restore photosynthesis in nondeoxygenated medium. Furthermore, induction of photosystem in the cbb(3)(-) mutant led to a highly unstable strain. These results demonstrate that photosynthetic metabolism in environments exposed to oxygen is critically dependent on the O(2)-detoxifying action of terminal oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W2064530685,"Background The role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) has been shown to differ in two different mouse models of asbestos and bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis. RAGE knockout (KO) mice get worse fibrosis when challenged with asbestos, whereas in the bleomycin model they are largely protected against fibrosis. In the current study the role of RAGE in a mouse model of silica induced pulmonary fibrosis was investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Wild type (WT) and RAGE KO mice received a single intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of silica in saline or saline alone as vehicle control. Fourteen days after treatment mice were subjected to a lung mechanistic study and the lungs were lavaged and inflammatory cells, protein and TGF-β levels in lavage fluid determined. Lungs were subsequently either fixed for histology or excised for biochemical assessment of fibrosis and determination of RAGE protein- and mRNA levels. There was no difference in the inflammatory response or degree of fibrosis (hydroxyproline levels) in the lungs between WT and RAGE KO mice after silica injury. However, histologically the fibrotic lesions in the RAGE KO mice had a more diffuse alveolar septal fibrosis compared to the nodular fibrosis in WT mice. Furthermore, RAGE KO mice had a significantly higher histologic score, a measure of affected areas of the lung, compared to WT silica treated mice. A lung mechanistic study revealed a significant decrease in lung function after silica compared to control, but no difference between WT and RAGE KO. While a dose response study showed similar degrees of fibrosis after silica treatment in the two strains, the RAGE KO mice had some differences in the inflammatory response compared to WT mice. Conclusions/Significance Aside from the difference in the fibrotic pattern, these studies showed no indicators of RAGE having an effect on the severity of pulmonary fibrosis following silica injury."
https://openalex.org/W1997488270,"Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation requires the activation of members of the Rho family of small GTPases. However, the molecular mechanisms through which NGF regulates cytoskeletal changes and neurite outgrowth are not totally understood. In this work, we identify the Rac1-specific guanine exchange factor (GEF) Tiam1 as a novel mediator of NGF/TrkA-dependent neurite elongation. In particular, we report that knockdown of Tiam1 causes a significant reduction in Rac1 activity and neurite outgrowth induced by NGF. Physical interaction between Tiam1 and active Ras (Ras-GTP), but not tyrosine phosphorylation of Tiam1, plays a central role in Rac1 activation by NGF. In addition, our findings indicate that Ras is required to associate Tiam1 with Rac1 and promote Rac1 activation upon NGF stimulation. Taken together, these findings define a novel molecular mechanism through which Tiam1 mediates TrkA signaling and neurite outgrowth induced by NGF."

This technique, called postuptake binding, revealed previously unknown aspects of TonB-dependent transport reactions. The experiments showed, for the first time, that despite the discrepancy in cell envelope concentrations of FepA and TonB (∼35:1), all FepA proteins were active and equivalent in FeEnt uptake, with a maximum turnover number of ∼5/min. FepA-mediated transport of FeEnt progressed through three distinct phases with successively decreasing rates, and from its temperature dependence, the activation energy of the OM stage was 33–35 kcal/mol. The accumulation of FeEnt in the periplasm required the binding protein and inner membrane permease components of its overall transport system; postuptake binding assays on strains devoid of FepB, FepD, or FepG did not show uptake of FeEnt through the OM. However, fluorescence labeling data implied that FepA was active in the ΔfepB strain, suggesting that FeEnt entered the periplasm but then leaked out. Further experiments confirmed this futile cycle; cells without FepB transported FeEnt across the OM, but it immediately escaped through TolC.

In contrast with MT1-MMP, the structurally similar MT6-MMP associates with the lipid raft compartment of the plasma membrane using a GPI anchor. As a result, MT6-MMP is functionally distinct from MT1-MMP. MT6-MMP is insufficiently characterized as yet. In addition, a number of its biochemical features are both conflicting and controversial. To reassess the biochemical features of MT6-MMP, we have expressed the MT6-MMP construct tagged with a FLAG tag in breast carcinoma MCF-7 and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. We then used phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to release MT6-MMP from the cell surface and characterized the solubilized MT6-MMP fractions. We now are confident that cellular MT6-MMP partially exists in its complex with TIMP-2. Both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are capable of inhibiting the proteolytic activity of MT6-MMP. MT6-MMP does not stimulate cell migration. MT6-MMP, however, generates a significant level of gelatinolysis of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled gelatin and exhibits an intrinsic, albeit low, ability to activate MMP-2. As a result, it is exceedingly difficult to record the activation of MMP-2 by cellular MT6-MMP. Because of its lipid raft localization, cellular MT6-MMP is inefficiently internalized. MT6-MMP is predominantly localized in the cell-to-cell junctions. Because MT6-MMP has been suggested to play a role in disease, including cancer and autoimmune multiple sclerosis, the identity of its physiologically relevant cleavage targets remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2005381697,"In eukaryotes, DNA replication is fired once in a single cell cycle before cell division starts to maintain stability of the genome. This event is tightly controlled by a series of proteins. Cdt1 is one of the licensing factors and is involved in recruiting replicative DNA helicase Mcm2-7 proteins into the pre-replicative complex together with Cdc6. In Cdt1, the C-terminal region serves as a binding site for Mcm2-7 proteins, although the details of these interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we report the structure of the region and the key residues for binding to Mcm proteins. We determined the solution structure of the C-terminal fragment, residues 450-557, of mouse Cdt1 by NMR. The structure consists of a winged-helix domain and shows unexpected similarity to those of the C-terminal domain of Cdc6 and the central fragment of Cdt1, thereby implying functional and evolutionary relationships. Structure-based mutagenesis and an in vitro binding assay enabled us to pinpoint the region that interacts with Mcm proteins. Moreover, by performing in vitro binding and budding yeast viability experiments, we showed that approximately 45 residues located in the N-terminal direction of the structural region are equally crucial for recognizing Mcm proteins. Our data suggest the possibility that winged-helix domain plays a role as a common module to interact with replicative helicase in the DNA replication-licensing process."

Post-transcriptional regulation of p27Kip1 expression is of significant interest. The embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like RNA-binding protein HuR is thought be important for the translation of p27Kip1, however, different reports attributed diametrically opposite roles to HuR. We report here an alternative mechanism wherein HuR regulates stability of the p27Kip1 mRNA. Specifically, human and mouse p27Kip1 mRNAs interact with HuR protein through multiple U-rich elements in both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR). These interactions, which occur in vitro and in vivo, stabilize p27Kip1 mRNA and play a critical role in its accumulation. Deleting HuR binding sites or knocking down HuR expression destabilizes p27Kip1 mRNA and reduces its accumulation. We also identified a CT repeat in the 5′ UTR of full-length p27Kip1 mRNA isoforms that interact with a ∼41-kDa protein and represses p27Kip1 expression. This CT-rich element and diffuse elements in the 3′ UTR regulate post-transcriptional expression of p27Kip1 at the level of translation.

Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The SCF-independent degradation of p27Kip1 in early G1 has also been suggested (26Malek N.P. Sundberg H. McGrew S. Nakayama K. Kyriakides T.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that p27Kip1 expression is regulated at the level of translation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (22Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 23Agrawal D. Hauser P. McPherson F. Dong F. Garcia A. Pledger W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4327-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). One group has reported that basal and cell cycle-dependent translation of p27Kip1 is stimulated by the embryonic lethal abnormal visual system-like RNA-binding protein HuR binding to the 5′ UTR of p27Kip1 mRNA (27Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas another reported that repression of internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation by HuR in proliferating but not quiescent cells is responsible for cell cycle-dependent expression of p27Kip1 (28Kullmann M. Göpfert U. Siewe B. Hengst L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3087-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). More recently, a p27Kip1 mRNA isoform with an upstream open reading frame has been proposed to be responsible for the cell cycle-dependent regulation of p27Kip1 expression (29Göpfert U. Kullmann M. Hengst L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, an endonuclease binding site in the 5′ UTR of p27Kip1 has been reported, suggesting that mRNA stability may also play a role in regulating the post-transcriptional expression of p27Kip1 (30Zhao Z. Chang F.C. Furneaux H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2695-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although HuR plays a critical role in regulating the stability of several mRNAs (31Guo X. Hartley R.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7948-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Atasoy U. Watson J. Patel D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), these studies failed to ascribe any role to HuR in regulating the stability of p27Kip1 mRNA. Given the critical role of p27Kip1 in the regulation of cell proliferation and cancer patients' outcome, understanding the regulation of its expression is of great interest. We therefore undertook a comprehensive study to investigate cis- and trans-regulatory elements that govern the post-transcriptional expression of p27Kip1. We report here that the p27Kip1 gene generates several transcripts by utilizing alternative transcription start sites and/or polyadenylation signals. Several U-rich elements in the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of p27Kip1 mRNA interact with HuR, whereas a CT repeat region in the 5′ UTR interacts with a 41-kDa protein to regulate basal and cell cycle-dependent post-transcriptional expression of p27Kip1. Specifically, HuR binding elements regulate the stability of p27Kip1 mRNA without a discernible effect on its translation, whereas a CT repeat region, present only in the p27Kip1 mRNA isoforms transcribed from the proximal transcription start sites, interacts with the 41-kDa protein and suppresses translation of p27Kip1 mRNA. We further report that mitogen stimulation of quiescent cells does not reduce the stability of the p27Kip1 protein but inhibits its de novo synthesis by inhibiting the accumulation of the p27Kip1 mRNA. Taken together, our data demonstrate that mRNA stability plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of p27Kip1 expression and that the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of p27Kip1 have distinct roles in the basal and cell cycle-dependent regulation of p27Kip1 expression. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (BCS). NIH 3T3-tTA cells were generated by transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with tetracycline-regulated transactivator (tTA) and selecting colonies by transient transfection with a reporter plasmid encoding for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, driven by the tetracycline response element and cytomegalovirus minimal promoter (34Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). These cells are referred to as NIH 3T3-tTA. Cells were rendered quiescent by reducing BCS to 0.2% for 36 h or to 0.1% for 24 h. Cells were pulsed with 300 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine-cysteine (Met-Cys) for 1 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, lysed, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins (250 μg) were pre-absorbed with a 50-μl protein A-Sepharose slurry (50% w/w) on a rotary shaker for 1 h. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of anti-p27Kip1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight. The antibody-antigen complex was recovered with 20 μl of protein A beads for 1 h, washed three times, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager and developed. For stability studies, quiescent cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met-Cys, washed three times, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented either with 0.2 or 10% BCS and 1 mm Met-Cys for 4, 8, or 12 h. p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated, separated, and visualized as described above. At day 10.5 a mouse embryonic cDNA library in pSPORT1 was obtained in 20 pools (kindly provided by Dr. Frank McKeon). Pools were screened by PCR, positive pools were titered, plated on 10 150-mm agar plates, and replica plated on nitrocellulose membranes. After lysis, denaturation in alkali, and neutralization, the DNA was cross-linked to membranes by UV light, and membranes were hybridized to the 32P-labeled p27Kip1 probe prepared by random labeling the 450-bp fragment of the coding region. Positive colonies were isolated and subjected to two more rounds of screening, and selected colonies were sequenced. The 5′ and 3′ RACE procedure, described in detail under supplemental “Materials and Methods,” was carried out using the GeneRacer kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogene). Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase genes were cloned into a bidirectional pBISA plasmid, created by modifying the pBI Tet Vector (Clontec). 5′ UTR (or fragments thereof) of p27Kip1 were cloned upstream from the firefly luciferase between MluI and NheI sites, whereas 3′ UTRs (or fragments thereof) were cloned between the ClaI and HindIII sites. Mouse p27Kip1 5′ or 3′ UTRs (and fragments thereof) cloned into pHGBf-luc/r-luc were obtained by PCR amplification using the primers or subcloning the digested cDNA fragments as described under supplemental “Materials and Methods.” All plasmids were sequenced to ensure that the intended fusions, mutations, and/or deletions were generated. The plasmids were transfected into NIH 3T3-tTA cells using Effectene (Qiagen) transfection reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA against HuR was obtained as a pool of five siRNAs from Dharmacon and transfected with Effectene reagent. For dual luciferase assay, cells were lysed using 1× passive lysis buffer, and the activity of reporter genes was measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Poly(A) plus RNA was isolated using a Micro-Fast Track kit (Invitrogen), separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked by UV. The membrane was hybridized to specific antisense RNA probes synthesized with the Strip-EZ RNA synthesis kit using the ULTRA-hyb hybridization buffer per the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). Full-length firefly and Renilla luciferases and fragments of 18 S cDNA were cloned into pBS plasmid between PstI and XbaI sites, linearized with BbsI or XcmI to transcribe firefly and Renilla luciferases, respectively, with T3 polymerase. pBS containing an 18 S RNA fragment was digested with XbaI and transcribed using T7 polymerase. A 382-bp fragment (nucleotide 604–906) of mouse p27Kip1 was cloned into the PstI site of pBS by digesting pSPORT1 vector containing mouse p27Kip1 with PstI. The resulting plasmid was linearized with HindIII and transcribed with T3 polymerase. Total RNA was isolated from NIH 3T3-tTA cells using the SV total RNA Isolation System (Promega). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript3 First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed on a light cycler instrument (Bio-Rad) using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green for relative quantification (IQ SYBR Green Supermix). Primers for the firefly luciferase were forward 5′-CGGTAAGACCTTTCGGTACT-3′ and reverse 5′-GATTACGTCGCCAGTCAAGT-3′; for the Renilla luciferase, forward 5′-GTAACGCGGCCTCTTCTTAT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGCTACTGGCTCAATATGT-3′. The relative amount of reporter mRNAs in the samples was calculated from a standard curve obtained with cDNA from NIH 3T3-tTA cells transfected with pHGBf-luc/r-luc vector using 5 concentrations with dilution factor 5. Concentrations of the firefly or Renilla luciferase mRNAs (log dilutions) were plotted to the PCR cycle detected. The data of three independent analyses for each gene and sample were averaged (of triplicates). The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase mRNA in all transfections was normalized to the ratio calculated for the pHGBf-luc/r-luc vector. Western blot analysis was carried out essentially as described (9Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To transcribe radiolabeled p27Kip1 mRNA for cross-linking, p27Kip1 fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into pBS vector between XhoI and SpeI sites or p27Kip1 cDNAs were manipulated to obtain the desired products. Details of the constructs generated and in vitro transcription are described under supplemental “Materials and Methods.” In vitro transcribed [α-32P]UTP and CTP-labeled p27Kip1 mRNA fragments were gel-purified and incubated with NIH 3T3 (for mouse p27Kip1 mRNA fragments) or HeLa cell (for human p27Kip1) nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of and excess of cold p27Kip1 fragments or nonspecific RNA (β-actin ORF). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was cross-linked in UVP cross-linker for 20 min at 254 nm, and the RNA was digested with RNase A. The reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the cross-linked proteins were visualized by PhosphorImager. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins with monoclonal antibodies against a panel of RNA-binding proteins was carried out as described for p27Kip1, except that protein G-Sepharose beads were substituted for protein A-Sepharose beads. For immunoprecipitation analysis, NIH 3T3 cells were harvested and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 45 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in RIPA buffer with a protease inhibitor mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl). Cells were lysed by using 2-s pulses of ultrasound for 30 s followed by a 1-min incubation on ice 4 times. The lysates were centrifuged, and precleared supernatants were incubated with a complex of anti-HuR or anti-hnRNP-A1 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads (HuR 3A2 antibody or cyclin D1 antibody Santa Cruz sc-5261). After centrifugation, the beads were washed 6 times in high-stringency RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, and 1 m urea). Beads were resuspended in Tris/dithiothreitol with RNasin, and incubated at 70 °C for 45 min to reverse the cross-links. The RNA was purified with TRIzol and reverse transcribed for real time reverse transcription-PCR. The primers used for amplification of the p27Kip1 mRNA were forward, 5′-TGGCTCTGCTCCATTTGACTGTCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCACGTTTGACATCTTCCTCCT-CG-3′, the primers used for amplification of 18 S RNA (as a specificity control) were forward, 5′-CGGCGACGACCCATTCGAAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAATCGAACCCTGATTCCCC-GTC-3′. NIH 3T3-tTA cells were transfected HuR siRNA with pHGBr-luc/f-luc plasmid in which firefly luciferase was fused to the 5′ UTR-2-(315–511) and 3′ UTR-2-(1110–2378) of the p27Kip1 mRNA with or without deletion of all three HuR binding sites (in the 5′ and 3′ UTR). Cells were treated with actinomycin D or vehicle 48 h after transfection and harvested at various times. Total RNA was isolated, and endogenous p27Kip1 or reporter mRNAs were quantified by real time PCR. The level of F-luc mRNA was normalized to R-luc mRNA and expressed as percent of F-luc mRNA in untreated cells. NIH 3T3-tTA cells transfected with pHGBr-luc/f-luc or pHGBr-luc/f-luc plasmids in which firefly luciferase was fused to 5′ UTR-2-(315–511) and 3′ UTR-2-(1110–2378) of p27Kip1 mRNA with or without deletion of all three HuR binding sites (in the 5′ and 3′ UTR). Cells were rendered quiescent, half were subsequently serum stimulated, and all were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide 5 min before lysis. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as previously described (35Aktas H. Flückiger R. Acosta J.A. Savage J.M. Palakurthi S.S. Halperin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8280-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged using a Beckman-Coulter SW-41 swinging bucket rotor (Fullerton, CA) in a Beckman-Coulter Optima ultracentrifuge at 32,000 × g for 2 h 30 min at 4 °C, with “slow” acceleration and no braking. Gradients were analyzed with the Brandel gradient fractionators and a SYR-101 syringe pump (Gaithersburg, MD), using a 5-mm path length flow cell and 254-nm filters. Profiles were recorded using an ISCO UA-6 UV detector (Lincoln, NE), all fractions were collected and total RNA was purified from each fraction with TRIzol and prepared for real time reverse transcription-PCR. To monitor expression of p27Kip1 through G0/G1/S phase transition, quiescent cells were serum-stimulated and expression of p27Kip1 was monitored by Western blot. The level of the p27Kip1 protein dropped steadily as cells progressed from G0 to S, reaching minimum levels just before entry into the S phase (Fig. 1A). In contrast, serum withdrawal from already stimulated cells led to a progressive increase in the level of p27Kip1 protein (Fig. 1B). In cells labeled with [35S]Met-Cys at hourly intervals starting 1 h before serum addition, de novo synthesis of p27Kip1 decreased rapidly upon serum stimulation and remained constant after the first 2 h following serum stimulation (Fig. 1C). If de novo synthesis of p27Kip1 is regulated by extracellular signals, the serum withdrawal from already stimulated cells should increase de novo synthesis of p27Kip1. Quiescent cells were stimulated with serum for 5 or 9 h, washed, and incubated in serum-free medium, and de novo p27Kip1 synthesis was measured by a 1-h pulse labeling at hourly intervals starting immediately after serum withdrawal. As expected, de novo synthesis of p27Kip1 in cells stimulated with serum for 5 or 9 h was significantly lower (∼20% of quiescent) compared with quiescent cells (Fig. 1D). Serum withdrawal from these stimulated cells increased p27Kip1 synthesis only in the second hour of labeling (∼60% of quiescent) and reached similar levels observed in quiescent cells in the third hour (Fig. 1D). These data confirm that extracellular signals regulate de novo synthesis of p27Kip1. To determine the role of protein turnover in the regulation of post-transcriptional expression of p27Kip1, we labeled quiescent NIH 3T3 cells with [35S]Met-Cys followed by chasing with cold Met-Cys in the presence or absence of 10% BCS. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, stability of p27Kip1 in quiescent and serum-stimulated cells is fairly similar through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with a calculated half-life of about 4 h. To study cis-regulators of p27Kip1 expression we cloned full-length p27Kip1 cDNA by screening a mouse cDNA library and amplifying mouse and human embryonic cDNA, which should contain all p27Kip1 isoforms, by a modified 5′ and 3′ RACE procedure. Mice express p27Kip1 mRNA isoforms that differ in their 5′ and 3′ UTRs. Different 5′ UTRs are products of alternative transcription start sites, whereas two prevalent 3′ UTRs of 1,268 and 1,988 nucleotides result from utilization of alternative polyadenylation sites. The expression of different p27Kip1 mRNA isoforms was confirmed by Northern blot hybridization of mouse brain and kidney tissue as well as of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). We also obtained one 3′ RACE product with a longer 3′ UTR that may have resulted from both alternative splicing and polyadenylation. This p27Kip1 mRNA isoform must be expressed at very low levels, apparent from its undetectable levels by Northern blot hybridization with probes specific to unique regions of this mRNA. The sequences of mouse p27Kip1 isoforms are provided under supplemental materials. Full-length mouse p27Kip1 cDNA sequence is deposited into GenBank. Surprisingly, accumulation of p27Kip1 mRNA was strongly dependent on the stage of the cell cycle; higher in quiescent and lower in S phase cells (Fig. 3B). Human cells also express several p27Kip1 mRNA isoforms that differ in their 5′ UTR but not coding region or 3′ UTR. The different 5′ UTRs appear to be the product of alternative transcription start sites. The sequence of human p27Kip1 mRNA did not differ from those already deposited in GenBank. Previous reports indicate that the coding region of p27Kip1 mRNA does not regulate post-transcriptional expression of the p27Kip1 protein (27Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We therefore concentrated our efforts on understanding the role of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs on the basal and cell cycle-dependent expression of p27Kip1. Toward this end we fused the 5′ and 3′ UTRs of p27Kip1 mRNA either singularly or in various combinations to the firefly luciferase ORF in pHGBf-luc/r-luc plasmid (control plasmid, see “Materials and Methods” and supplemental Fig. 1A). Renilla luciferase mRNA, transcribed from the same promoter but in the opposite direction and flanked by the same polyadenylation signal, served as an internal control. We used the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity as the readout. Our constructs yielded mRNA products of the expected sizes as confirmed by Northern blot hybridization (supplemental Fig. 1B). Because transcription of both firefly and Renilla luciferases in our constructs is driven by the same promoter-enhancer complex, and polyadenylation is controlled by the same polyadenylation signal, changes in the levels of firefly luciferase mRNA as compared with Renilla luciferase mRNA are likely to be due to the differential stability of the firefly luciferase mRNAs fused to various p27Kip1 5′ and 3′ UTRs. Similarly, changes in the activity of the firefly luciferase without concomitant change in the level of its mRNAs (all normalized to Renilla luciferase) are likely to be due to differential translatability of the firefly luciferase mRNAs imparted to them by the fused p27Kip1 fragments. To identify cis-acting post-transcriptional regulators of p27Kip1 expression, cells were transfected with various constructs, rendered quiescent, and after 24 h one-half was serum stimulated for an additional 12 h. Quiescent and serum-stimulated cells were lysed and reporter activity was assayed by dual luciferase assay (DLR), whereas reporter mRNA levels were determined by real time PCR. Real time PCR was preferred to Northern blot hybridization because fewer cells were required. The longest 5′ UTR was called full-length 5′ UTR (FL-5′ UTR). For 3′ UTR analysis we focused on the two predominant 3′ UTRs, the shorter one (1110–2378) was called 3′ UTR-S and the longer one (1110–3108) 3′ UTR-L for simplicity (see supplemental Fig. S1C for the schematic depiction of 5′ and 3′ UTRs used in these studies). The fusion with full-length p27Kip1 5′ UTR reduced the firefly luciferase expression to a similar extent (about 30%) in both quiescent and serum-stimulated cells compared with control plasmid pHGBf-luc/r-luc (Fig. 4A), with a smaller change in the levels of reporter mRNA (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that the full-length 5′ UTR of p27Kip1 may reduce basal translation of p27Kip1, however, the effect of full-length 5′ UTR on reporter gene expression is rather modest. Fusion of either 3′ UTR-S or 3′ UTR-L of p27Kip1 with firefly luciferase showed two interesting effects. 1) Both 3′ UTR-S and 3′ UTR-L fusions elevated the expression of firefly luciferase mRNA (normalized for Renilla luciferase mRNA) compared with its expression from the control plasmid without a corresponding increase in reporter activity. This finding suggests that both p27Kip1 3′ UTRs suppress basal translation while stabilizing the mRNA. 2) Fusion with either 3′ UTR-S and 3′ UTR-L resulted in a consistent increase in the firefly/Renilla ratio in quiescent compared with serum-stimulated cells. This cell cycle-dependent effect was accounted for by the more pronounced increase in the firefly luciferase mRNA in quiescent compared with s"
https://openalex.org/W1993142407,"Background Previous studies have shown that disruption of GABA signaling in mice via mutations in the Gad1, Gabrb3 or Viaat genes leads to the development of non-neural developmental defects such as cleft palate. Studies of the Gabrb3 and Gad1 mutant mice have suggested that GABA function could be required either in the central nervous system or in the palate itself for normal palatogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings To further examine the role of GABA signaling in palatogenesis we used three independent experimental approaches to test whether Gad1 or Viaat function is required in the fetal CNS for normal palate development. We used oral explant cultures to demonstrate that the Gad1 and Viaat mutant palates were able to undergo palatogenesis in culture, suggesting that there is no defect in the palate tissue itself in these mice. In a second series of experiments we found that the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol could rescue the cleft palate phenotype in Gad1 and Viaat mutant embryos. This suggested that normal multimeric GABAA receptors in the CNS were necessary for normal palatogenesis. In addition, we showed that CNS-specific inactivation of Gad1 was sufficient to disrupt palate development. Conclusions/Significance Our results are consistent with a role for Gad1 and Viaat in the central nervous system for normal development of the palate. We suggest that the alterations in GABA signaling lead to non-neural defects such as cleft palate as a secondary effect due to alterations in or elimination of fetal movements."
https://openalex.org/W2073109871,"Purine transport is essential for malaria parasites to grow because they lack the enzymes necessary for de novo purine biosynthesis. The Plasmodium falciparum Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1 (PfENT1) is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) gene family. PfENT1 is a primary purine transport pathway across the P. falciparum plasma membrane because PfENT1 knock-out parasites are not viable at physiologic extracellular purine concentrations. Topology predictions and experimental data indicate that ENT family members have eleven transmembrane (TM) segments although their tertiary structure is unknown. In the current work, we showed that a naturally occurring polymorphism, F394L, in TM11 affects transport substrate K(m). We investigated the structure and function of the TM11 segment using the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We showed that mutation to Cys of two highly conserved glycine residues in a GXXXG motif significantly reduces PfENT1 protein expression levels. We speculate that the conserved TM11 GXXXG glycines may be critical for folding and/or assembly. Small, cysteine-specific methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents reacted with four TM11 Cys substitution mutants, L393C, I397C, T400C, and Y403C. Larger MTS reagents do not react with the more cytoplasmic positions. Hypoxanthine, a transported substrate, protected L393C, I397C, and T400C from covalent modification by the MTS reagents. Plotted on an alpha-helical wheel, Leu-393, Ile-397, and Thr-400 lie on one face of the helix in a 60 degrees arc suggesting that TM11 is largely alpha helical. We infer that they line a water-accessible surface, possibly the purine permeation pathway. These results advance our understanding of the ENT structure."
https://openalex.org/W2000814843,"Background In October 2007, a cluster of patients experiencing a novel polyradiculoneuropathy was identified at a pork abattoir (Plant A). Patients worked in the primary carcass processing area (warm room); the majority processed severed heads (head-table). An investigation was initiated to determine risk factors for illness. Methods and Results Symptoms of the reported patients were unlike previously described occupational associated illnesses. A case-control study was conducted at Plant A. A case was defined as evidence of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and compatible electrodiagnostic testing in a pork abattoir worker. Two control groups were used - randomly selected non-ill warm-room workers (n = 49), and all non-ill head-table workers (n = 56). Consenting cases and controls were interviewed and blood and throat swabs were collected. The 26 largest U.S. pork abattoirs were surveyed to identify additional cases. Fifteen cases were identified at Plant A; illness onsets occurred during May 2004–November 2007. Median age was 32 years (range, 21–55 years). Cases were more likely than warm-room controls to have ever worked at the head-table (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–26.7), removed brains or removed muscle from the backs of heads (AOR, 10.3; 95% CI, 1.5–68.5), and worked within 0–10 feet of the brain removal operation (AOR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.2–80.0). Associations remained when comparing head-table cases and head-table controls. Workers removed brains by using compressed air that liquefied brain and generated aerosolized droplets, exposing themselves and nearby workers. Eight additional cases were identified in the only two other abattoirs using this technique. The three abattoirs that used this technique have stopped brain removal, and no new cases have been reported after 24 months of follow up. Cases compared to controls had higher median interferon-gamma (IFNγ) levels (21.7 pg/ml; vs 14.8 pg/ml, P<0.001). Discussion This novel polyradiculoneuropathy was associated with removing porcine brains with compressed air. An autoimmune mechanism is supported by higher levels of IFNγ in cases than in controls consistent with other immune mediated illnesses occurring in association with neural tissue exposure. Abattoirs should not use compressed air to remove brains and should avoid procedures that aerosolize CNS tissue. This outbreak highlights the potential for respiratory or mucosal exposure to cause an immune-mediated illness in an occupational setting."

Spectratyping analysis showed a preferential usage of Vβ12 and Vβ6 TCR gene families in 67% of HLA-DRβ1*0403-like genotyped monkeys. Docking of peptide 24112 into the HLA-DRβ1*0401–HA peptide–HA1.7TCR complex containing the VDJ rearrangements identified in fully protected monkeys showed a different structural signature compared to nonprotected monkeys. These striking results show the exquisite specificity of the TCR/pMHCII complex formation needed for inducing sterilizing immunity and provide important hints for a logical and rational methodology to develop multiepitopic, minimal subunit-based synthetic vaccines against infectious diseases, among them malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2122042596,"Although the family of chimaerin Rac-GAPs has recently gained significant attention for their involvement in development, cancer, and neuritogenesis, little is known about their molecular regulation. Chimaerins are activated by the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol via their C1 domain upon activation of tyrosine kinase receptors, thereby restricting the magnitude of Rac signaling in a receptor-regulated manner. Here we identified a novel regulatory mechanism for beta2-chimaerin via phosphorylation. Epidermal growth factor or the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate caused rapid phosphorylation of beta2-chimaerin on Ser(169) located in the SH2-C1 domain linker region via protein kinase Cdelta, which retained beta2-chimaerin in the cytosol and prevented its C1 domain-mediated translocation to membranes. Furthermore, despite the fact that Ser(169) phosphorylation did not alter intrinsic Rac-GAP activity in vitro, a non-phosphorylatable beta2-chimaerin mutant was highly sensitive to translocation, and displayed enhanced association with activated Rac, enhanced Rac-GAP activity, and anti-migratory properties when expressed in cells. Our results not only revealed a novel regulatory mechanism that facilitates Rac activation, but also identified a novel mechanism of cross-talk between diacylglycerol receptors that restricts beta2-chimaerin relocalization and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2028786597,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules play important roles in many biological and pathological processes. During tissue remodeling, the ECM molecules that are glycosylated are different from those of normal tissue owing to changes in the expression of many proteins that are responsible for glycan synthesis. Vitronectin (VN) is a major ECM molecule that recognizes integrin on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The present study attempted to elucidate how changes in VN glycans modulate the survival of HSCs, which play a critical role in liver regeneration. Plasma VN was purified from partially hepatectomized (PH) and sham-operated (SH) rats at 24 h after operation and non-operated (NO) rats. Adhesion of rat HSCs (rHSCs), together with phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, in PH-VN was decreased to one-half of that in NO- or SH-VN. Spreading of rHSCs on desialylated NO-VN was decreased to one-half of that of control VN, indicating the importance of sialylation of VN for activation of HSCs. Liquid chromatography/multiple-stage mass spectrometry analysis of Glu-C glycopeptides of each VN determined the site-specific glycosylation. In addition to the major biantennary complex-type N-glycans, hybrid-type N-glycans were site-specifically present at Asn(167). Highly sialylated O-glycans were found to be present in the Thr(110)-Thr(124) region. In PH-VN, the disialyl O-glycans and complex-type N-glycans were decreased while core-fucosylated N-glycans were increased. In addition, immunodetection after two-dimensional PAGE indicated the presence of hyper- and hyposialylated molecules in each VN and showed that hypersialylation was markedly attenuated in PH-VN. This study proposes that the alteration of VN glycosylation modulates the substrate adhesion to rat HSCs, which is responsible for matrix restructuring."

However, whether McPIP2;1 transports water or another solute and how its activity is regulated are so far unknown. Therefore, wild type (wt) or mutated McPIP2;1 protein was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Then, the osmotic water permeability (Pf) of the oocytes membrane was assessed by hypotonic challenges. Selectivity of McPIP2;1 to water was determined by radiolabeled glycerol or urea uptake assays. Moreover, swelling and in vitro phosphorylation assays revealed that both water permeation and phosphorylation status of McPIP2;1 were significantly increased by the phosphorylation agonists okadaic acid (OA), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and 8-Br-cAMP, and markedly decreased by the inhibitory peptides PKI 14-22 and PKC 20-28, inhibitors of protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC), respectively. Substitution of Ser123 or both, Ser123 and Ser282, abolished the water channel activity of McPIP2;1 while substitution of Ser282 only partially inhibited it (51.9% inhibition). Despite lacking Ser123 and/or Ser282, the McPIP2;1 mutant forms were still phosphorylated in vitro, which suggests that phosphorylation may have a dual role on this AQP. Our results indicate that McPIP2;1 water permeability depends completely on Ser123 and is positively regulated by PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2065308811,"Background The CombiMatrix ElectraSense® microarray is a highly multiplex, complementary metal oxide semiconductor with 12,544 electrodes that are individually addressable. This platform is commercially available as a custom DNA microarray; and, in this configuration, it has also been used to tether antibodies (Abs) specifically on electrodes using complementary DNA sequences conjugated to the Abs. Methodology/Principal Findings An empirical method is described for developing and optimizing immunoassays on the CombiMatrix ElectraSense® microarray based upon targeted deposition of polypyrrole (Ppy) and capture Ab. This process was automated using instrumentation that can selectively apply a potential or current to individual electrodes and also measure current generated at the electrodes by an enzyme-enhanced electrochemical (ECD) reaction. By designating groups of electrodes on the array for different Ppy deposition conditions, we determined that the sensitivity and specificity of a sandwich immunoassay for staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is influenced by the application of different voltages or currents and the application time. The sandwich immunoassay used a capture Ab adsorbed to the Ppy and a reporter Ab labeled for fluorescence detection or ECD, and results from these methods of detection were different. Conclusions/Significance Using Ppy deposition conditions for optimum results, the lower limit of detection for SEB using the ECD assay was between 0.003 and 0.01 pg/ml, which represents an order of magnitude improvement over a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. In the absence of understanding the variables and complexities that affect assay performance, this highly multiplexed electrode array provided a rapid, high throughput, and empirical approach for developing a sensitive immunoassay."
https://openalex.org/W2026856002,"gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease whose cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and the APP intracellular domain. Abeta is widely believed to have a causative role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and therefore modulation of gamma-secretase activity has become a therapeutic goal. Besides APP, more than 50 substrates of gamma-secretase with different cellular functions during embryogenesis as well as adulthood have been revealed. Prior to gamma-secretase cleavage, substrates are ectodomain shedded, producing membrane bound C-terminal fragments (CTFs).Here, we investigated gamma-secretase cleavage of five substrates; APP, Notch1, N-cadherin, ephrinB and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) in membranes isolated from embryonic, young or old adult rat brain by analyzing the release of the corresponding intracellular domains (ICDs) or Abeta40 by western blot analysis and ELISA respectively. The highest levels of all ICDs and Abeta were produced by embryonic membranes. In adult rat brain only cleavage of APP and Notch1 could be detected and the Abeta40 and ICD production from these substrates was similar in young and old adult rat brain. The CTF levels of Notch1, N-cadherin, ephrinB and p75-NTR were also clearly decreased in the adult brain compared to embryonic brain, whereas the APP CTF levels were only slightly decreased.In summary our data suggests that gamma-secretase dependent ICD production is down-regulated in the adult brain compared to embryonic brain. In addition, the present approach may be useful for evaluating the specificity of gamma-secretase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2044689737,"The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite exerts tight control over its ionic composition. In this study, a combination of fluorescent ion indicators and 36Cl− flux measurements was used to investigate the transport of Cl− and the Cl−-dependent transport of “H+-equivalents” in mature (trophozoite stage) parasites, isolated from their host erythrocytes. Removal of extracellular Cl−, resulting in an outward [Cl−] gradient, gave rise to a cytosolic alkalinization (i.e. a net efflux of H+-equivalents). This was reversed on restoration of extracellular Cl−. The flux of H+-equivalents was inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid and, when measured in ATP-depleted parasites, showed a pronounced dependence on the pH of the parasite cytosol; the flux was low at cytosolic pH values < 7.2 but increased steeply with cytosolic pH at values > 7.2. 36Cl− influx measurements revealed the presence of a Cl− uptake mechanism with characteristics similar to those of the Cl−-dependent H+-equivalent flux. The intracellular concentration of Cl− in the parasite was estimated to be ∼48 mm in situ. The data are consistent with the intraerythrocytic parasite having in its plasma membrane a 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid-sensitive transporter that, under physiological conditions, imports Cl− together with H+-equivalents, resulting in an intracellular Cl− concentration well above that which would occur if Cl− ions were distributed passively in accordance with the parasite's large, inwardly negative membrane potential.

In many cell types, acid extrusion mechanisms such as these act in concert with “acid-loading” mechanisms that mediate the uptake of “H+-equivalents,” usually via the export of OH− or HCO3−, often in exchange for Cl− ions. Acid-loading and acid-extruding mechanisms are typically regulated in a coordinated fashion, together ensuring that pHi is maintained within a narrow range (8Boron W.F. Adv. Physiol. Educ. 2004; 28: 160-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There is little known about acid-loading mechanisms in the malaria parasite. Nor have there been any studies of the transport of Cl− across the parasite plasma membrane. An x-ray microanalysis study of the elemental composition of the cytosol of mature, intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites estimated a [K+]:[Na+]:[Cl−] ratio of 1:0.13:0.28 (9Lee P. Ye Z. Van Dyke K. Kirk R.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 39: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). If it is assumed that, as in other cells, the combined concentration of K+ and Na+ is of the order of 150 mm, this gives an estimated cytosolic [Cl−] ([Cl−]i) of ∼40 mm. A normal, uninfected human erythrocyte has a [Cl−]i of 73–95 mm (10Merck E. Clinical Laboratory: 11th Edition of Medico-chemical Investigation Methods. Darmstadt, Germany1974: 528Google Scholar). This may be reduced slightly (by an estimated 12% (9Lee P. Ye Z. Van Dyke K. Kirk R.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 39: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) in erythrocytes infected with mature, trophozoite-stage parasites. The parasitophorous vacuole membrane in which the intracellular parasite is enclosed is thought to be freely permeable to Cl− and other monovalent ions (11Desai S.A. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The [Cl−] at the extracellular surface of the parasite is therefore likely to be in the range 65–85 mm. If Cl− were to distribute passively across the parasite plasma membrane, in accordance with the membrane potential (estimated as −95 mV under physiological conditions (4Allen R.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11264-11272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)), then [Cl−]i is predicted (by the Nernst equation) to be below 3 mm. The fact, that the x-ray microanalysis data indicate that the [Cl−]i is more than an order of magnitude higher than this, is consistent with Cl− being taken up, into the parasite, across its plasma membrane, via a process that maintains [Cl−]i away from electrochemical equilibrium. However, the presence and properties of any such system remain to be demonstrated. Herein we report the functional characteristics of a Cl−-dependent acid-loading mechanism in the plasma membrane of the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite. The physiological characteristics of the system match those of the pathway or pathways mediating Cl− transport into the parasite. The data are consistent with this system serving as a route for the uptake of Cl− into the intracellular parasite, coupling the influx of Cl− to the inward H+ electrochemical gradient. The acetoxymethyl ester form of the fluorescent pH indicator 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), and the fluorescent Cl− indicator N-(6-methoxy-quinolyl) acetoxy ester (MQAE), were obtained from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11264-11272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted on mature trophozoite-stage parasites (36–40 h post invasion). In the majority of experiments, trophozoites were “isolated” from their host erythrocytes by treatment of parasitized erythrocytes with the plant detergent saponin, as described elsewhere (13Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Saponin renders the erythrocyte plasma membrane and parasitophorous vacuole membrane permeable to macromolecules (14Ansorge I. Benting J. Bhakdi S. Lingelbach K. Biochem.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11264-11272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, cells were suspended in a HEPES- and MES-buffered saline containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm MES, and 1 mm MgCl2, at pH 7.4. For “Cl−-free saline” NaCl and KCl were replaced isosmotically either with the equivalent gluconate salts (125 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm potassium gluconate), sulfate salts (100 mm Na2SO4, 4 mm K2SO4) or sucrose (260 mm); in each case MgCl2 was replaced with MgSO4. The cytosolic pH of BCECF-loaded parasites within intact P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes was monitored using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Suspensions of parasitized erythrocyte cultures (1% hematocrit, >10% parasitemia) were loaded with BCECF by incubation with 5 μm of its acetoxymethyl ester for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed by centrifugation (1800 × g, 5 min), resuspended in the HEPES- and MES-buffered saline, then immobilized on polylysine-coated coverslips in a Bioptechs FCS2 perfusion chamber and maintained in the HEPES- and MES-buffered saline at 22 °C. The fluorescence signals from parasitized erythrocytes were collected on a Zeiss Pascal confocal laser scanning microscope through a Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.2 numerical aperture water objective. Excitation of BCECF was performed using an argon ion laser at 488 nm. Emitted light was collected through a 560 nm long pass filter from a 543 nm dichroic mirror. Photobleaching (the irreversible damage of BCECF, producing a less fluorescent species) was assessed by continuous exposure (5 min) of loaded cells to laser illumination. For each experiment, the laser illumination and microscope settings that gave no reduction in signal were used. Data capture and extraction were carried out with Zeiss Pascal software and Photoshop. Measurements of pHi were calibrated in situ using the nigericin/high-K+ method (16Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar) as described previously for malaria parasites (2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Bray P.G. Janneh O. Raynes K.J. Mungthin M. Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Wünsch S. Sanchez C. Gekle M. Kersting U. Fischer K. Horrocks P. Lanzer M. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1997; 99: 44-50Google Scholar). The pHi of parasites isolated from their host cells by saponin permeabilization of the erythrocyte and parasitophorous vacuole membranes was measured at 22 °C using BCECF in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorometer as described previously (2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The parasites were suspended at a cell density of 1–3 × 107 cells/ml. Measurements of pHi were calibrated using the nigericin/high-K+ method (2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For experiments in which the anion transport inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) was added to isolated parasites, pHi was calibrated in both the presence and absence of the inhibitor. In initial experiments it was found that the effect of DIDS varied with cell density; subsequent experiments with this reagent were therefore conducted using cell suspensions with a density close to 2 × 107 cells/ml. In a number of experiments parasites were suspended in a glucose-free medium to deplete them of ATP, thereby halting metabolism and inactivating the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Glucose was replaced with 10 mm Na+-salt to maintain the osmolality, and the parasites were incubated under these conditions for at least 15 min at 37 °C prior to beginning the experiment. In one series of experiments, the effect on pHi of removal of extracellular Cl− was investigated under conditions in which the initial pHi was set to a range of different values. BCECF-loaded parasites, de-energized by preincubation in glucose-free medium, were equilibrated for 15 min in a weakly buffered saline (155 mm NaCl/5 mm KCl/2 mm HEPES/2 mm Tris/2 mm MES/1 mm MgCl2) in which the pH ranged from 6.5 to 8.0. Under these conditions pHi approached pHo. The cells were then diluted 1:100 into a well buffered Cl−-free saline (125 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm MES, and 1 mm MgSO4) at pH 7.1, giving a final extracellular Cl− concentration of 1.62 mm. The ability of the parasite to respond to either an intracellular alkali load or an intracellular acid load was investigated by the addition of either 40 mm NH4+ (added as 40 mm NH4Cl or 20 mm (NH4)2SO4 (2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)) or 40 mm sodium lactate (7Elliott J.L. Saliba K.J. Kirk K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), respectively. The buffering capacity of the parasite cytosol at 22 °C was determined using parasites that were preincubated in the absence of Cl− and glucose. The cells were preincubated for at least 15 min at a range of pHo values (as above), then 2.5 mm (NH4)2SO4 was added. Intracellular buffering power (βi) was calculated by determining the difference between the observed change in pH induced by (NH4)2SO4 and that predicted to occur in the absence of intracellular buffering (19Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). βi was plotted as a function of pHi, and the data were fitted by the equation, βi = 19 + 56 (pHi −7.4)2 mm/pH unit, which was subsequently used for the calculation of H+-equivalent transport rates from the measured rate of change of pHi. In one series of experiments the pH of the digestive vacuole of the parasite was monitored qualitatively (i.e. without calibration) using suspensions of saponin-isolated parasites in which the digestive vacuole had been loaded with the membrane-impermeant fluorescent pH indicator, fluorescein-dextran, as described previously (20Saliba K.J. Allen R.J. Zissis S. Bray P.G. Ward S.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 36Cl− uptake into isolated parasites was measured at 22 °C using techniques described previously for other solutes (7Elliott J.L. Saliba K.J. Kirk K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, saponin-isolated trophozoite-stage parasites were suspended in a HEPES-buffered saline (125 mm NaCl/5 mm KCl/20 mm glucose/25 mm HEPES/1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.1). Aliquots (200 μl) of this cell suspension (typically 10 × 107 cells/ml) were mixed gently with an equal volume of HEPES-buffered saline containing ∼1 μCi/ml 36Cl−, over a 300-μl oil layer (5 parts dibutyl phthalate:4 parts dioctyl phthalate) in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. After an appropriate incubation period the tubes were centrifuged (15,800 × g, 2 min) to sediment the parasites through the oil layer, thereby terminating the uptake of 36Cl−. The cell pellets were processed for scintillation counting as described elsewhere (13Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In presenting the results of 36Cl− influx experiments, the amount of 36Cl− taken up by the parasite is expressed as the “distribution ratio” [36Cl−]i/[36Cl−]o; i.e. the estimated concentration of 36Cl− within the parasite ([36Cl−]i) relative to that in the extracellular solution ([36Cl−]o). Cellular 36Cl− uptake was calculated from the total radioactivity present in the cell pellet by subtracting the amount of radioactivity trapped in the extracellular space between the pelleted cells. The latter was estimated from the amount of radioactivity associated with pellets centrifuged from suspension immediately after (i.e. within 1–2 s of) combining the isolated parasites and 36Cl−. [36Cl−]i was calculated from the 36Cl− uptake and the total intracellular water space of the cell pellet. The latter was determined from the parasite number and the water space of a single saponin-isolated parasite, estimated previously to be 28 fl (13Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Isolated trophozoites were loaded with the fluorescent Cl− indicator MQAE by incubation with a 5 mm concentration of the dye for 45 min at 37 °C in RPMI. The cells were then washed three times at 22 °C and suspended in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.1. The cell suspension was transferred to a cuvette, and Cl− activity was measured at 22 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorometer (excitation 350 nm, emission 460 nm). Calibration was performed using a double ionophore technique described previously (21Krapf R. Berry C.A. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 955-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in standard [Cl−] solutions containing 5 μm nigericin and 10 μm tributyltin chloride. The Cl− standards were prepared by mixing, in varying ratios, two K+-rich solutions, one containing Cl− (130 mm KCl/20 mm glucose/25 mm HEPES/1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.1) and the other Cl−-free (130 mm potassium gluconate/20 mm glucose/25 mm HEPES/1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.1). MQAE is able to permeate cell membranes, and a slight reduction in fluorescence intensity of MQAE-loaded trophozoites was observed over time as the dye leaked slowly from the cells. The rate of the fluorescence change associated with this dye loss remained approximately constant throughout each experiment. In experiments in which MQAE fluorescence was monitored over a sustained period of time, specifically those experiments giving rise to Fig. 13B, the reduction in fluorescence intensity associated with dye leakage was subtracted from the data prior to the final conversion of MQAE fluorescence to [Cl−]i. Initial experiments investigating the effect of removal of extracellular Cl− (Cl−o) on pHi of mature parasites within intact erythrocytes were carried out using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fig. 1A shows the distribution of BCECF fluorescence in an infected erythrocyte. Fluorescence was distributed uniformly in the parasite cytosol but was largely absent from the parasite's internal digestive vacuole. For infected erythrocytes bathed in a HEPES- and MES-buffered, Cl−-containing medium (pH 7.4) the resting pHi of trophozoites was estimated as 7.44 ± 0.01 (mean ± S.E., n = 4). Upon replacement of Cl−o with gluconate, there was a rapid alkalinization of the parasite cytosol, with pHi reaching a value of 7.81 ± 0.12 (mean ± S.E., n = 4) within 2 min (Fig. 1B). Restoration of Cl− (132 mm) to the extracellular medium resulted in an acidification, with pHi returning to close to its original value within 2 min. In erythrocytes, replacement of extracellular Cl− with an impermeant anion (such as gluconate) results in a rapid alkalinization of the erythrocyte cytosol (22Kummerow D. Hamann J. Browning J.A. Wilkins R. Ellory J.C. Bernhardt I. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Lew V.L. Bookchin R.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); the alkalinization seen in the intraerythrocytic parasite is therefore likely to be due, at least in part, to an increase in the pH of the host cell cytosol. To study the regulation of pHi in the parasite, independently of the host cell, all further pH measurements were made in parasites effectively isolated from their host cells by saponin permeabilization of the erythrocyte and parasitophorous vacuole membranes. Fig. 2A shows the effect on pHi of the removal of Cl−o from a suspension of isolated trophozoites at an extracellular pH (pHo) of 7.1. The initial pHi was 7.32 ± 0.02 (mean ± S.E., n = 8). Upon replacement of extracellular Cl− with gluconate, pHi increased to 7.91 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E., n = 8) within 2 min. Upon restoration of Cl− (40 mm) to the extracellular medium the pHi returned to close to its original value within 2 min. The initial rate of this re-acidification corresponded to a H+-equivalent flux of 63 ± 15 mmol H+/(L cell H2O·min) (mean ± S.E., n = 3). A similar alkalinization of the parasite cytosol was observed when the extracellular Cl− was replaced with SO42− (Fig. 2B) or when the NaCl and KCl in the extracellular medium was replaced isosmotically with sucrose (Fig. 2C). In some cell types, removal of extracellular Cl− results in cell shrinkage (e.g. Refs. 23Lew V.L. Bookchin R.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Graf J. Haddad P. Haeussinger D. Lang F. Ren. Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 11: 202-220PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the increase in pHi that follows the removal of extracellular Cl− might be due to a reduction in parasite volume two series of experiments were carried out. In the first, suspensions of isolated parasites (in Cl−-containing media) were made hypertonic by the addition of increasing concentrations of either NaCl, sodium gluconate, Na2SO4, or sucrose, with the aim of inducing osmotic shrinkage of the parasites. As can be seen from Fig. 3A increasing the concentration of either NaCl or sodium gluconate by up to 150 mm (thereby increasing the extracellular osmolarity by up to 290 mosm, approximately double the original osmolarity, in each case) had no significant effect on pHi. Addition to the medium of up to 300 mm sucrose (thereby increasing the extracellular osmolarity by up to 315 mosm) caused a slight decrease in pHi, whereas addition of up to 150 mm Na2SO4 (thereby increasing the extracellular osmolarity by up to 347 mosm) caused a slight increase in pHi. Together, these data indicate that cell shrinkage per se has little if any effect on pHi in the parasite. In the second series of experiments, the alkalinization seen on replacement of extracellular Cl− isosmotically with gluconate (as in Fig. 2) was compared with that seen when the Cl− solution was replaced with a hypotonic gluconate solution (containing 100 mm gluconate rather than the usual 125 mm gluconate). Reduction of the osmolarity of the medium by ∼50 mosm will result in cell swelling, thereby countering, in part or in whole, any cell shrinkage that might have resulted from the removal of extracellular Cl−. As can be seen from Fig. 3B, the trace observed in the hypotonic (∼273 mosm) gluconate medium was very similar to that observed in the higher osmolarity (322 mosm) medium. These data are again consistent with cell volume changes playing little if any role in the pronounced changes in pHi seen upon removal and re-addition of extracellular Cl−. The 3D7 parasites used throughout this study are chloroquine-sensitive. In the course of this work one other chloroquine-sensitive strain (D10) and two chloroquine-resistant strains (7G8 and K1) of P. falciparum were tested for the effects on pHi of the removal then re-addition of extracellular Cl− (as in Fig. 2). For all four strains, removal of extracellular Cl− resulted in a pronounced alkalinization; the subsequent addition of 40 mm NaCl resulted in pHi returning to its original resting value (as in Fig. 2; data not shown). The phenomenon is therefore present in a range of parasite strains and is unrelated to the chloroquine resistance status of the parasites. In another series of experiments the digestive vacuoles of 7G8 and K1 parasites were loaded with a membrane-impermeant fluorescent pH indicator (fluorescein-dextran) and the pH of the digestive vacuoles thereby monitored as described previously (20Saliba K.J. Allen R.J. Zissis S. Bray P.G. Ward S.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For saponin-isolated parasites the alkalinization of the cytosol seen upon removal of extracellular Cl− was accompanied by an alkalinization of the digestive vacuole (not shown). This phenomenon was not studied in any detail; however, it does rule out the possibility that the cytosolic alkalinization is a consequence of the uptake of H+ by the digestive vacuole as any such uptake would have generated an acidification, rather than an alkalinization, of the digestive vacuole. To investigate whether the alkalinization of the parasite cytosol following the removal of Cl− from the extracellular medium was influenced by the energy status of the cell, the experiment was repeated with parasites preincubated and suspended in glucose-free medium. In the absence of glucose the parasite is rapidly depleted of ATP and is therefore unable to support H+-ATPase activity (1Hayashi M. Yamada H. Mitamura T. Horii T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34353-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Under these conditions pHi decreased to a value close to pHo (pH 7.1 (Fig. 4A)). When Cl−o was replaced with gluconate under glucose-free conditions, there was, again, an alkalinization (Fig. 4A). The alkalinization was substantially slower than that seen for cells in glucose-replete medium (Fig. 4B), with pHi taking 20 min to reach a maximum. Furthermore, the trace for the ATP-depleted parasites appeared sigmoidal, with the rate of alkalinization initially increasing as pHi increased, then slowing as the pHi plateaued at a value (7.91 ± 0.01; mean ± S.E., n = 8) similar to the value observed in ATP-replete cells (p = 0.97, Student's t test). Upon addition of 40 mm NaCl to the (alkalinized) cells in the Cl−-free medium a re-acidification was observed (Fig. 4A) with an initial rate equivalent to a H+-equivalent flux of 48 ± 3 mmol H+/(L cell H2O·min) (mean ± S.E., n = 3). This value was slightly, but not significantly, lower than the re-acidification rate measured in glucose-replete cells (p = 0.423, Student's t test). In one series of experiments ATP-depleted parasites, which had alkalinized upon replacement of extracellular Cl− with gluconate and then re-acidified in response to the addition of 40 mm NaCl (as in Fig. 4A), were subjected to a second round of Cl− replacement. Removal of Cl− from cells that had alkalinized then re-acidified previously caused the cells to undergo a second alkalinization, of similar magnitude to the first. The second alkalinization occurred more rapidly than the first (the time taken was reduced by a factor of up to ∼3; data not shown) but was still much slower than the very rapid alkalinization observed upon removal of Cl− from ATP-replete cells (Fig. 4B). The increased rate of alkalinization observed in ATP-depleted parasites subjected to two rounds of Cl− removal was not investigated further. The parasite's plasma membrane V-type H+-ATPase should be inactive in the ATP-depleted parasites (2Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to rule out a role for the H+-pump in the alkalinization observed upo"
https://openalex.org/W2054858255,"Extracellular recordings of single neurons in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices of monkeys in vivo have shown that their firing rate can increase, decrease, or remain constant in different cells, as the external stimulus frequency increases. We observed similar intrinsic firing patterns (increasing, decreasing or constant) in rat somatosensory cortex in vitro, when stimulated with oscillatory input using conductance injection (dynamic clamp). The underlying mechanism of this observation is not obvious, and presents a challenge for mathematical modelling. We propose a simple principle for describing this phenomenon using a leaky integrate-and-fire model with sinusoidal input, an intrinsic oscillation and Poisson noise. Additional enhancement of the gain of encoding could be achieved by local network connections amongst diverse intrinsic response patterns. Our work sheds light on the possible cellular and network mechanisms underlying these opposing neuronal responses, which serve to enhance signal detection."
https://openalex.org/W2108974882,"Over the last decade a number of species, from farm animals to rodents, have been cloned using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology (SCNT). This technique has the potential to revolutionize the way that genetically modified animals are made. In its current state, the process of SCNT is very inefficient (<5% success rate), with several technical and biological hurdles hindering development. Yet, SCNT provides investigators with powerful advantages over other approaches, such as allowing for prescreening for the desired level of transgene expression and eliminating the excess production of undesirable wild-type animals. The rat plays a significant role in biomedical research, but SCNT has been problematic for this species. In this study, we address one aspect of the problem by evaluating methods of activation in artificially constructed rat embryos.We demonstrate that treatment with a calcium ionophore (ionomycin) combined with a variety of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors is an effective way to activate rat embryos. This is in contrast to methods developed for the mouse embryo, which tolerates much less specific chemical treatments. Methods developed to activate mouse embryos do not translate well to rat embryos.Activation methods developed for one species will not necessarily translate to another species, even if it is closely related. Further, the parthenogenic response to chemical activators is not always a reliable indicator of how reconstructed embryos will react to the same activation method. A better understanding of rat oocyte physiology, although essential for developing better models of disease, may also provide insights that will be useful for making the SCNT process more efficient."
