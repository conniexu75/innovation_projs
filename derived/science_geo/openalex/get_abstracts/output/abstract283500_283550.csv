https://openalex.org/W2075576962,"There are at least ten suggested hypotheses for the function of mobbing predators by fish, birds, and mammals. Experiments with captive European black-birds support one of these-the ""cultural transmission hypothesis."" Perceiving a mobbing conspecific together with a novel, harmless bird induced blackbirds to mob the innocuous object. The mobbing response persisted during subsequent presentations of the novel bird alone, which was more effectively conditioned than an artificial control object. Enemy recognition could be culturally transmitted along a chain of at least six individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2043020306,"Windward reef morphogenesis is a dynamic process directly controlled by the growth potential of dominant corals and coralline algae relative to wave energy and sea level rise. Moderate wave energy favors vertically rapid growth that is porous and uncemented; high wave energy favors slow but compact growth. Growth potentials of Caribbean and Indo-Pacific reefs are probably equivalent. Major differences are probably not due to biological or direct climatic factors but are in part related to differing patterns of sea level rise resulting from Holocene crustal adjustment. The nature and position of antecedent foundations developed by high interglacial and interstadial sea levels is especially critical and is largely controlled by regional tectonic factors, especially long-term subsidence."

https://openalex.org/W1974039179,"An energy input-output model was used to investigate energy and employment in the construction industry. The model covered nearly 400 industrial sectors and was used to determine the impact of construction activities on total national energy consumption in 1967 and to study the patterns of total energy use and employment within various construction categories. For the construction of new buildings, total energy consumption could be reduced by 20 percent by selecting less energy-intensive building materials and assemblies for fixed programmatic requirements, by expending energy in construction to minimize the total lifetime energy cost of buildings, and by energy conservation in industries that supply direct and indirect inputs to the construction sector of the economy."
https://openalex.org/W2004052416,"Two stone tools (a chopper and a retouched flake) were found in mid-Pleistocene channel fills at Sambungmachan (Java), which earlier yielded a hominid skull cap with characteristics of Solo man and a Trinil-like fauna. The artifacts are the first discovered in place in deposits on Java that are assigned to the mid-Pleistocene on faunal grounds."
https://openalex.org/W2020832056,"Accelerator ion counting compares favorably with conventional beta counting. The major advantage of ion counting is that milligram samples can be analyzed. When sample size is not limiting, ion counting complements beta counting for the more routine carbon-14 determinations. Further development is needed before ion counting can achieve the same high precision as beta counting for large samples (± 2 per mil). A solution to the background variability has to be found before ion counting can be used to date samples back to the 75,000-year limit of beta counting."

https://openalex.org/W1983461470,"Whole rock potassium-argon ages for samples of subsurface basalt recovered near Charleston, South Carolina, are interpreted to indicate a Triassic or Jurassic age for the basalt and underlying sedimentary red beds. This age is consistent with existing evidence indicating that an early Mesozoic basin is present in the subsurface of a large part of the coastal plain of South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Alabama."

https://openalex.org/W1979728184,The plate tectonics model of the Pacific moving northwest relative to North America implies that the regional strain in California should be simple shear across a vertical plane striking N45°W or equivalently equal parts of north-south contraction and east-west extension. Measurements of the strain accumulation at seven separate sites in southern California in the interval 1972 through 1978 indicate a remarkably consistent uniaxial north-south contraction of about 0.3 part per million per year; the expected east-west extension is absent. It is not clear whether the period from 1972 through 1978 is anomalous or whether the secular strain in southern California is indeed a uniaxial north-south contraction.

This device is interesting because the operating wavelength can be set at will by variation of the electron energy and the device is potentially capable of operating at high average power."
