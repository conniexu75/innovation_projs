https://openalex.org/W4289780574,"Human gut commensals are increasingly suggested to impact non-communicable diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), yet their targeted suppression remains a daunting unmet challenge. In four geographically distinct IBD cohorts (n = 537), we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains, featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature, to be strongly associated with disease exacerbation and severity. Transfer of clinical IBD-associated Kp strains into colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized mice enhances intestinal inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phage combination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp clade members through distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp suppression in colitis-prone mice, driving an attenuated inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-concept assessment of Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthy volunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience, safety, and viability in the lower gut. Collectively, we demonstrate the feasibility of orally administered combination phage therapy in avoiding resistance, while effectively inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts."
https://openalex.org/W4285405108,"We studied the prevalent cytotoxic CD8 T cell response mounted against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein269-277 epitope (sequence YLQPRTFLL) via the most frequent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I worldwide, HLA A∗02. The Spike P272L mutation that has arisen in at least 112 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages to date, including in lineages classified as ""variants of concern,"" was not recognized by the large CD8 T cell response seen across cohorts of HLA A∗02+ convalescent patients and individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, despite these responses comprising of over 175 different individual T cell receptors. Viral escape at prevalent T cell epitopes restricted by high frequency HLAs may be particularly problematic when vaccine immunity is focused on a single protein such as SARS-CoV-2 Spike, providing a strong argument for inclusion of multiple viral proteins in next generation vaccines and highlighting the need for monitoring T cell escape in new SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4289793560,"Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest known genetic risk factor for developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease. How the interaction of APOE4 microglia with neurons differs from microglia expressing the disease-neutral APOE3 allele remains unknown. Here, we employ CRISPR-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dissect the impact of APOE4 in neuron-microglia communication. Our results reveal that APOE4 induces a lipid-accumulated state that renders microglia weakly responsive to neuronal activity. By examining the transcriptional signatures of APOE3 versus APOE4 microglia in response to neuronal conditioned media, we established that neuronal cues differentially induce a lipogenic program in APOE4 microglia that exacerbates pro-inflammatory signals. Through decreased uptake of extracellular fatty acids and lipoproteins, we identified that APOE4 microglia disrupts the coordinated activity of neuronal ensembles. These findings suggest that abnormal neuronal network-level disturbances observed in Alzheimer's disease patients harboring APOE4 may in part be triggered by impairment in lipid homeostasis in non-neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W4289780991,"Live bacterial therapeutics (LBTs) could reverse diseases by engrafting in the gut and providing persistent beneficial functions in the host. However, attempts to functionally manipulate the gut microbiome of conventionally raised (CR) hosts have been unsuccessful because engineered microbial organisms (i.e., chassis) have difficulty in colonizing the hostile luminal environment. In this proof-of-concept study, we use native bacteria as chassis for transgene delivery to impact CR host physiology. Native Escherichia coli bacteria isolated from the stool cultures of CR mice were modified to express functional genes. The reintroduction of these strains induces perpetual engraftment in the intestine. In addition, engineered native E. coli can induce functional changes that affect physiology of and reverse pathology in CR hosts months after administration. Thus, using native bacteria as chassis to “knock in” specific functions allows mechanistic studies of specific microbial activities in the microbiome of CR hosts and enables LBT with curative intent."
https://openalex.org/W4289793458,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potentially unlimited resource for cell therapies, but the derivation of mature cell types remains challenging. The histone methyltransferase EZH1 is a negative regulator of lymphoid potential during embryonic hematopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that EZH1 repression facilitates in vitro differentiation and maturation of T cells from iPSCs. Coupling a stroma-free T cell differentiation system with EZH1-knockdown-mediated epigenetic reprogramming, we generated iPSC-derived T cells, termed EZ-T cells, which display a highly diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and mature molecular signatures similar to those of TCRαβ T cells from peripheral blood. Upon activation, EZ-T cells give rise to effector and memory T cell subsets. When transduced with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), EZ-T cells exhibit potent antitumor activities in vitro and in xenograft models. Epigenetic remodeling via EZH1 repression allows efficient production of developmentally mature T cells from iPSCs for applications in adoptive cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4289780969,"Transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) controls dopamine release through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on dopaminergic axons. Anatomical studies suggest that cholinergic terminals signal predominantly through non-synaptic volume transmission. However, the influence of cholinergic transmission on electrical signaling in axons remains unclear. We examined axo-axonal transmission from CINs onto dopaminergic axons using perforated-patch recordings, which revealed rapid spontaneous EPSPs with properties characteristic of fast synapses. Pharmacology showed that axonal EPSPs (axEPSPs) were mediated primarily by high-affinity α6-containing receptors. Remarkably, axEPSPs triggered spontaneous action potentials, suggesting that these axons perform integration to convert synaptic input into spiking, a function associated with somatodendritic compartments. We investigated the cross-species validity of cholinergic axo-axonal transmission by recording dopaminergic axons in macaque putamen and found similar axEPSPs. Thus, we reveal that synaptic-like neurotransmission underlies cholinergic signaling onto dopaminergic axons, supporting the idea that striatal dopamine release can occur independently of somatic firing to provide distinct signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4289792154,"Intestinal homeostasis is underpinned by LGR5+ve crypt-base columnar stem cells (CBCs), but following injury, dedifferentiation results in the emergence of LGR5−ve regenerative stem cell populations (RSCs), characterized by fetal transcriptional profiles. Neoplasia hijacks regenerative signaling, so we assessed the distribution of CBCs and RSCs in mouse and human intestinal tumors. Using combined molecular-morphological analysis, we demonstrate variable expression of stem cell markers across a range of lesions. The degree of CBC-RSC admixture was associated with both epithelial mutation and microenvironmental signaling disruption and could be mapped across disease molecular subtypes. The CBC-RSC equilibrium was adaptive, with a dynamic response to acute selective pressure, and adaptability was associated with chemoresistance. We propose a fitness landscape model where individual tumors have equilibrated stem cell population distributions along a CBC-RSC phenotypic axis. Cellular plasticity is represented by position shift along this axis and is influenced by cell-intrinsic, extrinsic, and therapeutic selective pressures."
https://openalex.org/W4289793548,"Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on niche factors for their proper function. However, the source of these ISC niche factors and how they support ISCs in vivo remain controversial. Here, we report that ISCs depend on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and RSPO3+GREM1+ fibroblasts (RGFs). In the intestine and colon, LECs are surrounded by RGFs and are located near ISCs at the crypt base. Both LECs and RGFs provide the critical ISC niche factor RSPO3 to support ISCs, where RSPO3 loss in both cell types drastically compromises ISC numbers, villi length, and repair after injury. In response to injury, LEC and RGF numbers expand and produce greater amounts of RSPO3 and other growth/angiocrine factors to foster intestinal repair. We propose that LECs represent a novel niche component for ISCs, which together with RGFs serve as the major in vivo RSPO3 source for ISCs in homeostasis and injury-mediated regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4289953905,"The usage of the green synthesis method to produce nanoparticles (NPs) has received great acceptance among the scientific community in recent years. This, perhaps, is owing to its eco-friendliness and the utilization of non-toxic materials during the synthesizing process. The green synthesis approach also supplies a reducing and a capping agent, which increases the stability of the NPs through the available phytochemicals in the plant extractions. The present study describes a green synthesis method to produce nano-silica (SiO2) NPs utilizing Rhus coriaria L. extract and sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO3.5H2O) under reflux conditions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added to the mixture to control the pH of the solution. Then, the obtained NPs have been compared with the chemically synthesized SiO2 NPs. The structure, thermal, and morphological properties of the SiO2 NPs, both green synthesized and chemically synthesized, were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). Also, the elemental compassion distribution was studied by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In addition, the zeta potential, dynamic light scatter (DLS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the stability, thermal properties, and surface area of the SiO2 NPs. The overall results revealed that the green synthesis of SiO2 NPs outperforms chemically synthesized SiO2 NPs. This is expected since the green synthesis method provides higher stability, enhanced thermal properties, and a high surface area through the available phytochemicals in the Rhus coriaria L. extract."
https://openalex.org/W4289793564,"The intestinal epithelium undergoes continuous renewal and has an exceptional capacity to regenerate after injury. Maintenance and proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are regulated by their surrounding niche, largely through Wnt signaling. However, it remains unclear which niche cells produce signals during different injury states, and the role of endothelial cells (ECs) as a component of the ISC niche during homeostasis and after injury has been underappreciated. Here, we show that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) reside in proximity to crypt epithelial cells and secrete molecules that support epithelial renewal and repair. LECs are an essential source of Wnt signaling in the small intestine, as loss of LEC-derived Rspo3 leads to a lower number of stem and progenitor cells and hinders recovery after cytotoxic injury. Together, our findings identify LECs as an essential niche component for optimal intestinal recovery after cytotoxic injury."
https://openalex.org/W4289525691,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Previously, we demonstrated that HPV16 oncogene E6 or E6/E7 transduction increases the abundance of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), but OGT substrates affected by this increase are unclear. Here, we focus on the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on HPV-positive HNSCCs. We found that upon HPV infection, Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), an autophagy-initiating kinase, is hyper-O-GlcNAcylated, stabilized, and linked with autophagy elevation. Through mass spectrometry, we identified that ULK1 is O-GlcNAcylated at Ser409, which is distinct from the previously reported Thr635/Thr754 sites. It has been demonstrated that PKCα mediates phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser423, which attenuates its stability by shunting ULK1 to the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway. Using biochemical assays, we demonstrate that ULK1 Ser409Ser410 O-GlcNAcylation antagonizes its phosphorylation at Ser423. Moreover, mutations of Ser409A and its neighboring site Ser410A (2A) render ULK1 less stable by promoting interaction with the CMA chaperone HSC70 (heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein). Furthermore, ULK1-2A mutants attenuate the association of ULK1 with STX17, which is vital for the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database reveals that ULK1 is upregulated in HPV-positive HNSCCs, and its level positively correlates with HNSCC patient survival. Overall, our work demonstrates that O-GlcNAcylation of ULK1 is altered in response to environmental changes. O-GlcNAcylation of ULK1 at Ser409 and perhaps Ser410 stabilizes ULK1, which might underlie the molecular mechanism of HPV-positive HNSCC patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W4289968987,"In the United States (U.S.), a hepatitis E virus (HEV) seroprevalence between 6 and 21% has been described, with a decreasing trend. We aimed to investigate HEV infection in the U.S. population from 2009 to 2016, and examine the differences in seroprevalence using different assays. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-CDC) to estimate HEV seroprevalence and analyze demographic variables related to the infection. Additionally, we compared 4 serological tests used. The estimated HEV seroprevalence between 2009–2016 was 6.1% (95% CI: 5.6%-7.0%) for IgG and 1.02% (0.8%-1.2%) for IgM. Higher HEV IgG prevalences were found in older people, females, non-Hispanic Asians and those born outside of the U.S. The in-house immunoassay and the Wantai HEV-IgG ELISA presented the highest sensitivity values in the tested population. The highest specificity values corresponded to the DSI-EIA-ANTI-HEV-IgG assay. The kappa statistical values showed concordances no greater than 0.64 between the assays. HEV prevalence in our study was similar to previously reported, and a decline in the prevalence was observed through the NHANES assessments (from 1988 to 2016). The sensitivity and specificity of the assays varied widely, making comparisons difficult and highlighting the need to develop a gold standard assay."
https://openalex.org/W4289526815,"Cholesterol is one of the essential intrauterine factors required for fetal growth and development. Maternal high cholesterol levels are known to be detrimental for offspring health. However, its long-term effect on offspring skeletal development remains to be elucidated. We performed our studies in two strains of mice (C57BL6/J and Swiss Albino) and human subjects (65 mother-female newborn dyads) to understand the regulation of offspring skeletal growth by maternal high cholesterol. We found that mice offspring from high-cholesterol-fed dams had low birth weight, smaller body length, and delayed skeletal ossification at the E18.5 embryonic stage. Moreover, we observed that the offspring did not recover from the reduced skeletal mass and exhibited a low bone mass phenotype throughout their life. We attributed this effect to reduced osteoblast cell activity with a concomitant increase in the osteoclast cell population. Our investigation of the molecular mechanism revealed that offspring from high-cholesterol-fed dams had a decrease in the expression of ligands and proteins involved in hedgehog signaling. Further, our cross-sectional study of human subjects showed a significant inverse correlation between maternal blood cholesterol levels and cord blood bone formation markers. Moreover, the bone formation markers were significantly lower in the female newborns of hypercholesterolemic mothers compared with mothers with normal cholesterolemic levels. Together, our results suggest that maternal high cholesterol levels deleteriously program offspring bone mass and bone quality and downregulate the hedgehog signaling pathway in their osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W4289526755,"2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental contaminant that induces diverse biological and toxic effects, including reprogramming intermediate metabolism, mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. However, the specific reprogramming effects of TCDD are unclear. Here, we performed targeted LC-MS analysis of hepatic extracts from mice gavaged with TCDD. We detected an increase in S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine, a conjugate from the spontaneous reaction between the cysteine sulfhydryl group and highly reactive acrylyl-CoA, an intermediate in the cobalamin (Cbl)-independent β–oxidation-like metabolism of propionyl-CoA. TCDD repressed genes in both the canonical Cbl-dependent carboxylase and the alternate Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathways as well as inhibited methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) at lower doses. Moreover, TCDD decreased serum Cbl levels and hepatic cobalt levels while eliciting negligible effects on gene expression associated with Cbl absorption, transport, trafficking, or derivatization to 5′-deoxy-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), the required MUT cofactor. Additionally, TCDD induced the gene encoding aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1), the enzyme responsible for decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconate, and dose-dependently increased itaconate levels in hepatic extracts. Our results indicate MUT inhibition is consistent with itaconate activation to itaconyl-CoA, a MUT suicide inactivator that forms an adduct with adenosylcobalamin. This adduct in turn inhibits MUT activity and reduces Cbl levels. Collectively, these results suggest the decrease in MUT activity is due to Cbl depletion following TCDD treatment, which redirects propionyl-CoA metabolism to the alternate Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathway. The resulting hepatic accumulation of acrylyl-CoA likely contributes to TCDD-elicited hepatotoxicity and the multihit progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental contaminant that induces diverse biological and toxic effects, including reprogramming intermediate metabolism, mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

Adverse effects elicited by exposure to toxic substances are not only influenced by the dose, route of administration, and exposure duration but also genetic, epigenetic, and other systemic factors. Cellular responses to xenobiotic insults are essential to minimize damage and ensure survival. Adaptive effects such as cytochrome P450 induction metabolize and facilitate xenobiotic detoxification and excretion, while immune cell infiltration expedites damaged cell removal with metabolic reprogramming supporting increased glutathione biosynthesis. This culminates in an array of apical responses that may lead to inflammation, repair, proliferation, and/or additional cytotoxicity. Xenobiotics may also trigger the differential expression of genes and modulate enzyme activities that have the potential to qualitatively and quantitatively alter endogenous metabolite profiles with the possibility of mitigating or exacerbating the overall toxic burden (1Klaassen C.D. Casarett L.J. Doull J. Casarett and Doull’s Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons.8th ed. McGraw-Hill Education/Medical, New York, NY2013Google Scholar). Elucidating the role of endogenous metabolic plasticity in response to foreign agents, whether drugs, environmental contaminants, or natural products, is essential to the identification of susceptible cell subtypes and to distinguish adverse from adaptive responses underlying toxic effects (2Paules R. Phenotypic anchoring: linking cause and effect.Environ. Health Perspect. 2003; 111: 338-339Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to discovering potential strategies to reduce off-target toxicity, elucidating the mechanisms involved may reveal novel vulnerabilities for exploitation as innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of adverse drug reactions and diseases with similar pathologies (3Cui Y. Paules R.S. Use of transcriptomics in understanding mechanisms of drug-induced toxicity.Pharmacogenomics. 2010; 11: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The progression of simple, reversible hepatic fat accumulation to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and hepatocyte ballooning describes the typical clinicopathologic spectrum of phenotypes associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In NAFLD, >5% of the cytosolic space within hepatocytes is occupied by lipid droplets in patients where little to no alcohol was consumed and there was no secondary cause involving viral hepatitis, medication, or lipodystrophy (4Friedman S.L. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Rinella M. Sanyal A.J. Mechanisms of NAFLD development and therapeutic strategies.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 908-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). The ‘two-hit’ hypothesis for NAFLD development has evolved into a multiple hit etiology that disrupts several pathways (5Tilg H. Adolph T.E. Moschen A.R. Multiple parallel hits hypothesis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: revisited after a decade.Hepatology. 2021; 73: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). NAFLD prevalence is projected to increase from ∼83 million in 2015 to ∼101 million by 2030 in the US alone, while increasing the risk for more complex disorders including Metabolic Syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6Wree A.

TCDD is the prototypical member of a class of persistent environmental contaminants that includes polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and biphenyls (PCBs).

Although a number of structurally diverse chemicals, endogenous metabolites, microbial products, and natural products activate the AhR, its physiological ligand is unknown. Following ligand binding and the dissociation of chaperone proteins, the activated AhR translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus and dimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator. This heterodimer then binds dioxin response elements (DREs; 5′-GCGTG-3′) as well as nonconsensus sites throughout the genome recruiting coactivator complexes to gene promoters to elicit differential expression (32Avilla M.N. Malecki K.M.C. Hahn M.E. Wilson R.H. Bradfield C.A. The Ah receptor: adaptive metabolism, ligand diversity, and the xenokine model.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2020; 33: 860-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). AHR-mediated toxicity is generally believed to be the result of dysregulated gene expression. However, the consequences of AhR-mediated differential gene expression and the associated effects on intermediate metabolism of endogenous metabolites have not been explored. The emergence of transcriptomics and metabolomics has provided tools to comprehensively assess the time- and dose-dependent impacts of drugs, chemicals, environmental contaminants, and natural products on gene expression and intermediate metabolism as well as resulting pathologies. Several studies have reported the effects of PCDDs, PCDFs, or PCBs on gene expression and/or endogenous metabolite levels in diverse in vivo and in vitro models (14Nault R. Fader K.A. Lydic T.A.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the dose-dependent disruption of propionyl-CoA metabolism produces toxic intermediates that contribute to TCDD hepatotoxicity and progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis. Our results suggest TCDD dose-dependently reduced cobalamin (Cbl aka vitamin B12) levels compromising methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) activity and limiting the metabolism of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA using the canonical Cbl-dependent carboxylation pathway. Consequently, accumulating propionyl-CoA was redirected to the alternate Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathway resulting in the dose-dependent accumulation of acrylyl-CoA, as indicated by the increase in S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine (SCEC), a conjugate produced following the spontaneous reaction between the sulfhydryl group of cysteine and highly reactive acrylyl-CoA. Untargeted metabolomics annotation suggested TCDD-elicited dose-dependent changes in the level of intermediates associated with the Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like metabolism of propionyl-CoA. More specifically, this included the presence of acrylyl-CoA and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA in hepatic extracts following oral gavage with TCDD every 4 days for 28 days (data available at NIH Metabolomics Workbench, ST001379). However, the untargeted annotations were not sufficient to conclude that propionyl-CoA was metabolized via the Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathway. Targeted analysis was unsuccessful in confirming the identity of acrylyl-CoA due to its high reactivity. Alternatively, the presence of acrylyl-CoA was confirmed following the detection of SCEC, a conjugate formed following the spontaneous reaction between acrylyl-CoA and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine (40Kuwajima M.

Hepatic SCEC levels increased 15.6-fold following oral gavage of male mice with 30 μg/kg TCDD every 4 days for 28 days (Table 1). Urine cysteine/cysteamine conjugates with acrylyl-CoA are routinely used to diagnose Leigh syndrome where the conversion of acrylyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA is inhibited due to a deficiency in the short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1) activity (40Kuwajima M.

The increased levels of SCEC not only confirmed acrylyl-CoA accumulation but also ECHS1 inhibition and that propionyl-CoA was metabolized via the alternate Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathway as opposed to the preferred Cbl-dependent carboxylation pathway (41Sato K.

Note that the dose range and treatment regimen used in this study resulted in hepatic TCDD levels that approached steady state while inducing full dose response curves for known AhR target genes (Fig. 1) in the absence of (i) necrosis or apoptosis, (ii) marked increases in serum alanine transaminase, (iii) changes in food consumption, and (iv) body weight loss >15% (35Fader K.A.

At 0.01 μg/kg, hepatic TCDD levels were comparable to control levels and to background dioxin-like compound levels reported in US, German, Spanish, and British serum samples (42Alcock R.E. Behnisch P.A. Jones K.C. Hagenmaier H. Dioxin-like PCBs in the environment - human exposure and the significance of sources.Chemosphere. 1998; 37: 1457-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), while mid-range doses yielded levels comparable to women from the Seveso Health Study (21Warner M. Mocarelli P. Brambilla P. Wesselink A. Samuels S. Signorini S. et al.Diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity in relation to serum dioxin concentrations: the Seveso Women’s Health Study.Environ. Health Perspect. 2013; 121: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At 30 μg/kg TCDD, mouse hepatic tissue levels were comparable to serum levels reported in Viktor Yushchenko following intentional poisoning (43Sorg O. Zennegg M. Schmid P. Fedosyuk R. Valikhnovskyi R. Gaide O. et al.2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) poisoning in Victor Yushchenko: identification and measurement of TCDD metabolites.Lancet. 2009; 374: 1179-1185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consequently, the metabolomics and gene expression effects elicited by TCDD, described below, cannot be attributed to overt toxicity. Figure 2 summarizes the temporal- and dose-dependent effects of TCDD on gene expression associated with propionyl-CoA metabolism. Note that ∼40% of all genes in the mouse genome experience circadian-regulation in at least 1 tissue. Approximately, 11 to 16% of all detected hepatic transcripts and ∼50% of hepatic metabolites exhibit oscillating levels (44Fang B. Everett L. Jager J. Briggs E. Armour S.

Consequently, in addition to providing pDRE, ChIP-seq at 2 h, time course and dose response RNA-seq data collected between zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 to 3, complementary data from a diurnal-regulated study was included in all heatmaps to indicate the ZT for maximal differential gene expression within the 24 h cycle (ZT0-12 lights on; ZT13-24 lights off). TCDD has been reported to dose-dependently abolish oscillating hepatic gene expression and metabolite levels in the liver that are under diurnal control (35Fader K.A. Nault R. Doskey C.M. Fling R.R. Zacharewski T.R. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin abolishes circadian regulation of hepatic metabolic activity in mice.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All reported hepatic fold-changes discussed in the text of this study were taken from the diurnal gene expression data set (GSE119780) at the optimal gene expression ZT unless otherwise indicated. ChIP-seq analysis 2 h after a bolus oral gavage of 30 μg/kg TCDD suggested AhR enrichment may be involved in the repression of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Pcca and Pccb subunits, 2.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively), short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (Echs1, 1.5-fold), and alcohol dehydrogenase iron containing 1 (Adhfe1, 2.2-fold) (Fig. 2, B and C). No AhR enrichment was detected for aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1 (Aldh6a1, 2.2-fold) despite repression by 30 μg/kg TCDD (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the effects of TCDD on gene expression associated with both pathways were negligible within the 168 h time course study. TCDD disrupted the rhythmic expression of Pcca, Echs1, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (Hibch), and Adhfe1, all of which exhibited oscillating expression due to diurnal regulation. At 30 μg/kg, TCDD repressed Pcca and Pccb of the Cbl-dependent carboxylation pathway suggesting propionyl-CoA metabolism was redirected to the alternative Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathway. Although 30 μg/kg TCDD also repressed genes associated with the alternative pathway, the expression of short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acads) was not affected by treatment, allowing propionyl-CoA to be oxidized to acrylyl-CoA. This suggested TCDD-elicited gene repression may contribute to the redirection of propionyl-CoA metabolism from the preferred Cbl-dependent carboxylation pathway to the alternate Cbl-independent β–oxidation-like pathway at the highest dose. Elevated levels of acrylyl-CoA and 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP), as well as their derivatives, are not normally detected at appreciab"

Recruitment of L onto the nucleocapsid depends on the viral phosphoprotein P, which is an essential L cofactor. A prerequisite for genome and antigenome encapsidation is the presence of the monomeric, RNA-free, neosynthesized N protein, named N0. Stabilization of N0 depends on the binding of the N-terminal residues of P to its surface, which prevents N oligomerization. However, the mechanism involved in the transition from N0-P to nucleocapsid assembly, and thus in the specificity of viral genome encapsidation, is still unknown. Furthermore, the specific role of N oligomerization and RNA in the morphogenesis of viral factories, where viral transcription and replication occur, have not been elucidated although the interaction between P and N complexed to RNA has been shown to be responsible for this process. Here, using a chimeric protein comprising N and the first 40 N-terminal residues of P, we succeeded in purifying a recombinant N0-like protein competent for RNA encapsidation in vitro. Our results showed the importance of RNA length for stable encapsidation and revealed that the nature of the 5′ end of RNA does not explain the specificity of encapsidation. Finally, we showed that RNA encapsidation is crucial for the in vitro reconstitution of pseudo-viral factories.

The Mononegavirales order includes many human pathogenic viruses such as those responsible for rabies, measles, mumps, haemorrhagic fevers due to Ebola or Nipah viruses, and respiratory diseases induced by human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), or parainfluenza viruses (1Rima B.

All these viruses have a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome that is constitutively encapsidated by the nucleoprotein N, forming the nucleocapsid (NC). This NC serves as a template for the viral polymerase L responsible for both viral transcription and replication (2Collins P.L. Crowe J.E.

Polymerases of paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses.Virus Res. 2017; 234: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the vast majority of these viruses, transcription and replication are cytoplasmic, occurring in viral factories which are viro-induced organelles called inclusion bodies (IBs) (4Guseva S.

It is also recognized as a major cause of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised and elderly people (14Falsey A.R. Hennessey P.A. Formica M.A. Cox C. Walsh E.E.

Management of RSV infections in adult recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Blood. 2011; 117: 2755-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Currently, no vaccine is available, and the only specific treatment against HRSV is prophylactic, consisting of injection of humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against the fusion protein F (palivizumab, Sinagis) (17Collins P.L. Melero J.A. Progress in understanding and controlling respiratory syncytial virus: still crazy after all these years.Virus Res. 2011; 162: 80-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, the efficacy of this treatment is controversial and its high cost limits its prescription to at-risk children. The HRSV genome is approximatively 15.2 kb long and contains 10 genes encoding 11 proteins (2Collins P.L. Crowe J.E. Respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1601-1646Google Scholar). Replication and transcription rely on 4 of these proteins: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L which exhibits all the enzymatic activities required for viral replication and transcription, its cofactor, the phosphoprotein P responsible for the recruitment of L on the NC, the nucleoprotein N involved in genome and antigenome encapsidation, and the transcription factor M2-1 that has been described as an “antiterminating” factor during transcription and interacts with P and viral mRNA. During transcription, the polymerase L recognizes the leader sequence at the 3′ end of the genome, and the polymerase is guided by the gene start (gs) and gene end (ge) sequences flanking each gene in the viral genome. The neosynthesized viral mRNAs are capped and methylated at the 5′ end and polyadenylated at the 3′ end by the polymerase. It is noteworthy that the synthesis of all viral mRNAs depends on the presence of the M2-1 protein, which is required for L processivity along the genome (18Collins P.L. Hill M.G. Camargo E. Grosfeld H. Chanock R.M. Murphy B.R. Production of infectious human respiratory syncytial virus from cloned cDNA confirms an essential role for the transcription elongation factor from the 5' proximal open reading frame of the M2 mRNA in gene expression and provides a capability for vaccine development.Proc.

Role of the M2-1 transcription antitermination protein of respiratory syncytial virus in sequential transcription.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5852-5864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of M2-1 is still poorly understood. However, it has recently been shown that RSV mRNAs concentrate with M2-1 in specific subcompartments of IBs called IBs-associated granules (8Rincheval V. Lelek M. Gault E. Bouillier C. Sitterlin D. Blouquit-Laye S. et al.Functional organization of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 563Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggesting that the M2-1–mRNA interaction may promote the release of mRNAs from the polymerase L. On the contrary, replication of the viral genome only depends on L, P, and the NC. In that case, the polymerase recognizes the leader or the trailer sequences at the 3′ end of the genome or antigenome respectively, and the RNA synthesis starts at the first nucleotide and the polymerase proceeds through the ge and gs sequences to the end of the genome (or antigenome) (20Noton S.L.

Genomes and antigenomes, which have a triphosphate 5′ end (22Hefti E. Bishop D.H. The 5' nucleotide sequence of vesicular stomatitis viral RNA.J.

Encapsidation of genome and antigenome thus prevents the formation of double strand RNAs but also their degradation as well as their detection by cellular sensors of the innate immune system.

The RNA binds within a groove formed by the interface between the 2 globular domains of N (NNTD and NCTD) that are separated by a flexible hinge region. The N protein also possesses 2 N- and C-terminal extensions (N- and C-arms) that are involved in N oligomerization: the N-arm of the Ni protomer binds to the Ni-1 protomer, whereas the C-arm of Ni binds to the top of the NCTD of the Ni+1 protomer (24Bakker S.E.

RNA encapsidation therefore depends on both direct interaction with RNA and the ability of N to oligomerize, 2 mechanisms that are closely coupled. When expressed alone, the Mononegavirales N proteins all show a strong tendency to encapsidate cellular RNAs. This implies that viral replication depends on the ability to maintain a pool of RNA-free monomeric N, termed N0, available for the specific encapsidation of genomic and antigenomic RNAs. It is now well established that all these viruses share a common mechanism, with the neosynthesized N being maintained in the N0 form by P which acts as a molecular chaperone (28Leyrat C.

Notably, N0 is characterized by a rotation of NNTD relative to NCTD compared to the oligomeric form and a stacking of the C-terminal arm of N into the positively charged RNA groove that blocks RNA binding (30Esneau C.

However, the mechanism involved in the switch from N0 to N-RNA, which regulates specific encapsidation of genomes and antigenomes remains poorly characterized. In addition to their critical role in viral polymerase function, N and P have been shown to be the scaffold proteins responsible for IBs morphogenesis (38Garcia J. Garcia-Barreno B. Vivo A.

Importantly, the P protein (241 residues long), which forms tetramers through its central oligomerization domain (residues 131–151) flanked by highly disordered N- and C-terminal domains (PNTD and PCTD respectively) that are involved in multiple protein–protein interactions, plays a central role in regulating polymerase activity as well as in IBs formation.

Both the length of the PCTD and its interaction with N complexed to RNA are required for efficient IBs morphogenesis. However, the importance of N oligomerization and of RNAs in the morphogenesis of IBs remains to be characterized. In this study, we investigated the specificity of RNA encapsidation by HRSV N. Using a fusion protein between the full-length N and the peptide derived from the first 40 N-terminal residues of P (P40) responsible for chaperone activity on N0, we managed to purify a recombinant monomeric and RNA-free N-P40 chimeric protein. The resulting N-P40 protein was competent for in vitro RNAs encapsidation, the length of RNAs being critical for stable oligomerization, and invariably leading to the formation of N-RNA rings under the conditions tested. Furthermore, using this N-P40 protein, we revealed that RNA encapsidation is critical for the morphogenesis of pseudo-IBs in vitro. Recently, a strategy based on coexpression of PNTD with His-tagged N in E. coli allowed the purification of a N0–PNTD complex competent for encapsidation (47Gao Y. Cao D. Ahn H.M. Swain A. Hill S.

Given the low affinity of P peptide for N (37Galloux M. Gabiane G. Sourimant J. Richard C.A. England P.

Virol. 2015; 89: 3484-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which could lead to the loss of peptide upon purification and thus to N aggregation, we chose here to use a strategy based on the expression of a fusion protein between His-tagged full-length N and the 40 N-terminal residues of P (P40) in E. coli (Fig. 1A). This approach was previously used to determine the crystal structure of the N0–P complexes of HMPV (31Renner M. Bertinelli M. Leyrat C. Paesen G.C. Saraiva de Oliveira L.F. Huiskonen J.T. et al.Nucleocapsid assembly in pneumoviruses is regulated by conformational switching of the N protein.eLife. 2016; 5e12627Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), measles virus (34Guryanov S.G.

Virol. 2018; 92: e01304-e01317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After purification of this chimeric protein in the presence of 1 M NaCl, the sample was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography, following the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, and compared to the profile of purified WT N (Nwt) forming N-RNA rings (46Galloux M. Tarus B. Blazevic I. Fix J. Duquerroy S. Eleouet J.F. Characterization of a viral phosphoprotein binding site on the surface of the respiratory syncytial nucleoprotein.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 8375-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The elution profile of N-P40 showed 2 peaks (Fig. 1B). The major P1 peak with A260nm/A280nm ratio >1 and apparent mass of ∼500 kDa (estimated from the Superdex 200 calibration profile), of slightly smaller size than N-RNA rings, that could correspond to N-RNA oligomers or aggregates. A minor P2 peak presented A260nm/A280nm ratio <1 and apparent mass of ∼50 kDa, as expected for monomeric RNA-free N-P40 protein. The fractions of P1 or P2 peaks were pooled, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue and by band shift assay on native agarose gel and compared to the sample corresponding to purified Nwt. As shown on Figure 1C (upper panel), as analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the presence of a single band with a molecular weight close to 45 kDa for Nwt sample and of 50 kDa for P1 and P2 peaks were observed, consistent with the expected mass of the Nwt and the N-P40 protein, respectively. On native agarose gel, the Nwt complexed to RNA and thus negatively charged clearly migrated within the gel. The N-P40 from the P1 peak migrated with a single band, close to the band observed for Nwt, suggesting that N-P40 could oligomerize as rings (Fig. 1C, lower panel). On the contrary, N-P40 from the P2 peak poorly migrated within the gel and in the opposite direction. We then focused on the sample from P2 peak which was dialyzed to 300 mM NaCl and concentrated up to 1.5 mg/ml. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of the sample revealed the presence of a major protein peak near 6.7 mm in diameter that should correspond to monomers and a minor peak of oligomers near 17 nm in diameter (Fig. 1D). These data revealed that in our conditions, N-P40 tended to aggregate or oligomerize upon concentration and led us to work with a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. We finally analyzed the secondary and tertiary structures of N-P40 by circular dichroism (CD), using as previously Nwt purified as N-RNA rings as a control. The far-UV spectra of both N-P40 and Nwt showed peaks at 208 and 222 nm, typical of secondary structures with predominant α-helical content (Fig. 1E). The peak intensity shift observed for N-P40 revealed a lower helical content than Nwt. This observation correlates with the insertion of linkers in the N-P40 constructs, which are expected to be unfolded. The near-UV CD allows the detection of signals from aromatic residues engaged in a rigid chiral environment, consistent with the presence of a tertiary structure. The detection of a broad signal around 280 nm for the N-P40 protein can be attributed to the signal from Tyr and Trp residues and validates that the protein has a tertiary structure (Fig. 1F). In comparison, the spectrum obtained for Nwt revealed an intense positive signal between 260 and 280 nm, which can be attributed to the presence of RNA masking the signals from the aromatic residues of N. Overall, these results show that N-P40 can be purified as a monomeric and RNA-free protein and that the fusion of P40 does not have a major impact on N folding. This"

However, using a pharmacological approach to generate human MKs from somatic cells remains an unmet challenge. Here, we report that a combination of four small molecules (4M) successfully converted human cord blood erythroblasts (EBs) into induced MKs (iMKs). The iMKs could produce proplatelets and release functional platelets, functionally resembling natural MKs. Reprogramming trajectory analysis revealed an efficient cell fate conversion of EBs into iMKs by 4M via the intermediate state of bipotent precursors. 4M induced chromatin remodeling and drove the transition of transcription factor (TF) regulatory network from key erythroid TFs to essential TFs for megakaryopoiesis, including FLI1 and MEIS1. These results demonstrate that the chemical reprogramming of cord blood EBs into iMKs provides a simple and efficient approach to generate MKs and platelets for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4289962217,"Many members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of ubiquitin ligases localize in spherical, membrane-free structures collectively referred to as cytoplasmic bodies (CBs) in a concentration-dependent manner. These CBs may function as aggresome precursors or storage compartments that segregate potentially harmful excess TRIM molecules from the cytosolic milieu. However, the manner in which TRIM proteins accumulate into CBs is unclear. In the present study, using TRIM32, TRIM5α and TRIM63 as examples, we demonstrated that CBs are in a liquid droplet state, resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This finding is based on criteria that defines phase-separated structures, such as recovery after photobleaching, sensitivity to hexanediol, and the ability to undergo fusion. CB droplets, which contain cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-fused TRIM32, were purified from HEK293 cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. We found that in addition to TRIM32, these droplets contain a variety of endogenous proteins and enzymes including ubiquitin. Localization of ubiquitin within CBs was further verified by fluorescence microscopy. We also found that the activation of the intracellular ubiquitination cascade promotes the assembly of TRIM32 molecules into CBs, whereas inhibition causes suppression. Regulation is dependent on the intrinsic E3 ligase activity of TRIM32. Similar regulation by ubiquitination on the TRIM assembly was also observed with TRIM5α and TRIM63. Our findings provide a novel mechanical basis for the organization of CBs that couples compartmentalization through LLPS with ubiquitination."

Selectivity for Fn by α5β1 is achieved through recognition of an RGD motif in the 10th type III Fn domain (Fn10) and the synergy site in the ninth type III Fn domain (Fn9). However, details of the interaction dynamics are unknown. Here, we compared synergy-site and Fn-truncation mutations for their α5β1-binding affinities and stabilities. We also interrogated binding of the α5β1 ectodomain headpiece fragment to Fn using hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry to probe binding sites and sites of integrin conformational change. Our results suggest the synergistic effect of Fn9 requires both specific residues and a folded domain. We found some residues considered important for synergy are required for stability. Additionally, we show decreases in fibronectin HDX are localized to a synergy peptide containing contacting residues in two β-strands, an intervening loop in Fn9, and the RGD-containing loop in Fn10, indicative of binding sites. We also identified binding sites in the α5-subunit β-propeller domain for the Fn9 synergy site and in the β1-subunit βI domain for Fn10 based on decreases in α5β1 HDX. Interestingly, the dominant effect of Fn binding was an increase in α5β1 deuterium exchange distributed over multiple sites that undergo changes in conformation or solvent accessibility and appear to be sites where energy is stored in the higher-energy, open-integrin conformation. Together, our results highlight regions important for α5β1 binding to Fn and dynamics associated with this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4289526303,"Mitochondrial chelatable iron contributes to the severity of several injury processes, including ischemia/reperfusion, oxidative stress, and drug toxicity. However, methods to measure this species in living cells are lacking. To measure mitochondrial chelatable iron in living cells, here we synthesized a new fluorescent indicator, mitoferrofluor (MFF). We designed cationic MFF to accumulate electrophoretically in polarized mitochondria, where a reactive group then forms covalent adducts with mitochondrial proteins to retain MFF even after subsequent depolarization. We also show in cell-free medium that Fe2+ (and Cu2+), but not Fe3+, Ca2+, or other biologically relevant divalent cations, strongly quenched MFF fluorescence. Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrate in hepatocytes that red MFF fluorescence colocalized with the green fluorescence of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) indicator, rhodamine 123 (Rh123), indicating selective accumulation into the mitochondria. Unlike Rh123, mitochondria retained MFF after ΔΨm collapse. Furthermore, intracellular delivery of iron with membrane-permeant Fe3+/8-hydroxyquinoline (FeHQ) quenched MFF fluorescence by ∼80% in hepatocytes and other cell lines, which was substantially restored by the membrane-permeant transition metal chelator pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone. We also show FeHQ quenched the fluorescence of cytosolically coloaded calcein, another Fe2+ indicator, confirming that Fe3+ in FeHQ undergoes intracellular reduction to Fe2+. Finally, MFF fluorescence did not change after addition of the calcium mobilizer thapsigargin, which shows MFF is insensitive to physiologically relevant increases of mitochondrial Ca2+. In conclusion, the new sensor reagent MFF fluorescence is an indicator of mitochondrial chelatable Fe2+ in normal hepatocytes with polarized mitochondria as well as in cells undergoing loss of ΔΨm."
https://openalex.org/W4289969321,"Background There has been a substantial decline in in-person care in inpatient and outpatient settings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Avoidance of needed in-person care may contribute to an avoidable decline in patient health and an increase in mortality. While several systems and behavioral theories have been put forward to explain the decline, there is a lack of studies informed by patients’ own experiences. The current study applied a socio-ecological model encompassing patient, environmental, and institutional-related variables to examine patient-reported factors associated with avoidance of in-person care. Methods Between October and December 2020, a total of 3840 persons responded to a nationwide online questionnaire that was administered using ResearchMatch and Facebook. Self-reported avoidance of in-person care among those who needed it was the main outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with avoidance of needed care. Findings Out of a total of 3372 respondents who reported that they needed in-person care during the early phase of the pandemic, 257 (7.6%) avoided it. Patient-related variables associated with avoiding needed care included younger age (odds ratio (OR), 1.46, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.94, p&lt;0.01; &lt;45 y/o vs 45+), inability to afford care (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.34, p&lt;0.01), and greater COVID-related stress (OR = 1.36, CI 1.01 to 1.83, p&lt;0.05). More frequent discussions about COVID with family and friends was the only significant environment-related avoidance of care variable (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.01–1.91, p &lt; .05). Institution-related care avoidance variables included a negative patient healthcare experience rating (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.42, p&lt;0.001), poor awareness of the institution’s safety protocol (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.51, p&lt;0.01), and low ratings of the institution’s effectiveness in communicating their safety protocol (OR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.94 to 6.12, p&lt;0.001). The final model predicted 11.9% of the variance in care avoidance. Conclusions These results suggest that care avoidance of in-person care during the initial phase of the pandemic was influenced by a patient’s demographics as well as environmental and healthcare institutional factors. Patients’ previous experiences and their awareness of healthcare systems’ safety protocols are important factors in care avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W4290013617,"Over exploitation of mineral resources has increasingly caused serious heavy metal contamination such as chromium (Cr). Cr(VI), the pathogenicity factor, is one of common environmental contaminants and widely known health hazards to living organisms. Therefore, it is urgent to control the polluted soil. Up to now, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of Cr response in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13. In this study, transcriptome and differentially expressed genes in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13 strain was characterized by a comparison between Cr(VI)-treated sample and control sample using transcriptome sequencing approach. In total, 2974 genes were annotated, including 1245 (1154 down-regulated genes and 91 up-regulated genes) differentially expressed genes (DEGs). All DEGs could be assigned to 29 pathways, of which pathways related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and signal transduction mechanism were significantly enriched in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13. A possible mechanism for Cr toxicity response might be an active efflux which utilized a heavy metal translocating P-type ATPase to lower the intracellular Cr concentration. The down-regulated genes related to the antioxidant defense system had a key role in Cr reduction, such as SodA, Gst, osmC, BtuE, KatE, csdA and AhpC. The proteins that were visibly up-regulated, were likely to involve in alleviating Cr(VI) stress, and the significantly down-regulated genes such as MarR, Lrp, FhlA, GntR, HrcA, LysR family genes, were likely to reduce Cr(VI) induced oxidative stress. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze the expression patterns of some Cr responsive genes. This study reported the first identification of Cr responsive genes, and inferred the underlying regulatory mechanisms of response to Cr(VI) stress in Pseudomonas sp. Cr13."
https://openalex.org/W4290014329,"Rates of cesarean section in Iran are unnecessarily high largely due to fear of childbirth (FOC), yet this may be reduced through education. Iranian women are keen to obtain information about pregnancy and birth online though sources may not be reliable. Consequently, the present study aimed to compare the effect of childbirth preparation courses delivered both online via the social media platform 'Telegram' and in-person on pregnancy experience, FOC, birth preference, and mode of birth.This quasi-experimental study included 165 primiparous pregnant women referred to the prenatal clinic in Tehran, Iran. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants, who were subsequently divided into three groups; (A) social media-based educational intervention (n = 53); (B) in-person educational intervention (n = 52), and (C) a control group who received no prenatal education (n = 50). During the 18th and 20th weeks of pregnancy, demographic questions along with the pregnancy experience scale (PES), and version A of the Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire (WDEQ‑A) were completed. In the 36th and 38th weeks of pregnancy, the PES and WDEQ‑A questionnaires, as well as birth preference form were further completed. Mode of birth was recorded in the first few days of postpartum. The Fisher's exact test, along with ANOVA and Chi-square tests were used to determine associations between variables. A paired t-test was used to examine within-group comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to investigate the intervening effect of economic status.Post intervention, the mean score of pregnancy experience and FOC did not differ significantly between the three groups. Also, 86.8% of participants in group A, 90.4% of participants in group B, and 62% of participants in the control group preferred to give birth vaginally, which was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Moreover, 66% of participants in group A, 61.5% of participants in group B, and 50% of participants in the control group ultimately gave birth vaginally. None of the participants in group A underwent an elective cesarean section, while this rate was 7.7% and 24% for groups B and control, respectively (p = 0.002).Despite the non-significant differences identified between the three groups in terms of pregnancy experience and FOC, prenatal education delivered via social media may be usefully offered to Iranian women keen to receive education flexibly online.Name of the Registry: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials.

https://openalex.org/W4290014414,"Background The Emergency Department (ED) services play a fundamental role in managing the accesses of potential Sars-Cov-2 cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the SARS COV-2 pandemic on pediatric accesses in Emergency Department of Lazio Region. Methods The population includes all pediatric accesses (0–17 years) in the ED of Lazio Region during 2019 and 2020. Accesses were characterized by age, week and calendar period. Four periods were defined: pre-lockdown, lockdown, post-lockdown and the second wave. The trend of ED accesses (total or for specific cause) in 2020 (by period and week) were compared to them occurred in 2019. ED visits have been described by absolute frequency and percentage variation. Percentage variation of adult was also reported to compare the trend in adult and young population. The Chi-square test was used to compare characteristics of admissions in 2019 and 2020. Results There is a large decrease of pediatric accesses in 2020 compared to 2019 (-47%), especially for younger age-classes (1–2 years: -52.5% and 3–5 years: -50.5%). Pediatric visits to ED in 2020 decreased following the same trend of adults, but more drastically (-47% vs -30%). ED accesses for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia trend show different characteristics between children and adults: in adults there is an increase in 2020, especially during the 2 nd wave period (+321%), in children there is a decrease starting from the lockdown period to the achievement of the lowest level in December 2020 (-98%). Conclusions This descriptive study has identified a decrease of total pediatric accesses in ED in 2020 compared to 2019 and a different trend of accesses by adult and young population especially by cause. The monitoring of paediatric accesses could be a useful tool to analyse the trend of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and to reprogramming of the healthcare offer according to criteria of clinical and organizational appropriateness."
https://openalex.org/W4289443996,"Nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) is the most serious form of spermatogenesis abnormalities in male infertility. Genetic factors are important to consider as elements leading to NOA. Although many pathogenic genes have been reported, the causative genes of NOA for many patients are still unknown. In this study, we found ten point mutations in the gene encoding homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 4 (HIPK4) in patients with NOA, and using in vitro studies, we determined a premature termination point mutation (p. Lys490∗, c.1468A>T) that can cause decreased expression of HIPK4. Our phosphoproteomic analysis of Hipk4-/- testes revealed phosphorylation of multiple proteins regulated by HIPK4 during spermiogenesis. We also confirmed that a substrate of HIPK4 with four downregulated phosphorylation sites matching the xSPx motif is the known manchette-related protein RIMS-binding protein 3, which is required for sperm head morphogenesis. Therefore, we conclude HIPK4 regulates the phosphorylation of manchette protein RIMS-binding protein 3 and plays essential roles in sperm head shaping and male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W4289525514,"Natural products constitute and significantly impact many current anti-cancer medical interventions. A subset of natural products induces injury processes in malignant cells that recruit and activate host immune cells to produce an adaptive anti-cancer immune response, a process known as immunogenic cell death. However, a challenge in the field is to delineate forms of cell death and injury that best promote durable antitumor immunity. Addressing this with a single-cell chemical biology natural product discovery platform, like multiplex activity metabolomics, would be especially valuable in human leukemia, where cancer cells are heterogeneous and may react differently to the same compounds. Herein, a new ten-color, fluorescent cell barcoding-compatible module measuring six immunogenic cell injury signaling readouts are as follows: DNA damage response (γH2AX), apoptosis (cCAS3), necroptosis (p-MLKL), mitosis (p-Histone H3), autophagy (LC3), and the unfolded protein response (p-EIF2α). A proof-of-concept screen was performed to validate functional changes in single cells induced by secondary metabolites with known mechanisms within bacterial extracts. This assay was then applied in multiplexed activity metabolomics to reveal an unexpected mammalian cell injury profile induced by the natural product narbomycin. Finally, the functional consequences of injury pathways on immunogenicity were compared with three canonical assays for immunogenic hallmarks, ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin, to correlate secondary metabolite-induced cell injury profiles with canonical markers of immunogenic cell death. In total, this work demonstrated a new phenotypic screen for discovery of natural products that modulate injury response pathways that can contribute to cancer immunogenicity.

In total, this work demonstrated a new phenotypic screen for discovery of natural products that modulate injury response pathways that can contribute to cancer immunogenicity. Small molecule anti-cancer agents are typically discovered via high-throughput target-based approaches or untargeted cytotoxicity screens that reflect essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, cytoskeletal remodeling, or metabolism. Compounds from both discovery paradigms are well represented in the clinic by synthetic compounds and natural products (1Newman D.J. Cragg G.M. Natural products as sources of new drugs from 1981 to 2014.J. Nat. Prod. 2016; 79: 629-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (4126) Google Scholar). For example, imatinib is a synthetic drug developed to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia that blocks nucleotide triphosphate–binding pockets of tyrosine kinases, notably BCR/ABL, to stabilize inactive state complexes and prevent downstream signaling (2Miura M. Therapeutic drug monitoring of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2015; 38: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The natural products anthracyclines and taxanes, initially discovered via cytotoxicity assays, were later observed to interfere with DNA replication and microtubule stability, respectively (3Lown J.W.

Imatinib, anthracyclines, and taxanes are all featured in the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, underlining the complementarity of target-based and phenotypic discovery modes (5World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines – 22nd List, 2021.

In addition to tumor toxicity, some chemotherapeutics are thought to be effective because they trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD is a property of moribund cells that elicits inflammation toward a therapeutically productive adaptive antitumor immune response (6Casares N. Pequignot M.O. Tesniere A. Ghiringhelli F.O.

Notably, combining inflammatory agents that induce ICD with checkpoint blockade therapy enhanced survival in animal models (8Martins I. Michaud M. Sukkurwala A.Q. Adjemian S. Ma Y.

Examples of studied ICD inducers include widely prescribed chemotherapies, such as the anthracycline daunorubicin, peptide actinomycin D, podophyllotoxin teniposide, and platinum-based antineoplastic oxaliplatin (6Casares N.

Immunother. 2020; 69: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ICD can activate both innate and adaptive immune responses via expression of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including secretion of ATP, release of nuclear protein HMGB1, and surface exposure of endoplasmic reticulum resident protein calreticulin (eCRT) to name a few (17Galluzzi L. Vitale I. Warren S. Adjemian S. Agostinis P. Martinez A.B. et al.Consensus guidelines for the definition, detection and interpretation of immunogenic cell death.J. Immunother. Cancer. 2020; 8e000337Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar). These immunogenic DAMPs comprise ‘find me’ and ‘eat me’ signals that trigger recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, that initiate antigen-specific immune responses (17Galluzzi L. Vitale I. Warren S. Adjemian S. Agostinis P. Martinez A.B. et al.Consensus guidelines for the definition, detection and interpretation of immunogenic cell death.J. Immunother. Cancer. 2020; 8e000337Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Recently, the phenomenon of chemically induced antitumor immunity has broadened to include living cells. In these processes, live injured cells facilitate innate and adaptive immunity (11Aaes L. Tania Kaczmarek, A. Delvaeye T. Craene D. Bram Koker, D.

Signal. 2021; 14eabc4764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that additional modes of immunogenic induction remain to be discovered. Herein, the term “immunogenic cell injury” (ICI) refers to all types of immunogenic injury responses in injured or dying cancer cells. Based on these and prior studies (20Liu P. Zhao L. Loos F.

Commun. 2020; 521: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it is apparent that the various forms of chemically induced cell death and injury do not yield comparable immunogenic responses. There is a gap in understanding how cell death and injury pathways connect to the display of DAMPs that elicit therapeutically productive immune responses. Thus, we developed an injury cytometric module composed of fluorescent antibodies that detect molecular injury and stress markers. To expedite the discovery of immunogenic small molecule therapies, the injury module was designed with benchmark secondary metabolites that elicit injury phenotypes (Table S1). The topoisomerase poison etoposide effects DNA double strand breaks detected by phosphorylation of H2AX variant at serine 139 (γH2AX) (23Kuo L.J.

The pan-kinase alkaloid inhibitor staurosporine, a potent apoptotic agent (25Belmokhtar C.A. Hillion J. Ségal-Bendirdjian E.

Irish J.M. et al.Discovery of human cell selective effector molecules using single cell multiplexed activity metabolomics.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Apoptotic activation is required for doxorubicin-induced immunogenicity (6Casares N. Pequignot M.O. Tesniere A. Ghiringhelli F.O. Roux S.P.

Likewise, autophagy and the unfolded protein response are critical injuries for assessing immunogenic potential because they are required for ICD (10Bezu L. Sauvat A. Humeau J. Gomes-Da-Silva L.C.

Additionally, an explosive form of cell death known as necroptosis has gained traction as an immunogenic signal that is dependent on the RIPK–MLKL signaling pathway that is marked by phosphorylation of MLKL at serine 358 (p-MLKL) (35Rodriguez D.A.

Cell cycle arrest in mitosis promotes interferon-induced necroptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2019; 26: 2046-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and inhibits M-phase measured by expression of phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 28 (p-HH3) (Table S1) (27Earl D.C.

Following compound selection, each injury was assigned to a fluorescent channel that was compatible with fluorescent cell barcoding (FCB), to enhance sample throughput, and validated on next generation spectral flow cytometers, to broaden detection of molecular injury signals. The completed injury module was applied to aid identification of natural products that bias signaling pathways toward an immunogenic fate. The benchmark bioactive secondary metabolites (Table S1) were evaluated with multiplexed activity profiling (MAP) to identify optimal dose and timing for cell death and injury pathways preceding ICI-mediated DAMP induction (40Krutzik P.O.

A multiplexed activity metabolomics (MAM) approach was used to test a discovery workflow that matched bioactivity of fractioned extracts to potentially immunogenic compounds by correlating secondary metabolome mass spectra with single cell fluorescent cytometry data. The compounds bafilomycin A1, staurosporine, and nocodazole were spiked into an inert metabolomic extract and fractioned into plate wells. Despite the presence of contaminating lipids, primary metabolites, and other fermentation products, bioactivity was only observed in fractions containing benchmark compounds, demonstrating the specific and sensitive detection of chemically induced cell injury with this injury module. Following successful validation, the module was applied using MAP and MAM workflows to identify bioactive metabolites in five untested microbial extracts generated from cave-sourced actinomycetes. This resulted in the discovery of an unexpected injury response profile of the secondary metabolite narbomycin (44Hori T. Maezawa I. Nagahama I. Suzuki N. Isolation and structure of narbonolide, narbomycin aglycone, from Streptomyces venezuelae and its biological transformation into picromycin via narbomycin.J. Chem. Soc. D: Chem. Commun. 1971; : 304-305Crossref Google Scholar). The ICI module coupled with FCB and viability stain established a ten-color (six ICI functional markers, one viability marker, and three barcoding dye) flow cytometry panel that performed 336 individual assays per flow cytometry run (seven functional markers across 48 plate wells). Secondary assays measured the expression of known immunogenic DAMPs: ATP, HMGB1, and eCRT. Assessing injury patterns in microtiter wells with millions of individual cells and comparing them to well-characterized benchmark injury control compounds provided insights into the connection among immunogenic signals and afforded a discovery platform for compounds that induce ICI hallmarks. To validate injury-specific antibodies for the ICI module, chemical induction was used to measure injury phenotypes following 10 μM challenge for 24 h in fixed cells with a five-color panel (Fig. 1A). Vehicle-treated cells served as negative controls and were labeled with Alexa 750 (A × 750) fluorescent dye. Etoposide-treated cells were included as a positive control for chemical-specific induction of DNA damage response sensor γH2AX and labeled with Pacific Orange fluorescent dye (Fig. 1A). The γH2AX signal was detected with a fluorescently conjugated mouse primary antibody (Table S2). Cell populations challenged with the terpenoid thapsigargin or benzimidazole derivative nocodazole were stained independently with Pacific Blue dye and evaluated for UPR and necroptotic signal induction, respectively (10Bezu L.

Commercially available flow cytometry–validated antibodies for these ICI signals were unavailable, thus antibodies applied in other techniques (Table S1) were utilized to observe chemically induced injury signals. These two markers were targeted with phospho-specific unconjugated rabbit primary antibodies and detected with a fluorescent goat secondary antibody specific to rabbit Fc IgG (Fig. 1A and Table S2). Separate thapsigargin- or nocodazole-challenged cell populations were mixed with etoposide and vehicle-challenged cells and stained for the ICI marker of interest for detection with a spectral flow cytometer. Cells were gated as viable-singlets and isolated from drug challenged populations by their fluorescent dye label (Figs. 1B and S1, Experimental procedures). Thapsigargin- and nocodazole-challenged cells exhibited a right-shifted cell population that was quantified as percent in gate for positive secondary fluorescent antibody signal and compared to etoposide and vehicle controls with one-way ANOVA (Fig. 1, D–G). Positive signal was also compared to a fluorescent secondary control that was absent of primary antibody to confirm measured biological responses was not due to nonspecific binding of the fluorescent goat secondary antibody (Fig. S2 and Table S1).

Moreover, etoposide-treated cells were γH2AX positive, while γH2AX levels in thapsigargin- and nocodazole-challenged populations remained unchanged (Fig. S3). The detection of chemically induced p-EIF2α and p-MLKL validated these antibodies for flow cytometry applications. Next, the two validated ICI flow antibodies required fluorescent functionalization and confirmation that fluorescent modifications did not abolish target binding. Antibodies targeting p-EIF2α and p-MLKL were fluorescently conjugated with covalent primary amine reactive Alexa Fluor dyes (Fig. 1C, Experimental procedures). Conjugation intensity was evaluated by fluorescence SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and exhibited fluorescent signal at molecular weights of 150 kDa, 50 kDa, and 25 kDa consistent with full length, heavy chain, and light chain rabbit antibody molecular weights (Fig. S4). Detection of p-EIF2α and p-MLKL were repeated as described above and confirmed covalent modifications of antibodies did not negatively affect target binding (Fig. 1, D–G). Validated ICI module antibodies were then applied to a MAP workflow to rapidly screen three leukemia cell lines to identify adequate concentrations and challenge times for reliable ICI induction (Fig. 2A) with the compounds bafilomycin A1, etoposide, nocodazole, staurosporine, and thapsigargin (Table S1) (27Earl D.C.

https://openalex.org/W4289953743,"The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans is associated with high altitude, few sunshine hours, cold climate, and winter. The goals of this study were to investigate seasonal and geographic patterns of DM diagnosis in United States of America (USA) dogs with juvenile and mature onset DM. Data were collected by means of an online survey widely distributed in the USA through breed clubs, academic veterinary institutions, private veterinary referral practices, social media outlets, and the American Kennel Club. Juvenile DM (JDM) and mature onset DM were defined as DM with an age of onset <365 days and DM with an age of onset ≥365 days, respectively. Meteorological seasons were defined as: winter from December through February, spring from March through May, summer from June through August, and fall from September through November. Four geographic regions were also defined as the West, North, South, and Central regions of the USA. Nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals (CI) for season, geographic region, and breed specific proportions of dogs with JDM were considered statistically significantly different. The study included 933 dogs with mature onset DM and 27 dogs with JDM. Dogs were diagnosed with DM significantly more in the winter and northern USA compared to all other seasons and all other geographic regions, respectively. The prevalence of JDM among dogs with DM was 2.8%. The proportion of dogs with JDM among pure breeds was not significantly different than the proportion of JDM in mixed breed dogs. It is concluded that winter and cold climate could be shared environmental factors influencing DM expression in dogs and humans. Additionally, pure breed dogs do not appear to be at increased risk for JDM compared to mixed breed dogs, indicating that factors other than genetics could influence spontaneous JDM development in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W4289961320,"Introduction Little is known about the influence of intrauterine fetal factors on childhood growth in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of intrauterine fetal growth on child linear growth in rural Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a prospective community-based cohort study from July 2016 to October 2018. All pregnant women with gestational age of 24 weeks or below living in 13 kebeles, in central Ethiopia were enrolled. The fetuses were followed from pregnancy up to 11–24 months after birth. We measured biparietal diameter, head circumference, femoral length, and abdominal circumference at 26, 30 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. At birth, we measured infant weight. At 11–24 months of age, z-scores of length- for- age, and weight-for-length were calculated. A multilevel, mixed-effect, linear regression model was used to examine the influence of fetal, newborn, maternal, household factors and residence area on child linear growth. Results We included 554 children. The prevalence rate of stunting was 54.3% and that of wasting was 10.6%. Fetal biparietal diameter, head circumference, and abdominal circumference, were significantly associated with birth weight. Femoral length z-score in early pregnancy, gestational age at delivery and child age were significantly associated with length-for-age z-score. Family size was significantly associated with length-for-age z-score. Family size and maternal height were associated with weight-for-height z-score. There was a large variation in length-for-age z-score (Intra cluster correlation, or ρ (rho) = 0.30) and weight-for-length z-score (ρ = 0.22) than of birth weight of new-born (ρ = 0.11) in kebeles indicating heterogeneity in clusters for length-for-age z-score and weight-for-length z-score than birth weight. Conclusions Child linear growth was influenced by fetal growth, duration of pregnancy, maternal height, and family size. Environmental factors that are associated with the area of residence play a bigger role for linear growth than for birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W4289966309,"Ethiopia is one of the high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden countries. However, phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can take several weeks due to the slow growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains. In this study, we assessed the performance of a Sanger sequencing approach to predict resistance against five anti-tuberculosis drugs and the pattern of resistance mediating mutations.We enrolled 226 MTBC culture-positive MDR-TB suspects and collected sputum specimens and socio-demographic and TB related data from each suspect between June 2015 and December 2016 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) for rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin using BACTEC MGIT 960 was compared with the results of a Sanger sequencing analysis of seven resistance determining regions in the genes rpoB, katG, fabG-inhA, pncA, embB, rpsL, and rrs.DNA isolation for Sanger sequencing was successfully extracted from 92.5% (209/226) of the MTBC positive cultures, and the remaining 7.5% (17/226) strains were excluded from the final analysis. Based on pDST results, drug resistance proportions were as follows: isoniazid: 109/209 (52.2%), streptomycin: 93/209 (44.5%), rifampicin: 88/209 (42.1%), ethambutol: 74/209 (35.4%), and pyrazinamide: 69/209 (33.0%). Resistance against isoniazid was mainly mediated by the mutation katG S315T (97/209, 46.4%) and resistance against rifampicin by rpoB S531L (58/209, 27.8%). The dominating resistance-conferring mutations for ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide affected codon 306 in embB (48/209, 21.1%), codon 88 in rpsL (43/209, 20.6%), and codon 65 in pncA (19/209, 9.1%), respectively. We observed a high agreement between phenotypic and genotypic DST, such as 89.9% (at 95% confidence interval [CI], 84.2%-95.8%) for isoniazid, 95.5% (95% CI, 91.2%-99.8%) for rifampicin, 98.6% (95% CI, 95.9-100%) for ethambutol, 91.3% (95% CI, 84.6-98.1%) for pyrazinamide and 57.0% (95% CI, 46.9%-67.1%) for streptomycin.We detected canonical mutations implicated in resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin. High agreement with phenotypic DST results for all drugs renders Sanger sequencing promising to be performed as a complementary measure to routine phenotypic DST in Ethiopia. Sanger sequencing directly from sputum may accelerate accurate clinical decision-making in the future."

In the Federal District, two models of primary care coexist-the traditional primary care and the family health strategy. The present study aimed to analyze the factors associated with mortality of the elderly due to conditions sensitive to ambulatory care in the Federal District, Brazil.This cross-sectional study investigated all deaths that occurred in people over 60 years old between 2008 and 2018. The variables studied were age at death, sex, marital status, education, race/color, death by condition sensitive to ambulatory care, and population coverage of primary care services. The Urban Well-Being Index (UWBI) was used, which includes the dimensions: mobility, environmental and housing conditions, infrastructure, and collective services, to analyze issues related to the place where the senior citizen resides.The deaths 70,503 senior citizens were recorded during the study period. The factors associated with mortality in the elderly due to ambulatory care sensitive conditions were male, lower income, and less education. Residing in a place with poor UWBI presented a response gradient with higher mortality. Increased ambulatory care coverage was also associated with lower mortality.The study evidenced an association between male gender, age, income, and education, and UWBI with lower mortality due to ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and these associations presented a response gradient.

https://openalex.org/W4289971480,"Background Hesitancy and incomplete vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains an obstacle to achieving herd immunity. Because of fear of vaccine reactions, patients with medical and allergic co-morbidities express heightened hesitancy. Limited information is available to guide these patients. We sought to identify factors associated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy and reactogenicity. Methods We surveyed employees of a multi-site health system in central Pennsylvania who were offered the COVID-19 vaccine (N = 18,740) inquiring about their experience with the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccines. The survey was administered online using the REDCap platform. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine whether a particular factor(s) (e.g., demographics, selected co-morbid allergic and medical conditions, vaccine brand, and prior COVID-19) were associated with vaccine reactogenicity including the occurrence and severity of local and systemic reactions. We also explored factors and reasons associated with vaccine hesitancy. Results Of the 5709 who completed the survey (response rate, 30.4%), 369 (6.5%) did not receive the vaccine. Black race and allergy to other vaccines were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Reaction intensity following the first vaccine dose and allergic co-morbidities were associated with incomplete vaccination. Older individuals (&gt;60 years) experienced less reactogenicity. Females had higher odds of local and systemic reactions and reported more severe reactions. Asians reported more severe reactions. As compared to Pfizer-BioNTech, the Moderna vaccine was associated with higher odds of vaccine reactions of higher severity. Prior COVID-19 resulted in more severe reactions following the first dose, but less severe reactions following the second dose. Conclusions Targeted campaigns to enhance vaccination acceptance should focus on Black individuals, females, and those with allergic co-morbidities. Prior COVID-19 caused more severe reactions after the first but not the second vaccine dose. Moderna vaccine caused more vaccine reactions. Lessons learned from the early rollout of COVID-19 vaccine may serve to inform future novel vaccine experiences."
https://openalex.org/W4289985907,"Introduction With fragile health care systems, sub-Saharan Africa countries like Ethiopia are facing a complex epidemic, and become difficult to control the noble coronavirus. The use of COVID-19 preventive measures is strongly recommended. This study aimed to assess the adherence of COVID-19 mitigation measures and associated factors among health care workers. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers at referral hospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia from May 15 to June 10; 2021. It was a web-based study using an online questionnaire. STATA 14.2 was used for data analysis. Variables with a p-value&lt;0.05 at 95% confidence level in multivariable analysis were declared as statistically significant using binary logistic regression. Result Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures was 50.24% in the current study. The odd of adherence of participants with a monthly income of ≥12801birr was 15% whereas the odds of adherence of participants who hesitate to take the COVID 19 vaccine were 10% as compared to those who don’t hesitate. Participants who had undergone COVID-19 tests adhered 6.64 times more than their counterparts. Those who believe adequate measurements are taken by the government adhered 4.6 times more than those who believe not adequate. Participants who believe as no risk of severe disease adhered 16% compared to those with fear of severe disease. Presence of households aged &gt;60years adhered about 7.9 times more than with no households aged&gt;60. Participants suspected of COVID-19 diagnosis adhered 5.7 times more than those not suspected. Conclusion In this study, a significant proportion of healthcare workers did not adhere to COVID-19 mitigation measures. Hence, giving special attention to healthcare workers with a monthly income of ≥12801 birr, being hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccine, being aged 26–30, and perceiving no risk of developing a severe infection is crucial to reduce non-adherence."

This analysis included 1,604 participants who were taking antihypertensive medication at Visit 1 and had BP data at Visits 1 (2000-2004), 2 (2005-2008), and 3 (2009-2013). Persistent BP control was defined as systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg at all three visits. CVD events were assessed from Visit 3 through December 31, 2016. Hazard ratios (HR) for the association of persistent BP control with CVD outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, systolic BP, smoking, diabetes, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at Visit 3.At Visit 1, 1,226 of 1,604 participants (76.4%) with hypertension had controlled BP. Overall, 48.9% of participants taking antihypertensive medication at Visit 1 had persistent BP control. After multivariable adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial factors, and access-to-care, participants were more likely to have persistent BP control if they were <65 years of age, women, had family income ≥$25,000 at each visit, and visited a health professional in the year prior to each visit. The multivariable adjusted HR (95% confidence interval) comparing participants with versus without persistent BP control was 0.71 (0.46-1.10) for CVD, 0.68 (0.34-1.34) for coronary heart disease, 0.65 (0.27-1.52) for stroke, and 0.55 (0.33-0.90) for heart failure.Less than half of JHS participants taking antihypertensive medication had persistent BP control, putting them at increased risk for heart failure."

It warrants the evaluation of molecular-based HPV tests for accuracy and efficacy of screening. The performance of Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test was validated and compared with Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) high-risk HPV DNA test for primary screening in a large Chinese screening cohort. Of 6345 women screened, overall agreement between Cobas and HC2 was 92.23% (95% CI: 91.57-92.89). The inter-assay agreement was correlated with the severity of underlying biology, with an increasing concordance found in samples with more severe abnormalities. Most of the discordant samples had the test signal strength closer to the test limits of the detection than concordant samples, reflecting a low viral load and infection of a cluster of low-risk HPV in these samples. The Cobas test demonstrated significantly higher specificity in identifying CIN2+/CIN3+ cases than HC2 test (66.46% vs 43.67% and 65.42% vs 42.86%, p<0.001), with comparable sensitivity in clinical evaluation. Increased specificity of Cobas test would accent women having the highest risk of developing CIN2+, with the potential to reduce unnecessary colposcopy referral in a screening population."
https://openalex.org/W4289994362,"Technological convergence is an important organizational innovation capability, essential for improving the core competitiveness of green and sustainable industries. However, studies have mainly focused on measuring technological convergence and have ignored the factors that affect the capabilities of such convergence capabilities. Thus, this study attempts to bridge this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of structural holes in inter-organizational technical cooperation networks. This technological convergence is studied from the perspective of a patent. It also considers the moderating effects of the degree of patent cooperation and the cooperation distance. It employs the social network theory to construct inter-organizational patent cooperation, and technological convergence networks, to facilitate the analysis of the effect of structural holes on such a convergence. It empirically examines 52 non-ferrous metal recycling organizations, with close patent cooperation. Accordingly, the structural hole constraint index by the inter-organizational patent cooperation network, shows a positive U-shaped curve relationship with technology convergence. Moreover, the degree of inter-organizational patent cooperation strengthens the positive U-shaped relationship, and the distance of cooperation weakens the influence of the structural hole constraint index on technology convergence. Therefore, managers and policymakers should encourage more industry-academia-research or patent alliances and designate policies to promote such cooperation."

However, the lack of chloroplast genome research of this genus has greatly hindered the study of its molecular evolution and phylogenetic relationship. This study used the Illumina sequencing platform to sequence three medicinal plants of the Carpesium genus: Carpesium abrotanoides, Carpesium cernuum, and Carpesium faberi, obtaining three complete chloroplast genome sequences after assembly and annotation. It was revealed that the three chloroplast genomes were typical quadripartite structures with lengths of 151,389 bp (C. abrotanoides), 151,278 bp (C. cernuum), and 151,250 bp (C. faberi), respectively. A total of 114 different genes were annotated, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes. Abundant SSR loci were detected in all three chloroplast genomes, with most composed of A/T. The expansion and contraction of the IR region indicate that the boundary regions of IR/SC are relatively conserved for the three species. Using C. abrotanoides as a reference, most of the non-coding regions of the chloroplast genomes were significantly different among the three species. Five different mutation hot spots (trnC-GCA-petN, psaI, petA-psbJ, ndhF, ycf1) with high nucleotide variability (Pi) can serve as potential DNA barcodes of Carpesium species. Additionally, phylogenetic evolution analysis of the three species suggests that C. cernuum has a closer genetic relationship to C. faberi than C. abrotanoides. Simultaneously, Carpesium is a monophyletic group closely related to the genus Inula. Complete chloroplast genomes of Carpesium species can help study the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships and are expected to provide genetic marker assistance to identify Carpesium species."
https://openalex.org/W4289526841,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the most well-characterized growth factors and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Its receptor EGFR has been extensively explored as a therapeutic target against multiple types of cancers, such as lung cancer and glioblastoma. Recent studies have established a connection between deregulated EGF signaling and metabolic reprogramming, especially rewiring in aerobic glycolysis, which is also known as the Warburg effect and recognized as a hallmark in cancer. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a rate-limiting enzyme controlling the final step of glycolysis and serves as a major regulator of the Warburg effect. We previously showed that PKM2 T405/S406 O-GlcNAcylation, a critical mark important for PKM2 detetramerization and activity, was markedly upregulated by EGF. However, the mechanism by which EGF regulates PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation still remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrated that EGF promoted O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) binding to PKM2 by stimulating OGT Y976 phosphorylation. As a consequence, we found PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation and detetramerization were upregulated, leading to a significant decrease in PKM2 activity. Moreover, distinct from PKM2, we observed that the association of additional phosphotyrosine-binding proteins with OGT was also enhanced when Y976 was phosphorylated. These proteins included STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, PKCδ, and p85, which are reported to be O-GlcNAcylated. Together, we show EGF-dependent Y976 phosphorylation is critical for OGT-PKM2 interaction and propose that this posttranslational modification might be important for substrate selection by OGT."
https://openalex.org/W4289935924,"Cell-cycle dependent proteins are indispensible for the accurate division of cells, a group of proteins called Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are important to cell division as it bind microtubules and participate with other co-factors to form the spindle midbody, which works as the workhorse of cell-division. PRC1 is a distinguishing member of MAPs, as it is a human MAP and works as the key in mediating daughter cell segregation in ana-phase and telo-phase. The physiological significance of PRC1 calls for a high resolution three-dimensional structure. The crystal structure of PRC1 was published but has low resolution (>3 Å) and incomplete sidechains, placing hurdles to understanding the structure-function relationships of PRC1, therefore, we determined the high-resolution solution structure of PRC1's dimerization domain using NMR spectroscopy. Significant differences between the crystal structure and the solution structure can be observed, the main differences center around the N terminus and the end of the alpha-Helix H2. Furthermore, detailed structure analyses revealed that the hydrophobic core packing of the solution and crystal structures are also different. To validate the solution structure, we used Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments that address the structural discrepancies between the crystal and solution structure; we also generated mutants that are key to the differences in the crystal and solution structures, measuring its structural or thermal stability by NMR spectroscopy and Fluorescence Thermal Shift Assays. These results suggest that N terminal residues are key to the integrity of the whole protein, and the solution structure of the dimerization domain better reflects the conformation PRC1 adopted in solution conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4289962452,"Background Child undernutrition is a burden and the leading cause of child mortality in low-and middle-income countries like Bangladesh and India. Currently, this issue is a matter of great concern, inasmuch as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study intends to determine the factors of child undernutrition using a single composite index of anthropometric failure (CIAF) among the Bengali population. Methods Unit level data on 14055 under 5 children were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017–18 (BDHS) and the 4 th National Family Health Survey of India (NFHS-4). To understand child undernutrition and generate CIAF, data on height-for-age (stunting), weight-for-height (wasting), and weight-for-age (underweight) were used by WHO guidelines. These three undernutrition indicators were combined into a single undernutrition indicator called anthropometric failure (anth-failure) using the CIAF concept. Explanatory factors of anth-failure included data on maternal health, socio-demographic and birth-related variables. Differences of frequency were determined by Z-proportional and Chi-square tests; predictors of anth-failure were determined by binary logistic regression. Cut off point of p-value was taken as 0.05 to test the significance. Results Inter-country disparities were revealed, about half of Bengali children in India and two-fifths in Bangladesh being prone to anth-failure. Stunting and underweight were more prevalent in both countries than wasting. Maternal undernutrition, lack of maternal education, and poor wealth index were common factors of anth-failure for both countries. Children in Bangladesh developed anth-failure after the end of breastfeeding period, indicating a lack of nutritious food. Lack of antenatal care was another significant factor in Bangladesh. In India, the first child suffered from anth-failure due to lack of maternal education. Conclusions This study provides a better understanding of multifactorial impact on child undernutrition. It is proposed that the emphasis should be on initiatives that improve maternal education and nutrition, child food security, boost household wealth index, and enhance mothers’ access to health care. The study strongly recommends that the governments of Bangladesh and India invest financially in preventing child malnutrition, which will contribute to achieving the first four SDGs."
https://openalex.org/W4289971598,"Introduction Chlorhexidine cord care is an effective intervention to reduce neonatal infection and death in resource constrained settings. The Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia adopted chlorhexidine cord care in 2015, with national scale-up in 2017. However, there is lack of evidence on the provision of this important intervention in Ethiopia. In this paper, we report on the coverage and determinants of chlorhexidine cord care for newborns in Ethiopia. Methods A standardized Nutrition International Monitoring System (NIMS) survey was conducted from January 01 to Feb 13, 2020 in four regions of Ethiopia (Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region [SNNPR]) on sample of 1020 women 0–11 months postpartum selected through a multistage cluster sampling approach. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires in the local languages through home-to-home visit. Accounting for the sampling design of the study, we analyzed the data using complex data analysis approach. Complex sample multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of chlorhexidine cord care practice. Results Overall, chlorhexidine was reportedly applied to the umbilical cord at some point postpartum among 46.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.1%– 51.2%) of all newborns. Chlorhexidine cord care started within 24 hours after birth for 34.4% (95% CI: 29.5%– 39.6%) of newborns, though this varied widely across regions: from Oromia (24.4%) to Tigray (60.0%). Among the newborns who received chlorhexidine cord care, 48.3% received it for the recommended seven days or more. Further, neonates whose birth was assisted by skilled birth attendants had more than ten times higher odds of receiving chlorhexidine cord care, relative to those born without a skilled attendant (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 10.36, 95% CI: 3.73–28.75). Besides, neonates born to mothers with knowledge of the benefit of chlorhexidine cord care had significantly higher odds of receiving chlorhexidine cord care relative to newborns born to mothers who did not have knowledge of the benefit of chlorhexidine cord care (AOR: 39.03, 95% CI: 21.45–71.04). Conclusion A low proportion of newborns receive chlorhexidine cord care in Ethiopia. The practice of chlorhexidine cord care varies widely across regions and is limited mostly to births attended by skilled birth attendants. Efforts must continue to ensure women can reach skilled care at delivery, and to ensure adequate care for newborns who do not yet access skilled delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4289992942,"Intralingual translation has long been peripheral to empirical studies of translation. Considering its many similarities with interlingual translation, also described as translation proper, we adopted eye-tracking technology to investigate the cognitive process during translation and paraphrase, an exemplification of intralingual translation. Twenty-four postgraduate students were required to perform four types of tasks (Chinese paraphrase, English-Chinese translation, English paraphrase, Chinese-English translation) for source texts (ST) of different genres. Their eye movements were recorded for analysis of the cognitive effort and attention distribution pattern. The result demonstrated that: (1) Translation elicited significantly greater cognitive efforts than paraphrase; (2) Differences between translation and paraphrase on cognitive effort were modulated by text genre and target language; (3) Translation and paraphrase did not differ strikingly in terms of attention distribution. This process-oriented study confirmed higher cognitive efforts in inter-lingual translation, which was likely due to the additional complexity of bilingual transfer. Moreover, it revealed significant modulating effects of text genre and target language."
https://openalex.org/W4290014945,"Uninsured or underinsured individuals with cancer are likely to experience financial hardship, including forgoing healthcare or non-healthcare needs such as food, housing, or utilities. This study evaluates the association between health insurance coverage and financial hardship among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional analysis used Patient Advocate Foundation (PAF) survey data from May to July 2020. Cancer survivors who previously received case management or financial aid from PAF self-reported challenges paying for healthcare and non-healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Associations between insurance coverage and payment challenges were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors, which allowed for estimation of adjusted relative risks (aRR). Of 1,437 respondents, 74% had annual household incomes &lt;$48,000. Most respondents were enrolled in Medicare (48%), 22% in employer-sponsored insurance, 13% in Medicaid, 6% in an Affordable Care Act (ACA) plan, and 3% were uninsured. Approximately 31% of respondents reported trouble paying for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were uninsured (aRR 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83–3.64), enrolled in an ACA plan (aRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.28–2.72), employer-sponsored insurance (aRR 1.70, 95% CI 1.23–2.34), or Medicare (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09–2.03) had higher risk of trouble paying for healthcare compared to Medicaid enrollees. Challenges paying for non-healthcare needs were reported by 57% of respondents, with 40% reporting trouble paying for food, 31% housing, 28% transportation, and 20% internet. In adjusted models, Medicare and employer-sponsored insurance enrollees were less likely to have difficulties paying for non-healthcare needs compared to Medicaid beneficiaries. Despite 97% of our cancer survivor sample being insured, 31% and 57% reported trouble paying for healthcare and non-healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Greater attention to both medical and non-medical financial burden is needed given the economic pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4289525490,"Family with sequence similarity 83 A (FAM83A) is a newly discovered proto-oncogene that has been shown to play key roles in various cancers. However, the function of FAM83A in other physiological processes is not well known. Here, we report a novel function of FAM83A in adipocyte differentiation. We used an adipocyte-targeting fusion oligopeptide (FITC-ATS-9R) to deliver a FAM83A-sgRNA/Cas9 plasmid to knockdown Fam83a (ATS/sg-FAM83A) in white adipose tissue in mice, which resulted in reduced white adipose tissue mass, smaller adipocytes, and mitochondrial damage that was aggravated by a high-fat diet. In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found loss or knockdown of Fam83a significantly repressed lipid droplet formation and downregulated the expression of lipogenic genes and proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of Fam83a decreased mitochondrial ATP production through blockage of the electron transport chain, associated with enhanced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate FAM83A interacts with casein kinase 1 (CK1) and promotes the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, loss of Fam83a in adipocytes hampered the formation of the TOM40 complex and impeded CK1-driven lipogenesis. Taken together, these results establish FAM83A as a critical regulator of mitochondria maintenance during adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4289527038,"The obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis obtain all nutrients from the cytoplasm of their epithelial host cells and stimulate glucose uptake by these cells. They even hijack host ATP, exerting a strong metabolic pressure on their host at the peak of the proliferative stage of their developmental cycle. However, it is largely unknown whether infection modulates the metabolism of the host cell. Also, the reliance of the bacteria on host metabolism might change during their progression through their biphasic developmental cycle. Herein, using primary epithelial cells and 2 cell lines of nontumoral origin, we showed that between the 2 main ATP-producing pathways of the host, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) remained stable and glycolysis was slightly increased. Inhibition of either pathway strongly reduced bacterial proliferation, implicating that optimal bacterial growth required both pathways to function at full capacity. While we found C. trachomatis displayed some degree of energetic autonomy in the synthesis of proteins expressed at the onset of infection, functional host glycolysis was necessary for the establishment of early inclusions, whereas OxPhos contributed less. These observations correlated with the relative contributions of the pathways in maintaining ATP levels in epithelial cells, with glycolysis contributing the most. Altogether, this work highlights the dependence of C. trachomatis on both host glycolysis and OxPhos for efficient bacterial replication. However, ATP consumption appears at equilibrium with the normal production capacity of the host and the bacteria, so that no major shift between these pathways is required to meet bacterial needs."
https://openalex.org/W4289958253,"Valid, reliable, and acceptable tools for assessing self-reported competence in evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) are required to provide insight into the current status of EIDM knowledge, skills, attitudes/beliefs, and behaviours for registered nurses working in public health. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the EIDM Competence Measure. A psychometric study design was employed guided by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing and general measurement development principles. All registered nurses working across 16 public health units in Ontario, Canada were invited to complete the newly developed EIDM Competence Measure via an online survey. The EIDM Competence Measure is a self-reported tool consisting of four EIDM subscales: 1) knowledge; 2) skills; 3) attitudes/beliefs; and 4) behaviours. Acceptability was measured by completion time and percentage of missing data of the original 40-item tool. The internal structure of the tool was first assessed through item-subscale total and item-item correlations within subscales for potential item reduction of the original 40-item tool. Following item reduction which resulted in a revised 27-item EIDM Competence Measure, a principal component analysis using an oblique rotation was performed to confirm the four subscale structure. Validity based on relationships to other variables was assessed by exploring associations between EIDM competence attributes and individual factors (e.g., years of nursing experience, education) and organizational factors (e.g., resource allocation). Internal reliability within each subscale was analyzed using Cronbach's alphas. Across 16 participating public health units, 201 nurses (mean years as a registered nurse = 18.1, predominantly female n = 197; 98%) completed the EIDM Competence Measure. Overall missing data were minimal as 93% of participants completed the entire original 40-item tool (i.e., no missing data), with 7% of participants having one or more items with missing data. Only one participant (0.5%) had >10% of missing data (i.e., more than 4 out of 40 items with data missing). Mean completion time was 7 minutes and 20 seconds for the 40-item tool. Extraction of a four-factor model based on the 27-item version of the scale showed substantial factor loadings (>0.4) that aligned with the four EIDM subscales of knowledge, skills, attitudes/beliefs, and behaviours. Significant relationships between EIDM competence subscale scores and education, EIDM training, EIDM project involvement, and supportive organizational culture were observed. Cronbach's alphas exceeded minimum standards for all subscales: knowledge (α = 0.96); skills (α = 0.93); attitudes/beliefs (α = 0.80); and behaviours (α = 0.94)."
https://openalex.org/W4289967981,"Developing countries have common goals of poverty eradication and improving people's livelihoods. As the largest developing country, China has made remarkable achievements in poverty alleviation during the 30 years of reform. Although a targeted poverty alleviation mechanism was established by the Chinese government in 2013, the identification of poor households has been an arduous journey. Based on a total of 688 samples of grassroots officials and 2,621 rural households from 69 village-level divisions in 9 provinces in China, this study conducted cross-validation on the impact of the participation of rural households in the identifying poor households that required government assistance. This was from the perspectives of grassroots officials and rural households. It was investigated whether this participation led to an anomaly between the identification of poor households and the actual situation. Empirical results show that the participation of rural households in appraisals significantly increases the probability of identifying a non-poor household as a poor household (first error) and decreases the probability of failing to identify a poor household as a poor household (second error). As the impact of the first error is greater than that of the second error, the participation of rural households in appraisals has the overall effect of increasing the incorrect registrations of poor households. These results are still valid after addressing the self-selection problem. For other developing countries to successfully apply effort into poverty alleviation, in addition to focusing on increasing farmers' participation in public affairs, they should prevent any bias that may be caused by farmers' participation in public affairs; strengthen publicity and guidance; focus on the nurture of officials; perfect top-level design; and set clearer targets for poverty alleviation policies."
https://openalex.org/W4289968377,"To analyze ocular biometric changes following unilateral cataract surgery in children.A total of 57 children aged under 13 years who underwent unilateral cataract surgery were analyzed. Groups were classified according to their age at surgery: group I (age <3), II (3≤ age <6), III (6≤ age <9), and IV (age ≥9). The myopic shift, axial growth, and corneal curvature changes were compared between the pseudophakic eyes and the fellow phakic eyes.During 7.81 ± 4.39 years, the overall myopic shift (D) and the rate of myopic shift (D/year) were significantly higher at -3.25 ± 3.21 D and -0.45 ± 0.44 D/year in the pseudophakic eyes than -1.78 ± 2.10 D and -0.22 ± 0.29 D/year in the fellow phakic eyes (P = 0.01, 0.004). Group I (-1.14 ± 0.66 vs -0.02 ± 0.45 D/year) and group II (-0.63 ± 0.37 vs -0.31 ± 0.29 D/year) showed significantly higher rate of myopic shift in the pseudophakic eyes than in the phakic eyes. The rate of myopic shift in the pseudophakic eyes decreased in the older age groups (P = 0.001). There was no significant between-eye difference in the changes in axial length and keratometric values postoperatively.Following unilateral cataract surgery, a significant postoperative myopic shift was noticed in the pseudophakic eyes compared to the fellow phakic eyes in groups under 6 years old. Postoperative myopic shift and the resultant anisometropia should be considered when selecting the optimal power of IOL in young children requiring unilateral cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4289973192,"Soil water soluble base ion salt-based ion concentrations are critical parameters for estimating soil buffer capacity and vegetation productivity. Ionic content clearly covaries with the distribution of plant communities. Previous studies on salt-based ions in soils focused primarily on ion migration and its relationships with vegetation growth. Few studies have sought to characterize larger scale spatial distribution of salt-based ions or correlation with climatic and plant community characteristics. This study used ion chromatography to analyze the salt-based ion content (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) of surface soils from the Hunshandake sandy lands. Statistical methods were used interpret spatial variation. Results showed that the average content of salt-based ions in Hunshandake sandy land was 86.57 mg/kg. Average values ranked as Ca2+ > Na+ > K+ > Mg2+ but concentrations also exhibited uneven spatial distributions. Horizontal spatial variation in Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ ions showed these ions gradually decrease from northwest to southeast. Potassium ions (K+) showed no obvious spatial variation trends. Ions varied significantly across different soil layers but their average concentrations ranked as K+>Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+ (from shallow to deep). The 20-30 cm soil layer contained the highest salt ion concentrations. Of the four base ions, only K+ ions appeared in surface samples. In terms of water soluble base ion available salt-based ions, Ca2+ occurred in the highest concentrations along the north and west side of the study area. K+ ions occurred in the highest concentrations along the south and east sides of the study area. Na+ concentrations did not show a consistent spatial pattern. Statistical analysis detected significant correlations of normalized ion concentration parameters (Ca2+/CECT, K+/CEC, effective water soluble base ion salt-based ions) and the total species number, average species number and total biomass of the plant communities (P <0.05). This study can help inform understanding of soil water transport in sandy areas and provide a reference for interpreting ecosystems in arid regions."
https://openalex.org/W4289985814,"Photopsia is a photic phenomenon that can be associated with intraocular lenses after cataract surgery. To calculate the relative light intensity of photic effects observed after cataract surgery at the foveal region as the most sensitive region of the retina, photopsia was simulated using the ZEMAX optical design software. The simulations are based on the Liou-Brennan eye model with a pupil diameter of 4.5 mm and incorporating implanted IOLs. The hydrophilic IOLs implanted in the eye model have a power of 21 diopter (D) with an optic diameter of 6 mm and 7 mm. Four different intensity detectors are located in specific regions of the eye in this simulation. The ray-tracing analysis was carried out for variations of incident ray angle of 0° to 90° (temporally) in steps of 1°. Depending on the range of incident ray angle, the light intensity was detected at detectors located on the fovea, nasal side of the retina, or the edge surface of the IOLs. Some portion of the input light was detected at specific incident angles in the foveal region. By altering the IOLs edge design to a fully reflective or anti-reflective surface, the range over which the light intensity is detected on the fovea can be shifted. Additionally, with the absorbing edge design, no intensity was detected at the foveal region for incident ray angles larger than 5°. Therefore an absorbing edge design can make photic effects less disturbing for patients."
https://openalex.org/W4289985887,"Background Older adults account for a large proportion of emergency department visits, but those with serious life-limiting illness may benefit most from referral to home and community services instead of hospitalization. We aim to document emergency provider perspectives on facilitators and barriers to accessing home and community services for older adults with serious life-limiting illness. Methods We conducted interviewer-administered semi-structured interviews with emergency providers from health systems across the United States to obtain provider perspectives on facilitators and barriers to accessing home and community services. We completed qualitative thematic analysis using an iterative process to develop themes and subthemes to summarize provider responses. Results We interviewed 8 emergency nurses and 10 emergency physicians across 11 health systems. Emergency providers were familiar with local home and community services. Facilitators to accessing these services include care management and social workers. Barriers include services that are not accessible full-time to receive referrals, insurance/payment, and the busy nature of the emergency department. The most helpful reported services were hospice, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and visiting nursing services. Home-based palliative care and full-time emergency department-based care management and social work were the services most desired by providers. Providers expressed support for improving access to home and community services in the hopes of decreasing unnecessary emergency visits and inpatient admissions, and to provide patients with greater options for supportive care. Conclusion Obtaining the perspective of emergency providers highlights important considerations to accessing HCS for older-adults with serious life-limiting illness from the emergency department. This study provides foundational information for futures studies and initiatives for improving access to home and community services directly from the emergency department."
https://openalex.org/W4289989510,"The treatment success rate of conventional anti-tuberculosis (TB) regimens for extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is low, resulting in high morbidity and healthcare cost especially in the high TB burden countries. Recent clinical findings reported improved treatment outcomes of XDR-TB with the bedaquiline (BDQ)-based regimens. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of BDQ-based treatment for XDR-TB from the perspective of the South Africa national healthcare provider.A 2-year decision-analytic model was designed to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of adult XDR-TB patients with (1) BDQ-based regimen and (2) injectable-based conventional regimen. The model inputs were retrieved from literature and public data. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed. The primary model outputs included TB-related direct medical cost and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).In the base-case analysis, the BDQ group reduced 4.4152 DALYs with an incremental cost of USD1,606 when compared to the conventional group. The incremental cost per DALY averted (ICER) by the BDQ group was 364 USD/DALY averted. No influential factor was identified in the sensitivity analysis. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the BDQ group was accepted as cost-effective in 97.82% of the 10,000 simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 5,656 USD/DALY averted (1× gross domestic product per capita in South Africa).The BDQ-based therapy appeared to be cost-effective and showed a high probability to be accepted as the preferred cost-effective option for active XDR-TB treatment."
