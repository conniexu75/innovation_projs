https://openalex.org/W2127949919,"A paramyxovirus virus termed Nipah virus has been identified as the etiologic agent of an outbreak of severe encephalitis in people with close contact exposure to pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The outbreak was first noted in late September 1998 and by mid-June 1999, more than 265 encephalitis cases, including 105 deaths, had been reported in Malaysia, and 11 cases of encephalitis or respiratory illness with one death had been reported in Singapore. Electron microscopic, serologic, and genetic studies indicate that this virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is most closely related to the recently discovered Hendra virus. We suggest that these two viruses are representative of a new genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Like Hendra virus, Nipah virus is unusual among the paramyxoviruses in its ability to infect and cause potentially fatal disease in a number of host species, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2085299836,"TFIID is a large multiprotein complex that initiates assembly of the transcription machinery. It is unclear how TFIID recognizes promoters in vivo when templates are nucleosome-bound. Here, it is shown that TAFII250, the largest subunit of TFIID, contains two tandem bromodomain modules that bind selectively to multiply acetylated histone H4 peptides. The 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of the double bromodomain reveals two side-by-side, four-helix bundles with a highly polarized surface charge distribution. Each bundle contains an Nepsilon-acetyllysine binding pocket at its center, which results in a structure ideally suited for recognition of diacetylated histone H4 tails. Thus, TFIID may be targeted to specific chromatin-bound promoters and may play a role in chromatin recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2075707444,"To protect genome integrity and ensure survival, eukaryotic cells exposed to genotoxic stress cease proliferating to provide time for DNA repair. Human cells responded to ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation by rapid, ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent protein degradation of Cdc25A, a phosphatase that is required for progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. This response involved activated Chk1 protein kinase but not the p53 pathway, and the persisting inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk2 blocked entry into S phase and DNA replication. Overexpression of Cdc25A bypassed this mechanism, leading to enhanced DNA damage and decreased cell survival. These results identify specific degradation of Cdc25A as part of the DNA damage checkpoint mechanism and suggest how Cdc25A overexpression in human cancers might contribute to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2080961105,"The ets family transcription factor PU.1 is required for the development of multiple lineages of the immune system. Using retroviral transduction of PU.1 complementary DNA into mutant hematopoietic progenitors, we demonstrate that differing concentrations of the protein regulate the development of B lymphocytes as compared with macrophages. A low concentration of PU. 1 protein induces the B cell fate, whereas a high concentration promotes macrophage differentiation and blocks B cell development. Conversely, a transcriptionally weakened mutant protein preferentially induces B cell generation. Our results suggest that graded expression of a transcription factor can be used to specify distinct cell fates in the hematopoietic system."
https://openalex.org/W2137046761,"Fibrates and glitazones are two classes of drugs currently used in the treatment of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR), respectively. Whereas glitazones are insulin sensitizers acting via activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ subtype, fibrates exert their lipid-lowering activity via PPARα. To determine whether PPARα activators also improve insulin sensitivity, we measured the capacity of three PPARα-selective agonists, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate, and the new compound GW9578, in two rodent models of high fat diet-induced (C57BL/6 mice) or genetic (obese Zucker rats) IR. At doses yielding serum concentrations shown to activate selectively PPARα, these compounds markedly lowered hyperinsulinemia and, when present, hyperglycemia in both animal models. This effect relied on the improvement of insulin action on glucose utilization, as indicated by a lower insulin peak in response to intraperitoneal glucose in ciprofibrate-treated IR obese Zucker rats. In addition, fenofibrate treatment prevented high fat diet-induced increase of body weight and adipose tissue mass without influencing caloric intake. The specificity for PPARα activationin vivo was demonstrated by marked alterations in the expression of PPARα target genes, whereas PPARγ target gene mRNA levels did not change in treated animals. These results indicate that compounds with a selective PPARα activation profile reduce insulin resistance without having adverse effects on body weight and adipose tissue mass in animal models of IR.

Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), is characterized by glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. These metabolic abnormalities are frequently associated with visceral obesity (2.Despres J.P. Nutrition. 1993; 9: 452-459PubMed Google Scholar). The clustering of multiple cardiovascular risk factors in MS results in increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease, the major cause of mortality and morbidity in type 2 diabetic patients (3.Despres J.P. Marette A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 274-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Pharmacological treatment of MS should therefore aim at ameliorating IR and reducing cardiovascular risk factors. The PPAR nuclear receptors are important regulators of glucose and lipid homeostasis, which are activated by two classes of drugs: fibrates and glitazones (4.Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Glitazones are PPARγ activators, currently used for the treatment of IR and type 2 diabetes (5.Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These compounds increase fatty acid (FA) uptake in adipose tissue (6.Oakes N.D. Camilleri S. Furler S.M. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 935-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), due to PPARγ-mediated induction of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and FA transporter proteins (7.Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.-M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 8.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M.

These actions are considered major determinants of the effects of glitazones on glucose homeostasis, since they favor the diversion of FA from muscles resulting in a relief of inhibition of peripheral glucose utilization (6.Oakes N.D.

In addition, glitazones may also act by ameliorating TNFα-induced insulin resistance (9.Peraldi P. Xu M. Spiegelman B. J. Clin.

However, PPARγ activation also enhances adipose differentiation and fat storage (12.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Moreover, glitazones increase food intake (13.Hallakou S. Doaré L. Foufelle F. Kergoat M. Guerre-Millo M.

This action is likely to be mediated via PPARγ since heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice display increased adipose tissue leptin expression accompanied with lowered food intake (16.Kubota N.

Fonseca V. Graveline J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Results from the Helsinki Heart Study demonstrated that fibrates significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (19.Huttunen J. Manninen V. Manttari M. Koskinen P. Romo M. Tenkanen L. Heinonen O. Frick M. Ann. Med. 1991; 23: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs that are very efficient in lowering elevated triglyceride concentrations consistently observed in these patients (20.Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.-C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The action of fibrates on lipid metabolism is mediated principally by activation of PPARα leading to altered expression of genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in liver (21.Peters J.M.

Since fibrate treatment results in increased hepatic oxidation of fatty acids and reduced synthesis and secretion of triglycerides (20.Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.-C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), as well as decreased plasma concentrations of cytokines, such as TNFα (22.Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.-C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A.

Ther. 1998; 36: 345-349PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that selective PPARα activators might also improve glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we assessed therefore the influence of selective PPARα activators on glucose homeostasis and body weight control in animal models of IR. A first series of experiments was performed on male C57BL/6 mice, 8 weeks of age at the start of the experiment, which were randomly assigned to three different diets for 14 weeks. The mice received a low fat diet (UAR AO4), a high fat diet containing coconut oil (29% w/w) as described (24.Surwit R.S. Feinglos M.N. Rodin J. Sutherland A. Petro A.E. Opara E.C. Kuhn C.M. Rebuffé-Scrive M. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), or the same high fat diet supplemented with fenofibrate (0.05% w/w). A second series of experiments was performed with male Zucker rats of different ages, either bred at the U465 INSERM animal facility from pairs originally provided by the Harriet G. Bird Laboratory (Stow, MA) or obtained from Iffa-Credo (L'Arbresle, France). In the first experiment, 5-week-old obese fa/fa Zucker rats (n = 6 per group; U465 INSERM breeding facility) were fed a standard diet with or without ciprofibrate (0.005% w/w) for 15 days and subsequently subjected to an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). In the second experiment, 8 lean Fa/? and 14 obese fa/fa 21-week-old Zucker rats (Iffa-Credo breeding facility) were randomized in two groups per genotype, based on base-line body weight and serum triglyceride and glucose concentrations. Rats of each group were given a standard rat diet with or without ciprofibrate (0.005% w/w) for 21 days. In the third experiment, 12 obese fa/fa 20-week-old Zucker rats (U465 INSERM breeding facility) were randomized in two groups/genotype based on base-line body weight and treated for 9 days once daily by oral gavage with GW9578 (5 mg/kg/day) (25.Brown P.J.

The food intake of the animals was carefully monitored by weighing special gridded metal food containers at regular intervals. In all experiments, body weights were monitored throughout the treatment period. Except when glucose tolerance tests were performed, food was removed at 8 a.m. and blood samples collected 4 h later at the end of the treatment. Animals were euthanized and tissues collected and weighed. Serum or plasma was isolated and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Animals were anesthetized at 2:00 p.m. after a 5-h fast by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Rats were injected with glucose (0.55 g/kg) in the saphenous vein and blood samples were collected from the tail vein in heparinized tubes at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after the glucose load. Samples were kept on ice, and plasma was isolated and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Glucose concentrations were measured using enzymatic methods, insulin (CIS Bio) and leptin (Linco) by radioimmunoassay.

To determine whether selective PPARα activators influence insulin and glucose homeostasis, experiments were performed in animal models of IR using ciprofibrate and fenofibrate, which are the most PPARα-selective fibrates currently available in clinics, as well as with the novel PPARα subtype-selective agonist GW9578 (25.Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Results from in vitro transactivation assays demonstrated that ciprofibrate (data not shown) and fenofibrate (25.Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) activate PPARα with EC50 values of 20 and 30 μm, respectively, whereas PPARγ is only marginally activated by any of these compounds (EC50 value for PPARγ of 300 and >300 μm for fenofibrate and ciprofibrate respectively). Neither ciprofibrate nor fenofibrate activates PPARδ (Ref. 25.Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and data not shown). The third compound, GW9578, was chosen on the basis of its high activity and specificity for PPARα, with EC50values for murine PPARα of 5 nm (as opposed to 1.5 μm for PPARγ and 2.6 μm for PPARδ) (25.Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The influence of fenofibrate on glucose homeostasis was first analyzed in C57BL/6 mice, which develop obesity and IR when fed a high fat diet (24.Surwit R.S. Feinglos M.N. Rodin J. Sutherland A. Petro A.E. Opara E.C. Kuhn C.M. Rebuffé-Scrive M. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Feeding C57BL/6 mice with the high fat diet resulted in hyperinsulinemia and mild hyperglycemia, which were both corrected by low dose fenofibrate treatment (Fig. 1,A and B). By contrast, treatment of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice (n = 10/group) during 10 weeks with fenofibrate (0.1% w/w) incorporated in the diet did not influence serum glucose (untreated: 1.89 ± 0.33 versus treated: 2.03 ± 0.48 g/liter) or insulin (untreated: 17.6 ± 6.0versus treated: 16.3 ± 7.8 microunits/ml) concentrations, indicating that the effects of fenofibrate on glucose homeostasis occur only in IR fat-fed mice. Interestingly, fenofibrate treatment prevented the high fat diet-induced increase in body weight (Fig.2) and adipose tissue mass (Fig. 1,C and D). Identical results were obtained in a separate experiment with C57BL/6 mice submitted to the same nutritional protocol (Fig. 3). In these animals, serum leptin concentrations were measured and found to be positively correlated with body weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight, a relationship that was not influenced by fenofibrate treatment (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that fenofibrate does not exert a specific regulatory effect on leptin production. Interestingly, despite lower leptin concentrations, food intake was not increased in the mice fed the fenofibrate-enriched diet (13.8 ± 1.0 kcal/day/animal;n = 14) versus high fat diet alone (13.8 ± 0.9 kcal/day/animal; n = 14). These data further show that the effects of fenofibrate on glucose homeostasis, body weight, and adipose tissue mass are not driven by a reduction in caloric intake.Figure 3The positive correlation between leptin and body weight (A) or epididymal adipose tissue weight (B) is not influenced by fenofibrate treatment in C57BL/6 mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 6/group) were treated as indicated under Fig. 1. Body and epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum leptin concentrations were measured at the end of the treatment period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate which PPAR subtype was activated in vivo, Northern blot analysis of PPARα- and PPARγ-specific target gene expression was performed. To this aim, the mRNA levels of the gene coding for the fatty acid transporter CD36/FAT, which has been implicated in the development of the IR syndrome (27.Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D. Norsworthy P.J. Wahid F.N. Al-Majali K.M. Trembling P.M. Mann C.J. Shoulders C.C. Graf D. St. Lezin E. Kurtz T.W. Kren V. Pravenec M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), were measured based on the observation that its expression is regulated in a tissue-selective manner by activators of PPARα in liver and PPARγ in adipose tissue (28.Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In the C57BL/6 mice treated with fenofibrate, a marked increase in CD36/FAT mRNA levels were observed in the liver, whereas mRNA levels of CD36/FAT remained unchanged in epididymal adipose tissue (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that fenofibrate treatment resulted in selective activation of PPARα in liver, but not of PPARγ in adipose tissue of these mice. To test whether PPARα activators might also improve glucose homeostasis in another model of IR, we chose the obese Zucker rat, which bears a mutation in the leptin receptor gene resulting in early onset obesity and marked hyperinsulinemia (29.Bazin R. Lavau M. J. Lipid. Res. 1982; 23: 839-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the genetic background, these rats may also develop hyperglycemia later in life. Ciprofibrate treatment of 5-week-old obese Zucker rats lowered body weight gain and epididymal adipose tissue mass and reduced plasma insulin concentrations by almost 50% (TableI). Furthermore, the plasma insulin response to glucose during IVGTT was markedly decreased (Fig.5), demonstrating a clear-cut improvement of insulin action on glucose utilization. Serum glucose concentrations and IVGTT glucose curves were normal and comparable between treated and untreated obese rats (Table I and Fig. 5).Table IInfluence of ciprofibrate on body and adipose tissue weight and plasma insulin and glucose concentrations in 5-week-old obese Zucker ratsControl (n = 6)Treated (n = 6)p valueBody weight (g)202 ± 6185 ± 3p < 0.05Body weight gain (g/14 days)112 ± 395 ± 3p < 0.01Epididymal adipose tissue weight (g)1.63 ± 0.071.22 ± 0.05p < 0.01Glucose (g/liter)0.71 ± 0.050.64 ± 0.04NSaNS, not significant.Insulin (microunits/ml)109 ± 1255 ± 4p < 0.01a NS, not significant. Open table in a new tab In older obese Zucker rats, ciprofibrate treatment significantly decreased serum insulin concentrations (Fig.6), even though the insulin levels in these animals remained still higher than in age-matched lean (Fa/?) rats (insulinemia: 45 ± 8 microunits/ml; n = 4). In these obese rats, which have developed increased blood glucose concentrations at the age of 24 weeks, ciprofibrate treatment also decreased serum glucose concentrations (Fig. 6). In contrast to the observation in young obese Zucker rats, no change was detectable in body weight (Fig. 6) and adipose tissue mass (data not shown) at this age. Nevertheless, serum leptin concentrations were slightly decreased (Fig. 6), suggesting that adipose tissue tended to be reduced. Ciprofibrate treatment was without effect on serum insulin (untreated,n = 4: 45 ± 8; treated, n = 4: 53 ± 5 microunits/ml), glucose (untreated, n = 4: 1.2 ± 0.1; treated, n = 4: 1.0 ± 0.1 g/liter) and leptin (untreated, n = 4: 7.4 ± 0.8; treated, n = 4: 6.7 ± 1.0 ng/ml) concentrations in lean Zucker rats of the same age. At the dose administered to the obese Zucker rats, peak serum concentrations of ciprofibrate of 91 ± 3 μm were reached indicating, based on the EC50 values for PPARα (20 μm) and PPARγ (> 300 μm) activation, that ciprofibrate likely activates selectively PPARα in the obese rats. This was further demonstrated by a marked increase in CD36/FAT mRNA levels observed in the liver, with no change in both epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, mRNA levels of LPL and leptin, two other genes regulated by PPARγ, but not by PPARα activators in adipose tissue of rats (7.Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.-M. Heyman R.A.

By contrast, hepatic mRNA levels of the PPARα target genes (21.Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

In addition, the activity and mRNA levels of CPT-I and CPT-II as well as β-oxidation rates in the liver were significantly enhanced by ciprofibrate treatment (data not shown). These data indicate that ciprofibrate treatment results in selective PPARα, but not PPARγ activation in these obese Zucker rats. Similar results were obtained in a separate series of old obese Zucker rats treated for 9 days with the highly specific PPARα agonist GW9578 (25.Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ciprofibrate experiment, these obese Zucker rats were still normoglycemic at the age of 21 weeks, but serum insulin concentrations were significantly elevated, indicating a state of insulin resistance. Treatment with GW9578 resulted in markedly reduced serum insulin concentrations, whereas serum glucose levels were not affected (Fig. 6). Neither serum leptin levels nor body weights were changed, probably due to the short time of treatment in this particular experiment (Fig. 6). No effect of the treatment was observed on food consumption (untreated: 25.6 ± 6.7 g/day versustreated:25.0 ± 3.2 g/day), precluding an effect via dietary changes. When mRNA levels of CD36/FAT were measured, a pronounced increase of liver CD36/FAT mRNA levels was observed, whereas both epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue CD36/FAT mRNA levels remained unchanged after GW9578 treatment (Fig. 7). Furthermore, GW9578 treatment did not influence LPL or leptin mRNA levels in both adipose tissue depots (data not shown). Thus, as with ciprofibrate, treatment with GW9578 resulted in efficient PPARα activation, whereas PPARγ was not activated in these animals. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain naturally occurring and β-substituted FA (such as conjugated linoleic acid and MEDICA 16) (30.Houseknecht K.L. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Moya-Camarena S.Y.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 348-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) improve insulin sensitivity and normalize impaired glucose tolerance in rat models of IR. In humans bezafibrate may also improve glucose homeostasis (33.Jones I.R. Swai A. Taylor R. Miller M. Laker M.F. Alberti G. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34.Mikhailides D.P. Mathur S. Barradas M.A. Dandoma P. J. Cardiovasc.

Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Similarly, in contrast to ciprofibrate and fenofibrate, bezafibrate activates PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ with comparable EC50 values (PPARα: 50; PPARγ: 60 μm; PPARδ: 20 μm; Ref.25.Brown P.J. Winegar D.A. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Lewis M.C. Wilson J.G. Sundseth S.S. Koble C.S. Wu Z. Chapman J.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3785-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is impossible to conclude via which PPAR form the effects of these compounds on glucose homeostasis are mediated. In the present study we demonstrate that, in two models of diet-induced and genetic obesity-linked IR, PPARα activators correct elevated serum glucose and insulin concentrations by increasing insulin action on glucose utilization. Most importantly, fibrate PPARα activators also decrease adipose tissue mass, by a mechanism independent of changes in food intake and leptin gene expression. This effect is in sharp contrast to PPARγ activators, which increase body weight (13.Hallakou S. Doaré L. Foufelle F. Kergoat M. Guerre-Millo M. Berthault M.-F. Dugail I. Morin J. Auwerx J.

Staels B. Briggs M.R. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the nuclear receptor PPARα mediates the actions of ciprofibrate, fenofibrate and GW9578 on glucose homeostasis. First, based on the EC50 values of these compounds for the different PPARs and their serum concentrations attained in the obese Zucker rats, ciprofibrate and fenofibrate likely activate PPARα maximally, whereas PPARγ activation is negligible. Furthermore, ciprofibrate treatment increased mitochondrial β-oxidation and serum concentrations of ketone bodies (data not shown) in obese Zucker rats, which is consistent with PPARα activation. This is in contrast to the effect of glitazone PPARγ activators, which decrease serum ketone bodies (37.Oakes N.D. Kennedy C.J. Jenkins A.B. Laybutt D.R. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 38.Inoue I. Takahashi K. Katayama S. Harada Y. Negishi K. Itabashi A. Ishii J.

Second, treatment of obese Zucker rats with the highly specific PPARα ligand GW9578 resulted in a decrease of serum insulin concentrations. Finally, whereas glitazones have been shown to markedly influence gene expression in adipose tissue of both normal and obese Zucker rats (7.Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.-M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar,13.Hallakou S. Doaré L. Foufelle F. Kergoat M. Guerre-Millo M. Berthault M.-F. Dugail I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), GW9578 and ciprofibrate did not influence the expression of any known PPARγ target genes, including CD36/FAT, in adipose tissue. In sharp contrast, PPARα target gene expression in liver was significantly altered. These data provide in vivo evidence for selective activation of PPARα, but not PPARγ in the ciprofibrate- and GW9578-treated Zucker rats as well as in the fenofibrate-treated C57BL/6 mice. Although not the subject of the present study, PPARα ligands may influence body weight and glucose homeostasis through different mechanisms. At the doses employed in the present study, fibrates do not appear to have major effects on adipose tissue (present study and Refs.7.Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.-M. Heyman R.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In contrast, fibrates increase hepatic β-oxidation in obese Zucker rats (data not shown). This catabolic action on FA would result in an increased FA flux from peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, to the liver, a decreased FA synthesis, and a lowered delivery of triglycerides to peripheral tissues. As such fibrates might alleviate the FA-mediated inhibition of insulin-stimulated oxidative and non-oxidative glucose disposal in skeletal muscle (40.Randle P.J. Garland P.B. Hales C.N. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; I: 785-794Abstract Scopus (3743) Google Scholar, 41.Boden G. Chen X. Ruiz J. White J.V. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), thus ameliorating IR. Furthermore, by lowering plasma triglycerides, fibrates may decrease skeletal muscle triglyceride content, which is significantly related to IR and obesity (42.Goodpaster B.H. Kelley D.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As an alternative or concomitant mechanism, fibrates might improve insulin action by decreasing production of cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and TNFα. TNFα concentrations are increased in IR obese humans (43.Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar) and Zucker rats (44.Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar), as well as in rodents fed a high fat diet (45.Morin C.L. Eckel R.H. Marcel T. Pagliassotti M.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This cytokine has been implicated in the development of IR by interfering negatively with insulin signaling (44.Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). In support for this hypothesis is the demonstration that PPARα activators inhibit NFκB signaling, resulting in lowered production of cytokines by smooth muscle cells and decreased plasma concentrations of cytokines (22.Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.-C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 23.Madej A. Okopien B. Kowalski J. Zielinski M. Wysocki J. Szygula B. Kalina Z. Herman Z.S. Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 36: 345-349PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, such a mechanism has also been suggested to participate, at least in part, in the insulin-sensitizing effect of glitazone PPARγ activators (11.Miles P.D.G. Romeo O.M. Higo K. Cohen A. Rafaat K. Olefsky J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Finally, it cannot be excluded that PPARα agonists exert direct insulin-sensitizing actions. In contrast to glitazones, which are high affinity PPARγ ligands, the current clinically used fibrates are low affinity PPARα ligands. In conclusion, the results from this study suggest that PPARα ligands with higher affinity, in addition to being useful for the treatment of dyslipidemia, may also be of use to improve insulin sensitivity. Further studies in patients with MS are required to determine whether highly active and selective PPARα agonists also improve glucose homeostasis in man. We thank C. Ilic and V. Guilbert for technical contributions and K. Kristiansen for providing us the CD36/FAT cDNA."

Halorhodopsin crystals were grown in a cubic lipidic phase, which allowed the x-ray structure determination of this anion pump at 1.8 angstrom resolution. Halorhodopsin assembles to trimers around a central patch consisting of palmitic acid. Next to the protonated Schiff base between Lys 242 and the isomerizable retinal chromophore, a single chloride ion occupies the transport site. Energetic calculations on chloride binding reveal a combination of ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions for stabilizing the anion 18 angstroms below the membrane surface. Ion dragging across the protonated Schiff base explains why chloride and proton translocation modes are mechanistically equivalent in archaeal rhodopsins."

WNK1 has 2126 amino acids and can be detected as a protein of ∼230 kDa in various cell lines and rat tissues. WNK1 contains a small N-terminal domain followed by the kinase domain and a long C-terminal tail. The WNK1 kinase domain has the greatest similarity to the MEKK protein kinase family. However, overexpression of WNK1 in HEK293 cells exerts no detectable effect on the activity of known, co-transfected mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that it belongs to a distinct pathway. WNK1 phosphorylates the exogenous substrate myelin basic protein as well as itself mostly on serine residues, confirming that it is a serine/threonine protein kinase. The demonstration of activity was striking because WNK1, and its homologs in other organisms lack the invariant catalytic lysine in subdomain II of protein kinases that is crucial for binding to ATP. A model of WNK1 using the structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase suggests that lysine 233 in kinase subdomain I may provide this function.

Conserved structural motifs within the core sequence maintain the basic fold of the catalytic domain, and fewer than 10 highly conserved residues create the functional elements of the active site (4.Knighton D.R.

Prior to the solution of the three-dimensional structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 by Knighton et al. (4.Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Among these a lysine residue near the N terminus of the kinase in protein kinase subdomain II (Lys72 in PKA); this residue has frequently been mutated to eliminate the catalytic activity of protein kinases (9.Zoller M.J.

This lysine functions to anchor and orient ATP through interactions with the α and β phosphoryl groups (4.Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 5641-5646Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Until recently all members of the protein kinase family were found to contain a lysine following a short string of hydrophobic residues in this conserved position. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) contains arginine in place of this lysine but has not yet been shown to catalyze phosphorylation of protein substrates (11.Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12.Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Mutation of this arginine in KSR does impair its function in reconstitution assays, suggesting that it plays a significant role in KSR function (11.Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 shows that substitution of the conserved lysine with arginine causes the phosphoryl groups of ATP to be rotated away from the position necessary for phosphoryl transfer (10.Robinson M.J. Harkins P.C. Zhang J. Baer R. Haycock J.W. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 5641-5646Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of arginine in this conserved position of KSR is uncertain. We have identified a novel protein kinase WNK1 (withno lysine (K)), which contains cysteine in place of lysine at the usual conserved location but has kinase activity as deduced from its ability to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate in vitro. We have investigated the basis for its catalytic activity using a structural model, mutagenesis, and protein expression. WNK1 was isolated in a nested PCR cloning strategy aimed to identify novel members of the MAP/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) family. MAP kinases are a family of protein kinases that have been utilized to varying degrees to regulate or modulate almost all signal transduction pathways in cells (13.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These enzymes themselves are regulated by cascades of at least two upstream protein kinases, a MEK and a MEK kinase. Members of the MEK (or MKK) family display considerable selectivity for their particular MAP kinase targets, thereby contributing to signaling specificity (13.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They activate MAP kinases by dual phosphorylation on a tyrosine and a threonine residue, and each MEK recognizes only a small subset of possible MAP kinase substrates. After the purification and cloning of the first MEK family member, MEK1 (15.Seger R. Seger D. Lozeman F.J. Ahn N.G. Graves L.M. Campbell J.S. Ericsson L. Harrylock M. Jensen A.M. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

We continued to examine clones derived from the screen that led us to isolate cDNAs encoding MEK5 (22.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As described in this report, one of these clones encoded the unusual protein kinase WNK1. First strand cDNA isolated from nerve growth factor stimulated PC12 cells was used as the template in PCR reactions utilizing nested degenerate primers derived from MEK sequences (22.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). One PCR product (product 15) was used to screen a rat forebrain cDNA library (kindly provided by Jim Boulter) at low stringency, and a weakly hybridizing clone of approximately 900 base pairs (PC12 clone 2-3) was isolated that had a short region of identity to the PCR product. This PC12 clone 2-3 was then used to rescreen the rat forebrain cDNA library at high stringency, and a group of strongly hybridizing clones were isolated. Partial sequences that encoded the N terminus and the kinase domain of WNK1 were assembled from two of these clones. A 0.5-kb WNK1 3′ probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random-priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen another rat brain cDNA library that contains longer inserts (also kindly provided by Jim Boulter). One of the clones isolated contained the complete 3′ WNK1 sequence. The full-length WNK1 cDNA was assembled from these clones. A rat adult multi-tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a random-primed (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 0.5-kb WNK1 5′ probe according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a 2.8-kb WNK1 3′ probe. This Northern blot was stripped again and hybridized with a β-actin probe to confirm the presence of mRNA in each lane. A pSK-WNK1 full-length construct was created from three overlapping cDNA clones and was used as the template for the subsequent subcloning. A 1.6-kb WNK1 fragment encoding residues 1–555 was amplified by PCR with anEcoRI site incorporated at the 5′ end and aHindIII site incorporated at the 3′ end, and this fragment was digested with EcoRI-HindIII and ligated into pGEX-KG or pCMV5-Myc vectors that had been digested withEcoRI and HindIII to create pGEX-KG-WNK1 (1–555) and pCMV5-Myc-WNK1 (1–555). To make a pGEX-KG-WNK1 full-length construct, pGEX-KG-WNK1 (1–555) was digested with HindIII, filled-in with Klenow, and then digested with SacII; pSK-WNK1 was digested with SpeI, filled-in with Klenow, and then digested with SacII. The 6.5-kb insert fragment from pSK-WNK1 was gel purified and ligated into the 5.1-kb vector fragment from pGEX-KG-WNK1 (1–555). To generate a pCMV5-Myc-WNK1 full-length construct, pSK-WNK1 was digested with SacII-SpeI and the 6.5-kb insert fragment was gel purified and ligated into the 4.8-kb SacII-XbaI digested pCMV5-Myc-WNK1 (1–555) vector backbone. All constructs and mutants were sequenced to confirm that the sequences were correct. pCEP4HA-ERK2, pSRα-HA-JNK1, pCEP4HA-p38α, and pCEP4HA-ERK5 were as described (26.Xu S. Robbins D.J.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Quikchange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The WNK1 mutants used in this study include K233M, K256M, K259M, C250A, C250K, D368A, and the double mutant S378D/S382D. GST-WNK1 (full-length and 1–555) proteins were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 using the standard protocol (28.Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The induction conditions were: 40 μm (for 1–555) or 400 μm (for full-length) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 5 h. The protein concentration was estimated by comparing to serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin on the same gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was purchased from Calbiochem. GST-c-Jun and GST-ATF2Δ were as described (29.English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-WNK1 antisera Q255 and Q256 were raised using standard methods against a WNK1 N-terminal peptide: TSKDRPVSQPSLVGSKE (30.Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Anti-ERK1 Y691 was as described (30.Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Company. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was obtained from the Cell Culture Center. For immunoblotting, cell or tissue lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. Blots were then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 0.2 ml of cell lysates with 2 μl of antibody and 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Precipitates were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1m NaCl and once with 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2. HEK 293 cells were maintained, transfected, and harvested as described (31.Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For cell fractionation, cells from each 60-mm dish were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed with a Dounce apparatus, and the nuclei were collected by sedimentation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. A particulate fraction was collected by sedimenting the supernatant at 55,000 rpm for 30 min in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed with 200 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 2.5% glycerol, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) at 4 °C for 30 min. Both the washed nuclear pellet and the particulate fraction were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunofluorescence was essentially as described (32.Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were grown on coverslips coated with collagen, fixed with formaldehyde, and treated with anti-Myc antibody. Cells were washed and treated with goat anti-mouse fluorescein secondary antibody followed by diamidinophenylindole staining. Coverslips were mounted onto slides, and cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. In vitro kinase assays and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as described (33.Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A WNK1 model was made using PKA as a template. An alignment of the kinase domains of WNK1 and PKA was generated. InsightII (Molecular Biosystems) was used to change residues 50–100 of the structure of PKA to the corresponding residues found in WNK1 and create a ribbon diagram. In an attempt to isolate novel mammalian MEKs, nested degenerate PCR primers designed based on sequences conserved among MEK family members were used to amplify products from first strand cDNA isolated from PC12 cells (22.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). One product of 150 base pairs was used to probe a rat forebrain cDNA library. A clone isolated from a low stringency screen was used to screen two rat brain cDNA libraries and several positive clones encoding a novel protein kinase named WNK1 were isolated. The full-length WNK1 cDNA containing 7.2 kb was assembled from three overlapping clones. The sequence surrounding the ATG start codon matched the Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation, and stop codons were present upstream in all three reading frames. Although there was no poly(A) track found downstream of the stop codon in the available WNK1 sequence, there is a polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) at the end of the cDNA clone. The open reading frame encoded by the WNK1 cDNA contains 2126 amino acids with a serine/threonine protein kinase domain in the N-terminal 490 residues (Fig. 1, A and B). A partial clone encoding a closely related kinase (WNK2) was also isolated. Homologs of WNK1 exist in Caenorhabditis elegans,Phycomyces, Arabidopsis, and Oryza as well as other mammals (Fig. 1 C). A human expressed sequence tag containing an open reading frame lacking the kinase domain is almost identical to the WNK1 C-terminal sequence, and two human open reading frames containing partial kinase domains show strong similarity to the WNK1 catalytic domain, indicating that they may encode parts of human WNK family members. WNK1 and its homologs are characterized by the absence of the catalytic lysine found in subdomain II of almost all known protein kinases (1.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). In WNK1, a cysteine lies in the position of the usual lysine. WNK1 shares several sequence features with the MEK family, including the length of the activation loop (between subdomain VII and VIII), the position of potential activating phosphorylation sites (SFAKS; these sites are also conserved in the IκB kinases IKK1 and 2 (34.Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 35.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar)), conservation in the region of protein substrate binding, and a pattern of conserved hydrophobic residues near the C terminus. However, the kinase domain of WNK1 does not clearly fall into any kinase subgroup but shows the greatest similarity to MEKK-like kinases (∼30% identity) and, to a lesser extent, to Ste20p-like kinases. The N-terminal and C-terminal noncatalytic domains of WNK1 are not similar to any other proteins in the data base. To examine the expression of WNK1 in various rat tissues, a rat multi-tissue Northern blot was hybridized with a 0.5-kb WNK1 5′ probe. Two transcripts of 11 and 9.5 kb were detected in several tissues including lung, liver, and spleen (Fig.2). The existence of two different species of mRNA suggests that an alternative splicing event might be involved in WNK1 mRNA processing. Similar results were obtained using a 3′ 2.8-kb probe (data not shown). A polyclonal antibody raised against a WNK1 N-terminal peptide recognized a protein of ∼230 kDa corresponding to the predicted size of WNK1 in rat brain and several mammalian cell lines including 293, COS-1, and INS-1 cells (Fig.3), suggesting that it is widely expressed.Figure 3Detection of endogenous WNK1 protein in cell lysates. Lysates of rat brain and several cultured cell lines were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with anti-WNK1 antibody Q256 as described under “Materials and Methods.” GST-WNK1 (1–555) was loaded as the positive control. The arrowindicates the position of the endogenous protein on the blot. Molecular weight markers are shown. − Peptide, the antibody was not exposed to the antigenic peptide; + Peptide, the antibody was preincubated with 50 μg/ml of antigenic peptide overnight to demonstrate antibody specificity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether WNK1 is soluble or associated with nuclear or particulate fractions, HEK293 cells were fractionated and proteins in each fraction were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted with an anti-WNK1 antibody. The majority of endogenous WNK1 protein was found in the particulate fraction, suggesting that WNK1 is associated with either membranes or the cytoskeleton (Fig.4 A). To examine its cellular localization of further, a Myc-tagged WNK1 construct was transfected into 293 cells, and the expressed protein was visualized by immunofluorescence with an anti-Myc antibody. Most staining was observed outside of the nucleus, suggesting that WNK1 is cytoplasmic protein not restricted to the plasma membrane (Fig.4 B). To examine the kinase activity of WNK1, Myc-tagged WNK1 was transfected in 293 cells and then immunoprecipitated from lysed cells with an anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitate showed kinase activity toward MBP as well as itself (Fig. 5 A). Although activity toward MBP was detected, autophosphorylation was more consistent than MBP phosphorylation in the immune complex kinase assay because of the high background contributed by other protein kinases. Wild type GST-WNK1 expressed in E. coli phosphorylated both itself and MBP. Mutation of the putative Mg2+ binding residue aspartate 368 to alanine generated a WNK1 protein with no detectable kinase activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation occurs mainly on serine residues, indicating that WNK1 is a serine/threonine kinase (Fig. 5 B). To test the endogenous activity of WNK1, the endogenous protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-WNK1 antibodies and assayed by its ability to autophosphorylate. Immunoblotting confirmed that WNK1 was immunoprecipitated (not shown). The ability of WNK1 to autophosphorylate was apparent from the incorporation of labeled phosphate into a band of approximately 230 kDa. In contrast, neither preimmune serum nor the unrelated anti-ERK1 antibody immunoprecipitated an autophosphorylating band of this size (Fig. 5 C). To identify regulators of WNK1, we tested a number of agents and stimuli to determine whether they could increase WNK1 activity in 293 cells. Endogenous WNK1 was immunoprecipitated following cell treatment, and autophosphorylation was assayed. Among the stimuli tested, 0.5m NaCl (Fig. 5 D) and less so 0.5 msorbitol (not shown) caused a reproducible increase in WNK1 autophosphorylation, suggesting that WNK1 may be involved in osmosensing pathways. No effects were detected with epidermal growth factor, the microtubule disrupting agent nocodazole, anisomycin, lysophosphatidic acid (Fig. 5 D), serum, heat shock, phorbol ester, H2O2, or okadaic acid (not shown). Because WNK1 was isolated as a possible MEK homolog and has modest similarity to the MEKK-like and Ste20p-like kinases within its catalytic domain, we examined the potential regulation of MAP kinase pathways by WNK1. The WNK1 kinase domain (residues 1–555) was expressed in mammalian cells and the activities of the known MAP kinases, HA-tagged forms of ERK2, ERK5, JNK1, or p38, were measured. Myc-tagged WNK1 (1–555) constructs, either wild type or kinase dead (D368A), were used in the majority of experiments because expression was to a much greater extent than for full-length WNK1. HA-tagged proteins were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and assayed using MBP, c-Jun, or ATF-2 as substrates. No obvious changes in activity of any of these kinases were observed with overexpression of either wild type or kinase-dead WNK1 (1–555) (Fig.6) or with full-length WNK1 (not shown).In vitro, GST-WNK1 displayed neither MEK nor MEKK activity. It failed to phosphorylate recombinant ERK1, ERK2, ERK5, JNK1, or p38. WNK1 also did not phosphorylate MEK1, MKK2, MKK3, MKK4, MEK5, MKK6, or MKK7; nor did it phosphorylate IκB, ribosomal protein S6, or fragments of MEKK1 (not shown). In addition, the two possible phosphorylation sites of WNK1 (SFAKS) that lie in the same relative positions as the activating sites of phosphorylation in the MEK family were mutated to aspartic acid (S378D/S382D). Although comparable mutations increase the activity of some MEK family members (e.g. MEK1), there was no detectable effect of these mutations on WNK1 activity (not shown). In summary, these results suggest that WNK1 does not directly regulate the MAP kinase pathways tested. Several residues involved in catalysis of phosphoryl transfer are highly conserved in all protein kinases, notably the catalytic lysine residue present in kinase subdomain II, which binds to ATP. Surprisingly, this apparently invariant lysine residue is replaced by a cysteine (Cys250) in WNK1. The lack of lysine at this position was confirmed in multiple independent clones of rat WNK1. More striking, this unusual difference is conserved across diverse species, suggesting functional relevance. Two possible explanations for this deviation in WNK1 were either that the catalytic lysine was located at a different position in the structure or that the WNK1 catalytic mechanism was distinct from other protein kinases. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first created a structural model of WNK1 based on the coordinates of PKA (Fig.7). Based on this model, several candidate lysine residues that might potentially function in ATP binding, Lys233, Lys256, and Lys259, were mutated to methionine. In addition, Cys250 was mutated to either alanine or lysine to determine whether it was required for catalysis. These mutants were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and assayed in vitro using MBP as substrate (Fig. 8). WNK1 C250K had greatly reduced kinase activity, suggesting that Cys250 may play some catalytic role. However, WNK1 C250A had the same activity as wild type protein. This result demonstrated that Cys250 is not required for WNK1 activity, but a lysine that has a larger and positively charged side chain may interfere with the folding or activity of the catalytic site. WNK1 K256M and K259M exhibited kinase activity similar to the wild type protein, indicating that Lys256 and Lys259 are not required for catalytic activity. In contrast, WNK1 K233M had no detectable kinase activity, indicating that Lys233, like Asp368, plays a critical role in WNK1 activity. This lysine residue, Lys233, is conserved in position in all the WNK homologs, consistent with its importance for catalytic activity. Interestingly, Lys233 replaces a glycine residue in the glycine string of subdomain I that comprises the phosphate anchor ribbon as shown in Fig.7. Mutation of this residue in PKA has relatively little impact on its kinetic properties (36.Hemmer W. McGlone M. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16946-16954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that glycine, although it is usually present, is not required at this position for kinase activity. From this location in the primary sequence, the side chain of Lys233 can apparently fill the position normally occupied by the lysine residue present in other protein kinases that corresponds to Cys250 in WNK1 (Fig. 7).Figure 8Analysis of WNK1 mutants.

Roman numerals indicate the kinase subdomains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, we have isolated and characterized a protein kinase represented in diverse organisms with a previously unknown placement of a key catalytic residue. Mutagenesis studies indicates that a lysine, Lys233, in the glycine ribbon is required for activity of WNK1. All other residues conserved among the protein kinases are in the expected locations in WNK1. The impaired activity of a mutant in which the putative magnesium binding residue, aspartate 368, was replaced with alanine supports the conclusion that the active site is otherwise typical of protein kinases. Modeling experiments suggest that the active site structure can be preserved despite this significant sequence deviation. Interestingly, a key lysine present in GTPases and other nucleotidases often lies quite near the glycine string (37.Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Perhaps the altered organization of the catalytic residues in WNK1-like kinases reflects a yet-to-be-discovered regulatory or functional adaptation better served by this particular sequence arrangement.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and post-translational mechanisms. Two post-translational means of MMP regulation have been described. First, MMPs are synthesized as latent pro-enzymes. A cysteine-rich N-terminal peptide of the latent proenzyme interacts with the Zn+2 at the active site, blocking proteolytic activity of the proteinase (17Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). After cleavage of the propeptide, the latent enzyme becomes activated, enabling it to degrade its substrate. A second mode of post-translational regulation has been described as well. Active MMPs are inhibited by the broad spectrum proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (18Abe S. Nagai Y. J.

The mechanisms by which MMPs are proteolytically processed from their latent to their activated forms and how they are regulated by inhibitors are important to understanding their contributions to normal developmental and pathological processes.Evidence exists for several mechanisms of proteolytic activation of the latent proMMPs.

Already activated MMPs can also contribute to activation of other proMMPs. For example, MMP-3 can activate proMMP-1 (32Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Morodomi T. Salvesen G. Nagase H.

Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). This process of activation first involves an initial cleavage of proMMP-2 by MMP-14 at the Asn37-Leu38 bond of proMMP-2 followed by an autocatalytic cleavage of the intermediate product at the Asn80-Tyr81 bond, generating the fully active MMP-2 (36Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Although TIMP-2 is an inhibitor of MMPs, paradoxically in this mechanism it can function as a co-activator of proMMP-2 as well. Evidence indicates that TIMP-2 participates in the activation of proMMP-2 by MMP-14 by facilitating the assembly of a complex on the cell surface that brings the two MMPs together. In this trimeric complex, the C termini of proMMP-2 and TIMP-2 interact while the N termini of MMP-14 and TIMP-2 interact (34Atkinson S.J. Crabbe T. Cowell S. Ward R.V. Butler M.J. Sato H. Seiki M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The ability of TIMP-2 to participate in this mechanism is sensitive to the local extracellular matrix environment (42Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Atkinson S.J. d'Ortho M.P. Yamada K.M. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIMP-2 may be completely dispensable for proMMP-2 activation since the extracellular domain of MMP-14 can lead to proMMP-2 activation in the absence of any TIMP-2 (44Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Such TIMP-2-independent pathways may exist that allow intracellular activation of latent proMMP-2 (45Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Collier M. Li L. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).If the TIMP-2-dependent mechanism of proMMP-2 activation is the primary means for activating the latent proenzyme in normal tissues or cultured primary cells, then conversion of the latent MMP-2 proenzyme to its active form would fail in tissues or cells deficient for TIMP-2. To test this hypothesis and to study other in vivo functions of TIMP-2 in normal development and disease processes, mice carrying a null mutation in the single gene encodingTimp2 on chromosome 11 were generated. Reported here is the development of TIMP-2-deficient mice and studies of proMMP-2 activation in tissues and cells derived from mutant animals.DISCUSSIONMice carrying a targeted mutation in Timp2 were generated. No Timp2 mRNA was detected in tissues from mutant animals, indicating the mutation was null. Loss of TIMP-2 did not adversely affect normal mouse development, viability, or fertility on the C57BL/6 background. However, loss of the inhibitor did result in a dramatic reduction in activation of the latent proenzyme, proMMP-2, in lung tissue in vivo and cultured primary fibroblastsin vitro. This demonstrates that TIMP-2 is not only a potential component of the proMMP-2 activation mechanism, as indicated by several published reports, but in fact it is required for normal activation of the latent proenzyme in vivo. It cannot be ruled out that TIMP-2-independent mechanisms exist for activating proMMP-2. However, if such mechanisms exist, they are far less efficient at inducing proMMP-2 activation than the mechanism involving TIMP-2 in the tissue and cells analyzed in this study. Failure of proMMP-2 activation in and of itself was expected to have minimal developmental consequences, consistent with the lack of a developmental phenotype in mice deficient for MMP-2 (50Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051PubMed Google Scholar). However, any phenotypes seen in MMP-2-deficient mice may also be expected to be seen in TIMP-2-deficient mice.Because the proMMP-2 activation defect observed in cultures ofTimp2 mutant cells could be suppressed by exogenously added recombinant human TIMP-2 protein, the requirement for TIMP-2 in proMMP-2 activation is not cell autonomous. The effects of added TIMP-2 protein on proMMP-2 activation in the culture systems used were either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending upon the concentration of TIMP-2 protein in the cultures. This is consistent with observations that the stoichiometry of the various co-activators and of the latent proMMP-2 protein is critical in governing proMMP-2 activation. Although exogenously added human TIMP-2 could partly restore proMMP-2 activation to homozygous mutant cells, the activation products that accumulated were intermediates and not fully active MMP-2. The reasons for the partial activation are not clear. There may be important species differences between mouse and human TIMP-2. The specific preparations of human TIMP-2 used may have been only partly active. Finally, the cellular location where TIMP-2 interacts with proMMP-2 may be important to the nature of the interaction and the capacity of proMMP-2 to subsequently undergo complete activation. Exogenously added TIMP-2 may not provide the same interaction with proMMP-2 as endogenously produced protein.TIMP-1 was unable to replace TIMP-2 as a co-factor for proMMP-2 activation; however, it was able to block proMMP-2 activation at higher concentrations. This indicated that MMP activity is itself needed for proMMP-2 activation and also highlights the functional differences between TIMPs 1 and 2. These differences are likely to result from the particular structural features of the two TIMPs. One specific feature that may allow TIMP-2, but not TIMP-1, to participate in proMMP-2 activation is the 10-residue-long negatively charged C-terminal tail of TIMP-2, which is only 3 residues long in TIMP-1 (41Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This tail may enable TIMP-2 to form salt bridges with specific positively charged residues at the junction of C-terminal hemopexin domains III and IV of pro-MMP-2, which are required for proMMP-2 to form a complex with TIMP-2 (37Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 51Overall C.M. King A.E. Sam D.K. Ong A.D. Lau T.T. Wallon U.M. DeClerck Y.A. Atherstone J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4421-4429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A second structural difference between TIMPs 1 and 2 that may enable TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1 to participate in proMMP-2 activation lies at the N terminus. Residues within the unique long N-terminal A-B β-hairpin loop of TIMP-2 are required for specific interactions with MMP-14 (52Butler G.S. Hutton M. Wattam B.A. Williamson R.A. Knauper V. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20391-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 is 7 residues shorter in this domain, which significantly shortens the A-B β-hairpin. This and other loop structure differences between the two TIMPs cause them to associate very differently with MMPs and may prevent TIMP-1 from interacting with MMP-14 in a way that enables it to replace TIMP-2 as a co-activator of proMMP-2 (41Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Activation mechanisms for proMMPs other than proMMP-2 have been described as cell surface events requiring membrane type MMPs. For example, like proMMP-2, proMMP-13 can be activated by a mechanism involving MMP-14 and MMP-2 (28Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17124-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). It is not yet known if efficient proMMP-13 activation, like proMMP-2 activation, is dependent upon the presence of TIMP-2. These studies are ongoing. Other TIMPs may also play a direct role in activation of proMMPs. TIMP-4 is able to interact with the C-terminal region of proMMP-2 in a manner similar to that of TIMP-2 (53Bigg H.F. Shi Y.E. Liu Y.E. Steffensen B. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15496-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Whether it, like TIMP-2, is required for efficient proMMP-2 activation is not known.Other important functional differences between TIMPs 1 and 2 have been revealed during analysis of mutant mice. Although TIMP-2 loss resulted in defects in proMMP-2 activation, this was unaffected by a mutation within Timp1. Also, although TIMP-1-deficient animals are hyper-resistant to corneal infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a complement-dependent mechanism, TIMP-2-deficient mice have normal immune responses (11Osiewicz K. McGarry M. Soloway P.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 54Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878 (21): 519Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that other MMP-sensitive immune response mechanisms, possibly involving defensin production (55Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), are altered. More than 20 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 have been described that collectively degrade all extracellular matrix and a number of non-matrix proteins involved in inflammation and cell growth control (reviewed in Ref. 1Birkedal-Hansen H.

The MMPs and their specific inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been associated directly and indirectly with many developmental processes such as branching morphogenesis (2Sympson C.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and post-translational mechanisms. Two post-translational means of MMP regulation have been described. First, MMPs are synthesized as latent pro-enzymes. A cysteine-rich N-terminal peptide of the latent proenzyme interacts with the Zn+2 at the active site, blocking proteolytic activity of the proteinase (17Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). After cleavage of the propeptide, the latent enzyme becomes activated, enabling it to degrade its substrate. A second mode of post-translational regulation has been described as well. Active MMPs are inhibited by the broad spectrum proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (18Abe S. Nagai Y. J. Biochem. 1973; 73: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and by four known MMP-specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases or TIMPs (19Murphy G. McGuire M.B. Russell R.G.

This process of activation first involves an initial cleavage of proMMP-2 by MMP-14 at the Asn37-Leu38 bond of proMMP-2 followed by an autocatalytic cleavage of the intermediate product at the Asn80-Tyr81 bond, generating the fully active MMP-2 (36Will H.

Although TIMP-2 is an inhibitor of MMPs, paradoxically in this mechanism it can function as a co-activator of proMMP-2 as well. Evidence indicates that TIMP-2 participates in the activation of proMMP-2 by MMP-14 by facilitating the assembly of a complex on the cell surface that brings the two MMPs together. In this trimeric complex, the C termini of proMMP-2 and TIMP-2 interact while the N termini of MMP-14 and TIMP-2 interact (34Atkinson S.J. Crabbe T. Cowell S. Ward R.V. Butler M.J. Sato H. Seiki M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The ability of TIMP-2 to participate in this mechanism is sensitive to the local extracellular matrix environment (42Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Atkinson S.J. d'Ortho M.P. Yamada K.M. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIMP-2 may be completely dispensable for proMMP-2 activation since the extracellular domain of MMP-14 can lead to proMMP-2 activation in the absence of any TIMP-2 (44Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Such TIMP-2-independent pathways may exist that allow intracellular activation of latent proMMP-2 (45Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Collier M. Li L. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If the TIMP-2-dependent mechanism of proMMP-2 activation is the primary means for activating the latent proenzyme in normal tissues or cultured primary cells, then conversion of the latent MMP-2 proenzyme to its active form would fail in tissues or cells deficient for TIMP-2. To test this hypothesis and to study other in vivo functions of TIMP-2 in normal development and disease processes, mice carrying a null mutation in the single gene encodingTimp2 on chromosome 11 were generated. Reported here is the development of TIMP-2-deficient mice and studies of proMMP-2 activation in tissues and cells derived from mutant animals. DISCUSSIONMice carrying a targeted mutation in Timp2 were generated. No Timp2 mRNA was detected in tissues from mutant animals, indicating the mutation was null. Loss of TIMP-2 did not adversely affect normal mouse development, viability, or fertility on the C57BL/6 background. However, loss of the inhibitor did result in a dramatic reduction in activation of the latent proenzyme, proMMP-2, in lung tissue in vivo and cultured primary fibroblastsin vitro. This demonstrates that TIMP-2 is not only a potential component of the proMMP-2 activation mechanism, as indicated by several published reports, but in fact it is required for normal activation of the latent proenzyme in vivo. It cannot be ruled out that TIMP-2-independent mechanisms exist for activating proMMP-2. However, if such mechanisms exist, they are far less efficient at inducing proMMP-2 activation than the mechanism involving TIMP-2 in the tissue and cells analyzed in this study. Failure of proMMP-2 activation in and of itself was expected to have minimal developmental consequences, consistent with the lack of a developmental phenotype in mice deficient for MMP-2 (50Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051PubMed Google Scholar). However, any phenotypes seen in MMP-2-deficient mice may also be expected to be seen in TIMP-2-deficient mice.Because the proMMP-2 activation defect observed in cultures ofTimp2 mutant cells could be suppressed by exogenously added recombinant human TIMP-2 protein, the requirement for TIMP-2 in proMMP-2 activation is not cell autonomous. The effects of added TIMP-2 protein on proMMP-2 activation in the culture systems used were either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending upon the concentration of TIMP-2 protein in the cultures. This is consistent with observations that the stoichiometry of the various co-activators and of the latent proMMP-2 protein is critical in governing proMMP-2 activation. Although exogenously added human TIMP-2 could partly restore proMMP-2 activation to homozygous mutant cells, the activation products that accumulated were intermediates and not fully active MMP-2. The reasons for the partial activation are not clear. There may be important species differences between mouse and human TIMP-2. The specific preparations of human TIMP-2 used may have been only partly active. Finally, the cellular location where TIMP-2 interacts with proMMP-2 may be important to the nature of the interaction and the capacity of proMMP-2 to subsequently undergo complete activation. Exogenously added TIMP-2 may not provide the same interaction with proMMP-2 as endogenously produced protein.TIMP-1 was unable to replace TIMP-2 as a co-factor for proMMP-2 activation; however, it was able to block proMMP-2 activation at higher concentrations. This indicated that MMP activity is itself needed for proMMP-2 activation and also highlights the functional differences between TIMPs 1 and 2. These differences are likely to result from the particular structural features of the two TIMPs. One specific feature that may allow TIMP-2, but not TIMP-1, to participate in proMMP-2 activation is the 10-residue-long negatively charged C-terminal tail of TIMP-2, which is only 3 residues long in TIMP-1 (41Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This tail may enable TIMP-2 to form salt bridges with specific positively charged residues at the junction of C-terminal hemopexin domains III and IV of pro-MMP-2, which are required for proMMP-2 to form a complex with TIMP-2 (37Butler G.S.

A second structural difference between TIMPs 1 and 2 that may enable TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1 to participate in proMMP-2 activation lies at the N terminus. Residues within the unique long N-terminal A-B β-hairpin loop of TIMP-2 are required for specific interactions with MMP-14 (52Butler G.S. Hutton M. Wattam B.A. Williamson R.A. Knauper V.

TIMP-1 is 7 residues shorter in this domain, which significantly shortens the A-B β-hairpin. This and other loop structure differences between the two TIMPs cause them to associate very differently with MMPs and may prevent TIMP-1 from interacting with MMP-14 in a way that enables it to replace TIMP-2 as a co-activator of proMMP-2 (41Fernandez-Catalan C.

Whether it, like TIMP-2, is required for efficient proMMP-2 activation is not known.Other important functional differences between TIMPs 1 and 2 have been revealed during analysis of mutant mice. Although TIMP-2 loss resulted in defects in proMMP-2 activation, this was unaffected by a mutation within Timp1. Also, although TIMP-1-deficient animals are hyper-resistant to corneal infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a complement-dependent mechanism, TIMP-2-deficient mice have normal immune responses (11Osiewicz K.

We now show that AKT activation and activity are markedly increased in androgen-independent, prostate-specific antigen-positive prostate cancer cells (LNAI cells) established from xenograft tumors of the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line. These LNAI cells show increased expression of integrin-linked kinase, which is putatively responsible for AKT activation/Ser-473 phosphorylation, as well as for increased phosphorylation of the AKT target protein, BAD. Furthermore, expression of the p27Kip1 cell cycle regulator was diminished in LNAI cells, consistent with the notion that AKT directly inhibits AFX/Forkhead-mediated transcription of p27Kip1. To assess directly the impact of increased AKT activity on prostate cancer progression, an activated hAKT1 mutant was overexpressed in LNCaP cells, resulting in a 6-fold increase in xenograft tumor growth. Like LNAI cells, these transfectants showed dramatically reduced p27Kip1 expression. Together, these data implicate increased AKT activity in prostate tumor progression and androgen independence and suggest that diminished p27Kip1expression, which has been repeatedly associated with prostate cancer progression, may be a consequence of increased AKT activity.

Because AKT is a central regulator of many intracellular processes implicated in prostate tumor progression and because PTEN, the negative regulator of AKT, is functionally inactivated in a significant proportion of advanced hPCa, we explored whether increased AKT activity may be involved in prostate tumor progression and androgen independence. To better model androgen-independent hPCa, we established a novel series of AR+, PSA+, androgen-independent hPCa cells (LNAI cells) derived from xenograft tumors of the androgen-sensitive/dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Our analyses of these cells reveals that AKT activity is increased with androgen-independent progression corresponding to increased expression of integrin-linked kinase, the kinase putatively responsible for the activation of AKT by phosphorylation at Ser-473 (Refs. 27Delcommenne M.

In addition, overexpression of an activated AKT-1 cDNA in LNCaP cells dramatically accelerates xenograft tumor growth and suppresses p27Kip1 expression. These data implicate increased AKT activity in human prostate cancer progression and androgen independence and suggest that the reduction in p27Kip1 expression (4Agus D.B. Cordon-Cardo C. Fox W.

Cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). All xenograft studies were performed by injecting 4 × 106 cells subcutaneously in 100 μl of a 1:1 mix of 1× phosphate-buffered saline and Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) into castrated male nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawleynu/nu) or into intact male nude mice supplemented with 90-day release testosterone pellets (Innovative Research, Tampa, FL). First-generation LNAI cell lines, LNAI.T1 and LNAI.T2, were derived from a xenograft tumor of LNCaP established in an intact mouse that continued to grow following castration. Second generation LNAI cells, designated T1.8, T1.16, T2.9, T2.10, and T2.11, were established from individual xenograft tumors of LNAI.T1 and LNAI.T2, respectively, growing in castrated mice. To evaluate tumor formation and growth in the presence or absence of circulating androgens, these secondary LNAI cell lines were also then injected into intact and castrated male nude mice. Tumor volumes were calculated by the equation A2 × B × 0.4, where A is the smallest tumor diameter, B is the largest tumor diameter, and 0.4 is a correction factor (29Attia M.A. Weiss D.W. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 1787-1800PubMed Google Scholar). Protein extracts were isolated as described (30Graff J.R. Boghaert E.R. De Benedetti A. Tudor D.L. Zimmer C.C. Chan S.K. Zimmer S.G. Int. J.

For Western blots, 20–30 μg of protein extract/lane (as indicated in the individual figure legends) was electrophoresed, transferred to polyvinylidene membranes (Hybond-PTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the XCell IITM Mini-Cell apparatus (Novex, San Diego, CA), and immunoblotted with the following antibodies: AKT (1:500), phospho-AKTSer-473 (1:500 dilution) (New England Biolabs); BAD (1:500), p27Kip1 (1:1000) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); integrin-linked kinase (1:2000) and phospho-BADSer-136 (1:250) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); PSA (1:500) (M212091, Fitzgerald, Concord, MA); and β-actin (1:2000) (Sigma). Anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-sheep IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. All Western blots were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce) captured with the Lumi-imagerTM and, where indicated, quantitated with the Lumi-analystTM software (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitation/kinase assays were performed with the AKT activity kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs) using 200 μg of cell extract. RNA was isolated as described (31Graff J.R. De Benedetti A. Olson J.W. Tamez P. Casero Jr., R.A. Zimmer S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

RT-PCR analyses with these RNAs were performed with the Titan™ single-step RT-PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the specific primer sequences and conditions described for AKT-1, AKT-2, and AKT-3 (32Nakatani K.

Restriction digestion withHaeIII or NotI (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed to verify RT-PCR product identity. HaeIII specifically cuts AKT-1, -2, and -3 PCR products, whereasNotI cuts only the AKT-1 RT-PCR product. LNCaP cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the empty vector pCDNA3.1 (CLONTECH) or with pCDNA3.1 carrying the cDNA for the activated mutant of human AKT-1T308D/S473D. LNCaP cells were selected in culture media supplemented with 190 units/ml hygromycin (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA). The majority of androgen-independent hPCa express both the androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (33Craft N. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998–99; 17: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The most widely available and commonly used androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and Du145, lack expression of both AR and PSA (34Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and therefore may not reflect the majority of advanced, androgen-independent hPCa. To better model androgen-independent prostate cancer, we developed a panel of cell lines from the AR+, PSA+, androgen-dependent/sensitive hPCa cell line, LNCaP, following in vivo selection for xenograft tumor growth persisting after castration. These cell lines, designated LNAI cells, readily formed tumors both in intact, testosterone-supplemented male nude mice and in castrated male nude mice (TableI), indicating that these cell lines are androgen-independent. Notably, the second-generation LNAI cells, T1.8, T1.16, T2.11, formed tumors more rapidly in both intact and castrated hosts than the first-generation LNAI cells, LNAI.T1 and LNAI.T2. All of these LNAI cells expressed PSA (Fig.2) and AR (data not shown). PSA was also evident in the serum from LNAI xenograft-bearing intact and castrated mice (data not shown). Therefore, we have successfully established androgen-independent hPCa cells that, like the majority of androgen-independent hPCa, retain expression of both AR and PSA and share the same genetic background as the androgen-dependent/sensitive hPCa cell line, LNCaP. As such, differences between LNAI and LNCaP cells can be related to androgen independence and tumor progression without being complicated by differing genetic backgrounds.Table ITumor formation: LNCaP versus LNAI cellsCell lineTumor incidenceLatency periodTime to 1300 mm3IntactCastrateIntactCastrateIntactCastratedaysdaysdaysLNCaP1-aThese data were pooled from two experiments.

Because AKT is a key regulator of many intracellular processes that have been implicated in prostate cancer progression and androgen independence (1Isaacs J.T. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 26: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), we examined AKT expression and activation in androgen-independent LNAI cells relative to androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Although AKT expression levels were unchanged (Fig.3 A), AKT activation (Ser-473 phosphorylation) was markedly increased in LNAI cells relative to LNCaP, particularly in the more aggressively growing second-generation LNAI cells, T1.8, T1.16, and T2.11, (Fig. 3 A) and in xenografts (data not shown). Phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-308, which is also required for activation, was not increased in LNAI cells (data not shown). Moreover, AKT activity was also increased in LNAI cells relative to LNCaP cells (Fig. 3 B). Together, these data indicate that AKT activation (Ser-473 phosphorylation) and activity are increased in androgen-independent LNAI cells, particularly the more aggressively growing, second-generation lines (T1.8, T1.16, and T2.11), relative to androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Three isoforms of human AKT have been isolated, AKT-1, AKT-2, and AKT-3 (25Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 35Nakatani K. Sakaue H. Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Expression of AKT-3 has been specifically associated with hormone-independent primary human breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. Likewise, the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and Du145 express AKT-3, whereas the androgen-dependent/sensitive LNCaP hPCa cell line expresses only AKT-1 and AKT-2, suggesting that androgen-independent hPCA progression may involve AKT-3 induction (32Nakatani K.

We therefore examined whether the increased AKT activity in LNAI cells might reflect AKT-3 expression. RT-PCR analyses with primers designed specifically for each AKT isoform (32Nakatani K. Thompson D.A. Barthel A. Sakaue H. Liu W. Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21528-21532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) revealed that, like LNCaP cells, LNAI cells express only AKT-1 and AKT-2 (Fig.4 A), suggesting that the evolution of androgen-independent hPCa cells does not necessarily involve up-regulated AKT-3 expression. To evaluate further whether AKT-3 expression is induced during hPCa development or progression, we analyzed primary human prostate cancers, prostate cancer metastases to bone and soft tissues, and normal prostate tissue for expression of AKT-1 and AKT-3 (Fig. 4, B and C). Our analyses reveal that, although not all tissues express AKT-3, the majority of both normal and tumor tissue shows AKT-3 expression, thereby indicating that AKT-3 expression is not induced in, or restricted to, malignancy. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been putatively identified as responsible for AKTSer-473 phosphorylation (27Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 28Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses revealed that ILK is overexpressed in LNAI cells and xenografts (Fig.5), particularly in the second-generation LNAI cells in which AKT activation was highest (e.g. T1.16, Fig. 5), suggesting that the enhanced AKTSer-473phosphorylation may be a downstream consequence of up-regulated ILK expression. Because AKT activity was increased in androgen-independent LNAI cells, we addressed the question of whether molecules downstream from AKT were differentially affected in LNAI cells compared with LNCaP. The pro-apoptotic protein BAD can be functionally inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-136 by AKT (17Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar, 36Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Xenograft tissue and cell culture extracts of LNAI showed increased phosphorylation of BAD at the AKT target site, Ser-136, relative to LNCaP cell and xenograft extracts (Fig.6). AKT has recently been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate the Forkhead/AFX family of transcription factors (19Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C.

Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11836-11841Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As AFX activates transcription of the cell cycle regulator p27Kip1(23Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), inhibition of AFX-mediated transcription by AKT may lead to decreased expression of p27Kip1. In LNAI cells, in which AKT is hyperactivated, the protein expression of p27Kip1was markedly reduced relative to that in LNCaP (Fig.7). This decrease was most pronounced in the most aggressively growing, second-generation LNAI cells with the highest AKT activity (e.g. T1.16). These data are consistent with the notion that AKT negatively regulates AFX-mediated transcription of p27Kip1 but do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms, such as decreased protein or RNA stability, may contribute to p27Kip1 loss. Together, these data indicate that the increased AKT activity in androgen-independent LNAI cells profoundly effects key downstream mediators involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic signaling. Our data indicate that AKT activity is markedly enhanced in androgen-independent LNAI cells compared with androgen-dependent/sensitive LNCaP and suggest that increased AKT activity may be intimately involved in the progression of hPCa and the emergence of androgen-independent hPCa cells. To determine directly how AKT may impact upon hPCa progression, we established stable overexpressors of the constitutively active AKT-1T308D/S473D mutant in LNCaP cells (LNCaP:AKTDD cells) (Fig. 8,inset). Subcutaneous injection of these LNCaP:AKTDD cells into intact, testosterone-supplemented male nude mice yielded rapidly growing tumors with 100% incidence (4/4) in less than 30 days post-injection, whereas vector control cells formed tumors in only three of five mice that were not evident until day 37 post-injection (Fig. 8). Moreover, the LNCaP:AKTDDcells showed a dramatic increase in tumor growth (Fig. 8), with a mean tumor volume more than 6-fold that of the vector control transfectants at all time points (by Dunnett's test on ranked tumor volumes,p < 0.05 for all time points). Like the aggressively growing LNAI cells, LNCaP:AKTDD tumor cells showed a substantial decrease in p27Kip1 expression (Fig. 8,inset). Tumors did not form in castrated mice following injection with either LNCaP:AKTDD or vector control LNCaP cells. A second, independent experiment confirmed that LNCaP:AKTDD cells formed more rapidly growing tumors in intact male nude mice when compared with vector control LNCaP cells but were unable to form tumors in castrated male nude mice (data not shown). Therefore, although insufficient to elicit growth in castrated male nude mice, overexpression of the constitutively active AKTDD dramatically enhanced LNCaP xenograft tumor growth in intact male nude mice and resulted in markedly reduced expression of p27Kip1. We have developed a series of androgen-independent hPCa cell lines (LNAI cells) from the androgen-dependent/sensitive hPCA cell line, LNCaP. Like the majority of androgen-independent hPCa (34Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), these LNAI cells retain expression of AR and PSA. We have now shown that AKT activation (Ser-473 phosphorylation) and activity are increased in these LNAI cells when compared with androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and may be a consequence of increased expression of the integrin-linked kinase, the kinase putatively responsible for AKTSer-473 phosphorylation (27Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar,28Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Like parental LNCaP cells, LNAI cells express only AKT-1 and AKT-2, indicating that AKT-3 expression is not necessary for androgen independence, as has been suggested in studies with the androgen-independent PC-3 and Du145 hPCa cells (32Nakatani K.

Moreover, our data reveal that AKT-3 is expressed not only in prostate cancer tissues but also in normal prostate tissue, indicating that AKT-3 expression is not induced in, or restricted to, prostate malignancy. We have also shown that the increased AKT activity in these LNAI cells corresponds to increased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein, BAD, and markedly decreased expression of the p27Kip1 cell cycle regulator, consistent with the notion that AKT inhibits AFX-mediated transcriptional activation of p27Kip1 (23Medema R.H.

Taken together, these data imply increased AKT activity in hPCa progression and the emergence of androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells. To address whether AKT alone can drive prostate tumor progression and/or the emergence of androgen-independent cells, we established LNCaP cells with stable overexpression of a constitutively active AKT-1 cDNA. Though alone insufficient to elicit xenograft tumor growth in castrated mice, overexpression of activated AKT dramatically increased tumor growth in intact mice relative to vector control transfectants. Like the most aggressively growing LNAI cells (e.g. T1.16), these LNCaP:AKTDD cells also showed a remarkable reduction in p27Kip1 expression, suggesting that p27Kip1loss, which has been repeatedly linked to hPCa progression (4Agus D.B.

Taken together with the analyses of LNAI cells, these data reveal that increased AKT activity contributes to hPCa progression by dramatically accelerating prostate tumor growth, perhaps in relation to decreasing p27Kip1expression, and is specifically associated with the more advanced, aggressively growing androgen-independent hPCa cells (e.g. T1.16). Increased AKT activity may play a profound role in the progression of human prostate cancers. AKT regulates many of the processes associated with metastatic progression and the emergence of androgen-independent hPCa cells, such as a diminished apoptotic response (1Isaacs J.T. Urol. Clin.

AKT can dampen the normal apoptotic response by suppressing the activity of numerous pro-apoptotic proteins including BAD, caspase 9, and the Forkhead family of transcription factors (Refs. 17Datta S.R.

AKT can also facilitate the release of cells from cell cycle control by inhibiting AFX/Forkhead-mediated transcription of the key cell cycle regulator, p27Kip1 (23Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Further, by activating FRAP/mTOR and de-repressing translation initiation, AKT may specifically enhance the translation of cyclin D1 (24Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E.

The most aggressively growing, androgen-independent LNAI cells had the greatest increase in AKT activity. Moreover, overexpression of an activated AKT-1 mutant dramatically accelerated LNCaP xenograft tumor growth. However, our data also reveal that overexpression of an activated AKT-1 was alone insufficient to drive xenograft tumor growth in castrated mice, suggesting that factors in addition to increased AKT activity must contribute to the ability of LNAI cells to form and grow tumors in the absence of circulating androgens. For instance, the increased expression of ILK in LNAI cells may influence alternate pathways in addition to the AKT pathway, such as the Wnt pathway (27Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), that may contribute to the androgen-independent phenotype. Moreover, other intracellular pathways may be activated in LNAI cells independent of, or upstream from, AKT that contribute to the androgen-independent phenotype of LNAI cells. Indeed, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, perhaps as a downstream consequence of HER2 activation, has been implicated in hPCa progression and androgen independence (44Gioeli D. Mandell J.W. Petroni G.R. Frierson Jr., H.F. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar, 45Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat.

In summary, the data presented in this report indicate that increased AKT activity, perhaps as a consequence of increased ILK expression, is involved in hPCa progression and suggest that the reduction in p27Kip1 expression, which has been repeatedly associated with hPCa progression and androgen independence (4Agus D.B.

Together with previously published reports that PTEN is inactivated in a significant proportion of advanced primary human prostate cancers (10Ittmann M.M. Oncol. Rep. 1998; 5: 1329-1335PubMed Google Scholar) and that AKT regulates many of the intracellular processes associated with hPCa progression (1Isaacs J.T. Urol. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W1994189187,"A long-standing discrepancy between experimental and theoretical values for the lifetimes of holes in the surface-state electron bands on noble metal surfaces is resolved; previous determinations of both are found to have been in error. The ability of the scanning tunneling microscope to verify surface quality before taking spectroscopic measurements is used to remove the effects of defect scattering on experimental lifetimes, found to have been a significant contribution to prior determinations. A theoretical treatment of inelastic electron-electron scattering is developed that explicitly includes intraband transitions within the surface state band. In our model, two-dimensional decay channels dominate the electron-electron interactions that contribute to the hole decay and are screened by the electron states of the underlying three-dimensional electron system."
https://openalex.org/W2136385901,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandins (PG), plays a key role in inflammation, tumorigenesis, development, and circulatory homeostasis. The PGD2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) was identified as a potent natural ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). PPARγ expressed in macrophages has been postulated as a negative regulator of inflammation and a positive regulator of differentiation into foam cell associated with atherogenesis. Here, we show that 15d-PGJ2 suppresses the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of COX-2 in the macrophage-like differentiated U937 cells but not in vascular endothelial cells. PPARγ mRNA abundantly expressed in the U937 cells, not in the endothelial cells, is down-regulated by LPS. In contrast, LPS up-regulates mRNA for the glucocorticoid receptor which ligand anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone (DEX) strongly suppresses the LPS-induced expression of COX-2, although both 15d-PGJ2 and DEX suppressed COX-2 promoter activity by interfering with the NF-κB signaling pathway. Transfection of a PPARγ expression vector into the endothelial cells acquires this suppressive regulation ofCOX-2 gene by 15d-PGJ2 but not by DEX. A selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, inhibits production of PGD2 in the U937 cells. Taking these findings together, we propose that expression of COX-2 is regulated by a negative feedback loop mediated through PPARγ, which makes possible a dynamic production of PG, especially in macrophages, and may be attributed to various expression patterns and physiological functions of COX-2.

Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This cell type-specific regulation may be physiologically important because thromboxane A2 produced by macrophages (18Bienkowski M.J. Petro M.A. Robinson L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6536-6541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has the opposite effect of prostacyclin (PGI2), produced by vascular endothelial cells. We have recently reported that this different effect of DEX is partly explained by differing expression levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (16Inoue H. Umesono K. Nishimori T. Hirata Y. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of PGI2 and thromboxane A2synthases are inversely regulated in resident and activated peritoneal macrophages (19Kuwamoto S. Inoue H. Tone Y. Izumi Y. Tanabe T. FEBS lett. 1997; 409: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), where production of PGD2 and PGE2 is also inversely regulated (20Fournier T. Fadok V. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31065-31072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which suggests complex regulation of COX-2 expression as well as its physiological roles at different activated stages of macrophages. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors that includes the estrogen receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, and GRs (21Mangelsdorf D.J.

The PGD2metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 PGJ2(15d-PGJ2) was identified as a potent natural ligand for the PPARγ (22Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Recently, induction of COX-2 by 15d-PGJ2 was reported in immortalized epithelial and colorectal cancer cells (28Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Ther. 1999; 288: 1235-1241PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that underlie different regulation of COX-2 expression remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the different effect of 15d-PGJ2 on expression of the COX-2 gene between macrophage-like differentiated U937 cells and BAEC. We provide evidence that a unique expression pattern of PPARγ is involved in this different effect. Especially in U937 cells, LPS down-regulates PPARγ mRNA but up-regulates GR mRNA, although both 15d-PGJ2 and DEX suppressed COX-2 expression by interfering with the NF-κB signaling pathway. With additional evidence, we propose that the expression of COX-2 will be found to be regulated by a negative feedback loop mediated through PPARγ. This makes possible a dynamic production of PG especially in macrophages. U937 cells (10Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and BAEC (11Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol.

For differentiation into monocytes/macrophages, U937 cells were treated with 100 nm TPA and allowed to adhere for 48 h, after which they were fed with TPA-free medium and cultured for 24 h prior to use. TPA-differentiated U937 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were cultivated on 12-well tissue culture plates with 1 ml of the culture medium. After a further 24-h of incubation, the relevant reagents were added to the medium. After 12 h of incubation, the culture medium was removed and subjected to enzyme immunoassays for PGE2 and PGD2 (Cayman). PGD2 was measured as its methyl oxime after derivatization with methoxamine. Total RNA was isolated using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate procedure. RNAs were then subjected to electrophoresis. The cDNA probes used were the 1.5-kilobase pair insert of pHEPSII17 for COX-2 (31Kosaka T. Miyate A. Ihara H. Hara S. Sugimoto T. Takeda O. Takahashi E. Tanabe T. Eur. J.

The levels of mRNA were calculated on the basis of hybridization signals as measured by an image analyzer, BAS 5000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) as described previously (16Inoue H. Umesono K. Nishimori T. Hirata Y. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The primer pair for PPARγ amplification, designed to anneal to both human (33Greene M.E. Blumberg B.

The cycling conditions were as follows: 3 min at 96 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s; 57 °C, 2 s; and 74 °C, 30 s. The primer pair for human PGD2 synthase (35Kanaoka Y Ago H. Inagaki E.

The cycling conditions were as follows: 3 min at 96 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s; 58 °C, 2 s; and 74 °C, 15 s. Cell lysates (105 cell equivalents) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were probed with the human COX-2 antisera (IBL, Gunma, Japan) and visualized using the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. U937 cells stably transfected with a COX-2 (nucleotide −327/+59) luciferase reporter containing NF-κB site alone and pCB6 containing a neomycin-resistant gene were made by electroporation as described previously (13Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). BAEC was transfected using Trans IT™-LT-1 (Mirus) (16Inoue H. Umesono K. Nishimori T. Hirata Y. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 0.2 μg of COX-2 reporter vector phPES2(−327/+59) (10Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), 2.0 μg of pRShGRα, or pCMX-hPPARγ1, and 0.02 μg of pSV-βgal (Promega) were used for transfection of each 24-well plate. pCMX-hPPARγ1 was the human PPARγ1 expression vector under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter made by Dr. S. Osada (Kyoto University). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined; luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase standard in BAEC (11Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), whereas it was normalized with the protein concentration in the U937 cells (13Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on the expression of COX-2 gene, we performed Northern blot analysis using RNA derived from the differentiated U937 cells. LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B) and production of PGE2 (Fig. 1 C) were suppressed by 15d-PGJ2 in the U937 cells. The suppressive effect of 15d-PGJ2 was dose-dependent (Fig.1 A) and milder than that of DEX, i.e. 10 μm 15d-PGJ2 showed 50–60% suppression (Figs. 1 B and 2), whereas 100 nm DEX showed more than 70% (13Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of COX-2 protein (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, in BAEC, 15d-PGJ2 showed no effect on LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2). Similar results were also obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown).Figure 2Different effects of 15d-PGJ2 between differentiated U937 cells and BAEC. Macrophage-like differentiated U937 cells and BAEC were treated with LPS for 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm15d-PGJ2. Isolated total RNA (10 μg) was examined by Northern blot analysis for expression of COX-2 mRNA. The relative amount of COX-2 mRNA was measured by an image analyzer after normalization with that of GAPDH, and LPS-induced amount of COX-2 mRNA was indicated as 100% because expression of COX-2 mRNA was very low in both cells without the LPS treatment. The results represent the mean ± standard deviations of three separate dishes. The GAPDH expression level in the U937 cells is higher than that in BAEC, although ethidium bromide staining intensities of 28 S RNA were equal between them, as measured by an image analyzer FLA2000. Similar result was also obtained using a bovine COX-2 cDNA probe instead of the human probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) DEX-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression is modulated by GR, which will explain the distinct effect of DEX on COX-2 expression between macrophages and endothelial cells (16Inoue H. Umesono K. Nishimori T. Hirata Y. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, we examined whether expression of PPARγ accounts for the different effects of 15d-PGJ2. Expression of PPARγ mRNA was observed in the differentiated U937 cells (33Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in monocytes and macrophages (27Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar), and that expression was down-regulated by the treatment of LPS in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3 A and 3C). This down-regulation was not observed by the treatment of 15d-PGJ2 alone (data not shown). In contrast, no PPARγ mRNA was detected in BAEC (Fig. 3, A and B) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, although PPARδ mRNA was constitutively expressed in both cells as well as in U937 cells (data not shown). In aortic smooth muscle cells (36Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.-C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), the PPARα activators inhibit the inflammatory response. However, in the U937 cells as well as in activated macrophages (24Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3266) Google Scholar), no expression of PPARα was observed by Northern blot analysis; a selective PPARα activator, Wy-14643 (100 μm), showed no effect on COX-2 mRNA expression in the U937 cells (data not shown). As described previously, the suppressive effect of 15d-PGJ2 on COX-2 expression was milder than that of DEX in the U937 cells. To address this question, we examined the expression levels of GR after various treatments (Fig. 4). LPS increased GR mRNA about 2-fold, which shows an inverse expression pattern between GR and PPARγ. Moreover, DEX partly restored the suppressive expression of PPARγ by LPS. This inverse expression pattern between GR and PPARγ is explained in part by the milder suppressive effect of 15d-PGJ2 than of DEX, suggesting that different roles of GR and PPARγ on COX-2 expression. Next, we examined the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the COX-2 promoter activity. The human COX-2 promoter region (−327/+59) contains the NF-κB and NF-IL6 sites and CRE (31Kosaka T. Miyate A. Ihara H. Hara S. Sugimoto T. Takeda O. Takahashi E. Tanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In the differentiated U937 cells expressing GR and PPARγ, the NF-κB site is involved in both LPS-induced expression of the COX-2 gene and its suppression by DEX (13Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, 15d-PGJ2 suppressed COX-2 transcription mediated through the NF-κB site in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). On the other hand, in BAEC expressing no detectable levels of GR (16Inoue H. Umesono K. Nishimori T. Hirata Y. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and PPARγ (Fig. 3, A andB), C/EBPδ (also known as NF-IL6β) activates COX-2 transcription mainly through CRE, whereas the NF-κB and NF-IL6 sites also contribute to the COX-2 expression (11Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assay using the COX-2 promoter (−327/+59) showed that 15d-PGJ2 did not suppress the COX-2 promoter activity in BAEC (Fig. 6), which is consistent with no suppression of COX-2 mRNA by 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 2). However, by coexpression of PPARγ, BAEC acquired the suppressive regulation of COX-2 gene by 15d-PGJ2 but not by DEX, whereas by coexpression of GR (16Inoue H. Umesono K. Nishimori T. Hirata Y. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), BAEC acquired a more suppressive regulation by DEX than by 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 6), indicating the involvement of PPARγ in regulation of COX-2 expression by 15d-PGJ2.Figure 6BAEC transfected with a PPARγ expression vector acquire the ability to suppress COX-2 transcription after treatment with 15d-PGJ2but not with DEX. BAEC were transfected with a COX-2 reporter vector, phPES2(−327/+59) along with either human PPARγ expression vector (pCMX-hPPARγ1) or human GR expression vector (pRShGRα) and with pSV-βgal as an internal control for the transfection. 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 5 h with no stimulant or with 1 μg/ml LPS in the presence or absence of 10 μm15d-PGJ2 or 100 nm DEX. Values represent the means ± standard deviations of three separate wells. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the presence of albumin or serum, PGD2 is metabolized to PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2, natural ligands for PPARγ (22Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 23Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar), and these PGD2 metabolites actively transport to cellular nuclei (37Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that COX-2 expression is self-regulated by PGD2metabolites, which are produced in a COX-2 dependent manner. To examine this possibility, we investigated whether U937 cells produce PGD2 in a COX-2 dependent manner. An enzyme immunoassay showed that U937 cells produced PGD2, and a COX-2 selective inhibitor, NS398, suppressed this production (Fig. 7). Moreover, PGD2synthase mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the U937 cells (data not shown). These results are also consistent with previous reports in bone marrow-derived macrophages (20Fournier T. Fadok V. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31065-31072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and specialized antigen-presenting cells (38Urade Y. Ujihara M. Horiguchi Y. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2982-2989PubMed Google Scholar). The present study has shown that 15d-PGJ2suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA in macrophage-like differentiated U937 cells but not in vascular endothelial cells. This difference comes from different expression patterns of PPARγ, i.e. a much higher level of expression in the U937 cells (Fig. 3) and acquisition of 15d-PGJ2 sensitivity upon COX-2 expression by coexpression of PPARγ into BAEC (Fig. 6). Moreover, LPS down-regulates PPARγ mRNA but up-regulates GR mRNA, although PPARγ and GR suppressed COX-2 promoter activity by interfering with the NF-κB signaling pathway (13Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). On the other hand, U937 cells as well as macrophages (20Fournier T. Fadok V. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31065-31072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) produces PGD2 in a COX-2-dependent manner, and PGD2 is spontaneously converted to PGJ2 derivatives by non-enzymatic dehydration (37Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that PGD2 metabolites such as 15d-PGJ2 work as intracellular signaling mediators, which retain the low expression level of COX-2 by a negative feedback loop meditated through PPARγ in macrophages (Fig. 8). After treatment with LPS, up-regulation of COX-2 was coincident with down-regulation of PPARγ (Fig. 3), which canceled the negative feedback loop. Simultaneously, a rapid increase of PGE2(Fig. 1) was observed, and cAMP enhanced the COX-2 transcription by LPS in the U937 cells (13Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), suggesting that COX-2 expression is enhanced by a positive feedback loop (20Fournier T. Fadok V. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31065-31072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) mediated through PG receptors. In fact, the existence of PGE receptor subtypes EP2 and EP4, increasing the intracellular cAMP level, were reported in murine macrophage-like cell line J774.1 (39Katsuyama M. Ikegami R. Karahashi H. Amano F. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This positive feedback loop can be suppressed by DEX because LPS up-regulates GR mRNA and will increase the sensitivity to DEX (Fig. 4). Moreover, the possibility that COX-2 has anti-inflammatory properties at the later phase of carrageenin-induced pleurisy was recently reported (40Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Chivers W.J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), which is also explained by the negative feedback regulation of COX-2 by PPARγ. PPARγ is activated by a range of synthetic and naturally occurring substances, including antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, polyunsaturated fatty acids, PGD2 metabolites, components of oxidized low density lipoprotein, and 12/15-lipoxygenase products (41Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Among these ligands, rosiglitazone (BRL49653), the most potent synthetic ligand for PPARγ, did not suppress LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA in U937 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, despite the stronger binding activity of rosiglitazone in vitro, several reports emphasize the higher biological activity of 15d-PGJ2 compared with rosiglitazone (42Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this context, 15d-PGJ2, but not PPARγ agonists such as troglitazone, was recently reported to be a direct inhibitor of IκB kinase, which is responsible for NF-κB activation (43Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), suggesting that some biological effects of 15d-PGJ2 are independent of PPARγ. On the other hand, a somatic PPARγ mutation, R288H, showed a normal response to synthetic ligands but greatly decreased response to natural ligand 15d-PGJ2 (44Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), implying that there are different responses of PPARγ between different ligands. Moreover, the fact that subtype U937 cells express no detectable level of PPARγ indicates a significant amount of COX-2 mRNA in the inactivated stage but no induction of COX-2 mRNA by LPS, 2H. Inoue, T. Tanabe, and K. Umesono, manuscript in preparation. suggesting the involvement of PPARγ in COX-2 expression. Further studies are necessary to elucidate these different effects between 15d-PGJ2 and synthetic PPARγ ligands. TPA-differentiated U937 cells would be assumed to be responsive macrophages because of similar expression patterns of COX-2 and thromboxane A2 synthase mRNAs in casein-elicited peritoneal macrophage (19Kuwamoto S. Inoue H. Tone Y. Izumi Y. Tanabe T. FEBS lett. 1997; 409: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, expression of PPARγ but not PPARα is observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells; this is different than the report that PPARγ is induced upon differentiation into macrophages, whereas PPARα is already present in undifferentiated monocytes (45Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be attributed to heterogeneity of macrophages (19Kuwamoto S. Inoue H. Tone Y. Izumi Y. Tanabe T. FEBS lett. 1997; 409: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression is regulated not only in a cell type-specific but also a species-specific manner. In fact, the delayed induction of COX-2 by gonadotropin was reported in bovine granulosa cells but not in rat cells; however, the induction was observed in both species (46Liu J. Antaya M. Boerboom D. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Sirois J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35037-35045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The similarity of nucleotide sequences of the COX-2 promoter region between bovine and human was higher than between bovine and rat genes, although cis-acting elements for NF-κB, NF-IL6 sites, and CRE are conserved among human, bovine, rat, and mouse COX-2 promoter regions. No suppression of 15d-PGJ2 on the LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and no detectable level of PPARγ mRNA were observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells or in BAEC. Therefore, there is not as much difference in the regulation of COX-2 expression at least between human and bovine endothelial cells. PPARγ and GR mRNAs are inversely regulated by LPS in U937 cells (Fig. 4), although both 15d-PGJ2 and DEX suppressed COX-2 promoter activity by interfering with the NF-κB signaling pathway (Fig. 5). Ligands for PPARs and DEX are reported to enhance COX-2 expression in some carcinoma cells (28Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Chinery R. Coffey R.J. Graves-Deal R. Kirkland S.C. Sanchez S.C. Zackert W.E. Oates J.A. Morrow J.D.

These different effects on COX-2 expression may be explained by differently regulated levels of expression of PPARs, steroid hormone receptors, and CAAT enhancer-binding proteins. In this context, estrogen-induced production of a PPAR ligand was reported in a PPARγ-expressing tissue in which induced conversion of PGD2 to a metabolite was observed (48Ma H. Sprecher H.W. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30131-30138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a precise transcriptional network among these transcription factors is important for adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine each relationship between COX-2 and the transcriptional network in physiological and pathophysiological functions.

Describing the change in energy of the cesium antibonding state with a simple classical model provides information on the mechanical forces acting on cesium atoms that are “turned on” by photoexcitation.

Cellular components of this signaling pathway characterized to date are cell surface receptors for reelin like apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and cadherin-related neuronal receptors, and intracellular components like Disabled-1 and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn, which bind to the intracellular domains of the ApoER2 and VLDL receptor or of cadherin-related neuronal receptors, respectively.

The most recently discovered members of the receptor family are mammalian ApoER2 and its avian homologue LR7/8B (4Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol.

Their common structure resembles that of the LDLR and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), but multiple alternative splicing events result in a complex array of receptor proteins (6Kim D.-H.

ApoER2 may contain a 59-amino acid insertion in its cytoplasmic domain, which is encoded by an extra exon that is differentially spliced in distinct variants of the receptor. The insertion is proline-rich and contains two potential SH3 binding sites (8Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The prevalent site of expression of ApoER2 and LR7/8B is the brain, particularly neurons and cells that are components of brain barrier systems, such as the epithelia of the choroid plexus and of the arachnoidea, as well as endothelial cells of blood vessels (9Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Hüttinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol.

Recently, the finding that cytosolic adaptor proteins like Dab1 and Fe65 bind to the intracellular receptor domains, in particular to the NPXY motif of LDLR and the LDLR-related protein (11Trommsdorff M. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 12Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A.

Signal transduction should be considered to be another part of the functional spectrum that some or all of these receptors might participate in (13Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Herz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E157-E162Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). First proof for this hypothesis was generated by the results of targeted disruption of both the VLDLR and the ApoER2 in mice (14Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). This genetic approach has identified both receptors as components of a signaling pathway that relays the reelin signal into migrating neurons. In addition, binding experiments showed that reelin interacts with the extracellular domains of both VLDLR and ApoER2 (15Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 16D'Arcangelo G. Homayoundi R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T.

Reelin is secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells in the outermost layer of the developing cerebral cortex and orchestrates the migration of neurons along radial fibers, thus forming distinct cortical layers in the cerebrum (for review see Ref. 17Curran T. D'Arcangelo G. Brain. Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms are used to establish the characteristic neuronal arrangement in the hippocampus as well as the correct positioning of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. A naturally occurring genetic defect in reelin creates the phenotype of the reeler mouse, which is characterized by an inversion of the cortical layers and absence of cerebellar foliation with an abnormal distribution of the Purkinje cells. Naturally occurring disruption or targeted deletion of the DAB1 gene produces phenotypes indistinguishable from that of thereeler mouse, suggesting that Dab1 is another component in the reelin signaling pathway (18Sheldon M.

Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In addition, a family of cadherin-related cell surface proteins termed the cadherin-related neuronal receptor (CNR) family have been identified to bind reelin (20Senzaki K. Ogawa M. Yagi T. Cell. 1999; 99: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These proteins associate with Fyn, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase of the Src kinase family (21Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), which in turn interacts with Dab1 (22Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that reelin acts by direct binding to VLDLR and/or ApoER2 and to CNRs, thereby leading to phosphorylation of Dab1, which is associated with the tails of the LDLR relatives. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 may then start kinase cascade(s) controlling cellular motility and shape by acting on the neuronal cytoskeleton (14Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T.

Cell. 1999; 99: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, other experimental evidence suggests that the Reelin/Dab1 signaling pathway might not be the only signaling event involving members of the LDLR family. Apolipoprotein E, a universal ligand for these receptors, exerts an antithrombotic activity by inhibiting platelet aggregation through the l-arginine:nitric oxide pathway (23Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), supposedly mediated by ApoER2 (24Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K.

Furthermore, the stimulation of androgen synthesis in rat ovarian theca cells by apoE also seems to be mediated by members of the LDLR family (26Zerbinatti C.V. Dyer C.A. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A key feature of development of atherosclerosis is the activation of endothelial cells (27Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9959) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating to indicate that activation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 via the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway plays a pivotal role in endothelial cell activation by cytokines, hypoxia, shear stress, and most interestingly, by LDL (28Zhu Y.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The JNK-signaling pathway is involved in a variety of processes including cellular responses to environmental stress, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and morphogenesis (for review see Ref. 31Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Recently it became evident that this pathway plays an important role in regulating region-specific apoptosis of neurons during early brain development (32Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 33Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current study was to search for proteins interacting with the proline-rich insertion in the cytoplasmic tail of ApoER2 and to examine if this region is involved in signaling pathways. Here we demonstrate that this domain interacts with the JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-1 and JIP-2, both members of the JIP group of mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffolding proteins (34Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that the occurrence of the proline-rich domain-containing splice variant of ApoER2 and the expression of JIP-2 coincide during differentiation of neurons. The results demonstrate a molecular link between ApoER2 and the JNK signaling pathway. The cDNA coding for the 59-amino acid insertion of the murine ApoER2 tail was generated using the following primers: sense, 5′-GGA ATT CGC AAT CAG CAA CTA TGA TCG C and antisense, 5′-TTG GAT CCT TAC TTG CAC TTG ACG ACA GGC. The PCR product was cloned via internal EcoRI restriction sites of the primers into pLexA. Fidelity of the construct was confirmed by sequencing, and the construct was subsequently used as a bait for screening a mouse brain MatchmakerR LexA Yeast Two Hybrid library (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Putative positive colonies were streaked out to create master plates, and the corresponding plasmid insertions were selectively amplified by colony PCR using vector-specific primers and were directly sequenced. The full-length cDNA of murine JIP-2 was cloned by two consecutive rounds of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. Using primer a (5′-ACTGGCCTCGCAGCTGCTGTCC, annealing temperature, 58 °C), a 1678-base pair fragment was obtained. Then, using primer b (5′-GTCGTCCGTGATCTCAGACAGG, annealing temperature, 58 °C), another 81 base pairs of the 5′-sequence were obtained. The ATG assigned to represent the start codon for the mouse JIP-2 cDNA is located within a sequence consistent with the consensus sequence of translational start sites (35Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the published sequence of human JIP-2 (34Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). An IB1 (JIP1-b) cDNA was obtained from Dr. G. Waeber, Lausanne, France. IB1 and JIP-2 were tagged at the 5′-end with a 9xmyc epitope and cloned into pCIneo (Promega). The partial cDNA clone obtained by Yeast Two Hybrid screening (corresponding to amino acids 607–830, Fig.3 B) was tagged at the 5′-end with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and cloned into pCIneo. GST fusion proteins of the respective domains of the ApoER2 tail (Fig. 1) were prepared as described (9Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Hüttinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H.

GST-Dab1 is described in Ref. 14Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R. Richardson J.A. Herz J.

The cDNA constructs corresponding to the SH3 (270 base pairs) and the PID (430 base pairs) domains of JIP-2 were amplified via PCR from the full-length JIP-2 cDNA using the following primers: SH3 sense, 5′-GAATTCAATGTCAACAGCACGTCTCGATCC; SH3 antisense, 5′-CCAGCAGGTCCTTGGCAGGACC (annealing temperature 60 °C); PID sense, 5′-GAATTCAAGGTGGATCGCTTCGATGTGC, PID antisense, 5′-GTAGATATCCTCTGTAGGGCAGGC (annealing temperature 60 °C). The PCR fragments were subcloned into a T/A cloning vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen), then cut out via EcoRI sites present in the primers, and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo, which contained a 9xmyc-tag 5′ of the insertion. Fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing.Figure 1Structural organization of murine ApoER2 and of respective constructs used in the two hybrid screen and subsequent pull-down assays. a, cartoon of full-length ApoER2 emphasizing relevant structural features of the receptor.

After UV cross-linking, hybridization was performed using the partial JIP-2 cDNA originally found in the Yeast Two Hybrid screen. Methylene Blue staining was used as quality and loading control. The antibody against mouse ApoER2 was produced against the complete intracellular domain expressed as a GST fusion protein as described previously (9Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S.

Anti-JIP-2 was produced against a synthetic peptide (see Fig. 3 A) corresponding to the cloned mouse JIP-2 cDNA as described (4Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were obtained commercially from the sources indicated: antimitogen-activated protein 2 (Sigma), anti-HA tag (16B12, Babco), anti-Myc (9E10, used as hybridoma supernatant from the corresponding cells, ATCC), Oregon Green 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), Alexa 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), and goat anti-rabbit-biotinylated IgG (Sigma). 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 584 mg/liter glutamine and transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cellular extracts for Western blots and precipitation experiments were prepared by lysing the cells in HUNT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice and centrifugation to remove insoluble material. For pull-down experiments, 30 μl of cell extract were diluted with 150 μl of HUNT buffer. After the addition of ∼10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose with bound fusion protein, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with 200 μl of HUNT buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads for 3 min at 95 °C under reducing conditions in SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (36Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H. Meilinger M.

Mice were euthanized with CO2 and perfused via the left ventricle with 25 ml of PBS, followed by 25 ml of a solution containing 75 mml-lysine, 75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 2.4 mg/ml sodium meta-periodate. The brain, testis, and epididymus were then removed and stored in the fixation solution for 4 h at 4 °C. Embedding and specimen preparation was done as described (9Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Hüttinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32213-32221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Incubation with the primary antibodies (dilutions: anti-JIP-2, 1:500; anti-ApoER2, 1:100) was performed at 4 °C for 20 h in blocking solution. After five washes in PBS, the following incubations were performed at 23 °C: goat anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG diluted 1:500 in blocking solution for 1 h, five washes with PBS, peroxidase-labeled avidin (Sigma) for 1 h diluted 1:200 in 1% nonfat dry milk in PBS, and a final wash with PBS (five times). For the color reaction, slices were incubated in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.1, containing 150 μl of 30% peroxide and 20 mg of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, per 100 ml of buffer. The staining process was followed under the microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 135) and stopped by immersing the slides in water. Nuclei were counterstained with Harris-modified hematoxylin solution (Sigma). Neuronal stem cell culture and differentiation into neurons was performed according to Ref. 37Johe K.K. Hazel T.G. Muller T. Dugich-Djordjevic M.M. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3129-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar. Embryos 15–17 days old were removed and put into PBS plus chlortetracycline (Life Technologies, Inc.). Embryo heads were opened sagittally under sterile conditions, and the brains were removed with forceps and transferred into HBSS (Life Technologies, Inc.). After three washes with HBSS, brains were triturated in Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min, and the cells were suspended in prewarmed culture medium (Dulbecco's Nut Mix F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.)), grown on 10-cm cell culture dish coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Stem cells were grown in the presence of 10 ng/ml human recombinant bovine fibroblast growth factor (Sigma). Growth factor was added every day, and the medium was changed every second day. To start differentiation into neurons, in addition to 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 10 ng/ml recombinant platelet-derived growth factor-BB (Sigma) was added to the medium. Two days later only platelet-derived growth factor-BB was added daily. At 50% confluency, cells were split by rinsing once with PBS and incubating with 1 ml of Trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 10–20 min at 37 °C until cells detached. Trypsinization was stopped by the addition of medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml chicken egg white trypsin-inhibitor (Sigma). Poly(A)+ RNA from stem cells and differentiated neurons was prepared from five 10-cm cell culture dishes each using the Micro FastTrackTM 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). The resulting mRNA pellet was directly used for cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers and SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The following primers were used: ApoER2, sense, 5′-CAGTGGCTGTCCCTCACTCGG and antisense, 5′-GAAGATGATGGACTGCCCTG (annealing temperature, 62 °C); IB1 (JIP-1b), sense, 5′-ATGTCTTCATGAGTGGCCG and antisense, 5′-GCTGTGTCCTTGAGATCAGTG (annealing temperature, 56 °C); JIP-2, sense, 5′-ACCTTGAGATCTCTCTGCGG and antisense, 5′-GGATATCTACCTGGAGTAAGC (annealing temperature, 60 °C). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose. 293 cells were grown on culture slides (Becton Dickinson) coated with poly-d-lysine to a confluency of 50–70%. Mouse brain cells were transferred to coated 8-well slides 2–6 days prior to the staining. Slides were coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) and fibronectin (Sigma). After washing twice with PBS, cells were fixed with a mixture of equal amounts of methanol and acetone at −20 °C for 4 min (293 cells) or at −20 °C for 30–60 min (mouse brain cells). Fixed cells were rehydrated for 15 min at room temperature with PBS, incubated with the primary antibody in blocking solution (1% nonfat dry milk in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with blocking solution, and incubated at room temperature with the secondary antibody (Alexa 594 1:500 or Oregon Green 488 1:500, Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After two washes with blocking solution and two final washes with PBS, microscopy was performed. The intracellular domain of ApoER2 is highly homologous to that of LDLR and VLDLR and binds the intracellular adaptor protein disabled via its conserved NPXY motif (11Trommsdorff M. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, because of the differential splicing of an additional exon in the ApoER2 gene, a region coding for a 59-amino acid insertion is present in the cytoplasmic tail of a significant fraction of the receptor population (7Brandes C. Novak S. Stockinger W. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Genomics. 1997; 42: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1 a, this proline-rich domain is inserted 10 amino acids before the carboxyl terminus of the protein. To identify proteins interacting with this specific domain of ApoER2, we used the yeast two-hybrid method based upon the LexA system (38Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A Matchmaker LexA mouse brain cDNA library was screened using the 59-amino acid insert as bait (Fig.1 b). Out of 108 transformants screened, four clones scored positive for an interaction of the receptor insert with products of transcripts encoded by the library. Two of these clones represented sequences interrupted by stop codons in all reading frames; the remaining two clones were identical and homologous to human JIP-1 and JIP-2 (34Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between ApoER2 and the candidate protein at the biochemical level, we performed “pull-down” experiments by incubation of extracts prepared from 293 cells expressing the HA-tagged protein with bacterially expressed fusion proteins between GST and various receptor tail constructs as shown in Fig. 1, c–e. Protein complexes were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, eluted, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Fig.2, lanes 2–4). The same antibody was used to demonstrate the expression of the tagged cDNA product in transfected 293 cells by direct Western blotting of the respective cell extracts (Fig. 2, lane 1). Clearly, the HA-tagged product of the candidate clone interacted with the GST fusion proteins that contained either the proline-rich insert alone (“i,”lane 2) or the full-length tail (“ti,” lane 3) of the receptor. Importantly, the interaction is specific for the insert, because the tail without insert (“t,” lane 4) did not interact with the HA-tagged protein. The specificity for the insert is also documented by the fact that the tagged protein does not bind to the cytosolic tail of the VLDLR (data not shown). To further verify this result, we used an HA-tagged fragment of Dab1, which previously had been shown to bind to the ApoER2 tail independently of the proline-rich insert (14Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), in a similar experiment. Indeed, Dab1 binds to both the short and long cytosolic domains but not to the proline-rich insert itself (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). In contrast to the novel protein identified by the screen, it was previously shown that Dab1 binds to the VLDLR tail, too (14Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1968189883,"The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase family 4, subfamily D, isoform 3 (PDE4D3) is shown to have FQF and KIM docking sites for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) (p42MAPK). These straddle the target residue, Ser579, for ERK2 phosphorylation of PDE4D3. Mutation of either or both of these docking sites prevented ERK2 from being co-immunoprecipitated with PDE4D3, ablated the ability of epidermal growth factor to inhibit PDE4D3 through ERK2 action in transfected COS cells, and attenuated the ability of ERK2 to phosphorylate PDE4D3in vitro. The two conserved NH2-terminal blocks of sequence, called upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2), that characterize PDE4 long isoforms, are proposed to amplify the small, inherent inhibitory effect that ERK2 phosphorylation exerts on the PDE4D catalytic unit. In contrast to this, the lone intact UCR2 region found in PDE4D1 directs COOH-terminal ERK2 phosphorylation to cause the activation of this short isoform. From the analysis of PDE4D3 truncates, it is suggested that UCR1 and UCR2 provide a regulatory signal integration module that serves to orchestrate the functional consequences of ERK2 phosphorylation. The PDE4D gene thus encodes a series of isoenzymes that are either inhibited or activated by ERK2 phosphorylation and thereby offers the potential for ERK2 activation either to increase or decrease cAMP levels in cellular compartments.

These enzymes appear to be of particular regulatory significance in immune/inflammatory cells, and in the central nervous system, as PDE4-selective inhibitors, they serve as potent anti-inflammatory agents and exhibit anti-depressant properties (6.Houslay M.D. Sullivan M.

Each of the four PDE4 genes encodes multiple isoforms that are generated by alternate mRNA splicing or the use of alternative promoters. Each of the various isoenzymes encoded by a single PDE4 gene falls into two categories (6.Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), namely “long” PDE4 isoenzymes that exhibit both UCR1 and UCR2 and “short” isoenzymes that lack UCR1 and have either an intact or NH2-terminally truncated form of UCR2. The functional role of UCR1 and UCR2 and the functional consequences of generating short and long isoenzymes remain to be defined. Nevertheless, it has been shown (13.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14.Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I.R. McCallum J.F. Engels P. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that the long PDE4D3 isoenzyme can be activated through the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue (Ser54) at the start of UCR1. PDE4D3 can also be regulated through inhibitory phosphorylation by the p42MAPK, ERK2 (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), that occurs at a single residue (Ser579) located within the PDE4D3 catalytic unit. These regulatory phosphorylation events appear to be intertwined as ERK2 inhibition of PDE4D3 was ablated by subsequent PKA-mediated phosphorylation (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This provides a potential feedback regulatory system whereby the ERK2-mediated inhibition of PDE4D3 allows cAMP levels to rise, triggering the subsequent PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PDE4D3 (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this regard, PDE4D3 provides a point of cross-talk that links ERK2 activation to the regulation of cAMP signaling. The corollary of this is the ability of PKA to attenuate ERK2 activation through the inhibitory phosphorylation of c-Raf (16.Cook S.J. McCormick F.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These straddle Ser579, the residue that provides the target for ERK2 phosphorylation in PDE4D3. These docking sites allow PDE4D3 to be co-immunoprecipitated with ERK2 and are essential for ERK2 to regulate the activity of PDE4D3 in intact cells. In addition, we show here, through analysis of PDE4D long and short isoenzymes as well as truncated species, that UCR1 and UCR2 play a key role in defining the functional response of PDE4D isoenzymes to ERK2 phosphorylation. A monoclonal antibody to human PDE4D proteins, which does not cross-react with other PDE4 species and which we have described previously (28.Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was a gift from Sharon Wolda (ICOS Corp., Seattle, WA). This antibody was generated against the extreme COOH-terminal 65 amino acids of the PDE4D3 protein that are found in common in all known PDE4D isoforms. This antibody can detect PDE4D3 isoforms truncated at the amino terminus, such as those lacking UCR1 and UCR2. It will detect all known PDE4D isoforms, since their COOH termini are identical (28.Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We also employed polyclonal antibodies specific for PDE4D (28.Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody to the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) epitope was obtained from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody specific for ERK2 and described previously by us (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Harnett (University of Glasgow, United Kingdom). The construction of the VSV epitope-tagged PDE4D3 and the various S579A and S579D mutants of PDE4D3 has been described in detail previously by us (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The various other mutations described in this study were done on this construct using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Various pieces of the PDE4D3 cDNA were cloned into the NotI site of the vector pcDNA3 (InVitrogen). In these constructs, the insert was placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus intermediate early gene promoter. pcDNAFN43VSVF encodes amino acids 16–673 of PDE4D3, which encompasses UCR1, UCR2, and the catalytic region, yielding the construct (UCR1+UCR2+CAT)4D. pcDNAFN43N2VSVF encodes amino acids 134–673 of PDE4D3, which encompasses both UCR2 and the catalytic region, yielding the construct (UCR2+CAT)4D. pcDNAFN43N3VSVF encodes amino acids 225–673 of PDE4D3, which encompasses the catalytic region only, yielding the construct (CAT)4D. In all cases, a sequence corresponding to the VSV glycoprotein epitope was added immediately downstream from the last native codon of the PDE to encode a carboxyl-terminal fusion (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The native PDE4D stop codon was removed in this process, but a synthetic stop codon was placed immediately downstream from the epitope sequence (Fig.1). All polymerase chain reactions were performed in a volume of 25–50 μl containing 200 μm dNTP, 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide, 50–100 ng of DNA template, and 0.2–1 units of Taq-DNA-polymerase. All polymerase chain reaction-generated or mutagenized constructs were verified by sequencing before use. Sequencing was performed on an automated sequencing machine (ABI model 373 or 377; Perkin-Elmer) with reactions containing 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 pmol of appropriate sequencing oligonucleotide (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction; Perkin-Elmer). Cell culture and transfection were performed using the COS1 SV40-transformed monkey kidney cell line maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air in complete growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml), glutamine (2 mm), and 10% fetal calf serum. Details have been described before by us (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, however, COS1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran. The DNA to be transfected (5 μg) was mixed and incubated for 15 min with 250 μl of 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma) in PBS to give a DNA-dextran mix. When cells reached 70% confluency in 100-mm dishes, medium was removed, and the cells were given 10 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mm chloroquine and the DNA-dextran mix (250 μl). The cells were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After this period, the medium was removed, and the cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO in PBS. After PBS washing, the cells were returned to normal growth medium and left for a further 2 days before use. For determination of PDE activity, the cells were homogenized in PDE assay buffer, and only when performing immunoprecipitation analyses were the cells scraped and lysed in buffer. This was performed as described in detail previously by us (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of the PDE4D species and ERK2 was performed as described before by us using ∼20 μg of protein samples with detection using an anti-VSV mAb, either mAbs or polyclonal antibodies specific for PDE4D enzymes, and an ERK2-specific mAb (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 28.Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The quantification of immunoreactive protein was verified by three different procedures as described before by us (29.Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For two of these, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run with a range of different protein amounts/lane and then subjected to immunoblotting. For routine analysis, immunodetection of the protein was performed by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The films were scanned, and optical densities were plotted against sample protein content. Reference lanes were run with various amounts of PDE4D species to calibrate the linear portion of the range. As a confirmation, immunodetection was also performed using a 125I-labeled secondary antibody. Cell lysates from COS1 cells were prepared as described previously (30.MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Peden A.H. Bolger G.B. Vernon R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3549-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For harvesting, the cells were first washed in PBS before being scraped into lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, with added protease inhibitors) and mixed at 4 °C for 20 min. This was cleared by centrifugation before further procedures were carried out. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates (150 μg of protein) were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. This was removed by centrifugation and the PDE immunoprecipitated by incubation with the indicated specific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then coupled to 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose with incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed with lysis buffer and, finally, PDE assay buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.6, with protease inhibitors). Lysates of U937 human monocytic cells were similarly subjected to immunoprecipitation. PDE activity was determined by a modification of the two-step procedure of Thompson and Appleman (31.Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as described previously by us (32.Marchmont R.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All assays were conducted at 30 °C with initial rates taken from linear time courses. Activity was linear with added protein concentration. Transfection of COS1 cells led to the novel PDE4 activity comprising >97% of the total cell activity. Mock transfections (vector only) did not alter the endogenous COS cell PDE activity. As a routine, we subtracted the residual endogenous COS1 cell PDE activities found in parallel experiments from those activities found in the PDE4D transfected cells. Untransfected and mock (vector only) transfected COS1 cells exhibited a PDE activity of 10 ± 5 pmol/min/mg protein. This was done as described previously (14.Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I.R. McCallum J.F. Engels P. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). PDE4 from 5 × 105transfected COS1 cells was immunoprecipitated as a complex with protein G-Sepharose. This was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 volume of phosphorylation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (100 MBq/mmol). The reaction was started by the introduction of either 0.5 or 1 unit of activated recombinant ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) and allowed to continue for a period of either 5 or 30 min at 30 °C as stated above. The Sepharose was washed four times with 1 ml of PDE buffer and resuspended in PDE buffer for analysis. This was performed as described earlier by us (33.Heyworth C.M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (34.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 222: 680-682Crossref Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) that ERK2 phosphorylated the long PDE4D3 isoenzyme at a single site, Ser579, that is located within the PDE4D catalytic unit. This caused the inhibition of PDE4D3. Such phosphorylation was demonstrated (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) both in vitro, using recombinant activated ERK2, as well as in intact COS1 cells that had been challenged with EGF in order to activate endogenous ERK2. Based upon studies done on various ERK2-phosphorylated transcription factors, it has recently been suggested that authentic ERK2 substrates contain docking sites for this kinase (21.Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 22.Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Such sites have been envisaged as providing a modular system that allows for enhanced ERK2 binding and thus fidelity of ERK2 phosphorylation and action in vivo (24.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 27.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Two such sites have been recognized to date. One of these is the FQF motif (27.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) that is located some 5–30 residues carboxyl-terminal to the ERK2 phosphorylation site. The other is the KIM motif that has been found approximately 120–150 residues NH2-terminal to the ERK2 phosphorylation site of various transcription factors (21.Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 22.Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, a number of transcription factors, such as Elk-1 and members of its subfamily, that provide well recognized ERK substrates exhibit both of these docking sites (27.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H.

The PDE4 enzymes all have an FQF motif located some 14–18 residues COOH-terminal to this serine. This begins at Phe-597 in PDE4D3. Shown for comparison is the equivalent FQF motif found in the transcription factor hElk1 (GenBank™ accession no. M25269). The KIM docking site is located 120–150 residues NH2-terminal to the ERK target Ser/Thr residue.

We note here that the PDE4D3 catalytic unit contains (Table I) a putative ERK2 docking site in the form of an FQF motif that is located some 15 amino acids COOH-terminal to Ser579, the target for ERK2 phosphorylation (15.Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition to this, the sequence VetKKvtssgLlL, found some 122 residues amino-terminal to Ser579 in PDE4D3, provides a potential ERK2 docking site of the KIM form (Capital letters indicate concensus residues, Table I). The work of various investigators indicates that the core of the KIM form of ERK docking site contains a leucine residue located some 3–6 residues to the COOH-terminal side of a cluster of basic residues (23.Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,27.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K.

https://openalex.org/W2003826460,"Stereodynamic complexes of copper were found to undergo inversion of a helical chiral element upon oxidation or reduction. The amino acid methionine was derivatized by the attachment of two chromophores to the nitrogen atom. The resultant ligands formed stable complexes with Cu I and Cu II salts. For a derivative of a given absolute chirality, the complexes afford nearly mirror image circular dichroism spectra. The spectral changes originate from reorientation of the nitrogen-attached chromophores due to a conformation interconversion driven by the exchange of a carboxylate for a sulfide ligand. The electrically induced chirality inversion coupled with strong interactions with polarized light is unique and may lead to novel chiral molecular devices."

To facilitate investigation of mechanisms controlling NE assembly, we developed a cell-free system made from Xenopus laevis eggs to study the process in the absence of chromatin. NEs incorporating nuclear pores were assembled around beads coated with the guanosine triphosphatase Ran, forming pseudo-nuclei that actively imported nuclear proteins. NE assembly required the cycling of guanine nucleotides on Ran and was promoted by RCC1, a nucleotide exchange factor recruited to beads by Ran-guanosine diphosphate (Ran-GDP). Thus, concentration of Ran-GDP followed by generation of Ran-GTP is sufficient to induce NE assembly."

All members of the ADAMTS family consist of an N-terminal propeptide domain, a metalloproteinase domain, and a disintegrin-like domain, resembling the structural elements of the reprolysin family of metalloproteases that includes the adisintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) and snake venom metalloproteases (8Rawlings N.D.

Unlike typical ADAM proteins that are membrane-anchored and have a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain in the C-terminal region, the C terminus of ADAMTS proteins contains a varying number of thrombospondin type-1 (TSP-1) motifs, the sequence of which is the conserved motif in thrombospondin 1 and 2 (10Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Aggrecan is a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that accounts for about 10% of the dry weight of cartilage (11Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. Dudhia J. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyton J.G.

It consists of three globular domains: G1, through which it interacts with hyaluronan (HA); G2; and G3 at the C terminus of the molecule. The core protein between G2 and G3 is highly substituted with the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) keratin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. Aggrecan is usually found as part of a large aggregate with HA containing approximately 100 proteoglycan molecules/HA molecule. The molecule carries a large number of fixed negatively charged groups on the GAGs that results in high osmotic pressure in the tissue, thus allowing aggrecan to swell and hydrate the framework of collagen fibrils in cartilage, providing the tissue its properties of compressibility and resilience. The interglobular domain of aggrecan between the G1 and G2 domain has been shown to be susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. In fact, aggrecanase activity was originally defined by cleavage at the Glu373/Ala374 bond within this region of the aggrecan core protein (13Flannery C.R. Lark M.W. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1008-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that recombinant aggrecanase-1 degrades cartilage aggrecan very efficiently and cleaves sequentially at five sites within the molecule (14Tortorella M.D. Burn T.

Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), suggesting that aggrecanase-1 and aggrecanase-2 may be important in the destruction of cartilage aggrecan in arthritic diseases. Aggrecanase-1, like all of the ADAMTS proteins, contains a TSP-1 motif with sequences similar to segments in thrombospondin 1 and 2 that have been implicated in binding (Fig. 1). The sequence W(S/G)XW has been implicated in the interaction of thrombospondin with the sulfated GAG chains of heparin, heparin sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate (26Guo N.-H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E.

Bruno-Bossio G. Voland C. Lecerf J. Lawler J. Delmas P. Silverstein R. Clezardin P. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1998; 16: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the TSP-1 motifs of murine ADAMTS-1 bind to heparin and the extracellular matrix (9Wolsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 340-389Google Scholar, 29Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This opens the possibility that this region in aggrecanase-1 may serve to bind the enzyme to the glycosaminoglycans of the aggrecan molecule. We recently demonstrated that deglycosylation of aggrecan decreases the ability of aggrecanase activity in culture media to generate aggrecan fragments formed by cleavage at the Glu373/Ala374 bond (30Pratta M.A. Arner E.S. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1997; 22: 453Google Scholar),3 which is consistent with this hypothesis. Therefore, the goal of the studies reported herein was to determine whether aggrecanase-1 recognizes aggrecan through binding of the TSP-1 motif to the aggrecan glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate, and whether binding of the enzyme to these glycosaminoglycans is important for cleavage of the core protein. The full-length form of the enzyme, beginning with residue Met1 and ending with residue Lys837, and a truncated form of the enzyme, beginning with residue Met1, ending with residue Pro431, and lacking the disintegrin and TSP motif, were expressed inDrosophila cells as described previously (1Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K. Hillman Jr., M.C. Hollis G.F. Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Both the full-length and truncated forms of aggrecanase-1 were purified from the fermentation medium as follows. Media were loaded onto a Macro S column (Bio-Rad) and aggrecanase-1 protein eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in 50 mm Hepes buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl at pH 7.5. The majority of the aggrecanase-1 eluted with 0.6–0.7m NaCl. These fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Diaflo pressure concentrator fitted with a YM-30 membrane, and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min, and pooled fractions containing the aggrecanase-1 were concentrated for further evaluation. Proteolytic activity of truncated aggrecanase-1 was confirmed by demonstrating that it binds to α2-macroglobulin as evaluated by the inability of the bound material to enter an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Since the binding of a proteinase and α2-macroglobulin is initiated by proteolysis of the “bait” region of the α2-macroglobulin, which in turn triggers large conformational changes and entraps the proteinase (31Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), binding confirms the activity of the aggrecanase-1. In addition, both the full-length and truncated aggrecanase-1 cleaved a peptide substrate containing the aggrecanase-sensitive cleavage site, NITEGE-ARGS. 4M. D. Tortorella, R.-Q. Liu, and E. C. Arner, unpublished data. Full-length ADAMTS-1 was expressed in the same Drosophila system as aggrecanase-1. The activity of the protein was confirmed by showing it binds to α2-macroglobulin. Overlapping peptides to the TSP motif were synthesized at Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). These peptides included GGWGPWGPWGD, GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG, SRTCGGGVQFSSRDCTRPV, SSRDCTRPVPRNGGKYCEGRR, and GGKYCEGRRTRFRSCNTEDCP. The monoclonal antibody, MAB2035, which recognizes chondroitin sulfate stubs on the core protein of aggrecan following deglycosylation, was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Neoepitope antibodies were used to detect fragments generated by aggrecanase-mediated cleavage at sites shown in Fig.2. The monoclonal antibody, BC-3 (32Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which recognizes the N terminus, ARGS, of aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at Glu373/Ala374, was licensed from Dr. Bruce Caterson (University of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom). Polyclonal neoepitope antibodies to the peptide sequences ATTAGELE and PTTFKEEE, which are present on the C terminus of aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu1480/Gly1481bond and at the Glu1667/Gly1668 bond, respectively, were prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals. Specificity of these antibodies was determined in competitive ELISA using synthetic peptide antigens as inhibitors. Intact, undigested aggrecan was not detected with any of the antibodies, and competition experiments confirmed that peptides spanning the cleavage sites did not block antibody binding to aggrecanase-1-digested aggrecan fragments, while peptides containing the external neoepitope sequences did block binding of the antibodies to aggrecan fragments. Nasal septa were removed from bovine noses obtained fresh from slaughter. The cartilage was sliced, and aggrecan was extracted by stirring at 4 °C for 48 h in 10 volumes of 4 m guanidine-HCl in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitors, 0.01 mEDTA, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 2 mmphenymethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 m benzamidine HCl. Aggrecan monomers were isolated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride (33Hascall V.C. Sajdera S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2384-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the bottom of this gradient (d > 1.54 g/ml) containing the monomers was dialyzed at 4 °C against water, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans were removed from bovine aggrecan monomers using chondroitinase ABC, keratanase, and keratanase II (Seikagaku, Cape Cod, MA). 0.1 units of chondroitinase ABC, keratanase, and 0.01 units of keratanase II per 10 μg of aggrecan was allowed to incubate for 4 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris/HCl with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. Digestions were carried out in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. Purified bovine aggrecan (500 nm) was incubated with recombinant human aggrecanase-1 (full-length or truncated) at 37 °C for the indicated times. To evaluate the ability of TSP peptides to block aggrecanase activity, the peptides at concentrations from 0.1 to 100 μm were incubated with 500 nm bovine aggrecan for 30 min at room temperature. Aggrecanase-1 was then added, and the reaction mixtures incubated for 5 h. The reactions were quenched with EDTA and analyzed by immunolocation with neoepitope antibodies. For analysis of fragments by Western blot, aggrecan was enzymatically deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/10 μg of aggrecan) for 1 h at 37 °C and then with keratanase (0.1 units/10 μg of aggrecan) and keratanase II (0.002 units/10 μg of aggrecan) for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mTris/HCl, pH 6.5. After digestion the aggrecan was precipitated with five volumes of acetone and reconstituted in 30 μl of Tris glycine-SDS. Twenty microgram of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) from each sample was loaded on a 4–12% Tris glycine gel and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunolocated with a 1:1000 dilution of one of the above neoepitope antibodies. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate for the neo-epitope antibodies. Neoepitope-reactive aggrecan cleavage products were visualized by developing the blots in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color developing reagent. Overnight transfer resulted in complete transfer of both low and high molecular fragments, and the densitometric response was found to be linear over the density ranges required for the blots. The neoepitope-reactive fragments were quantified by scanning densitometry. 500 nm aggrecan or GAG-free aggrecan was incubated with 1 nm recombinant aggrecanase-1, in the presence or absence of 100 μm TSP peptide, GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG, in Tris buffer for 30 min. Free aggrecanase-1 was separated from bound enzyme by passing the solution through 500- or 100-kDa size exclusion membrane filter units (Microcon-100, Millipore Corp., Beverly, MA). The filtrates were analyzed for unbound enzyme in an aggrecanase-1 ELISA. The K d of aggrecanase-1binding was estimated by incubating aggrecanase-1 (1 nm) for 30 min with aggrecan monomer (0.1–500 nm) and plotting percentage of bound aggrecanase-1 against aggrecan concentration. The IC50 for inhibition by the TSP peptide was estimated by incubating aggrecanase-1 (1 nm) for 15 min with the peptide (0.1–100 μm), followed by incubation with the aggrecan monomer (500 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C and plotting percentage of bound aggrecan versusthe concentration of peptide. The K i for the TSP peptide was calculated from the IC50 using the following equation. Ki=IC50/(1+[aggrecan concentration]/Kdof aggrecan­enzyme)Equation 1 A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the sequence VMAHVDPEEP within the catalytic domain of aggrecanase-1 was generated (1Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

The antibody recognizes both denatured and native enzyme and is used in a direct ELISA. The samples containing aggrecanase-1 were coated on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane plate (Millipore, Beverly, MA) and were incubated overnight. The plates were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. The aggrecanase-1 antibody was then added at a 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed three times using Tris-buffered saline and the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI), was added at a 1:5000 dilution and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed three times, developed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and read at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. Purified recombinant full-length active aggrecanase-1 was used to characterize the aggrecanase-1 ELISA, with linearity being maintained over 2 logs in a standard curve with aggrecanase-1 (TableI). The polyclonal antiserum was specific for aggrecanase-1 and did not recognize aggrecanase-2 or ADAMTS-1 (data not shown).Table IAggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) ELISA standard curveStandard (dilution)Absorbance at 405 nmNone (buffer blank)0.000ADAMTS-4 (undiluted)0.410ADAMTS-4 (1:2)0.198ADAMTS-4 (1:10)0.043ADAMTS-4 (1:20)0.020Purified recombinant full-length active aggrecanase-1 standard was coated on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane plate, incubated overnight and analyzed by ELISA using a polyclonal antiserum to the catalytic domain as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant full-length active aggrecanase-1 standard was coated on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane plate, incubated overnight and analyzed by ELISA using a polyclonal antiserum to the catalytic domain as described under “Materials and Methods.” Active recombinant human full-length aggrecanase-1 (Phe213–Lys837) was compared with active recombinant truncated (Phe213–Pro431) aggrecanase-1 for the ability to cleave bovine aggrecan at the Glu373/Ala374 site. The concentration of the full-length and truncated enzymes was determined by active site titration (34William J.W. Morrison J.F. Duggleby R.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) against a peptide substrate containing the TEGE-ARGS aggrecanase cleavage site using a tight-binding hydroxamate inhibitor, and equal amounts of the full-length and truncated form were incubated with native aggrecan for 5 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation, aggrecan cleavage products were detected by Western blot analysis using the MAB2035 antibody. The full-length form of the enzyme cleaved aggrecan resulting in disappearance of the intact aggrecan and the generation of lower molecular mass fragments (Fig.3). In contrast, the truncated form of the enzyme, which lacks the TSP-1 motif and disintegrin-like domain, did not result in a decrease in intact aggrecan or the generation of any detectable fragments. These data suggested that the C terminus of the aggrecanase-1 is important for cleavage of aggrecan. To examine whether the loss of activity by truncation was related to the removal of the TSP-1 motif from aggrecanase-1, overlapping peptides corresponding to various regions of the TSP-1 motif were tested for their ability to block cleavage of bovine aggrecan at the Glu373/Ala374 site (Fig.4). Full-length aggrecanase-1 was incubated with aggrecan in the presence or absence of the TSP-1 peptides, and cleavage of aggrecan at the Glu373/Ala374 site was monitored by Western analysis using the BC-3 antibody. Peptide 1, GGWGPWGPWGD, representing the N-terminal region of the TSP-1 motif containing the putative GAG binding motif, inhibited cleavage of aggrecan, with an IC50value of 17 μm. Peptide 2, GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG, containing both the GAG and CD36 binding motifs was the most potent in blocking cleavage of aggrecan, with an IC50 of 3 μm. Peptides 3 and 4, representing the middle sequences of the TSP motif, were relatively ineffective in blocking aggrecan cleavage with IC50 values of 70 and >100 μm, respectively. Finally, peptide 5, containing the C-terminal sequence of the TSP-1 motif, showed modest inhibition of aggrecan cleavage, with an IC50 of 38 μm. Peptide 2, which exhibited the greatest potency in blocking cleavage of aggrecan between residues Glu373 and Ala374, was then evaluated for the ability to block aggrecanase cleavage at the preferential sites within the C terminus of the molecule between residues Glu1667 and Gly1668 and between Glu1480 and Gly1481 (35Tortorella, M. D., Pratta, M. A., Liu, R.-Q., Austin, J., Ross, O. H., Abbaszade, I., Burn, T., Arner, E. C. (2000)J. Biol. Chem.275, in pressGoogle Scholar). Aggrecanase-1 was incubated with aggrecan in the presence or absence of 100 μm peptide, and the reaction mixture was analyzed for aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage between residues Glu1667/Gly1668, residues Glu1480/Gly1481, and residues Glu373/Ala374 using the anti-KEEE, anti-GELE, and anti-ARGS (BC-3) antibodies, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that this peptide blocked cleavage of aggrecan almost completely at all three sites (Fig. 5). This peptide was also tested for the ability to prevent aggrecanase-1 from binding to aggrecan. Aggrecanase-1 was incubated with native aggrecan or GAG-free aggrecan in the presence or absence of 100 μm TSP peptide 2. The free aggrecanase-1 was separated from bound enzyme by passing the reaction mixture through a 100-kDa size exclusion membrane filter. Native aggrecan and GAG-free aggrecan, both of which have a molecular mass of >350 kDa, are retained. In contrast, free aggrecanase-1 with a molecular mass of ∼62 kDa readily passes through the membrane, while aggrecanase-1 bound to aggrecan is retained. In order to determine the percentage of aggrecanase-1 bound, the filtrate was analyzed for aggrecanase-1 by ELISA. Aggrecanase-1 that incubated with native aggrecan was completely bound (TableII). In contrast, aggrecanase-1 that incubated with GAG-free aggrecan was <10% bound, and aggrecanase-1 that incubated with native aggrecan in the presence of TSP peptide was entirely unbound.Table IIThrombospondin motif peptide, GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG, blocks binding of aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) to aggrecanTreatmentAggrecanase-1 in filtrate2-aO.D. reading at 405 nm from aggrecanase-1 ELISA.Free2-bPercentages of free and bound aggrecanase-1 were calculated by comparing amount of aggrecanase-1 (O.D. from ELISA) in filtrate following incubation with aggrecan compared with amount present when incubated with buffer alone.Bound2-bPercentages of free and bound aggrecanase-1 were calculated by comparing amount of aggrecanase-1 (O.D. from ELISA) in filtrate following incubation with aggrecan compared with amount present when incubated with buffer alone.%%Buffer0.380Native aggrecan0.002199GAG-free aggrecan0.354937Native aggrecan + peptide0.37999<1Aggrecanase-1 (1 nM) was incubated with 500 nM deglycosylated aggrecan, native aggrecan or native aggrecan in the presence of 100 μM TSP peptide, GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG.

Following the incubation, free aggrecanase-1 was separated from bound protein using Micron 100 kDa size-exclusion filter units. The amount of aggrecanase-1 in the filtrate was monitored using an aggrecanase-1 ELISA. The K d for aggrecanase-1 binding to aggrecan was next determined. Aggrecanase-1 (1 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with bovine nasal aggrecan monomer (0.1–500 nm). Following the incubation, free aggrecanase-1 was separated from bound protein by filtration and the percentage of bound aggrecanase-1 was plotted against aggrecan concentration (Fig.6 A). From these data, the apparent K d was estimated to be 10.6 nm. The concentration-dependent inhibition of aggrecanase-1 binding to aggrecan by the TSP peptide 2 was next evaluated. Aggrecanase-1 was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with the peptide GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG, followed by addition of the aggrecan monomer (500 nm) and an additional 30-min incubation. Free aggrecanase-1 was separated from the bound protein by filtration, and the filtrates were analyzed for free aggrecanase-1 by ELISA. The percentage of free aggrecanase-1 was plotted against the concentration of the TSP peptide, and the IC50 was estimated to be 5 μm (Fig.6 B). Using this value and the determinedK d of aggrecan binding (10.6 nm), the apparent K i for the TSP peptide 2 was estimated to be 105 nm. Finally, we evaluated at the ability of aggrecanase-1 to cleave GAG-free aggrecan as compared with native aggrecan. Aggrecanase-1 was incubated with native or GAG-free aggrecan at 37 °C for 0–1 h, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed for aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage between residues Glu1667/Gly1668, residues Glu1480/Gly1481, and residues Glu373/Ala374, using the anti-KEEE, anti-GELE, and BC-3 antibodies, respectively. Aggrecanase-1 cleaved native aggrecan in a time-dependent manner between residues Glu1667 and Gly1668 to generate KEEE-reactive fragments (Fig. 7 A), between residues Glu1480 and Gly1481 to generate GELE-reactive fragments (Fig. 7 B), and between residues Glu373 and Ala374 to generate BC-3-reactive fragments (Fig. 7 C), but did not cleave the GAG-free aggrecan at any of these sites to generate immunoreactive fragments. Evaluation of these reaction mixtures for general cleavage by Western analysis using the MAB2035 antibody showed no decrease in intensity of the band representing intact aggrecan and no appearance of smaller molecular mass bands when GAG-free aggrecan was used as the substrate (Fig. 7 D). These data confirm lack of cleavage of GAG-free aggrecan at these sites and indicate that aggrecanase-1 also did not cleave GAG-free aggrecan at any other sites within the molecule over this time period. These studies clearly demonstrate that the TSP-1 motif located within the C terminus of aggrecanase-1 is important for aggrecan binding and cleavage. Furthermore, the data suggest that aggrecanase-1 binds aggrecan through interaction of its TSP-1 motif with the GAG side chains of aggrecan. Removal of the GAG from aggrecan results in the loss of aggrecanase-1 binding and cleavage, and both binding and cleavage of native aggrecan by aggrecanase-1 were blocked with peptides corresponding to regions of the TSP-1 motif. These data suggest that peptides representing specific sequences within the TSP motif may serve to inhibit aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation. The peptide GGWGPWGPWGD (peptide 1) from the aggrecanase-1 TSP-1 motif, corresponding to the sequence implicated in the interaction of thrombospondin with sulfated GAG chains, was effective in blocking cleavage of aggrecan with an IC50 of 17 μm. However, extension of the peptide to include the sequence CSRTCG representing the CD36 binding region in thrombospondin, resulted in a peptide (peptide 2) that was more potent in inhibiting aggrecan cleavage (IC50 = 3 μm). These data suggest that sequences corresponding to both the GAG-binding region and CD36 binding motif of thrombospondin may play a role in aggrecanase binding to and cleavage of aggrecan. Little inhibition was seen with peptides representing other regions of the TSP-1 motif, with the exception of the C-terminal region, GGKYCEGRRTRFSCNTEDCP, which inhibited cleavage with an IC50 of 38 μm. This sequence does not contain sequences corresponding to the GAG-binding regions of thrombospondin or to the CD36 binding motif. Therefore, the specific region in this peptide responsible for binding remains to be determined. Our demonstration that the binding of aggrecanase-1 to aggrecan is blocked by a TSP-1 peptide containing the GAG-binding region of this motif in thrombospondin suggests that binding involves the GAG of aggrecan. Additional evidence is provided by the data showing that aggrecanase-1 binds to native but not GAG-free aggrecan. Finally, the lack of cleavage of the GAG-free aggrecan substrate by aggrecanase-1 provides further support. A recent report showing inhibition of partially purified aggrecanase activity by chondroitin sulfate (36Sugimoto K. Takashashi M. Yamamoto Y. Shimada K. Tanzawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is also consistent with this hypothesis. Studies evaluating binding of aggrecanase-1 to aggrecan demonstrated that the IC50 of peptide 2 (5 μm) for inhibition of binding was similar to that for its inhibition of cleavage of aggrecan (3 μm), consistent with the hypothesis that binding of aggrecanase-1 to the GAG chains is important for cleavage of aggrecan. Although our experiments were not designed to directly measure TSP peptide binding to aggrecan, in many cases that K iis equivalent to K d. Based on the data generated, if we make this assumption, then the affinity of the TSP peptide to aggrecan (K i = 105 nm) is 1 log less than the affinity of aggrecanase-1 for aggrecan (K d= 10.6 nm). The most likely reasons for the apparent lower affinity of the peptide are as follows. 1) It is a linear peptide lacking a tertiary structure, which may be necessary for binding; or 2) there are other binding sites on aggrecanase-1, which add to the overall affinity of aggrecan binding, which the TSP peptide would not contain. The TSP peptide represents just a portion of the TSP motif. Therefore, it is possible that a peptide spanning the entire region may show a binding affinity comparable to aggrecanase-1 protein. The ability of the TSP-1 motif of aggrecanase-1 to inhibit aggrecan cleavage suggests that C-terminal fragments of the protein may have the ability to inhibit cleavage of aggrecan. Western analysis of cartilage explant culture media for aggrecanase-1 using an antibody that recognizes the catalytic domain of the enzyme, showed several bands with a lower molecular mass than the mature protein, 5M. D. Tortorella and E. C. Arner, unpublished data. indicating that a portion of the aggrecanase-1 protein had lost the C-terminal region representing the TSP motif. This opens the possibility that C-terminal cleavage of the aggrecanase protein may serve as a control mechanism to regulate aggrecan degradation by this enzyme. Loss of the C terminus would not only decrease the ability of the active enzyme to cleave the aggrecan substrate, but fragments containing the TSP-1 motif might also serve to inhibit aggrecan cleavage by the remaining full-length enzyme by competing with its binding to the GAG of aggrecan. The peptide GGWGPWGPWGDCSRTCGGG, containing both the putative GAG-binding sequence and CD36 binding sequence, was effective in blocking aggrecanase-1 activity. Therefore, theoretically any protein containing these sequences could potentially act as an endogenous inhibitor of aggrecanase. Human proteins found to have homologous sequences include thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-2, ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1), ADAMTS-5/11 (aggrecanase-2), ADAMTS-8, sco-spondin-mucin-like protein, properdin, and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2. Of these proteins, ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5/11, and thrombospondins-1 and -2 (1Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P.

ADAMTS-4 and -5/11 represent aggrecanase-1 and -2, respectively, and have both been shown to efficiently cleave cartilage aggrecan. In contrast, we have found that ADAMTS-1 is ineffective in cleaving aggrecan (data not shown). Therefore, since it contains a homologous peptide sequence, it may be capable of acting as an inhibitor of aggrecanase-1 and -2 by competing for binding sites on the aggrecan molecule. Thrombospondin-1 and -2 each contain three repeating TSP motifs with homologous sequences. Therefore, these thrombospondins, or thrombospondin fragments that contain any of the TSP type-1 motifs, may serve as endogenous inhibitors of aggrecanase. We have found relatively high levels of thrombospondin-1 in the cartilage extracellular matrix (approximately 0.1–1 μm), and thrombospondin-1 fragments in media from cartilage explants stimulated with cytokines. More importantly we have demonstrated that thrombospondin-1 blocks both aggrecanase-1 and -2 cleavage of aggrecan with an IC50 of approximately 300 nm (data not shown). Thus, it is interesting to speculate that thrombospondins may represent endogenous inhibitors of aggrecanase-1 and -2. We are currently exploring what role the thrombospondins may play in the regulation of aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan breakdown in models of cartilage degradation. The ability of thrombospondin-1 to suppress angiogenesis has been identified with two independent regions within the TSP type-1 motifs of the molecule: the tryptophan-rich W(S/G)XW motifs and the CD36 binding region. In addition, METH-1 and -2 (ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-8) have recently been shown to inhibit angiogenesis through their TSP-1 motifs (6Vazquez F. Hastings G. Oriega M.-A. Lane T.F. Oikemus S. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23349-23357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Since similar sequences are present in the TSP-1 motif of both aggrecanase-1 and -2, the C terminus of these enzymes may also have the capacity to inhibit angiogenesis. Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue, although the mechanism responsible for this property is still unclear. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that the aggrecanases may have an additional function in contributing to the suppression of vasularization of the cartilage matrix. The studies reported herein demonstrate an important role for the C terminus of aggrecanase-1 in the ability of this enzyme to bind to and cleave the aggrecan substrate. In addition, they suggest that this property is mediated through binding of particular regions of the TSP type-1 motif to the GAG side chains of aggrecan. Therefore, our data raise the possibility that the requirement of substrate binding through the C terminus of the enzyme may provide a potential control mechanism for regulation of aggrecan degradation by aggrecanase."

There are increasing efforts to characterize the activities of the enzymes that regulate the turnover of PP-InsP4, PP-InsP5, and [PP]2-InsP4. Several phosphatases (diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolases) that hydrolyze these compounds have been described (11Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A notable omission from our understanding of the intricacies of the turnover of higher inositol phosphates is any characterization of the enzyme(s) that phosphorylate Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to PP-InsP4. Thus, an important goal of this study was to identify this “missing link” in inositide research: the PP-InsP4 synthase. We now report that PP-InsP4in mammals is synthesized by the type 1 and type 2 forms of the InsP6 kinase. In addition, we show that these enzymes can further phosphorylate PP-InsP4, thereby forming a hitherto unknown inositol polyphosphate. We have further investigated the activity of the yeast enzyme in several ways. We have characterized its substrate specificity in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that disrupting the InsP6 kinase gene of S. cerevisiae(ip6kΔ) influences inositol polyphosphate levels in a unique fashion. We also show that ip6kΔ yeast cells have fragmented vacuoles. These data support an important role for diphosphoinositol polyphosphates in regulating intracellular trafficking. The various InsP6 kinases used in this study were incubated for various times at 37 °C in 25 or 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with KOH, 12 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mmEDTA, 0.02 mg/ml phosphocreatine kinase (Calbiochem 238395) and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The appropriate 3H-labeled inositol phosphate was added as indicated. Assays were quenched with ice-cold perchloric acid and neutralized as described previously (16Shears S.B. Shears S.B. Signalling by Inositides: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 33-52Google Scholar). Where specifically indicated, reactions were quenched by incubation for 3 min at 100 °C. Control experiments showed that all kinase activity was inactivated by this heat treatment, but none of the diphosphorylated inositol phosphates were degraded. The HPLC analysis of [3H]inositol-labeled yeast cells was performed as described previously (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Assays of the activities of recombinant enzymes employed HPLC using a Partisphere SAX column (Krackler Scientific, Durham, NC) that was eluted with a gradient generated by mixing Buffer A (1 mm Na2EDTA) and Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1.3 m(NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.85, with H3PO4) as follows: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–10 min, 0–45% B; 10–60 min, 45–100% B; 60–70 min, 100% B. 1-ml fractions were collected. In some experiments, particularly when a new HPLC column was installed, the percentage of B at 10 min was increased to 50%. This change in the gradient, plus the tendency of inositol phosphates to elute earlier as the column aged, means that slightly different elution properties are seen in the different figures shown in this study. Recombinant hDIPP2α was prepared as described previously (11Caffrey J.J. Safrany S.T. Yang X. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12730-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for mammalian InsP6 kinase types 1 and 2 were recovered from the pCMV-glutathione S-transferase vector used previously (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The type 1 kinase cDNA was amplified using the following primers: 5′-GCACTCGAGAATGTGTGTTTGTCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTAAGCTTAGGGCCTACTGGTTCTC-3′; the polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pTrcHisB expression vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA for the type 2 kinase was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CGACTCGAGGATGAGCCCAGCCTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCATTCGAAC TCACTCCCCACTCTCCTC-3; the polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the XhoI and BstBI restriction sites of pTrcHisB. The methods used to transform Escherichia coli (strain BL21), to induce with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and to isolate the poly(His)-tagged proteins using Talon resin (CLONTECH), were all according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The recombinant yeast InsP6 kinase was produced as described previously (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The YDR017C open reading frame in S. cerevisiae comprises thekcs1 gene that encodes the yeast InsP6 kinase. Using strain PJ69–2A of S. cerevisiae, the portion of thekcs1 gene that encodes the C terminus of the kcs1protein from amino acid 575 to the C-terminal stop codon was replaced by the dominant kanr marker gene using the KanMX4 expression construct as described previously (17Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for the gene disruption were: 5′-GAAGGAAAAGAAACTCTAATACGACTACAATGGGAAACCATAATGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′ and 5′-TAAGCGCAGCTAAAAGAATATTCATTAGTTCTATCCTTTCTTTTCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′. 10 μg of total RNA prepared from exponentially growing yeast was fractionated on a 1% agarose/MOPS-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was hybridized with a 1.2-kilobaseBamHI-NotI fragment corresponding to the 3′-region of the gene. This fragment was obtained by the digestion of the cDNA for the yeast InsP6 kinase (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Wild-type and ip6kΔ yeast were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (20 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 2% glucose). Yeasts from 5 ml of early logarithmic phase cultures (A 600 = 0.4–0.6) were collected and resuspended in 100 μl of medium containing 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 2% glucose, 10 μm carboxy-DCFDA. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Fluorescence (excitation = 504 nm, emission = 529 nm) was visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with 100× objective. Nonradioactive InsP6 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and the Alexis Corporation (San Diego, CA), respectively. Stock solutions were prepared in 1 mm EDTA. Carboxy-DCFDA was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). [3H]InsP6 was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and [3H]Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 were isolated from 5-day-old [3H]inositol-labeled chick erythrocytes (18Stephens L.R. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). [PP]2-[3H]InsP4 was obtained by phosphorylation of [3H]InsP6 using partly purified enzyme preparations from rat brain (19Safrany S.T.

PP-[3H]InsP5 and PP-[3H]InsP4 were prepared by phosphorylation of [3H]InsP6 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 respectively, using the type 1 InsP6 kinase (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was isolated from [14C]inositol-labeled, parotid acinar glands (20Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the radiolabeled inositol phosphates that we synthesized were purified by HPLC and desalted (7Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 were present in S. cerevisiae (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One goal of this study was to determine the importance of the yeast InsP6 kinase to the synthesis of the diphosphorylated inositol phosphates in vivo. The yeast InsP6 kinase protein is about three times larger in mass than either of the type 1 and type 2 forms of the mammalian InsP6 kinases (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The domain of the yeast InsP6 kinase that is homologous to the smaller, mammalian enzymes resides in a region close to the C terminus. The latter portion of the yeast protein was deleted by disrupting the appropriate 3′-region of the kinase gene (Fig. 1 and see “Experimental Procedures”). To confirm the correct integration of the marker gene, two diagnostic Southern blots were performed. Yeast genomic DNA was digested by SnaBI, and a band of approximately 5.5 kilobases was detected only in the gene-disrupted strain upon hybridization with the kanr gene (data not shown). Coincidentally, the kanrcassette used for the gene disruption is almost identical in size to the InsP6 kinase gene it replaces (Fig. 1). Thus, a band of approximately 5.5 kilobases was detected only in wild-type cells upon hybridization with a probe corresponding to the deleted region of the InsP6 kinase gene (data not shown). The success of the gene disruption was also verified by Northern analysis of wild-type and mutant yeast (Fig. 1). The gene-disrupted strain is hereafter designated ip6kΔ. We investigated the consequences of the gene disruption upon the inositol phosphate profile of wild-type and ip6kΔ cells. Levels of PP-InsP5 in ip6kΔ cells were >80% lower than those of wild-type cells (TableI). This result demonstrates that this kinase is quantitatively important for the expression of PP-InsP5 synthase activity in vivo. Nevertheless, our results indicate that there must be an alternative, hitherto unrecognized, pathway for PP-InsP5 synthesis in yeast. Levels of [PP]2-InsP4 were 60% lower in the ip6kΔ cells compared with the wild type (Table I). This result indicates that the InsP6 kinase plays only a partial role in the pathway of [PP]2-InsP4synthesis. Note also that the levels of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 in the ip6kΔ cells were 80% lower than those of wild-type cells (Table I). Thus, in yeast, there is an unexpected link between the metabolism of PP-InsP5 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5.Table IComparison of levels of higher inositol phosphates in wild-type and ip6kΔ strains of S. cerevisiaeInositol phosphateWT ([3H] dpm)ip6kΔ ([3H] dpm)ip6kΔ/WTIns(1,3,4,5,6)P53238 ± 1274718 ± 1620.22Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P510,624 ± 306610,287 ± 32490.97InsP6169,333 ± 18,883133,720 ± 24,9310.79PP-InsP5951 ± 120161 ± 300.17[PP]2-InsP41505 ± 199613 ± 920.41Levels of inositol phosphates were determined by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the means and S.E. from three experiments.

Open table in a new tab Levels of inositol phosphates were determined by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the means and S.E. from three experiments. Levels of the less phosphorylated inositol phosphates (InsPn, where n = 1–4) were similar in both wild-type (WT) and ip6kΔ cells. The ip6kΔ cells grew more slowly than the wild-type cells at 23 and 30 °C (Fig. 2). At 37 °C, the ip6kΔ cells did not grow at all (Fig. 2). Prior to the identification of the yeast InsP6 kinase (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the gene that encodes this protein was known as kcs1 (21Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that earlier study, the deletion of the kcs1/InsP6kinase gene from S. cerevisiae yielded no apparent growth phenotype (21Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because that strain of yeast had a different genetic background from the strain that we have used. We (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and others (22York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) have previously shown that drastic impairment of the pathway of InsP6 synthesis in S. cerevisiaeis accompanied by a decreased efficiency in the rate of export of mRNA from the nucleus. We (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) did point out, however, that mRNA export may be regulated by metabolites of InsP6(such as PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4) rather than by InsP6itself. Indeed, we previously showed that one particular gene-disrupted strain of yeast (ipmkΔ), which displayed an impaired mRNA export phenotype and decreased synthesis of InsP6, also had 60–80% lower levels of PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The ip6kΔ cells gave us the first opportunity to study whether mRNA export was affected by quantitatively similar changes in levels of PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4, under conditions where InsP6 levels were not significantly affected (Table I). We measured mRNA export as described previously (15Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but found no significant difference between wild-type andip6kΔ cells (data not shown). This negative result redirected our efforts to the hypothesis (see the Introduction) that diphosphoinositol polyphosphates regulate protein trafficking. In yeast cells, several different vesicle transport pathways converge upon the vacuole (23Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This organelle receives endocytic traffic from the cell surface as well as biosynthetic traffic from the Golgi apparatus (23Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 513-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the effect of the deletion of the InsP6kinase upon vacuole morphology. The luminal interior of yeast vacuoles was identified by incubating cells with membrane-permeable carboxy-DCFDA (25Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Once the probe has entered the vacuoles, the acetate groups are hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases, forming the less membrane permeable and fluorescent carboxy-DCF (25Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fluorescence detection of the vacuolar space in wild-type cells revealed the usual complement (26Srivastava A. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1998; 148: 85-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of one large vacuole (Fig.3). In contrast, the ip6kΔ strain contained several smaller, fragmented vacuoles (Fig. 3). This altered vacuolar morphology may reflect defects in the fusion into vacuoles of small vesicles derived from endocytosis or from the trans-Golgi network. The intensity of staining is also decreased in the null strain (Fig. 3), possibly because of less active intraluminal esterase activity in the ip6kΔ cells. Could the lower levels of [PP]2-InsP4 in the ip6kΔ yeast cells (Table I) reflect an unexpected ability of the yeast InsP6 kinase to phosphorylate PP-InsP5? To examine this question, we compared the rates of phosphorylation of both InsP6 and PP-InsP5 by the recombinant yeast InsP6 kinase. Trace amounts of [3H]InsP6 were almost completely phosphorylated to PP-[3H]InsP5 (Fig.4 A and Ref. 13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The yeast kinase was also separately incubated with PP-[3H]InsP5, but only approximately 5% of the substrate was converted to [PP]2-InsP4(Fig. 4 C), and in any case, even this slow reaction required 5-fold higher concentrations of enzyme than were used for the assays of InsP6 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, levels of InsP6 in S. cerevisiae are 180-fold higher than those of PP-InsP5 (Table I). These data indicate that the yeast InsP6 kinase does not provide an efficient route for [PP]2-InsP4 synthesisin vivo. We must therefore search for a separate yeast PP-InsP5 kinase with greater catalytic efficiency that can account for [PP]2-InsP4 synthesis in vivo. We also found that the yeast InsP6 kinase phosphorylated Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (Fig. 4 B). TheV max values for InsP5 and InsP6 were each approximately 2 μmol/mg/min. The affinity of the enzyme for InsP6 (mean K m = 3.3 μm) was about 3-fold less than the affinity for InsP5 (mean K m = 1.2 μm). This is the first time an enzyme with PP-InsP4 synthase activity has been identified. In the case of S. cerevisiae, cellular levels of InsP6 are 50-fold higher than those of InsP5 (Table I), so we would not anticipate substantial phosphorylation of InsP5 by this kinase in intact yeast cells. However, in mammalian cells, levels of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 are very similar to each other (27Shears S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We therefore next investigated whether either of the two mammalian InsP6 kinases (named types 1 and 2; see Ref.13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) could also phosphorylate Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5. The type 1 InsP6 kinase was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein and purified using Talon resin (Fig. 5). The enzyme was incubated with trace amounts of [3H]InsP6and an ATP regeneration system (see “Experimental Procedures”). The InsP6 was found to be completely phosphorylated to PP-[3H]InsP5 (Fig.6 A and Ref. 13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). No [PP]2-InsP4 was formed (data not shown and see Ref. 13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Several other inositol polyphosphates, namely inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, have also previously been found not to be significant substrates for this enzyme (13Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 was not previously tested as a substrate. We now studied this issue, in view of the observation that the yeast kinase phosphorylated both InsP6 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (Fig. 4).Figure 6Phosphorylation of [3H] InsP6 and [3H] InsP5 by the mammalian type 1 InsP6 kinase.

Because levels of both InsP6 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 in mammalian cells each range from 15 to 50 μm (27Shears S.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Protein splicing begins with an acyl rearrangement at the N-terminal junction whereby the conserved Ser or Cys attacks the carbonyl carbon of the preceding residue forming an ester or thioester intermediate (Fig.1 a). The conserved Cys/Ser/Thr residue at the C-terminal splicing site attacks the ester/thioester intermediate resulting in the formation of the branched intermediate. The next step couples the cyclization of a conserved Asn adjacent to the C-terminal splicing junction with the cleavage of the peptide bond to the branched ester (thioester) intermediate. The excised intein containing an aminosuccinimide residue at the C terminus and the ligated N- and C-terminal exteins are formed. Finally, a spontaneous O → N/S → N acyl rearrangement of the branched ester linkage completes the splicing event. Currently, over 100 protein splicing elements, inteins, have been deposited into the New England Biolabs Intein Data base (8.Perler F.B. Davis E.O. Dean G.E. Gimble F.S. Jack W.E. Neff N. Noren C.J. Thorner J. Belfort M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1125-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of the inteins can be divided into three conserved domains, N-terminal, C-terminal, and an optional endonuclease (9.Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is subdivided into four motifs, N1–N4. Likewise the C-terminal and endonuclease domains are divided into two and four motifs, C1 and C2 and EN1–EN4, respectively (Fig.1 b). The splicing motifs are located in blocks N1–N4, and C1 and C2 with strictly conserved residues (His79 and Asn454) residing in blocks N3 and C1, respectively. The penultimate histidine of PI-SceI is highly conserved (>90% of the inteins contain this amino acid) but is not essential for splicing of the PI-SceI intein (3.Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J.

Asn454 and Cys455, however, are absolutely necessary for protein splicing (3.Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler J.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 10.Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Crystal structures exist for two of these inteins, PI-SceI homing endonuclease (12.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and GyrA splicing domain (13.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) as well as two mechanistically related proteins, hedgehog autoprocessing domain (14.Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and glycosylasparaginase (15.Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Gou H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The four structures all exhibit the β-scaffold termed the HINT (Hedgehog, INTein) module (14.Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The GyrA structure contains a single Ala0 preceding the mutated Cys1 → Ser1 of the intein. The peptide linkage between Ala0 and Ser1 is in the energetically less favorable cis conformation with the hydroxyl group of Ser1 positioned for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of Ala0 (13.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The structure suggests Thr72, His75, and His197 play catalytic roles in the splicing reaction. Glycosylasparaginase activates itself by an N → O acyl shift followed by hydrolysis of the ester linkage (15.Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Gou H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As a result, the N-terminal side of a loop covering the active site is cleaved to allow the substrate to enter. In contrast to the GyrA structure, the structure of glycosylasparaginase has revealed a high energy distortedtrans peptide at the N-terminal junction (15.Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Gou H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Residues involved in the N → O acyl rearrangement (Asp151 and Thr152) form an unusual tight turn that forces the scissile peptide bond from an ω = 180° (planar conformation) to an ω <160°. Along with the main chain dihedral angle distortion, the τ angle of Asp151 deviates ∼9° from the ideal 110°. The authors conclude that these main chain distortions around the cleavage site could raise the energy 5 kcal/mol for each distorted residue. The crystal structures of GyrA and glycosylasparaginase give structural support to the proposed splicing mechanism. However, the former lacks a full complement of residues from the N- and C-exteins including the absolutely required Thr199 at the C-terminal splicing junction. The latter structure seems applicable only to the initial acyl rearrangement step in the protein splicing pathway. In the current study, we have cloned and expressed a mutant of the VMA1 intein (identified as VMA29) in which Cys1 and Asn454have been mutated to Ala in order to block protein splicing. In addition, 10 residues (MKAEEGKLEG) have been added to the N terminus of the intein as well as four residues (CGER) to the C terminus (Fig.1 c). This structure is the first example of a true precursor of an intein. Plasmid pVMA29 encoding the VMA mutant C1A/N454A (VMA29) with the sequence MKAEEGKLEG positioned upstream to the N-terminal cleavage site and the sequence CGER positioned downstream to the C-terminal splicing site was used to transform the Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3), a methionine auxotroph. Cells containing the pVMA29 were grown in LeMaster media to an A 600 = 0.5, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 15 h at 20 °C. Cells were lysed by the addition of 20 mg of lysozyme to cells suspended in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. After 30 min incubation at 20 °C, the sample was pulse-sonicated for 3 min. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman J25 centrifuge. Clarified lysate was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and loaded directly onto a Porus Heparin column. Samples containing the 50-kDa VMA29 protein were eluted from the column with a gradient run from 50 mm NaCl to 1 m NaCl. These fractions were pooled and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Pooled fractions were loaded onto Source 15S column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and eluted with 50 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing VMA29, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and loaded on to an S200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 500 mm NaCl, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to locate the fractions containing the mutant protein; these fractions were pooled, concentrated, and the buffer exchanged to 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Light-scattering experiments performed on these samples (data not shown) indicated the protein sample was monodispersed with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa. VMA29 was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were grown from droplets containing 2 μl (31 mg/ml) of protein and 2 μl of polyethylene glycol 3350 (10% w/v, 3 mm CdCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). The resulting 4-μl droplet was equilibrated against a well containing 500 μl of the above polyethylene glycol solution. The crystals belong to the space group P21 (unit cell a = 59.00 Å, b = 101.68 Å, c = 86.77 Å, β = 93.51o) and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Crystals (0.3 mm in each direction) were stabilized in a mother liquor containing 25% glycerol, flash-cooled to −170 °C in liquid nitrogen, and used for data collection. A 2.0-Å data set was collected at the HHMI X4A beam line of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), and data were reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (16.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Data collected on the VMA29 mutant were completely isomorphous with the previously determined structure of PI-SceI. Model phases for the VMA29 mutant were calculated based on the refined crystal structure of PI-SceI (12.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1VDE) with the water molecules removed. XTALVIEW (17.McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar) was used to examine the initial electron density map which showed a rough fit of the model to the experimental data with strong density present at the N and C terminus corresponding to the additional sequence present in the miniprecursor mutant. Refinement was carried out employing the simulated annealing protocol in the crystallographic and NMR system (18.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol.

The N- and C-terminal addition sequences as well as water molecules were built into the electron density map based on Fourier coefficients (‖F obs‖ − ‖F calc‖)e i αcalc. Water molecules were placed in difference electron density peaks only if the peaks were above 2.5 ς and if acceptable hydrogen bonds to atoms in the model could be made. Deletion of water molecules occurred if the water molecules refined position was farther than 3.3 Å from its nearest neighbor or if their Bfactors exceeded 70 Å2. The statistics for the current refined structure are summarized in Table I. Zn2+ concentration was determined using Perkin-Elmer 2380 atomic absorption spectrometer in the laboratory of Dr. D. Giedroc at Texas A&M University. A standard curve from 0.5 μm Zn+2 to 6.0 μm Zn2+ was used to quantitate the concentration of zinc in the protein sample. The protein solution was diluted. The atomic absorption readings from 1:50, 1:100, and 1:200 dilutions of the protein solution were averaged to give a mean zinc concentration of 161 μm. Using the molar extinction coefficient of 4.68 × 104/mol for VMA29, 2F. S. Gimble, personal communication. the protein concentration was determined to be 123 μm. The zinc present in the protein sample co-purified with the protein since neither the protein storage buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) nor the crystallization solution described above contained any measurable zinc. The refined crystal structure of VMA29 consists of two independent molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The VMA29 molecule from residues 1 to 454 (the intein) has a fold identical to the PI-SceI intein (12.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Of the 10 additional residues at the N terminus of VMA29, the last 4 (Lys−4, Leu−3, Glu−2, and Gly−1) have well defined electron density in molecule B (Fig. 2). Leu−3, Glu−2, and Gly−1 have been shown to support proficient splicing (3.Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler J.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The side chain of Glu−2 forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Leu−3, which fixes the main chain atoms of Lys−4 and Leu−3. The amide nitrogen of Gly−1 hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Ile434, and its carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to the amide of the same residue. The backbone amide of Glu−2 and the side chain of Leu−3 are in van der Waal contact with S-γ from Cys455. The C-γ2 atom of Leu−3 packs against the nonpolar side chain atoms of Glu457. The arrangement of hydrogen bonds around Gly−1 and the packing of the −2 and −3 residues against residues 455 and 457 distort the main chain geometry of Gly−1. Its τ angle (N-Cα-C) measures 100°, 10° less than the ideal angle. The scissile peptide bond between Gly−1 and Ala1 is in the transconformation, in agreement with the structure of glycosylasparaginase, but contrary to the GyrA structure (13.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The Sce VMA intein seems more tolerant at the −1 position (19.Chong S. Williams K.S. Wotkowicz C. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10567-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) than some mini-inteins (20.Evans T.C.J. Benner J. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3923-3926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21.Mathys S. Evans T.C.J. Chute I.C. Wu H. Chong S. Benner J. Liu X.-Q. Xu M.-Q.

BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The mutational evidence provides support for the possibility of a distortedtrans conformation to exist in the full-length Sce VMA precursor. Molecule A in the asymmetric unit differs from B in that only residues Glu−2 and Gly−1 are defined by strong electron density. The main chain distortion observed in the molecule B is reduced here (τ angle of 105°), and the scissile peptide bond is also in the trans conformation. A −50° rotation about the ψ1 torsion angle (Cα1–C′1) will superimpose Ala1 from molecule A onto B. In the A molecule, Gly−1 has no hydrogen bond interaction with other surrounding residues. The backbone NH and carbonyl oxygen of Ala 1 make hydrogen bonds with the O-δ1 and NH, respectively, of Asn76. Glu−2 contributes to the structural stability of this area with a hydrogen bond between its carbonyl oxygen and the side chain hydroxyl of Thr78. The four native extein residues (Cys455, Gly456, Glu457, and Arg458) at the C-terminal splicing junction of molecule B are clearly defined by electron density (Fig.2). However, in molecule A, electron density defines only Cys455. The most notable feature at the C-terminal splicing site is the unexpected presence of a zinc atom in both molecules, chelated by Glu80, the highly conserved His453, Cys455, and a water molecule. The geometry of zinc coordination in molecule B is T4 (tetrahedral) (23.Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (Fig.3) with all three center angles involving the zinc atom measuring ∼110°. It is unclear whether the zinc binding is structural or catalytic; however, the coordinating angles and bond distances are closer to those characteristic of a structural zinc (23.Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The zinc-binding site in the molecule A exhibits elongated electron density consistent with at least two different zinc binding modes. One involves His442, Cys455, and His453 (χ2 = −61), and a water molecule, whereas the other is similar to the site in the B molecule. Atomic absorption spectrometry identified the presence of one zinc atom per protein molecule (see “Materials and Methods”), but we found no measurable zinc in the storage or crystallization buffers. From these data, we conclude that the zinc atom co-purified with the VMA29 protein. Residues that chelate the zinc atom are important for protein splicing in the wild-type VMA protein. Cys455 receives the N-terminal extein during the transesterification reaction resulting in the formation of the branched intermediate (3.Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler J.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). His453 is highly conserved among inteins deposited into the New England Biolabs intein data base (∼90% of the inteins contain a histidine at this position). It is also adjacent to Asn454 (an Ala in the current structure) which is absolutely conserved and essential for excising the spliced exteins from the intein (3.Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler J.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 6.Xu M.-Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Glu80is not a conserved residue, but it is adjacent to the strictly conserved, catalytically required, His79 (24.Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) which is hydrogen-bonded to the amide of the scissile peptide bond at the N-terminal splice junction (or at Gly−1). His42 is a conserved residue in motif C2. The main chain distortion found in Gly−1 (τ = 100°) is also present in Ala454. The chelation of the zinc atom by His453 and Cys455 bends the main chain at this residue (Fig. 3) thereby causing the observed change in τ angle resulting in increase in energy of the peptide bonds surrounding this residue. In the wild-type protein, Asn454 undergoes succinimide formation whereby its side chain cyclizes with its own backbone carbonyl carbon. The distortion at this residue could help lower the energy barrier for succinimide formation. We conclude Cys455, His453, and Asn454 are poised to receive the thioester formed at Cys1 and undergo transesterification and succinimide formation. The wild-type model of the VMA precursor was generated by replacing Ala1 and Ala454 in the VMA29 structure with Cys and Asn, respectively, and energy-minimizing the structure (see “Materials and Methods”). Side chain atoms were modeled such that their corresponding χ1 angles were equal to the most favored, Cys χ1 = −60 and Asn χ1 = −180. Following energy minimization, these angles undergo only very slight changes (−61° and−177°, respectively). The S-γ atom of the modeled Cys1 is in position to hydrogen bond to the side chain O-δ1 of Asn76 and is also within 4.4 Å of its own carbonyl carbon. The O-δ atom of Asn454 is 3.5 Å from Thr435 backbone amide, and its N-δ atom is 2.7 Å from both Thr435 backbone carbonyl oxygen and its own backbone carbonyl carbon. The model reveals a hydrophobic surface to the “back” of Asn454 (away from the N-terminal splicing junction) comprised of side chain atoms from Ile434, Phe444, Leu436, Val37, and Val27. This surface constrains the χ1 values between −117° and −180° (i.e. in an orientation consistent with cyclization). The distance between the S-γ atom of Cys1 and the same atom of Cys455 is ∼9 Å in both molecules in the asymmetric unit. It is unclear how this distance is traversed during transesterification. The model for GyrA (Protein Data Bank code 1AM2 (13.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar)) precursor was superimposed onto the structure of the VMA29 precursor (Fig.4 a) using the sequence alignment (HINT module) found in Klabunde et al. (13.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fig.4 b illustrates residues involved in protein splicing occupy the same relative position in each protein even though VMA29 contains a bound zinc atom and residues comprising the N- and C-terminal exteins. The largest deviation in α-carbon position, 1.46 Å, occurs between GyrA Ser1 and VMA29 Ala1. The catalytically required GyrA His75 is 1.22 Å from the position of its equivalent residue in VMA29 (His79). Likewise the conserved His197 is 1.05 Å from the position of VMA29 His453; however, the side chain χ2 differs by 136° (−78 and 58, respectively). Similarly, Thr72 and Asn76 are within 1.03 Å of each other, and the strictly conserved Asn198 and Ala454 are 1.30 Å from one another. The structural superposition illustrates zinc binding at the C-terminal splicing junction does not influence the relative positions of the amino acids proven to be involved in protein splicing. It does, however, influence the side chain orientation of the penultimate histidine. The additional N- and C-extein residues also do not appear to perturb the important splicing residues. The Sce VMA inteins with Leu−3, Glu−2, Gly−1, Cys455, and Gly456 have previously been shown to undergo efficient splicing (6.Xu M.-Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, this is a splicing relevant structure. Based on the wild-type model for the VMA precursor, we propose the following molecular mechanism (Fig. 5). The side chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn76 and the S-γ of Cys1are within hydrogen bonding distance (2.91 Å). This interaction would help polarize the sulfhydryl such that its lone pair electrons would be oriented toward the carbonyl carbon of scissile peptide bond. Much like the GyrA structure (13.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), there does not appear to be a good general base in close proximity to Cys1. Glu−2 is within 3.5 Å of S-γ atom, but the amino acid at this position has not been shown to be critical for protein splicing (3.Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler J.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is not clear from this structure how the thiolate anion is generated. Regardless of the exact mechanism responsible for sulfhydryl activation, a tetrahedral intermediate would be formed during the acyl shift reaction. The intermediate could be stabilized by interactions of N-δ from Asn76 and O-γ from Thr78 (Fig.5 a). The imidazole ring of His79 is in position to protonate the amide nitrogen of Cys1 promoting the break down of the tetrahedral intermediate to form the thioester. Relieving the distorted/strained main chain atoms of Gly−1 may help drive the N → S acyl rearrangement. The transesterification reaction requires the thioester between Gly−1 and Cys1 to be in close proximity to the acceptor, Cys455. As stated above, the distance between the modeled side chain of Cys1 and that of Cys455is ∼9 Å (Fig. 5 b). It is not possible at this time to determine exactly how this gap is traversed, but the tight type II turn between residues 3 and 6 could relax and allow Cys1 to move toward Cys455. His453 → Gln substitution provides experimental evidence for a conformational change occurring during splicing of the PI-SceI intein. C-terminal cleavage in the resulting mutant was shown to be absolutely dependent on N-terminal cleavage to liberate the N terminus (19.Chong S. Williams K.S. Wotkowicz C. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10567-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The coordination between Cys455 and the zinc atom would be disrupted when the thioester is presented. The zinc atom could move away from the newly formed thioester and take up a position between His454 and His442 (much like the position observed in molecule A of this structure) or it could diffuse away from the protein (Fig. 5 c). If the former occurred, a main chain carbonyl oxygen from either Gly456 or Asn454could replace the sulfur atom from Cys455 in the coordination of the zinc. His453 would then rotate ∼120° about χ2 to orient its N-ε toward the new position of zinc and in doing so would position its N-δ such that it could donate a proton to the amide nitrogen of Cys455 after asparagine cyclization. The resulting orientation of His453 would be consistent with that observed in the GyrA structure as well as the side chain orientation found in one of the zinc binding modes of molecule A. Experimental data suggest that succinimide formation could occur independently of the initial steps in the splicing reaction. Self-splicing inteins carrying mutations of Cys1 inhibited cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction but still retained cleavage activity at the C-terminal splice junction (11.Cooper A.A. Chen Y. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20.Evans T.C.J. Benner J. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3923-3926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21.Mathys S. Evans T.C.J. Chute I.C. Wu H. Chong S. Benner J. Liu X.-Q. Xu M.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, in the normal splicing pathway prior cleavage at the N-terminal junction would be favored to occur before asparagine cyclization coupled peptide bond cleavage could proceed. Since transesterification most likely involves the relaxation of the type II tight turn between residues 3 and 6, subsequently the residues involved in cyclization of Asn454 would take favorable positions (Fig. 5 d). His453 would be in position to protonate the amino group of Cys455. The side chain nitrogen of Asn454refined to a position where it hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Ile434. These interactions coupled with the hydrophobic surface orient the β-amide such that it could attack its own backbone carbonyl carbon. As a result the amide bond between Asn454and Cys455 would be broken down forming the C-terminal aminosuccinimide which would be hydrolyzed to form a C-terminal asparagine or isoasparagine. A spontaneous S → N acyl shift would result in a stable amide bond between Gly−1 and Cys455, thus completing protein splicing. The VMA29 miniprecursor structure presented here provides the first image of a true intein precursor containing multiple residues from both N- and C-terminal exteins. The N-terminal scissile peptide bond is in the trans conformation with a distorted τ angle in the −1 residue. These observations are in agreement with the recently solved crystal structure of glycosylasparaginase (15.Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Gou H.-C.

https://openalex.org/W1998830750,Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite observations indicate that extensive denitrification without significant dehydration currently occurs only in the Antarctic during mid to late June. The fact that denitrification occurs in a relatively warm month in the Antarctic raises concern about the likelihood of its occurrence and associated effects on ozone recovery in a colder and possibly more humid future Arctic lower stratosphere. Polar stratospheric cloud lifetimes required for Arctic denitrification to occur in the future are presented and contrasted against the current Antarctic cloud lifetimes. Model calculations show that widespread severe denitrification could enhance future Arctic ozone loss by up to 30%.

Upon binding, Mdm2 inhibits the transcription regulatory activity of p53 and promotes its rapid degradation. In this study we investigated the effect of the human Mdm2 homologue Hdmx on p53 stability. We found that Hdmx does not target p53 for degradation, although, like Mdm2, it inhibits p53-mediated transcription activation. On the contrary, Hdmx was found to counteract the degradation of p53 by Mdm2, and to stabilize both p53 and Mdm2. The RING finger of Hdmx was found to be necessary and sufficient for this stabilization, and it probably involves hetero-oligomerization with the RING finger of Mdm2, which may lead to inhibition of Mdm2's ubiquitin ligase activity. However, Hdmx does not relieve the inhibition by Mdm2 of transcription activation by p53, probably due to the formation of a trimeric complex consisting of Hdmx, Mdm2, and p53. We propose a model in which Hdmx secures a pool of largely inactive p53, which, upon the induction of stress, can be quickly activated.

Signaling pathways activated by DNA damage, ribonucleotide depletion, oxidative stress, and incomplete mitotic stimuli lead to the activation of p53. This activation is mainly due to posttranslational modifications, which lead to both increased DNA binding and accumulation of p53 protein levels. Downstream responses of p53 are growth arrest or apoptosis, which are mediated by its target genes including p21/waf1/cip1 (1el Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The activities and stability of p53 are tightly regulated. A key regulator of p53 half-life is the Mdm2 protein. The mdm2 oncogene was discovered as an amplified gene on a murine double minute chromosome in the spontaneously transformed 3T3DM cell line (3Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The Mdm2 protein associates with the transactivation domain of p53, thereby inhibiting the transcription regulatory functions of p53 (4Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

In addition, it has recently been shown that upon binding of Mdm2, the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 is promoted by enhancing the ubiquitination of p53 (7Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar, 8Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar), most likely by an intrinsic E3-like ubiquitin-ligase activity of Mdm2 (9Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). For the latter activity of Mdm2 not only the p53-binding domain is necessary, but also its nuclear localization signal and nuclear export signal to allow nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling (10Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and the RING finger domain which contains the putative ubiquitin-binding site (9Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). We previously reported the identification of a mouse and human Mdm2 homologue, Mdmx and Hdmx, respectively (11Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 12Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P.

Several structural domains are conserved between Mdm2 and Mdmx: most notably, the p53-binding domain, the zinc finger, and the RING finger. In a recent study, the similar requirements of Mdm2 and Hdmx to bind to p53 have been clearly demonstrated (13Bottger V. Bottger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F.M. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Like Mdm2, Mdmx can inhibit p53-mediated transcription activation via binding of its N terminus to the transcriptional activation domain of p53 (11Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the effect of Hdmx on the regulation of p53 stability. It was found that Hdmx does not target p53 for proteasome-mediated degradation but, on the contrary, enhances levels of p53 and Mdm2. This effect is mainly mediated by the RING finger of Hdmx, which, through the interaction with the RING finger of Mdm2, probably inhibits Mdm2's ubiquitin ligase activity. Binding of the RING finger of Hdmx to Mdm2 does not release p53 from Mdm2; hence, a trimeric complex can be formed that is not able to activate transcription. Full-length human HA1-tagged hdmxwas cloned into pCDNA3.1myc-his (Invitrogen). Thehdmx-ΔR and hdmx-R constructs, coding for amino acids 1–392 and 393–490, respectively, were made by PCR with the 3′ primers encoding the HA tag and 5′ primers encoding the SV40 large T nuclear location signal. The PCR products were sequenced and cloned into pCDNA3.1myc-his. PCR primers used to construct hdmx-ΔR: 5′ primer: 5′-CCACCATGGGCTCGAAGAAGAAGCGAAAGGTAATGACATCATTTTCC-3′, and 3′ primer: 5′-AAGCTTCTAGAGGCTAGCATAATCAGGAACATCATAGAG-CTCGAATTCCACTGAGTTGC-3′; to construct hdmx-R: 5′ primer: 5′-CCACC-ATGGGTCCGAAGAAGAAGCGAAAGGTAGAATTCTTGGATTTGGC-3′ and 3′ primer: 5′-TAAGCTTCTAGAGGCTAGC-3′. Plasmids encoding full-length mouse mdm2 (mdm2-X2) and wild type and mutant (Ala-143) human p53 (pC53-SN, pC53-SCX3, respectively) have been described previously (14Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven G.T.

Approximately 16 h prior to transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. C33A, G401, and Hep3B cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. p53−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in F15, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (17van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) as described previously (11Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P.

Hep3B cells were grown on six-well plates and transfected as outlined above. Luciferase analysis were performed with a commercial kit (Promega), and activity was measured in a Luminometer (Berthold). To correct for transfection efficiency, 1.5 μg of CMV-LacZ was co-transfected in all cases and luciferase values were corrected for β-galactosidase activity. Anti-Mdm2 antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibodies 2A10, 4B2, and 3G5 (18Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Anti-Hdmx antibodies were rabbit polyclonal antibody p56 or mouse monoclonal antibodies 6B1A, 11F4D, and 12G11G. 2Y. F. M. Ramos, R. Stad, J. Attema, A. J. van der Eb, and A. G.

Anti-HA antibody was rabbit polyclonal antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-LacZ antibody was mouse monoclonal antibody clone D19–2F3–2 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Cells lysates were made in IPB0.7 (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 0.7 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholic acid) and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (19Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23456-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized by autoradiography or with the use of a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Cell lysates were made in Giordano buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA), and the precipitations were carried out as described previously (11Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The different HA-tagged Hdmx proteins were precipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody. Endogenous Hdmx was precipitated with either p56 or with a mixture of 11F4D and 12G11G, Mdm2 was precipitated with 2A10, and p53 was precipitated with a mixture of PAb421 and PAb1801. Cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the indicated plasmids. 40 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 80% acetone for 10 min, and washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. After a 30-min pre-incubation with 5% normal goat serum in PBS, 0.05% Tween, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS, 0.05% Tween, 5% normal goat serum for 60 min, washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with FITC- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min, and washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Stained cells were embedded in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80% glycerol, 2.3% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and 0.002% DAPI. Binding of Mdm2 to p53 results in p53 being targeted for degradation. Both the p53-binding domain and the RING finger of Mdm2 are required for this degradation (20Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar), and since these domains are conserved in Hdmx, we investigated whether Hdmx can also target p53 for degradation. C33A cells, which contain high levels of endogenous mutant p53 that can be degraded upon overexpression of Mdm2 (20Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected with eitherhdmx or mdm2. Immunofluorescence was used to analyze the expression of Hdmx, Mdm2 and p53. As shown in Fig.1 (A–C), the cells expressing Hdmx showed no decreased p53 levels, indicating that Hdmx does not target p53 for degradation, whereas overexpression of Mdm2 clearly leads to a reduction of p53 signal (Fig. 1, D–F). Since both Hdmx and Mdm2 bind to the same N-terminal region of p53 (13Bottger V. Bottger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F.M. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we questioned whether Hdmx could interfere with Mdm2-directed p53 degradation, for instance by competing with Mdm2 for p53 binding. Therefore, C33A cells, which contain high levels of endogenous mutant p53, were co-transfected with mdm2 and hdmx. Immunofluorescence indicated that now the Mdm2-positive cells did not show decreased levels of p53 (Fig. 1, G–I). Double staining for Mdm2 and Hdmx on coverslips from the same transfection confirmed co-expression of Hdmx and Mdm2 (data not shown). This result indicates that Hdmx can prevent Mdm2-directed p53 degradation. In order to assess the effect of Hdmx on p53 stability more quantitatively, transfections were performed into p53−/−MEFs. To prevent induction of endogenous Mdm2 by transfected p53, a DNA binding mutant p53 (Ala-143) was used. In these experiments, 100 ng of p53 was transfected alone or in the presence of 2 μg ofmdm2 with either none or increasing amounts ofhdmx. As a control for transfection efficiency, 1.5 μg of CMV-lacZ plasmid was co-transfected in all cases. As shown previously, co-transfection of p53 and mdm2 results in a reduction of p53 protein levels (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Co-transfection of 2, 4, or 7 μg ofhdmx results in restoration of p53 levels (lanes 3, 4, and 5). Besides increased levels of p53, also increased levels of Mdm2 were observed (Fig.2 A, lanes 3, 4, and5). This stabilization of Mdm2 was independent of the presence of p53 (data not shown). The same effect was observed in other p53-deficient cells (H1299 and Saos2 cells; data not shown). In general, after co-transfection of high amounts of hdmx, p53 levels exceeded the levels observed after transfection of p53 alone (compare lane 1 with lanes 4 and 5). This could be due to the effect of transfected hdmx on the endogenous Mdm2. Fig. 2 Bshows that hdmx can also stabilize p53 in the absence of transfectedmdm2, probably due to the inhibition of the endogenous Mdm2 protein. In all cases, LacZ protein levels were comparable, indicating that Hdmx has no effect on the transcription levels of the transfected plasmids. One possible explanation for this inhibition of Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation was that Hdmx competes with Mdm2 for p53 binding. However, during the course of this study, it was reported that the RING fingers of Mdm2 and Hdmx could interact with each other, leading to stabilization of the Mdm2 protein (21Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of p53 and Mdm2 stabilization, we constructed two deletion mutants of Hdmx, one encoding the RING finger (hdmx-R) and another containing all but the RING finger (hdmx-ΔR) and tested their effects on p53 and Mdm2 stability. Fig.3 A shows that only full-length Hdmx (lane 3) and Hdmx-R (lane 5) are able to stabilize both p53 and Mdm2, while Hdmx-ΔR is not (lane 4). These results favor the model, in which the RING finger of Hdmx, by binding to the RING finger of Mdm2, inhibits Mdm2's ubiquitin ligase activity, resulting in stabilization of both p53 and Mdm2. Transfection of G401 cells, which contain endogenous wild type p53, showed that full-length Hdmx and the Hdmx RING finger could also stabilize endogenous wild type p53 (Fig. 3 B,panels A–C and G–I, respectively). Under these conditions the Hdmx mutant lacking the RING finger was also able to stabilize p53 (panels D–F). In this setting, however, the ratio between Hdmx-ΔR and the endogenous Hdm2 is strongly increased so that competition for p53 binding probably also results in stabilization of p53. Since Hdmx expression leads to increased levels of p53 due to inhibition of Mdm2-mediated degradation, we wondered whether the ability of p53 to activate transcription would also be modulated. Hep3B cells, lacking endogenous p53, were transfected with the Bax-luc reporter. Co-transfection of 20 ng of wild type p53 results in a 9-fold induction of the luciferase activity (see Fig.4 A, lane 2). Mdm2 completely inhibits this p53 activity (lane 3), whereas full-length Hdmx partially inhibits p53 (lane 4). Co-expression of Hdmx-ΔR leads to a stronger inhibition of p53, probably due to higher expression levels of Hdmx-ΔR compared with full-length Hdmx (comparelane 4 and 5). To our surprise Hdmx-R, which lacks the N-terminally located p53-binding site, also partially inhibits p53 activity (lane 6). Co-transfection of the different hdmx constructs with mdm2 did not reverse the inhibition of p53 activity (lanes 7–9), indicating that the stabilized p53 protein is not able to activate transcription. Hdmx and Mdm2 both bind p53 via their N-terminal domains, and Hdmx and Mdm2 can interact with each other via their RING fingers. To test whether Hdmx, Mdm2, and p53 can form a heterotrimeric complex, H1299 cells were co-transfected with mutant p53 and mdm2 in the presence of either HA-tagged full-length hdmx orhdmx-ΔR or hdmx-R. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody or with anti-Mdm2 antibody 2A10. Fig. 5 A shows that Mdm2 co-precipitates with both full-length Hdmx and Hdmx-R, both in the anti-Mdm2 and the anti-Hdmx immunoprecipitations, confirming the earlier described association between the RING fingers. This binding is observed both in the presence or absence of p53 (lanes 6 and 8 and lanes 10 and12, respectively). After co-transfection of mdm2 and p53, p53 is co-immunoprecipitated with Mdm2, regardless of the presence of Hdmx (lanes 5–8; anti-Mdm2 IP), indicating that under these conditions Hdmx does not significantly disturb the binding between Mdm2 and p53. Interestingly, p53 is also co-immunoprecipitated with all Hdmx proteins in the presence of Mdm2 (lanes 6–8;anti-Hdmx IP). The observation that Hdmx-R co-immunoprecipitates p53 could suggest the presence of a trimeric complex between p53, Mdm2, and Hdmx-R. However, this binding, although somewhat weaker, is also observed in the absence of transfected Mdm2 (lane 4). These results can be explained in two ways; either this binding is via endogenous Mdm2, although this cannot be detected, or the RING finger of Hdmx interacts directly with p53. In a preliminary glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiment, a direct binding of p53 to the Hdmx RING finger was observed (data not shown). The physiological relevance of this binding needs to be further investigated. As the above experiment did not answer the question whether a trimeric complex between Hdmx, Mdm2, and p53 could be formed, we performed co-transfection experiments with an N-terminal deletion mutant of Mdm2 (mdm2-ΔXM), which is defective in its ability to bind p53 (22Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows that Mdm2-ΔN could only be co-immunoprecipitated with p53 in the presence of Hdmx, in both the anti-Mdm2 and anti-p53 IP. This result indicates that a heterotrimeric complex can be formed between p53, Hdmx, and Mdm2. The formation of this trimeric complex fits with the observation that stabilized p53 protein is not able to activate transcription. To investigate whether endogenously expressed p53, Hdmx, and Hdm2 proteins interact, immunoprecipitations were performed on G401 cell lysates, which contain detectable levels of endogenous Hdmx, Hdm2, and wild type p53. Clear binding of Hdmx to Hdm2 could be detected by immunoprecipitation of Hdmx with either the rabbit polyclonal antiserum p56 or with a mixture of antibodies 11F4D and 12G11G and by immunoprecipitation of Hdm2 with antibody 2A10, with non-immune rabbit serum and anti-large T antibody serving as controls (Fig. 6 A). Binding of p53 to both Hdmx and Hdm2 was determined by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody p56 and monoclonal antibody 2A10, respectively (Fig. 6 B) and by immunoprecipitation of p53 with a mixture of PAb421 and PAb1801 (Fig.6 C). The presence of an endogenous trimeric complex cannot be determined in this way, since all three proteins can also form heterodimers. Interestingly, p56 and 11F/12G precipitate equal amounts of Hdmx, but the amount of co-precipitated Hdm2 is much less with the use of 11F/12G. This difference is most likely caused by the fact that the epitopes of 11F4D and 12G11G map within the Hdmx RING finger,2 and thus apparently disturb the interaction between Hdmx and Hdm2. In this study we show that the Hdmx protein does not target p53 for degradation, but even prevents Mdm2-triggered degradation. Thus, although the domain structures of Hdmx and Mdm2 are very similar, their biological activities differ considerably. The inability of Hdmx to destabilize p53 could be due to several reasons. First, analysis of the Hdmx amino acid sequence does not reveal a good consensus for a NES, which is present in Mdm2, and is essential for degradation of p53 (10Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Second, although the RING finger structure is conserved between Mdm2 and Hdmx, the amino acid identity is only 44%, leaving the possibility that residues essential for the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 are absent in Hdmx. The differences in structure of the RING fingers of Hdmx and Mdm2 is underscored by the observation that hetero-oligomerization is much more efficient than homo-oligomerization (21Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We have started to swap domains between Mdmx and Mdm2, to investigate which motifs are responsible for the difference in function between the two proteins. The inhibition of the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation by Hdmx is mainly caused by the Hdmx RING finger and most likely involves the hetero-oligomerization with the RING finger of Mdm2, which possibly prevents the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2. Alternatively, through binding of Hdmx, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mdm2 might be impaired, as has been shown for the p19ARF protein (23Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, in the case of high overexpression of Hdmx compared with endogenous Mdm2, the effect might also be caused by competition with Mdm2 for p53 binding. The interaction of the RING fingers of Mdm2 and Hdmx has been reported by Tanimura et al. (21Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Like us, they find that the interaction leads to stabilization of Mdm2. They suggest, however, that the increased levels of Mdm2 would lead to an even more rapid degradation of p53. Our results suggest a model in which the interaction of the RING fingers prevents both the ubiquitination of p53 and the auto-ubiquitination of Mdm2. These findings are in line with the observation that the inhibition of Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination by p14ARF also leads to increased levels of Mdm2 (24Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The biological function of the effect of Hdmx on p53 half-life remains to be elucidated. Stabilized p53 protein seems not to be able to activate transcription, possibly due to the formation of a trimeric complex. We propose the model that Hdmx secures the presence of a pool of inactive p53 that can be instantly activated upon certain cellular stresses. It has recently been shown that the interaction of Hdmx and p53 is disrupted after in vitro phosphorylation of p53 (25Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the kinetics of the p53 response after cellular stress might be partially dependent upon the levels of Hdmx. It is of interest to note that G401 cells, in which we can detect an endogenous Hdm2/Hdmx complex, contain significant levels of relatively stable wild type p53 (half-life of about 4 h; Ref. 26Steegenga W.T. Shvarts A. van Laar T. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). It would be interesting to see what the effect on p53 levels would be by decreasing the Hdmx levels, for instance by an antisense approach, or by disrupting the Hdmx-Hdm2 interaction by microinjection of the 11F4D or 12G11G antibodies, which recognize an epitope in the RING finger of Hdmx. We are currently testing this hypothesis. Relatively high levels of Hdmx might also explain the observation that a high percentage of certain tumor types contain high levels of wild type p53 and Mdm2, e.g.germ-cell tumors (27Guillou L. Estreicher A. Chaubert P. Hurlimann J. Kurt A.M. Metthez G. Iggo R. Gray A.C. Jichlinski P. Leisinger H.J. Benhattar J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1221-1228PubMed Google Scholar, 28Riou G. Barrois M.

This would mean that the efficacy of treatment of tumors showing overexpression of Hdmx and containing wild type p53 will be very high.

Lack of functional TIMP-2, however, dramatically altered the activation of proMMP-2 both in vivo andin vitro. Fully functional TIMP-2 is essential for efficient activation of proMMP-2 in vivo. No evidence of successful functional compensation was observed.

TIMPs inhibit the catalytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and in some cases also inhibit the proteolytic activation of MMP zymogens required for attainment of catalytic activity. Among members of the TIMP family, the primary structure is highly conserved. However, TIMPs 1, 2, 3, and 4 differ somewhat in inhibitory selectivity against the various MMPs. The TIMPs also display greatly different patterns of expression (1Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74 (22): 111PubMed Google Scholar, 3Edwards D.R.

TIMP-2 is widely expressed in the body and occurs either in free form or bound to (inactive) proMMP-2 (4Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It inhibits in the nanomolar range virtually all MMPs against which it has been tested by formation of classical binary non-covalent complexes (6Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A number of studies have suggested that TIMP-2 regulates the proteolytic activation of proMMP-2 on the cell surface by a membrane-type MMP-dependent process (7Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G.

The suggested model implicates TIMP-2 as a bridging molecule, tethering proMMP-2 through binding between the COOH-terminal ends of the two molecules and binding between the MT-MMP and TIMP-2 NH2-terminal ends (7Strongin A.Y.

In this way TIMP-2 may play a biological role in the activation of MMPs as well as through the inhibition of MMP-activity (10Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. APMIS. 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To analyze the significance of the various proposed roles of TIMP-2, we targeted the mouse Timp-2 gene for mutation by homologous recombination.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation and Characterization of the Mouse Genomic Timp-2 LocusScreening of a λfixII mouse genomic DNA library with humanTimp-2 cDNA (11Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Onisto M. Levy A.T. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13933-13938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yielded 2 overlapping clones, each of which contained exons 2, 3, and 4 of the mouse Timp-2gene. To obtain the two terminal Timp-2 exons, primer pairs were designed to the 5′ (sense, CTGCGCCCCTTGACAAAGA; antisense, TGCATTGCAAAACGCCTGTT) and 3′ (sense, CTTGACATCGAGGACCCGTAAGAAG; antisense, CATGGGGCTGACTGGGACTC) untranslated regions of the mouseTimp-2 cDNA (12Shimizu S. Malik K. Sejima H. Kishi J. Hayakawa T. Koiwai O. Gene. 1992; 114: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PCR of those probes was used to screen pools of 129/OLA mouse genomic DNA P1 phage clones (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) to obtain the entire Timp-2 locus. Three clones were obtained. Due to the size of intron 1 (>50 kb), they have not been fully sequenced. All DNA sequencing was performed by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) sequencing core facility using an Applied Biosystems Inc. automated DNA sequencer. Primers for the various sequencing reactions were provided either by the sequencing core or by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center oligonucleotide synthesis core facility. Sequencing results were confirmed by multiple overlapping reactions on each strand. Genetics Computer Group software was used to analyze all sequence data (13Genetic Computer Group, Inc. Wisconsin Package , Version 9.0. Madison, WI1999Google Scholar).Construction of the Targeting Vector and Creation of Transgenic MiceUsing the vector pNTK (14Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) as the framework for the construction of a targeting vector, a 2.2-kb BamHI fragment upstream of mouse Timp-2 exon 2 and a 6-kb HindIII fragment from a 9-kb EcoRI subclone downstream of mouseTimp-2 exon 3 were cloned in as the 2 homology regions. The construct was linearized with SalI, purified, and electroporated into the embryonic stem cell line HM-1 (15Magin T.M. McWhir J. Melton D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3795-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Electroporated cells were subjected to 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μm ganciclovir (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) selection. Purified DNA of surviving colonies was genotyped by both PCR and Southern blot analyses. For PCR analysis, two primer pairs were designed to amplify sequences spanning the 5′ homology region. The first was made to the endogenous locus: sense, ATTTCGCAGGAATGTTTATGGAGAA; antisense (sequence deleted in mutant locus), GCCCTGGTGTTGCTTCACAG. The second was made to the mutant locus sense, AAGGGAAGGTATTTCGCAGGAA; antisense (phosphoglycerate kinase promoter), CTGACTAGGGGAGGAGTAGAAGGTG. Detection of the mutant locus by Southern blot analysis was observed as a 1.8-kb decrease in size (7.5 to 5.7 kb) of the EcoRI band, hybridizing to a 1-kbXbaI/BamHI probe just upstream of the 5′ homology region. The overall targeting efficiency was 9/72 (∼13%). Five of the 9 homologous recombinants were injected into 72-h-old blastocysts from C57BL/6 mice (NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD) and implanted into pseudopregnant B6D2 or C57BL/6 X DBA females (NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD). Offspring were mated to generate heterozygous animals for the targeted gene in either an out-bred background to C57BL/6 females (NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD) or in an inbred background to 129/ReJ females (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Heterozygous animals were subsequently interbred to generate homozygous mutant progeny in both genetic backgrounds.RNA AnalysisA mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with a 250-base pair probe corresponding to the mouse TIMP-2 5′-untranslated region/exon 1 PCR amplification product (described above as the proximal probe for the Timp-2 gene locus). The manufacturer's protocol was followed. For analysis of gene targeting, total RNA was isolated from newborn mouse tissues by snap-freezing in liquid N2 followed by extraction in TRIzol (Life Technologies). Purified RNA was subjected to Northern analysis by conventional methods (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In this case, the 5′ TIMP-2 probe could not be used due to cross-hybridization with 28 S rRNA. Therefore, this blot was probed with 170 base pairs of KpnI fragment from the mouse TIMP-2 cDNA containing portions of exons 4 and 5. The novel splice junction from TIMP-2 mRNA transcribed from the mutant locus was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using the primer pair sense, CCTCCTGCTGTTAGCCTCGCTCGTG (exon 1), and antisense, TGACCCAGTCCATCCAGAGGCACTC (exon 4). The amplification product was cloned into pCRscript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced.Cell CultureSkins of 14.5-day-post-coitus embryonic and newborn mice were floated dermis side down on 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies) at 4 °C for 8 h. The epidermis was discarded, and the dermis was dissociated by forcing it through a syringe. The cell suspension was seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) with 50% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). The serum concentration was gradually reduced to 10% for maintenance. HT1080 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were also maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.Protein AnalysisWestern BlottingSerum-free conditioned medium from mouse dermal fibroblasts was precipitated with an equal volume of ethanol and resuspended in gel loading buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were boiled and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel run with MES buffer, Novex, San Diego, CA), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-TIMP-2 monoclonal antibodies 67–4H11 (P178–193 amino acid sequence YRGAAPPKQEFLDIED(+C)) and 68–6H4 (P30–44 amino acid sequence DSGNDIYGNPIKRIQ(+C)) (Fuji Chemical Industries, Ltd, Toyama, Japan). Western blots were developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) followed by exposure to Renaissance solutions (NEN Life Science Products) and autoradiography analysis. For organomercurial activation, conditioned culture medium was incubated with 1 mm p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate at 35 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline to 1 mm.ZymographySerum-free conditioned medium was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in non-reducing gel loading buffer containing 2% SDS. The samples were electrophoresed in a 10% gelatin zymogram (Novex) and developed overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For reverse zymography, conditioned culture medium was electrophoresed in 17% polyacrylamide reverse zymograms containing 2.5 mg/ml gelatin and 0.15 μg/ml MMP-2 (17Oliver G.W. Leferson J.D. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Kleiner D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Isolation of proMMP-2·Timp-2 ComplexesGelatin-Sepharose (0.2 ml) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 15 mm NaN3was mixed with 100 ml of conditioned fibroblast culture medium derived from Timp-2 heterozygous mice. The suspension was rotated end over end overnight, and the gel was repeatedly washed with the same buffer. Bound fibronectin was removed by a single wash with 1m arginine, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, for 30 min. After an additional washing step, proMMP-2·TIMP-2 complex was eluted by boiling in gel loading buffer containing 2% SDS under reducing conditions.Collagen Fibril DissolutionTo analyze the ability of live cells to degrade fibrillar collagen, 24-well tissue culture plates were coated with reconstituted collagen fibrils by polymerizing 0.4 ml/well of a 300 μg/ml neutralized solution of rat tail tendon type I collagen for 2 h at 37 °C (18Havemose-Poulsen A. Holmstrup P. Stoltze K. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Periodontal Res. 1998; 33: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The collagen fibril film was air-dried and washed with several changes of distilled water and culture medium. Aliquots (25 μl) of a suspension of 106 cells/ml were dotted onto the center of each well. The cells were allowed to attach for 5 h, and the wells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies). Mouse skin fibroblasts were grown in serum-free medium (Optimem, Life Technologies) for up to 4 days. HT1080 cells were pretreated for 12 h with 1.6 × 10−7m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), then incubated with either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% fetal calf serum with and without 3 μg/ml purified human TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. The cells were removed with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100,and collagen remaining in the wells was visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue.Preparation of Lung HomogenatesLungs of 3-week-old mice were homogenized individually in a Dounce homogenizer in 20 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 120 μl of gel loading buffer, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and microcentrifuged for 5 min. The supernatants were analyzed by zymography.RESULTSThe structure of the mouse Timp-2 gene locus is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. To generate a mutation of the mouse Timp-2 gene, a targeting vector was designed that removes exons 2 and 3. High percentage chimeric animals produced from five different homologous recombinants were mated to C57BL/6 mice, and chimeras from four of the five clones resulted in germline transmission of the targeted allele. Chimeras with the highest percentage germline transmission for two of the clones were also mated to 129/ReJ mice, and each produced germline transmission of the targeted allele to the inbred background as well. Interbred heterozygotes gave rise to the expected Mendelian distribution of the two alleles in both the out-bred and inbred backgrounds. Genotyping of F1 offspring is shown in Fig. 1 C.Phenotype of TIMP-2-deficient MiceMice homozygous for the mutant Timp-2 locus developed without immediately apparent (0–120 weeks) macroscopic or histologic abnormalities in the out-bred background. They were able to repeatedly procreate, produce, and nurture seemingly healthy offspring. Lifespan based on ∼70 mice (half wild type, half mutant) appeared unabridged beyond 2 years regardless of gender. Because TIMP-2 is involved in the cellular activation of proMMP-2, we sought to determine whether this process was altered in mutant mice. Zymography of matrix-enriched lung extracts (Fig.2) showed that although most of the proMMP-2 was already converted to active form in normal littermates, only a small fraction of the proenzyme was processed in the lungs of mutant mice, suggesting that the mutation had resulted in impairment of MMP-2 activation in vivo. We then asked whether the TIMP-2 mutation also impaired the autocatalytic activation of proMMP-2 by organomercurials under MT1-MMP-free conditions. To determine this skin fibroblast, cultures were derived from 14.5-day-post-coitus embryos and neonates for each genotype and background. Fig.3 shows that proMMP-2 from homozygous mutant cells is converted significantly faster (>30 fold) than that from wild type cells. Although full activation required overnight (16 h) incubation of wild type medium, this process was completed in 30 min in the TIMP-2 mutant media (Fig. 3 A). The rate of conversion was again reduced by addition of exogenous TIMP-2 (Fig.3 B).Figure 2Impairment of proMMP-2 activation in mutant mice.

Samples of culture medium from wild type (+/+) or homozygous mutant (−/−) mouse fibroblasts were incubated at 37 °C with or without 1 mm p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate (APMA) and in the presense or absence of exogenous TIMP-2 (final concentration, 10 μg/ml). Aliquots were removed at various time points, and 1,10-phenanthroline was added to stop the reactions. Aliquots from the various time points were analyzed by gelatin zymography.

B, effect of exogenous TIMP-2 on MMP-2 activation in mutant conditioned medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The observation that TIMP-2 deficiency abrogates the physiologic (presumably MT1-MMP-dependent) activation of proMMP-2 in mutant TIMP-2 mice but significantly accelerates the MT1-MMP-independent, organomercurial-induced autocatalytic conversion of the enzyme illustrates the duality of TIMP-2-function in MMP-2 activation. Previous studies suggest that TIMP-2 in a biphasic manner promotes the MT1-MMP-dependent processing of proMMP-2 at low concentrations but inhibits it at higher concentrations (9Kinoshita T. Sato H. Okada A. Ohuchi E. Imai K. Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16098-16103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Exposure of live cells to concanavalin A has previously been shown to induce or greatly enhance the cell-mediated (and presumably MT1-MMP-dependent) conversion of proMMP-2 to its active form. Homozygous mutant cells displayed a decidedly biphasic response to addition of exogenous TIMP-2. In the range 5 to 100 ng/ml, TIMP-2 greatly accelerated proMMP-2 conversion, whereas concentrations of 500 ng/ml or higher increasingly blocked conversion (Fig.4). In wild type cells, which by reverse zymography contained in the range 400–500 ng/ml endogenous TIMP-2, conversion of proMMP-2 was inhibited at all concentration.Figure 4Effect of exogenous TIMP-2 on activation of proMMP-2. Gelatin zymogram of 40-h culture medium from wild type and homozygous mutant fibroblasts grown in increasing concentrations of exogenous Timp-2. ProMMP-2 activation is induced by exposure to 20 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) for the duration of the incubation period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of Wild Type and Mutant Timp-2 Gene LociMouseTimp-2 transcript is expressed in 2 size species, 1.1 and 3.5 kb, resulting from the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Expression levels vary among tissues as do the ratios between the two transcripts, but some level of expression can be detected in all tissue types tested (Fig. 5 A) as previously shown (5Blavier L. DeClerck Y.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1513-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression from the mutant locus produced two new species of 0.9 and 3.3 kb corresponding to loss of exons 2 and 3 (Fig.5 B). All four species were expressed in heterozygous mice. To verify that a splicing event was taking place on message produced from the mutant locus resulting in attachment of exon 1 to exon 4, reverse transcription-PCR was performed across the splice junction, and the amplification product was cloned and sequenced (Fig.5 C). This confirmed the predicted splicing event and verified that the original reading frame of the message remained intact, suggesting that any protein made following transcription from this locus would contain the correct COOH-terminal sequence downstream of Ala-89 (Fig. 5 D).Figure 5Analyses of mouse Timp-2 RNA transcripts. A, mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (2 μg poly(A) mRNA/lane) probed with a portion of the mouse TIMP-2 cDNA. The probe recognizes both the 1.1-kb and 3.5-kb forms of the TIMP-2 message. A third transcript is seen only in testis.B, Northern blot analysis of total RNA from wild type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous mutant (−/−) neonates. Transcripts being made from the mutant Timp-2 locus splicing together exons 1 and 4 form two new RNA species with a decrease in size directly related to the loss of exons 2 and 3. C, ethidium bromide-stained gel shows the inserts resultingPstI/KpnI digestion of the cloned splice junctions from RNA of wild type and homozygous mutant mice; reverse transcription-PCR was performed with primers spanning the proposed novel splice junction from the mutant; the respective expected products were produced, cloned, and sequenced.

An immunoreactive polypeptide of the predicted size (14 kDa) was produced by cells containing the mutant locus and absent in cells that do not (Fig. 6 B). The wild type TIMP-2 product (22 kDa), as expected, was not detected in samples from homozygous mutant mice. The reactivity with the two mAbs confirmed that the mutant polypeptide contained the COOH-terminal tail epitope but lacked the deleted epitope in the NH2-terminal domain. This observation provided additional and independent evidence of an in-frame deletion with nucleotide and amino acid sequences in correct register. Densitometry of Western blots suggested that mutant cells secreted in the range 5–10-fold less TIMP-2-like protein than wild type cells on a molar basis.Figure 6Detection of mutant TIMP-2. A, loop structure of wild type TIMP-2. Mutant TIMP-2 lacks most of loops 1 and 2; the missing sequence is shown inblack with white lettering.

The right panel shows the effect on collagen degradation of 24× concentrated medium from 4-day cultures of mouse fibroblasts derived from either wild type (WT) or homozygous mutant (Mut) mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mutant Cells Express <1% of Wild Type TIMP-2 Inhibitory ActivityHaving established that the predicted mutant protein was being expressed and possessed the correct amino acid sequence downstream of the splice site, we sought to assess any residual TIMP-2-type inhibitory function by two different lines of experiments. First, reverse zymography (Fig. 6 C) showed no TIMP-2 inhibitory activity at the position of wild type TIMP-2 from homozygous mutant cells, but a barely visible band was noted at the predicted (14 kDa) size, suggesting that this protein might still possess some, albeit minimal, inhibitory activity against MMP-2. The activity of other TIMP bands in the same reverse zymograms did not appear to have changed noticeably because of loss of functional TIMP-2, which all but dispels the notion of compensatory up-regulation of other TIMPs. Densitometry of reverse zymograms performed on serial dilutions of culture medium from (−/−), (+/−), and (+/+) mice suggested that the residual TIMP-2-type inhibitory activity released by the cells was in the range 100–300-fold (190 ± 90) lower than that of wild type cells. Second, we assessed the loss of function of TIMP-2-type inhibitory activity in a cell-based assay. When attached, HT1080 cells efficiently degrade fibrillar type I collagen by a process that is inhibitable by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1 (Fig. 6 D). Concentrated culture medium from wild type fibroblasts inhibited degradation of the collagen fibril film to a level comparable with that obtained by the addition of purified TIMP-2, whereas similarly concentrated medium from homozygous mutant cells did not (Fig.6 D).Since the induced mutation largely destroyed inhibitory activity against MMP-2, we asked whether the proMMP-2 binding activity, which resides in the intact COOH-terminal part of the molecule, might still be intact (20Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We addressed this question by gelatin-Sepharose affinity isolation of proMMP-2 and any (mutant or wild type) TIMP-2 protein already bound to the proenzyme. Fig.7 shows that products from both alleles were bound to proMMP2. Moreover, comparison of the ratio of mutant and wild type TIMP-2 secreted by heterozygous cells before and after gelatin-Sepharose purification showed that mutant TIMP-2 bound to proMMP2 more or less to the same extent as wild type TIMP-2. Based on densitometry of Western blots, we surmised that the mutant locus on a molar basis yields 5–6-fold less TIMP-2-like protein than the wild type locus in the same cells. These findings suggest that the COOH-terminal domain of the mutant TIMP-2 polypeptide adopts a configuration (perhaps by independent folding) that leaves intact the proMMP-2 binding activity.Figure 7Mutant (Mut.)

Although the mode and effect of binding of TIMPs to activated MMPs is well understood and based on a straightforward paradigm, the highly specific binding of TIMP-2 to the MMP-2 zymogen (and TIMP-1 to the MMP-9 zymogen) is not. Zymogen binding is mediated predominantly or exclusively by the COOH-terminal domain of the inhibitor, whereas inhibitory binding involves the NH2-terminal domain (20Willenbrock F. Crabbe T.

In approximately 85% of Ewing's sarcomas, such translocations give rise to the chimeric geneEWS/FLI. In the resulting fusion protein, the RNA binding domains from the C terminus of EWS are replaced by the DNA-binding domain of the ETS protein FLI-1. EWS/FLI can function as a transcription factor with the same DNA binding specificity as FLI-1. EWS and EWS/FLI can associate with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme as well as with SF1, an essential splicing factor. Here we report that U1C, one of three human U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-specific proteins, interacts in vitro and in vivo with both EWS and EWS/FLI. U1C interacts with other splicing factors and is important in the early stages of spliceosome formation. Importantly, co-expression of U1C represses EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation, demonstrating that this interaction can have functional ramifications. Our findings demonstrate that U1C, a well characterized splicing protein, can also function in transcriptional regulation.

One important consequence of chromosomal translocations is the creation of novel in-frame fusion genes that often involve transcription factors (1Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). In virtually all cases of Ewing's sarcoma, a chromosomal translocation creates a fusion gene between EWS and a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, most commonly FLI-1 (2Delattre O.

EWS, TLS, and TAFII68 comprise a unique family of RNA-binding proteins termed the TET family (TLS/FUS,EWS, TAFII68), which may play a role in multiple nuclear processes. The RNP motifs in these proteins differ structurally from those in other RNA-binding proteins in that they contain an unusually long predicted loop structure following the first α-helix of the domain. This structural feature is limited to TET family members and may allow for unique interactions with RNA (18Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of EWS, TLS, and TAFII68 involved in tumor-derived fusion proteins are all rich in glutamine, serine, and tyrosine and are capable of transcriptional activation (19May W.A.

Both EWS and TAFII68 have been identified in specific populations of the TFIID complex and associate with the human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (18Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). EWS and TLS have also been shown to interact with splicing factors (25Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol.

In addition, TLS is capable of promoting homologous DNA pairing and D-loop formation, essential steps in double-strand DNA break repair through recombination (28Baechtold H. Kuroda M. Sok J. Ron D.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4515-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Perhaps due to loss of this repair activity, TLS knock-out mice show evidence of genetic instability (30Hicks G.G. Singh N. Nashabi A. Mai S. Bozek G. Klewes L. Arapovic D. White E.K. Koury M.J. Oltz E.M. Van Kaer L. Ruley H.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Kuroda M. Sok J.

It is unclear which of the functions associated with the TET family contribute to tumorigenesis in the context of the fusion proteins. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the N-terminal tumor-associated portion of EWS. We identified U1C, one of three U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)1-specific proteins. snRNPs play an essential role in splicing through a large complex known as the spliceosome. All snRNPs are made up of snRNA and associated proteins. They share at least eight common Sm proteins and have specific protein associations as well (32Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The U1 snRNP is composed of an RNA backbone, common Sm proteins, and three U1-specific proteins: U1A, U1C, and U1–70K (33Pettersson I. Hinterberger M. Mimori T. Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5907-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The U1snRNP binds to the 5′ splice site on pre-mRNA to form a stable complex identified as the early or E complex in mammalian splicing extracts (34Michaud S. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). U1A and U1–70K contain RNA-binding domains and interact with naked snRNA on their own (35Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4872-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,36Scherly D. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Dathan N.A. Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4163-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, the binding of U1C to the U1snRNP particle is dependent on protein-protein interactions between U1C and U1–70K as well as U1C and the common Sm proteins (37Nelissen R.L. Will C.L. van Venrooij W.J. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4113-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We show that U1C interacts in vitro and in vivowith EWS and with higher affinity with EWS/FLI. This interaction can cause repression of EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation and may therefore affect EWS/FLI target gene regulation. To generate t-EWS/LexA as bait for the yeast two-hybrid screen, a fragment corresponding to the tumor-associated portion of EWS (t-EWS, amino acids 1–264) was PCR-amplified from HL-60 cDNA and cloned into a modification of the yeast expression vector pSD.08 (38Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) to allow in-frame fusion with the DNA binding domain of LexA (amino acids 2–202). Expression of the fusion protein was under control of the GAL1–10/CYC1 promoter. The plasmid also contained aTRP1+ marker. Absence of PCR mutations was verified by sequence analysis. To create a U1C clone for in vitro transcription and translation, the U1C coding sequence was amplified by PCR from the clone isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen and cloned into pBluescript KS containing a FLAG epitope tag between theBamHI and EcoRI sites as anEcoRI/HindIII fragment. The absence of PCR mutations was confirmed by sequence analysis. To create glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion plasmids, sequences for t-EWS (amino acids 1–264), c-EWS(the C terminus of EWS; amino acids 245–647), wild-type EWSor a type I EWS/FLI fusion (2Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and cloned in frame with the EcoRI site in the pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector. EWS deletion plasmids were also cloned in this way to make pGEX EWS-(1–58), pGEX EWS-(1–120), pGEX EWS-(1–133), pGEX EWS-(1–209), pGEX EWS-(59–184), pGEX EWS-(121–264), pGEX EWS-(184–264), and pGEX EWS-(210–264) (numbers indicate amino acid residues). The absence of PCR mutations was verified for all clones by sequence analysis. To generate epitope-tagged constructs, the mammalian expression vector pCB6+ (a gift from Dr. Frank Rauscher) was modified by the addition of two tandem FLAG or HA epitope tags cloned between the BglII and EcoRI sites. EWS and EWS/FLI were amplified by PCR and cloned in frame with the tags at theEcoRI site. EWS/FLI deletion clonesEF-B, EF-C, and EF-H were made by ligating the EWS portion from pGEX EWS-(1–120), pGEX EWS-(1–133), and pGEX EWS-(210–264), respectively, in frame with the FLAG tag at the 5′-end and the region of FLI from EWS/FLI at the 3′-end. To create clones for the mammalian two-hybrid system, the vectors pCMVbd and pCMVad (Stratagene) were modified by the addition of FLAG or HA epitope tags cloned between the BamHI andEcoRI sites to create pbdFLAG, padFLAG, and padHA. Sequences encoding EWS, EWS/FLI, EWS/FLI-B, EWS/FLI-C, and EWS/FLI-H were excised from pCFLAG and cloned into padFLAG or padHA asEcoRI/HindIII fragments. U1C was excised from pBluescript and cloned into pbdFLAG as anEcoRI/HindIII fragment. The reporter gene plasmid, pFrLuc (Stratagene), contains five tandem Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of a luciferase reporter. To generate tkD2A-luc, an EWS/FLI-responsive luciferase reporter construct, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and its poly(A) sequences were excised from the tkD2A vector (20Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J. Cormier F. Delattre O. Roussel M. Thomas G. Ghysdael J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3230-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), a kind gift from Dr. Jacques Ghysdael, as an MluI/EcoRI fragment. TheEcoRI site was blunted, and the luciferase gene and its poly(A) sequences from the pGL2 promoter vector (Promega) were inserted as an MluI/blunted BamHI fragment. A cDNA library was generated using random-primed cDNA from the Ewing's sarcoma cell line RD-ES (ATCC) that contains an EWS/FLI fusion gene. cDNA was ligated to BstXI adapters and cloned into plasmid pSD10A (a gift from Dr. Steven Dalton) downstream of sequences encoding the activation domain of VP16 (38Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The library plasmid pSD10a also contains URA3 and β-lactamase genes for selection in Saccharomyces cereviseae and Escherichia coli, respectively. The yeast reporter strain S330 (39Dalton S. Hopwood B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5867-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was transformed with the plasmid pt-EWS/LexA to create the strain S330-EL. To identify proteins that interact with t-EWS, S330EL was then transformed by electroporation as described (40Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Colonies were plated onto nylon filters overlaid on medium that contained 2% glucose and was deficient in tryptophan and uracil (trp−ura−). Thirty-six hours later, filters were transferred to trp−ura− medium containing 2% galactose, and colonies were grown on galactose for 12 h. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (38Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To control for the possible background contributed by t-EWS/LexA alone, S330-EL and S330 transformed with VP16/LexA were subjected to X-gal staining in parallel with the library transformants. All positive colonies were picked within 25 min following the addition of X-gal, before background staining in the S330-EL cells appeared. One positive clone was identified as U1C and contained the full-length coding sequence as well as 36 base pairs of 5′-untranslated sequence and 306 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence. The U1C/VP16 plasmid isolated in the library screen was reintroduced into S330 yeast, alone or in combination with 14 different LexA fusion proteins (gifts from Dr. Mark Osborne), to ensure that the intrinsic activation activity of the t-EWS bait did not cause sporadic false positives. U1C/VP16 did not activate transcription of the reporter with any of these negative controls. pGEX, pGEX t-EWS, pGEX c-EWS, pGEX EWS, and pGEX EWS/FLI were transformed into E. coliBL21. Expression of t-EWS, c-EWS, and EWS GST fusion proteins was induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 25 °C. Expression of EWS/FLI GST fusion protein was induced under the same conditions for 5 h. The soluble fraction of these proteins was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equivalent quantities of GST fusion proteins used for pull-down assays were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. In vitro transcribed and translated U1C protein was synthesized using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysates (Promega) and [35S]methionine. Labeled proteins were incubated for 1 h in 300 μl of GST-binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) with 2 μg of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were washed three times with 500 μl of GST binding buffer, and were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4–20% gradient gel followed by autoradiography. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 3 × 105 cells were seeded on six-well plates and were transfected 16–18 h later. All transfections contained 500 ng of pFrLuc reporter (Stratagene), 100 μl of CMVβgal, and 1.7 μg of pCMVad and pCMVbd plasmids to achieve equivalent protein expression. DNA was mixed with 6.2 μl of FuGene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and added to cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed with 20 and 40 μl of cell lysis supernatant using Promega luciferase assay reagent and a Monolight analytical luminometer. β-galactosidase activity was measured by adding 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferone at pH 7.5 to 5 μl of cell extract. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, 200 μl of 500 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.7, was added, and fluorescence was measured with a Fluoroskan fluorometer (adapted from Ref. 41Galjaard H. Genetic Metabolic Disease: Early Diagnosis and Prenatal Analysis. Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V., Amsterdam1980Google Scholar). Luciferase values were normalized with β-galactosidase activity. The average results of at least three experiments are shown. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 4 × 105 cells were seeded on 60-mm plates and were transfected 16–18 h later. Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's recommendations using 5.6 μl of Superfect (Qiagen) and 2.8 μg of total DNA (800 ng of ptkdluc reporter, 400 ng of CMVBgal, and a total of 1.6 μg from combinations of pCFLAG EWS/FLI construct, pCFLAG U1C, or empty vector). Transfections were incubated 3 h at 37 °C. Medium was then aspirated from plates, and 6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h later. Luciferase assays were performed with 20 and 80 μl of cell lysis supernatant, and values were normalized with β-galactosidase activity as described above. The average results of at least three experiments are shown. Cell extracts were sonicated briefly, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Epitope-tagged proteins were detected with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Babco) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml or anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a concentration of 7 μg/ml and visualized with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:5000, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the amino-terminal region of EWS found in several tumor-specific chromosomal translocations. A bait expression vector was constructed by fusing amino acids 1–264 of EWS (t-EWS) in frame with sequences encoding the dimerization and DNA binding domain of the bacterial repressor protein LexA. A cDNA library was generated from a Ewing's sarcoma cell line containing an EWS/FLI fusion to increase the likelihood that essential interacting partners contributing to the transforming ability of the fusion protein would be expressed. The library was cloned into a vector containing the transcriptional activation domain from the herpes simplex virus protein VP-16. Because the region of EWS contained in the bait possesses a strong transcription activation domain, two steps were taken to minimize background activity contributed from the bait alone. First, a yeast reporter strain was chosen that contains six LexA binding sites upstream of the lacZ gene integrated into theura3 locus (39Dalton S. Hopwood B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5867-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This decreased background signals because only a single copy of the reporter is integrated. Second, the level of t-EWS/LexA expression was regulated by a galactose-inducible promoter. If cells were grown on galactose for 24 h or more, little difference could be seen between t-EWS/LexA and VP-16/LexA activity as detected by X-gal staining. However, following 8–10 h of galactose induction, a VP-16/LexA fusion protein produced blue staining within 12–15 min, while the t-EWS/LexA fusion required 3 h to produce the same degree of staining. Protein-protein interactions were detected within 15–25 min after the addition of X-gal. One clone identified in the two-hybrid screen contained the full-length sequence encoding U1C, one of three human U1 snRNP-specific proteins. This clone was further tested to exclude the possibility that it represented a false positive or nonspecific interaction. The U1C/VP16 clone failed to activate the yeast reporter in the absence of t-EWS/LexA and also failed to interact with any of a panel of LexA fusion proteins used to screen for nonspecific interactions. Therefore, the interaction between U1C and t-EWS was specific in yeast. To confirm the interaction of U1C with EWS outside of the yeast system, we tested the in vitro association between these proteins by GST pull-down assays. We fused t-EWS (amino acids 1–264), the C terminus of EWS (amino acids 245–656), EWS/FLI, or wild-type EWS with GST (Fig.1 A) and expressed the resulting chimeric proteins in E. coli BL21. Full-length U1C protein was transcribed and translated in vitro and incubated with each of the chimeric proteins and GST alone. U1C interacted with t-EWS alone or in the context of the full-length EWS protein or EWS/FLI. This interaction was specific, since U1C did not bind to GST alone or to GST fused to the C terminus of EWS containing the RNA binding domains (Fig. 1 B). To further delineate the amino acids in the N terminus of EWS responsible for the interaction with U1C, eight GST fusion proteins comprising deletions of t-EWS were made (Fig.2 A). GST pull-down assays were performed on this series of EWS deletions with in vitrotranslated U1C. U1C was specifically retained on beads coupled with GST-EWS-(1–120), GST-EWS-(1–133), GST-EWS-(1–209), and GST-t-EWS (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the minimal region required for interaction between EWS and U1C comprised amino acids 1–120 in EWS. To demonstrate an intracellular association between EWS or EWS/FLI and U1C, a mammalian two-hybrid system was employed. This system is similar to a yeast two-hybrid system in that it allows detection of protein-protein interactions by activation of reporter gene expression if a functional transcription factor is reconstituted as a result of interaction between two hybrid proteins. We fused full-length EWS or EWS/FLI to the strong transcriptional activation domain of NF-κB (ad-EWS and ad-EWS/FLI), and U1C was fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (bd-U1C). We transfected ad-EWS or ad-EWS/FLI alone or with bd-U1C to assay the ability of the proteins to interact and activate transcription of a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter gene. Equivalent protein expression of EWS, EWS/FLI, and U1C was verified by Western blotting (data not shown). When EWS was expressed with U1C, a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity was seen (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, a 14-fold increase was seen when EWS/FLI was expressed with U1C (Fig.3 A), suggesting that the tumor-associated fusion protein binds U1C with a higher affinity than wild-type EWS. To ensure that this difference was not due to a higher intrinsic activation activity of EWS/FLI as compared with EWS, both proteins were expressed as GAL4 DNA-binding fusion proteins, and luciferase activity was measured. No difference was seen (data not shown), indicating that the higher luciferase activity seen by EWS/FLI with U1C was specific to the interaction. The difference in the strengths of interactions of U1C with EWS and EWS/FLI may not have been reflected in the GST pull-down assay because factors critical to the stronger EWS/FLI interaction may have been limited or absent in the in vitro assay but were available in the environment of the mammalian cells. In addition, although the GST protein was soluble, it is possible that a greater proportion of protein is folded in the correct conformation when synthesized in mammalian cells compared with E. coli. Alternatively, the mammalian two-hybrid assay may simply be a more sensitive assay. To confirm the specificity of these interactions in mammalian cells, EWS deletion constructs were made. EWS deletions B and C (Fig.2 A) contained the region of EWS necessary for interaction as defined in the GST pull-down assay, and EWS deletion H (Fig.2 A) lacked the complete interaction domain. These regions of EWS were cloned as EWS/FLI fusions in the NF-κB activation domain vector and expressed in the mammalian two-hybrid system with U1C as described above. The first 120 or the first 133 amino acids of EWS fused to FLI (EF-B and EF-C) interacted with U1C to a similar degree as full-length EWS/FLI, while minimal or no interaction was seen between U1C and amino acids 210–264 of EWS fused to FLI (EF-H) (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Because there was no substantial difference in interaction between U1C and EF-B or EF-C, we used EF-B, which contained the minimal region necessary for interaction, for subsequent experiments. To determine the functional significance of the interaction between U1C and EWS/FLI, we tested the ability of U1C to affect EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation. An EWS/FLI-responsive reporter gene was cotransfected with EWS/FLI and vector or increasing amounts of U1C. EWS/FLI activated the reporter 9.7-fold over basal levels seen with vector alone. When 400 ng of U1C was added, a 35% repression of this activation was seen. Increasing the amount of U1C to 800 ng increased the repression to 75% (Fig. 4 A). The increased amounts of U1C plasmid in the transfections gave a corresponding increase in U1C protein (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, co-expression of U1C repressed EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. U1C did not specifically repress transactivation of a GAL4-responsive reporter construct by a t-EWS/GAL4 fusion protein (data not shown). Thus, the repression mediated by the U1C-EWS interaction may be dependent upon specific promoter contexts or dependent upon the C-terminal motifs fused to EWS, or it may not have been evident due to the decreased affinity of U1C for EWS compared with EWS/FLI. To confirm that the repression effect of U1C on EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation is dependent on its binding to the N terminus of EWS, equivalent amounts of the deletion constructs EWS/FLI-B and EWS/FLI-H were transfected in place of full-length EWS/FLI. Both deletion constructs were still capable of activating transcription of the reporter (Fig. 4 C). U1C repressed activation of EWS/FLI-B by 77%, showing a specific interaction with the minimal interacting domain of EWS, whereas no significant repression was seen with EWS/FLI-H (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the interaction domain of EWS is necessary for U1C-mediated repression. The recurrent combination of t-EWS with DNA binding motifs via chromosomal translocations in multiple human tumors indicates an important role for this domain. We hypothesized that the N-terminal domain of EWS may contribute unique properties to the chimeric proteins through interactions with other cellular proteins. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with this tumor-associated portion of EWS to identify cellular pathways that may be altered in the tumors. In this report, we showed that t-EWS in the context of EWS and EWS/FLI interacts with the splicing protein U1C. Additionally, the essential splicing factor SF1, also termed ZFM1 (42Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar), was identified in our yeast two-hybrid screen (data not shown) and in a previously published study as an EWS-interacting protein (25Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These interactions suggest that EWS and perhaps the EWS/FLI fusion protein may play a role in splicing. Several additional lines of evidence implicate EWS and the related protein TLS in splicing. TLS and EWS have both been co-immunoprecipitated with the heterologous nuclear proteins hnRNPA1 and hnRNPC1/C2 (21Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which also participate in splicing (43Choi Y.D. Grabowski P.J. Sharp P.A. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1986; 231: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 44Yang X. Bani M.R. Lu S.J. Rowan S. Ben-David Y. Chabot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Further, TLS can interact with TASR, a member of the SR domain-containing family of splicing proteins (26Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). TLS can also modulate 5′ splice site selection (27Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The role of U1C and SF1 in splicing is well established. These two splicing factors are involved in early stages of spliceosome formation. The U1 snRNP is required for the formation of complex E of the spliceosome, the earliest stage of spliceosome assembly, which commits the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. The U1snRNP complex binds to the 5′ splice site, and the U1C protein appears to potentiate the base pairing between the U1 snRNA and the 5′ splice site (45Heinrichs V. Bach M. Winkelmann G. Luhrmann R. Science. 1990; 247: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SF1 as well as several other protein components and ATP are required for the formation of the next step in spliceosome assembly, the presplicing complex A (42Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA. 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that U1C binds to EWS in mammalian cells and can bind to EWS/FLI with higher affinity than to wild-type EWS (Fig.3 A). Differential interactions between EWS and EWS/FLI have also been observed with TFIID components (24Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 46Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Taken together, the selectivity of these interactions suggests that the folding or accessibility of t-EWS is somewhat dependent upon the C terminus of the protein. Thus, the regulation of this domain in chimeric fusion proteins found in tumors may be modulated by a subset of EWS-interacting proteins. Furthermore, EWS/FLI could potentially interfere with normal interactions of EWS with the splicing and transcriptional machinery by binding interacting partners more strongly. Our results also show that U1C is able to repress EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation (Fig. 4 A). This functional effect is dose-dependent and requires the region of EWS that interacts with U1C. Like U1C, SF1 was also a specific repressor of EWS-mediated transactivation (25Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As expected, EWS/FLI, a strong transcriptional activator, increases expression of some downstream genes including stromelysin and Manic Fringe (47Braun B.S. Frieden R. Lessnick S.L. May W.A. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4623-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 48May W.A. Arvand A. Thompson A.D. Braun B.S. Wright M. Denny C.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EWS/FLI can repress the transcription of the transforming growth factor-β type II receptor, leading to decreased sensitivity to transforming growth factor-β in cells expressing the fusion protein (49Hahm K.B. Cho K. Lee C. Im Y.H. Chang J. Choi S.G. Sorensen P. Thiele C.J. Kim S.-J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Because target genes may be activated or repressed by EWS/FLI, the U1C-mediated repression could enhance or suppress the transforming activity of the fusion protein. Creation of a functional transcription factor through chromosomal translocations is an invariant theme among EWS, TLS, and TAFII68 fusion proteins generated in human solid tumors; therefore, it is likely that aberrant gene regulation plays an important role in tumorigenesis. However, while EWS/FLI is a strong transcriptional activator, deletions within the EWS domain that significantly decrease the transactivation potential of the fusion protein cause only a moderate decrease in transforming activity (50Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar). The region of EWS contributing the greatest transforming activity is included in the region required for interaction with U1C. In addition, an EWS/FLI mutant that can no longer bind DNA is still transforming (51Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that the fusion proteins may perform other roles in addition to deregulated transcription. Thus, the transcriptional activation and cellular transformation functions of EWS are not entirely concordant. Accordingly, the effect of interaction with U1C on transformation may not be solely determined by modulation of EWS/FLI-mediated transactivation and may also include alterations in splicing regulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the processes of RNA transcription and processing are closely coupled in vivo. In fact, the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is required for efficient capping, cleavage at the polyadenylation site, and splicing of mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 52Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The sequence of the t-EWS domain consists of a series of degenerate repeats that show similarity to the repeats of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (2Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Indeed, t-EWS can function as a transcription activation domain, and it has also been shown to interact directly with components of TFIID and the RNA polymerase II complex (24Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 46Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interaction between t-EWS and the splicing machinery further extends the functional similarities between EWS and the carboxyl-terminal domain. The identification of these protein-protein interactions and their physiological relevance may be critical in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Ewing's sarcoma and multiple other tumor types containing EWS, TLS, and TAFII68 fusion proteins. Emerging data suggest that disruption of RNA splicing may be a novel pathway that contributes to tumorigenesis. For example, changes in expression patterns of splicing factors as well as alterations in alternative splicing increased with tumor progression in a mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis (53Stickeler E. Kittrell F. Medina D. Berget S.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3574-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, changes in expression patterns of splicing factors have been identified in some human colon adenocarcinomas (54Ghigna C. Moroni M. Porta C. Riva S. Biamonti G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5818-5824PubMed Google Scholar), and alternatively spliced forms of important cell cycle regulators, such as p53 and cyclin D1, have been found in human cancer cell lines and tumors (55Chow V.T. Quek H.H. Tock E.P. Cancer Lett. 1993; 73: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 56Hosokawa Y. Gadd M. Smith A.P. Koerner F.C. Schmidt E.V. Arnold A. Cancer Lett. 1997; 113: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interaction of t-EWS with splicing factors as well as basal transcription factors strongly suggests that the fusion of EWS, or the related proteins TLS and TAFII68, to different DNA binding domains may provide an efficient mechanism for the tumor cell to subvert normal regulation of transcription and post-transcriptional processing.

NBCn1 is an electroneutral Na+/HCO3−cotransporter that is partially blocked by DIDS (14Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (abstr.): 400Google Scholar).

It is presently unclear whether these clones arise from separate genes or are splicing isoforms. Of the NBC clones reported, none are Cl−-dependent or transport Cl−.

We identified a Drosophilaexpressed sequence tag (AA567741, deposited by the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project) with similarity to both the AEs and NBCs. We obtained this Drosophila clone (Research Genetics, St. Louis, MO) and sequenced it (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, New Haven, CT). This 3225-base pair clone has an initial Met followed by a 3090-base pair open reading frame and a 3′-UTR (104 bp). We directionally subcloned the cDNA into a Xenopus expression plasmid as previously (2Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J.

Linearized cDNA was used to make capped cRNA with the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (2Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J.

The full cDNA sequence of Drosophila NDAE1 is GenBankTM accession number AF047468. We isolated poly(A)+ RNA from Drosophila developmental stages and body segments as described previously (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We used 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from these stages for denaturing electrophoresis and electroblotting. The NDAE1-cDNA was random primed and 32P-labeled. Hybridization overnight at 60 °C in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) followed by low stringency washing (42 °C with 2× SSC) did not result in discrete hybridization. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript RT kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.) with Drosophila poly(A)+ RNA. UsingDrosophila NDAE1-specific primers, ExTaqpolymerase (Panvera, Madison, WI), and dNTPs, we performed PCR with 30 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (45 s). Products were verified with a 0.65% agarose/Tris borate EDTA gel. The gel was Southern blotted onto Zeta-probe (Bio-Rad) and detected using random-primed, digoxigenin-labeled NDAE1 cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Detection of digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe was performed using DIG Luminescent Detection (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), recorded on x-ray film, and digitized using Adobe PhotoShop (Fig.2 a). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal method and the PAM250 residue weight table (DNA Star program, Lasergene, Madison, WI) with the percentage divergence and similarity calculated as previously reported (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and the alignment shaded and annotated using GeneDoc©. To determine NDAE1 mRNA cellular distribution in Drosophila, we made whole mounts of 0–24 hDrosophila embryos. To make antisense cRNA, the completeDrosophila NDAE1 was directionally cloned into pSport 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at EcoRI and SalI. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense NDAE1-cRNA was synthesized using the SP6 promoter and mMessage mMachine (Ambion) as described above and reduced to a mean size of ∼200 bp by alkaline hydrolysis (16Cox K.H. DeLeon D.V. Angerer L.M. Angerer R.C. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Embryos were permeabilized using proteinase K treatment. Digoxigenin label was visualized using an anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (17Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Embryo staining was documented on slide film and subsequently digitized. Hybridization was determined specific if (i) NDAE1 staining was evident in discrete cells making DNA hybridization unlikely and (ii) staining with a sense RNA probe was negative. Chromosomes were prepared and hybridized by standard methods (18Pardue M.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 333-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled probes were generated by random hexamer-priming with Biotin-HighPrime®(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the entire NDAE1-cDNA (i.e. the EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the pSport 2 construct), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-biotin antibodies were used for detection. The CO2/HCO3−-free ND96 contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 and 195–200 mosm). In CO2/HCO3−-equilibrated solutions, 10 mm NaHCO3 replaced 10 mm NaCl and was maintained by continuous bubbling with 1.5% CO2/98.5% O2. In O-Na+ solutions, choline replaced Na+. In O-Cl− solutions, gluconate replaced Cl−. Non- HCO3− solutions were bubbled with 100% O2 to remove trace CO2 and HCO3−. 50 nl of water (control) or RNA solution (35 ng of NDAE-cRNA) was injected into stage V/VIXenopus oocytes. Voltage electrodes, made from fiber-capillary borosilicate and filled with 3M KCl, had resistances of 1–10 MΩ (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Ion-selective electrodes (pH, Cl−, and Na+) were pulled similarly and silanized withbis-(dimethylamino)-dimethylsilane (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). pH electrodes tips were filled with hydrogen ionophore 1 mixture B (Fluka) and backfilled with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cl− electrode tips were filled with a Cl− ionophore (Corning, Corning, NY) and backfilled with 0.5 m NaCl; Na+ electrode tips were filled with sodium ionophore 1 mixture B (Fluka) and backfilled with 0.15m NaCl. Electrodes were connected to a high impedance electrometer (WPI-FD223 for intracellular pH (pHi), intracellular Cl− activity (aCli), or intracellular Na+ activity (aNai) and Vm experiments), and digitized output data were acquired by computer. All ion-selective microelectrodes had slopes of −54 to −57 mV/decade ion concentration (or activity). pH electrodes were calibrated at pH 6.0 and 8.0; Cl− and Na+electrodes were calibrated with unbuffered 10 and 100 mmNaCl (ionic strength was not identical). Selectivity of Cl− was checked using unbuffered 100 mmNaHCO3 and for Na+ using 100 mmKCl. Na+ electrodes were greater than 50-fold selective for Na+ (19Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Cl− electrodes were at least 10-fold selective versus HCO3−. For voltage-clamp experiments (Warner Inst. Co., Oocyte Clamp), electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl/agar and 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.2–0.5 MΩ. Oocytes were clamped to −60 mV and stepped from −160 to +60 mV in 20 mV steps; the resulting data were filtered at 5 kHz (8 pole Bessel filter, Frequency Devices) and sampled at 1 kHz as previously reported (19Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were acquired and analyzed using Pulse and PulseFit (HEKA Instruments, Germany). Values quantitated are indicated as the mean ± S.E. Ion activities between control and NDAE1 oocytes were shown by a two-tailed t test to have a significance of p < 0.016 or less. DNA sequencing of our clone revealed a single, long open reading frame flanked by 5′- and 3′-UTRs (UTRs, 426 and 104 bp, respectively). This Drosophila cDNA encodes a 1030-amino acid membrane protein with both sequence homology and predicted topology similar to both the AEs and NBCs. The predicted protein is 43% similar to the cloned NBCs and 32% similar to the AEs (Fig.1, a and b). Although the NDAE1 hydropathy plot (Fig. 1 b) is similar to those of the BTS members, it is most similar to the AEs. A dendrogram of the published BTS sequences (Fig. 1 c) implies that NDAE1 forms a new branch of this superfamily. Our NDAE1 topology model (Fig.1 d) predicts (i) intracellular NH2 and COOH termini, (ii) 12 transmembrane spans (TMs), (iii) a central exofacial loop with putative N-glycosylation sites, and (iv) multiple putative phosphorylation sites. Recently the complete sequence of the Drosophila genome was reported (20Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). Although a predicted gene product “CG4675” in two forms (AAF52496, alt 1 and 2 for proteins and AE003616 for the assembled genomic contig) encoding the ndae1 gene was identified, the sequence analysis is not completely accurate. The predicted protein sequences are missing thirteen NH2-terminal amino acids (MAEKNEYIELPWT) partly encoded from an additional 5′-intron. CG4675-alt 2 contains a 69-amino acid insertion (amino acids 32–100 of the NH2-truncated protein), which we have not found present in DrosophilamRNA. A second Drosophila gene and protein have homology to the BTS family (CG8177). Using a pileup analysis, gene product CG8177 (GenBankTM accession number AAF50207) is about 32% identical to NDAE1 and the NBCs, but about 34–40% identical to the AEs. Though CG8177 apparently encodes a HCO3− transporter protein, future transport experiments will be needed to determine the actual function. Next, we determined the location of NDAE1 mRNA in Drosophila. Using Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA, we were unable to detect NDAE1 mRNA in embryos, isolated adult heads, or body parts. However, by RT-PCR we could detect NDAE1 mRNA in heads as well as several embryonic stages (Fig.2 a). In situhybridization to NDAE1 mRNA in whole mount Drosophilaembryos (Fig. 2, b and c) illustrates that NDAE1 is present during embryogenesis. CNS staining is apparent throughout embryogenesis (Fig. 2, b and c). Staining of the gut primordium and mesoderm is evident in stage 6/7 (Fig.2 b). Staining of a specific subset of cells in the CNS is detectable by late embryogenesis (Fig. 2 c) as is staining of the anal plate (not shown), i.e. the larval absorptive apparatus. The NDAE1-sense strand controls did not stain (Fig. 2,d and e). The difference between RT-PCR andin situ hybridization verses Northern detection of NDAE1 mRNA likely reflects sensitivity by amplification or individual cell mRNA abundance of the two former techniques. To evaluate the physiologic function of NDAE1, we expressed it inXenopus oocytes. Fig. 3 is a model illustrating ion transport attributed to Na+-dependent Cl-HCO3 exchange activity. We tested this model with oocytes expressing NDAE1. Fig.4 a shows that removal and replacement of bath Na+, Cl−, or both, with and without HCO3− does not alter pHiof a water-injected control cell. However, expression of NDAE1 elevates resting pHi by ∼0.3 pH units (Fig. 4 b),i.e. control = 7.27 ± 0.03 (n = 9) and NDAE1 = 7.54 ± 0.03 (n = 18). The acidification elicited by CO2/HCO3−(Fig. 4 a) is markedly reduced in NDAE1 oocytes (Fig.4 b) and greatly increases intracellular [HCO3−] 3[HCO3−] is calculated using the pHi obtained just before CO2, steady-state pHi in the presence of CO2/HCO3−, and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (19Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar).(control = 3.1 ± 0.2 mm, n = 9; NDAE1 = 7.4 ± 0.4 mm, n = 16). The higher resting pHi and elevated [HCO3−] are consistent with NDAE1's role as an acid extruder, “forward” transport in Fig. 3 a. Bath Na+ removal elicits a robust pHi decrease illustrating that NDAE1 is readily reversible (Fig. 3 b). Subsequent removal of Cl− stops and slightly reverses the acidification, whereas readdition of Na+ in the sustained absence of Cl− triggers a rapid pHi recovery (Fig. 4 b). A similar response is completely blocked by 200 μm DIDS (Fig. 4 g). Our results indicate that NDAE1 is indeed functionally unique in the BTS. These pHichanges are consistent with Na+ and HCO3− cotransport in exchange for Cl− and H+ as observed in snail neurons (7Thomas R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 273: 317-338Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and squid axons (6Russell J.M. Boron W.F. Nature. 1976; 264: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Figure 4Physiology of NDAE1 expressed inXenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water or cRNA in water. a, c, and e are water-injected control oocytes. b, d,f–i are injected with 35 ng/oocyte of NDAE1 cRNA. All solutions are pH 7.5, and all HCO3−solutions are 1.5% CO2/10 mm HCO3−.

The oocyte was exposed twice to CO2/HCO3−, first without DIDS (not shown) and second with 200 μm DIDS. Exposure to DIDS appears to completely block NDAE1 activity, resulting in a response similar to control oocytes. h, DIDS inhibition of NDAE1-mediated aCli changes, second pulse shown.i, using a double CO2/HCO3− protocol as ing, DIDS also blocks the aNai changes. The hatched bar at the bottom right corner represents 10 min for that experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further tested our transport model (Fig. 3) by measuringaCli. Fig. 4 c shows that a control oocyte has ∼31 mm aCli (37.0 ± 1.6 mm, n = 9), which only slightly changes with ion replacement ± CO2/HCO3−. Fig. 4 dillustrates that an oocyte expressing the NDAE1 transporter has ∼22 mm aCli (29.5 ± 2.1 mm, n = 6). NDAE1 oocytes show both rapid and robust responses to ion replacement and addition of CO2/HCO3−, i.e. changes of 3–8 mm activity (Fig. 4 d). CO2/HCO3− supplied to the bath decreases aCli, and Na+ removal reverses this response. With both Na+ and Cl−removed aCli change stops, but readdition of Na+ elicits a large and rapid fall inaCli. The removal of bath CO2/HCO3− bringsaCli back to resting levels (Fig.4 d). These alterations of aCli are also blocked by 200 μm DIDS (Fig. 4 h). Moreover, the beginning of Fig. 4 d illustrates that HCO3− is not required for ionic movements through the transporter (solutions bubbled with 100% O2). This physiologic characteristic is reminiscent of the multiple transported anions (e.g. OH−, Br−, I−), and HCO3− stimulated activity of the AEs. To discriminate between Na+ dependence (“binding”)versus Na+ driven (transport), we measured the effect of NDAE1 function on aNai of oocytes. Fig. 4, e and f shows representative traces from control and NDAE1 oocyte experiments, respectively, using similar solution protocols as in Fig. 4, a–d. A control oocyte (Fig. 4 e) has ∼2.6 mm aNai (3.1 ± 0.5 mm,n = 10), which does not change with bath ion substitutions. Fig. 4 f shows that aNai is increased to ∼5 mm in NDAE1-expressing oocytes (4.6 ± 0.3 mm, n = 10). Na+ is transported by NDAE1 as evidenced by (i) increased aNai with the addition of CO2/HCO3−, (ii) reduced aNai with Na+ removal, and (iii) increased aNai with Cl−removal. Na+ transport via NDAE1 is blocked by 200 μm DIDS (Fig. 4 i). Changes ofaNai are always in the opposite direction asaCli changes indicating a Na+ for Cl− exchange. As shown for both the pHi andaCli responses, Na+ transport was also observed in the complete absence of HCO3−(not shown). Thus, our data indicate that this DrosophilaNa+-dependent Cl-HCO3 exchanger is more appropriately named a Na+-driven anion exchanger or NDAE1. We noted that Cl− removal or the addition of HCO3− resulted in significant depolarizations only in NDAE1 oocytes (Fig. 4 b). Therefore, we voltage-clamped and used anion transport inhibitors (DIDS, diphenylamine carboxylic acid, and niflumic acid) to evaluate the electrical nature of NDAE1 (Fig. 5). In a voltage-clamped oocyte, this depolarization is measured as an inward (negative) current. A comparison of water-injected control (Fig.5 a) and NDAE1 oocytes (Fig. 5 b) illustrates that both Cl− removal and HCO3− addition elicit current specific to NDAE1 expression. The reversal potential of both control (Fig. 5 c) and NDAE1 oocytes (Fig.5 d) is about −20 mV. In the absence of Cl−, there is also a HCO3−-stimulated current only in NDAE1 oocytes (Fig. 5 b). This current has a linear voltage dependence (Fig. 5 d). DIDS, diphenylamine carboxylic acid, and niflumic acid block the depolarization (unclamped cell) because of Cl− removal (Fig. 5 e). However, the measured currents in NDAE1 oocytes are small compared with the pHi,aCli, and aNai changes. The voltage deflections and associated currents are either endogenous to the oocyte uncovered by NDAE1 activity or more likely a “leak” current through the NDAE1 transporter. Present data imply that the NDAE1 current represents a leak current rather than NDAE1 being “electrogenic”: (i) the J(ion)/J(current) ratio 4The J(ion) was calculated from the initial rate of ionic change elicited by Cl− removal and the volume to surface area ratio of the oocyte ([diameter/2]/3). Similarly, J(current) was calculated from the current in 0 Cl− at −20 mV, i.e. the voltage obtained in unclamped oocytes with Cl− removal and SA/V. The resulting values was divided by the Faraday constant to yield a true flux, J(current).for Cl−, HCO3−, and Na+is > 1000; and (ii) the pHi changes are two to three times greater for NDAE1 than rkNBC, whereas the transport currents are at least 10-fold smaller (30 nA versus 300–500 nA, respectively) (19Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transporter currents (or voltage changes) would not have been detectable in snail neurons (7Thomas R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 273: 317-338Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or squid axons (6Russell J.M. Boron W.F. Nature. 1976; 264: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To begin investigating the role of NDAE1 in vivo, we searched the Berkeley Drosophila genome Project (BDGP) data base with the NDAE1 sequence and identified a P element insertion mutation in the vicinity of ndae1. This insertion lies 408 bases 5′ of the predicted NDAE1 initiation codon (Fig.6 a). By RT-PCR we determined that the insertion site of this P element mutation lies within the NDAE1 5′-untranslated sequence, using wild type poly(A)+RNA and primers that flank the site of insertion (Fig. 6 b). These data suggest that this P element disrupts ndae1. Because this P element insertion was isolated in a screen for lethal P element-induced mutations (12Torok T. Tick G. Alvarado M. Kiss I. Genetics. 1993; 135: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Roch F. Serras F. Cifuentes F.J. Corominas M. Alsina B. Amoros M. Lopez-Varea A. Hernandez R. Guerra D. Cavicchi S. Baguna J. Garcia-Bellido A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 103-112PubMed Google Scholar), our data further suggest thatndae1 may be essential for viability. Detailed phenotypic and physiological analysis of this mutant will be presented elsewhere. Expression of NDAE1 in Xenopus oocytes shows all the physiologic properties of the Na+ dependent Cl-HCO3 exchanger: Cl− transport, Na+ transport, Na+/HCO3−cotransport (or Na+-H+ exchange), and sensitivity to DIDS. NDAE1 does not require HCO3−and appears to be a more general anion exchanger. Our data indicate that NDAE1 exchanges Na+ and HCO3−(or an anion) for Cl− and H+ (Fig. 3). Thus based on our functional studies, it is likely that NDAE1 is theDrosophila form of the Na+-dependent Cl−-HCO3− exchanger functionally identified in neurons, fibroblasts, mesangial cells, and renal tubule cells. Physiologically, the activity of the Na+-dependent Cl−- HCO3− exchanger appears to be regulated. In mesangial cells, agents such as angiotensin II, serotonin, and vasopressin, which act locally as growth factors (23Ganz M.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F576-F585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, stimulate ion transport activity including Na+-dependent Cl−-HCO3− exchange (10Ganz M.B. Boyarsky G. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Nature. 1989; 337: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recently, Na+-dependent Cl−-HCO3− exchange activity was shown to increase during normal renal development (24Ganz M.B. Saksa B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F550-F555PubMed Google Scholar). And, in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, Kaplan and Boron (11Kaplan D.L. Boron W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4116-4124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that transformation with c-Ha-ras not only increased the activity of the Na+-dependent Cl−-HCO3− exchanger but also shifted activation to more alkaline pH values, effectively removing pHi as the transporter control mechanism. Moreover, some studies postulate that mis- or deregulation of stilbene-sensitive HCO3− transport (25Lee A.H. Tannock I.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1901-1908PubMed Google Scholar) or Na+-H+ exchange (26Rotin D. Steele-Norwood D. Grinstein S. Tannock I. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar) is involved in neoplasia. We postulate that future NDAE1 studies will elucidate the mechanisms for these regulatory observations. As the first cloned Na+ and Cl−-coupled HCO3− transporter, NDAE1 may assist the molecular identification of still other cation- and anion-coupled HCO3− transporters. The identification of NDAE1 in Drosophila presents the opportunity to use genetic analysis and manipulation to further understand NDAE1 function and importance in vivo. Because disruption of the NDAE1 gene and loss of the protein is apparently lethal (12Torok T. Tick G. Alvarado M. Kiss I. Genetics. 1993; 135: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NDAE1 is likely an important developmental protein. Cloning of mammalian NDAE1 homologs will provide novel insights to normal and pathologic roles they play in the CNS, circulatory system, digestive tract, respiratory tract (27Cassel D. Scharf O. Rotman M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Katz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6122-6127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and urinary system. In the visual system, determining the localization of the NDAE1 may increase our understanding of fluid and ion transport by the ciliary body (28Butler G.A. Chen M. Stegman Z. Wolosin J.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the lens (29Duncan G. Dart C. Croghan P.C. Gandolfi S.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (e.g. glaucoma) or neuronal transmission in the retina. In the kidney, understanding NDAE1 function may provide insights into disorders of excessive Na+ retention (e.g. hypertension) or impaired HCO3− reclamation (e.g. renal tubular acidosis). In the CNS elucidating NDAE1 function may lead to an understanding of how the Na+ driven Cl−-HCO3− exchanger modulates neuronal activity by altering pHi, pHo, andaCli (e.g. seizure disorders). NDAE1 is also likely an important acid-base homeostatic regulator for insects, particularly for the gut. Based on our in situhybridization, NDAE1 mRNA is present in the developing gut. The NDAE1 mRNA and the protein are likely to persist in the adult organism. The midguts of mosquito larvae (30Dadd R.H. J. Insect Physiol. 1975; 21: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and lepidopteran larvae (31Dow J.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 355-375PubMed Google Scholar) are known to be extremely alkaline, i.e. pH 8–12. At least in mosquito larvae, this alkalinity is in part mediated by removal of H+ by a V-type ATPase (32Zhuang Z. Linser P.J. Harvey W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 2449-2460PubMed Google Scholar) presumably working in concert with a yet unknown base secretory mechanism. Depending on the cellular location, an insect anion exchanger, e.g. NDAE1, could be involved in secretion of either acid or alkali, as in the α- and β-cells of the mammalian cortical collecting duct. In insect species with alkaline proximal guts, the distal gut is responsible for returning the food stream to a neutral or acidic pH (33Moffett D.F. Physiol. Zool. 1994; 67: 68-81Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that NDAE1 could have a more widespread role in insect acid-base balance. From the current data, we hypothesize that NDAE1 may aid in maintaining the high gut pH of Drosophila and potentially mosquitoes. The gut and salivary gland pH of mosquitoes, in particular, is a factor contributing to transmission of disease such as encephalitis and malaria. That is, acidic environments (pH < 7) appear to promote cellular infection (34Hacker J.K. Hardy J.L. Virology. 1997; 235: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The high pH of the gut likely protects the vector organism. Infectivity of Plasmodium berghei, present in mice, to mosquitoes is reduced with low pH and low blood HCO3− of the mice (35Butcher G.A. Sinden R.E. Billker O. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A corollary hypothesis is that the mosquitoes' ability to spread disease could be controlled by altering the transport activity of NDAE1. With the cloning of NDAE1 these questions may now be addressed at the genetic, molecular, and physiologic levels. We thank Marilyn McHugh and Dr. Ester P. Jane for technical assistance.

A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), the partial deglucosylation of asparagine-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 induces cotranslational physical interaction between glycoproteins and members of a small family of lectins, each of which recognizes the monoglucosylated glycan as ligand (2Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the complex coincides with the removal of glucose by glucosidase II (5Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In the absence of conformational maturation, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGTR) functions as a folding sensor (6Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that recognizes structural determinants common to nonnative glycoprotein structure (7Sousa M. Parodi A.J.

Reglucosylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides induces the reassembly of folding intermediates with calnexin (4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). As such, reversible glucosylation hinders premature exit from the ER (2Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar,4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) until correctly folded molecules that are no longer substrates for UGTR are released from the lectin-mediated retention cycle (4Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). As a rule, failure to attain conformational maturation following biosynthesis results in the selective elimination of misfolded polypeptides and unassembled protein complexes by a relatively stringent mechanism of conformation-based quality control (10Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 11Ellgard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Molecular characterization of primary and secondary disposal systems, plus the identification of the full repertoire of quality control machinery, is currently under intense investigation (for a review, see Ref. 11Ellgard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Because the efficiency of modification by UGTR and glucosidase II is sensitive to the number of mannose units within the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide (6Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that oligosaccharide processing represents the meeting point between protein folding and quality control pathways. For this reason, recent work has focused toward elucidating the potential role of processing mannosidases in glycoprotein quality control (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp.

In addition to its fundamental importance in normal cell physiology (16Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), the process of quality control in the early secretory pathway has been implicated as a key factor in the molecular pathogenesis associated with several human disorders (17Thomas P.J. Qu B.-H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 18Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 162-165Google Scholar). To this end, a major physiologic role for the monomeric secretory glycoprotein α1-antitrypsin (AAT) is to prevent the destruction of lung elastin. The hindered secretion and disposal of allelic variants from liver hepatocytes, the predominant site of biosynthesis (19Carlson J.A. Rogers B.B. Sifers R.N. Hawkins H.K. Finegold M.J. Woo S.L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), can lead to plasma AAT deficiency. A severe deficiency of the plasma protein is known to function as a heritable risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive lung disease (for reviews, see Refs.20Sifers R.N. Shen R.-F. Woo S.L.C. Mol. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar and 21Sifers R.N. Finegold M.J. Woo S.L.C. Semin. Liver Dis. 1992; 12: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gene expression studies performed in stably transfected murine hepatoma cells have allowed for the characterization of AAT quality control mechanisms in a physiologically relevant model system (9Liu Y.

Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) precludes conformational maturation following biosynthesis, resulting in its lectin-mediated intracellular retention prior to disposal (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently, we (26Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) proposed a model of quality control in which the removal of a single terminal α1,2-linked mannose unit from multiple asparagine-linked oligosaccharides abrogates the physical dissociation of null(Hong Kong) from the ER lectin calnexin (27Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), leading to its selective degradation by the cytosolic proteasome (28Rivett J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In this process of “molecular capture,” the attenuated removal of glucose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides functions as the underlying mechanism by which the misfolded glycoprotein is selected for degradation. In the present study, stably transfected hepatoma cells were used for the molecular characterization of the conformation-based quality control of variant PI Z, the most common severe deficiency variant of human AAT (29Brantly M. Nukiwa Y. Crystal R.G. Am. J. Med. 1989; 84: 13-31Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A single amino acid substitution at the base of the reactive center loop (12McCracken A.A. Karpichev I.V. Ernaga J.E. Werner E.D. Dillin A.G. Courchesne W.E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) favors inappropriate polymerization (31Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) of a late folding intermediate (32Yu M.-H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), hindering its secretion from liver hepatocytes. The structural anomaly has been detected by velocity sedimentation (24Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q-Q. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fluorescence-based and ultrastructural analyses (31Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), and transverse urea gradient gels following in vitrorefolding (32Yu M.-H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Enhanced secretion of recombinant PI Z bearing site-directed mutations predicted to impede loop-sheet polymerization (33Sidhar S.K. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Foreman R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 8393-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has confirmed that the structural anomaly plays a predominant role in the intracellular transport defect. The intracellular accumulation of an insoluble fraction of PI Z polymers is responsible, in part, for a heritable form of liver cirrhosis (21Sifers R.N. Finegold M.J. Woo S.L.C. Semin. Liver Dis. 1992; 12: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a hindered rate of disposal has been linked to this phenotype (34Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular characterization of PI Z quality control may lead to the development of therapeutic interventions to alleviate the severity of the lung and liver disease. Here we demonstrate that the selective elimination of variant PI Z is accomplished by a nonproteasomal mechanism that is cytosol-independent but sensitive to general inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatase activity. The results of glycosidase inhibitor studies plus coimmunoprecipitation analyses indicate that the combined processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by ER mannosidases I and II (35Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Hersovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) partitions variant PI Z away from the conventional proteasome-mediated disposal mechanism by preventing posttranslational assembly with calnexin. These data implicate ER mannosidase II as a component of glycoprotein quality control and identify a natural molecular strategy to partition variant PI Z away from the conventional proteasome-mediated disposal pathway. Glycosidase inhibitors were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All phosphatase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors, except for lactacystin, were purchased from Calbiochem. Lactacystin was purchased from the E. J. Corey laboratory (Harvard Medical School). All routine buffers and salts were procured from Sigma. Previously established mouse hepatoma cells stably transfected with human genomic DNA encoding human AAT variants (cell lines H1A/M-15, H1A/N13, and H1A/Z8) were used in these analyses (22Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J. Muensch H. Woo S.L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 23Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected clones that exhibited the highest rate of AAT biosynthesis relative to endogenous murine albumin were chosen to mimic the authentic in vivo conditions of hepatocytes. Monolayers of semiconfluent cells were pulse-radiolabeled for 15 min at 37 °C in methionine-free medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) containing [35S]methionine (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (NEN Life Science Products) and then chased in methionine-free medium for up to 3 h. Cells were lysed with buffered Nonidet P-40 detergent (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) either immediately following the pulse or at the specified time point during the chase. Experiments involving kifunensine, swainsonine, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, castanospermine, and lactacystin included a 1-h preincubation period prior to pulse radiolabeling. Unless stated otherwise, all other inhibitors were added to cells at the onset of the chase period. Pervanadate was generated from sodium orthovanadate prior to use, as described previously (36Miller S.C. Furniss M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32618-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Steady-state radiolabeling of cells with [35S]methionine was performed as described previously (37Graham K.S., Le Anhquyen Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20463-20468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated by a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with an excess of specific polyclonal antiserum against human AAT (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or murine albumin (Bethyl Laboratories) immobilized to protein G-agarose (Calbiochem) (25Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorographic enhancement of vacuum-dried gels. Quantitation of radiolabel was performed by scintillation counting of excised gel slices (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Le A. Steiner J.L. Ferrell G.A. Shaker J.C. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of insoluble radiolabeled PI Z in pulse-chase experiments, the insoluble pellet resulting from the centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) of the Nonidet P-40 cell lysate was agitated with 1% lithium dodecylsulfate for 10 min. (37Graham K.S., Le Anhquyen Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20463-20468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prior to immunoprecipitation of the released protein and detection by fluorography. Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane was performed at isotonic conditions as described for human hepatoma cells (38Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of pulse-radiolabeled cells in semiconfluent 100-mm diameter dishes were washed at 25 °C with CSK buffer (0.3m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) and then incubated for 5 min at that same temperature with 3 ml of CSK buffer containing 0.050 mg/ml digitonin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The optimal concentration of digitonin needed to efficiently permeabilize >98% of cells was determined by Trypan blue exclusion (39Choudhury P. Liu Y. Bick R.J. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13446-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by the loss of the immunoreactive 20 S proteasome α-subunit. Digitonized cells were washed three times at 25 °C with CSK buffer prior to the initiation of a 3-h incubation at 37 °C in CSK buffer. Following each experiment, AAT was immunoprecipitated from the incubation buffer and the Nonidet P-40 lysate derived from the permeabilized cells, as described for intact cells. Aliquots of the buffered Nonidet P-40 cell lysate or media were subjected to velocity sedimentation in linear 5–20% sucrose gradients in a manner that was identical to that described previously (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q-Q. Sifers R.N. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variant PI Z was immunoprecipitated from individual gradient fractions, as described above, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE, detected by fluorography, and quantitated by scintillation counting of excised gel pieces. After the electrophoretic transfer of protein from SDS-PAGE gels onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), ECL Western blotting was performed under previously described conditions (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Choudhury P. Liu Y. Bick R.J. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13446-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with a 1:1000 dilution of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a synthetic peptide homologous to the cytoplasmic tail of canine calnexin (StressGen) or a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit antiserum against the α-subunit of the 20 S proteasome (Calbiochem). Incubation with conjugated secondary antibodies, subsequent washings, and the detection of immunospecific bands were performed in a manner identical to that reported previously (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Choudhury P. Liu Y. Bick R.J. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13446-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Relative band intensities were quantified by standard densitometric analysis. Variants null(Hong Kong) and PI Z are retained in the ER of stably transfected hepatoma cells by distinct mechanisms (9Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q-Q. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but each is subjected to intracellular disposal (23Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular turnover was examined in pulse-chase studies following a 15-min pulse with [35S]methionine. After 3 h of chase, 30% of pulse-radiolabeled null(Hong Kong) remained undegraded in the cell lysate (t12 = 120 min) (Fig.1, compare lanes 1 and2). Under identical conditions, the intracellular population of radiolabeled PI Z was not detected (t12 = 90 min) (Fig. 1, compare lanes 5 and 6), and only a fraction (∼15%) was secreted into the medium during this period (compare lanes 1 and 9), as previously reported (23Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No fraction of either radiolabeled variant was detected in the membrane pellet following cell lysis with Nonidet P-40; nor was the loss altered in response to the use of alternative polyclonal antisera for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These findings indicate that the intracellular turnover of both variants was the result of intracellular degradation rather than a reflection of protein insolubility or hindered antibody recognition. Lactacystin, a specific irreversible covalent inhibitor of the multicatalytic proteasome (40Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), arrested null(Hong Kong) turnover such that 95% of the pulse-radiolabeled molecules were detected in cells following a 3-h chase (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and4). In contrast, <5% of pulse-radiolabeled PI Z was detected in cells under identical conditions (Fig. 1, comparelanes 7 and 8), and this was not the result of accelerated secretion (compare lanes 9 and 10). In a separate set of experiments, not lactacystin, MG132, orN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, all inhibitors of proteasomal activity (28Rivett J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 40Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 41Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg D.L. Roirdan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), hindered PI Z turnover by more than 5% (data not shown). Overall, these findings indicate that variants null(Hong Kong) and PI Z are eliminated in hepatoma cells by distinct disposal pathways, the latter being somewhat more efficient. To initiate the biochemical description of the nonproteasomal disposal system, we explored the reported inhibitory effect of the metabolic poison sodium fluoride on PI Z disposal (24Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q-Q. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since it fails to inhibit the intracellular turnover of variant null(Hong Kong) (39Choudhury P. Liu Y. Bick R.J. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13446-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since combinations of metabolic poisons are required to deplete intracellular ATP (43Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), we extended our investigation to test the hypothesis that the effect of sodium fluoride on PI Z disposal actually involves its reported role as an inhibitor of intracellular phosphatases (44Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, 80% of radiolabeled PI Z remained undegraded in cells following a 3-h chase in the presence of sodium pervanadate (Fig.2 a, lane 3), a membrane-permeable inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (45Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), as compared with 20% under control conditions (lane 2). Pervanadate treatment had no demonstrable effect on null(Hong Kong) disposal under an identical set of conditions (data not shown). Importantly, PI Z turnover was inhibited to a similar extent as with sodium fluoride when pulse-radiolabeled cells were incubated with phenylarsine oxide (Fig. 2 b), an additional general tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (46Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation with okadaic acid, a general inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatase activities (47Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 3: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), had no demonstrable inhibitory effect on PI Z disposal (Fig.2 b). Incubation with pervanadate arrested PI Z disposal without hindering the enhanced electrophoretic mobility of radiolabeled molecules in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 a), which reflects the removal of mannose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides during intracellular retention (24Le A. Ferrell G.A. Dishon D.S. Le Q-Q. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter observation was common to all the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (data not shown), indicating that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role at a relatively late step in the nonproteasomal disposal of variant PI Z. Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane was performed after pulse radiolabeling with [35S]methionine (see “Materials and Methods”) as an alternate method to confirm that PI Z disposal occurs independently of the cytosolic proteasome. Quantitation after ECL Western blotting demonstrated that selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane had removed >95% of the immunoreactive proteasomal α-subunit (Fig.3 a). Under these conditions, only a negligible loss (∼20%) of pulse-radiolabeled variant null(Hong Kong) (Fig. 3 b, N) or wild type AAT (Fig. 3 b, M) was detected following 3 h of incubation in isotonic buffer. These findings indicated that the manipulation had arrested proteasome-mediated disposal without perturbing the structural integrity of the ER. In contrast, <5% of radiolabeled PI Z remained in the permeabilized cells under identical conditions (Fig. 3 c, Co). Moreover, the loss of radiolabeled protein was unaffected by lactacystin treatment (Fig. 3 c, Lct). At no period during the course of these experiments was radiolabeled PI Z detected in either the incubation buffer or membrane pellet of the Nonidet P-40 detergent lysate (data not shown). These data confirm that the loss of protein did not reflect its release from the ER or result from insolubility. Importantly, 82% of radiolabeled PI Z remained undegraded in permeabilized cells following a 3-h incubation when pervanadate was included in the incubation buffer (Fig. 3 c, Pv). These data indicate that the selective elimination of PI Z occurs independently of cytosolic factors. In a previous report (26Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), inhibitor studies were utilized to demonstrate how the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides participates in the molecular capture of variant null(Hong Kong) for intracellular disposal. ER mannosidase I is the more abundant of two distinct mannosidases that can initiate the removal of mannose from asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (35Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Hersovics A.

Residues found in conserved structural motifs A (Asp-238) and B (Asn-297) are involved in nucleotide selection. Asp-238 appears to couple binding of nucleotides with the correct sugar configuration to catalytic efficiency at the active site of the enzyme.

Klenow fragment ribonucleoside triphosphate human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase Moloney murine leukemia virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase DNA-dependent RNA polymerase polymerase chain reaction All nucleic acid polymerases, with the exception of mammalian DNA polymerase β, have the same overall topology (1Hansen J.L.

Nature. 1985; 313: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), these enzymes resemble a cupped, right hand with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains. The fingers and thumb subdomains contribute to substrate binding, especially to regions of primer and template remote from the catalytic center (3Eick D. Wedel A. Heumann H.

The overall structure and, to some extent, sequence of palm subdomains are also highly homologous. Thus, the functional similarity between the kinetic and chemical mechanism of nucleic acid polymerases is not surprising (13Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 14Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30147-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nucleic acid polymerases are categorized based upon their specificity for template and nucleotide. Of course, specificity is a relative term, since it is quite dependent upon reaction conditions. At physiologically relevant values of pH and ionic strength and in the presence of Mg2+ ions, most DNA-dependent DNA polymerases prefer to utilize DNA templates and 2′-deoxyribonucleotides (2′-dNTPs) as substrates rather than RNA and ribonucleotides (rNTPs) (18Benkovic S.J. Cameron C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The converse is true for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) (19Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, even under physiological conditions, exceptions to polymerase specificity have been noted, especially for primer and/or template utilization. For example, KF utilizes RNA templates (21Ricchetti M. Buc H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) utilizes RNA templates (22Arnaud-Barbe N. Cheynet-Sauvion V. Oriol G. Mandrand B. Mallet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and poliovirus RdRP utilizes DNA primers (20Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Template preference becomes even more ambiguous when alternative divalent cations, such as Mn2+, are employed (20Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37060-37069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This “identity crisis” of polymerases regarding template utilization is not too surprising given the existence of enzymes like reverse transcriptases (RTs) that bridge both worlds (23Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ease of polymerases to move from one template type to another was probably a driving force for the evolution of specific protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions as an obligatory step for the initiation of transcription, replication, and repair (24Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1991Google Scholar). In contrast to template selection, nucleotide selection is more stringent under physiological conditions. For example, T7 DdRP exhibits an 80-fold preference for rNTPs relative to 2′-dNTPs (25Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). KF exhibits a 103 to 106-fold preference for 2′-dNTPs (26Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptases from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) exhibit a 105-fold preference for 2′-dNTPs (29Zinnen S. Hsieh J.C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24195-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M. Hendrickson W.A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The use of Mn2+ as divalent cation permits all classes of polymerase to incorporate one or two nucleotides of the incorrect sugar configuration (31Rienitz A. Grosse F. Blocker H. Frank R. Krauss G.

However, processive incorporation of nucleotides of the incorrect sugar configuration is not tolerated (37Lewis D.A. Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 290: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This interest has resulted from the development of structural models for DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and a DdRP in complex with various substrates (e.g. primer, template, and/or nucleotide). These studies have uncovered interactions between the enzyme and nucleotide that may be important during the selection process (5Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 6Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 7Huang H.

Biol. 1994; 243: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Construction and characterization of site-directed mutants of KF, HIV-1 RT, and MMLV RT have confirmed the structural predictions by altering the 2′-dNTP/rNTP preference of these enzymes. The 2′-dNTP-utilizing enzymes use a steric gating mechanism to decrease the affinity of the enzyme for rNTPs (27Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 40Bonnin A. Lazaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The steric gate is formed, in part, by a residue found in structural motif A (motif designations are as defined by Hansen et al. (1Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar)) of the palm subdomain (KF Glu-710, HIV-1 RT Tyr-115, MMLV RT Phe-155). Structural motif B of the palm subdomain may also participate in this process (43Gutierrez-Rivas M. Ibanez A. Martinez M.A. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mechanism employed by rNTP-utilizing enzymes is not fully understood. A steric gating mechanism has been proposed for T7 DdRP. Succinctly, it has been suggested that a water molecule bound to Tyr-639, a residue that occludes the nucleotide-binding pocket, is displaced as a consequence of rNTP binding. Displacement of this water molecule results in movement of Tyr-639 out of the pocket, thereby permitting productive rNTP binding. The absence of a 2′-OH would not permit induction of this conformational transition, thereby creating a steric block to productive binding of 2′-dNTPs (25Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although this model is based upon steady-state kinetic analysis of T7 RNA polymerase derivatives, a water molecule and movement of Tyr-639 have been observed crystallographically (45Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 46Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An alternative model has been proposed recently for rNTP selection by T7 DdRP based solely upon structural observations. Selection for rNTP binding appears to be mediated by a hydrogen-bonding network consisting of the 2′-OH and side chains of the enzyme (His-784 and Tyr-639). Such a network is more consistent with the 80-fold preference of this enzyme for rNTPs (25Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 47Rechinsky V.O. Kostyuk D.A. Tunitskaya V.L. Kochetkov S.N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An 80-fold difference in specificity corresponds to a free energy difference of approximately 3 kcal/mol, a reasonable value for one or two hydrogen bonds (67Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Engineering. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 30Google Scholar). Moreover, as discussed above, steric mechanisms yield specificity differences that are, on average, 4000-fold greater than that observed for this enzyme. Aspects of these two models are mutually exclusive. Analysis of His-784 derivatives under conditions in which 2′-dNTP incorporation by the wild-type enzyme is observed should help to distinguish between these two models (45Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Currently, information regarding the mechanism of nucleotide selection by the RdRP is not available. Our previous work has shown that the RdRP from poliovirus utilizes rNTPs at least 121-fold more efficiently than 2′-dNTPs (48Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This value is similar to that determined for T7 DdRP. In addition, Hansen et al. have predicted the use of a hydrogen-bonding network to select for rNTP binding based upon the unliganded structure of this enzyme (1Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used the structure for the ternary complex of HIV-1 RT to develop a model for the ternary complex of poliovirus RNA polymerase. In addition, we use biochemical and biological analysis of site-directed mutants of 3Dpol to test predictions of this model. This analysis demonstrates a role for conserved structural motifs A and B in 2′-dNTP/rNTP selection by the RdRP. In addition, we provide additional support for the biological relevance of the primer-template (sym/sub) system developed to study the RdRP from poliovirus in vitro(48Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). [α-32P]UTP (>6,000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; [γ-32P]ATP (>7,000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN; nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (ultrapure solutions) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.; all DNA oligonucleotides and T4 DNA ligase were from Life Technologies, Inc.; all RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO); restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and Deep Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs, Inc.; polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were from EM Science; and 2.5-cm DE81 filter paper discs were from Whatman. All other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma or Fisher. The coordinates for the HIV-1 RT ternary complex (1rtd) and 3Dpol (1rdr) are available from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics. Superpositioning of the two structures was performed using lsqkab from the CCP4 suite of programs (49Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Structural alignments were initially performed using the thumb and palm subdomains. Final superpositioning of the two structures was confined to structural motifs A (3Dpol residues 233–240), B (), C (324), and E (). The final positions of C-α atoms in the four structural motifs had a root mean square deviation ranging from 0.9 to 1.8 Å. 3Dpol residues were inserted into the structurally analogous positions of HIV-1 RT using the program O (50Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Residues having the same identity in both structures were not altered from those observed in the HIV-1 RT structure. Amino acids unique to 3Dpol were manually set in position based on their orientation in the unliganded 3Dpol structure. In some instances, the side chains were adjusted to eliminate steric contact with neighboring residues. 2′-OHs were inserted into both the primer and template strands of the nucleic acid within the polymerase active site as well as the incoming nucleotide. Bond angles for the 2′-OHs were adopted from various RNA structures determined using NMR and x-ray crystallography obtained from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics. Within the vicinity of the active site, DNA in the HIV-1 RT structure adopts an A-form conformation causing the sugar pucker to switch from C2′-endo to C3′-endo; hence, modification of the sugar geometry was not necessary. Nucleotide bases of the RNA were modified to correspond to that of sym/sub (48Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), 5′-GCAUGGGCCC-3′, and the incoming nucleotide was modified to ATP, the first nucleotide incorporated into sym/sub. Two additional regions (comprising residues 163–202) were modeled into the structure based on a partial structural and sequence alignment. Region I, residues 175–202, was identified by superpositioning of the 3Dpol and HIV-1 RT structures and consists of an extended α-helix that runs underneath the 3′-end of the template strand. Region II comprises residues 163–174 (which are absent from the 3Dpol structure), which represent the active site side of the fingers subdomain. Energy minimizations were performed on the entire structure, comprising both modified and unmodified regions, using the program CNS SOLVE (51Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16949) Google Scholar). Initial attempts at energy minimization were performed on the modified region of the structure only; however, upon completion of the first cycle, gross distortions of the molecule were observed. The modified region was reinserted into the entire HIV-1 RT structure, and energy minimizations were repeated. The additional structure eliminated distortions in the molecule, allowing the protein side chains to relax into positions void of unfavorable, steric contact. Iterative cycles of minimization, a total of 10, were performed using the constant temperature algorithm. The final settings for the energy minimization follow. The Cartesian (restrained) molecular dynamics algorithm was utilized at a constant temperature (298 K) using the coupled temperature control method (52Berendsen R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23173) Google Scholar). 10,000 molecular dynamics steps were performed at 0.0005-ps intervals. The dielectric was set to 1 (the default value), and the number of trials utilizing different initial velocities was set to 1. The output files from each cycle were superimposed to observe side chain and nucleic acid motions, which were most apparent for side chains and nucleotides not involved in protein or nucleic acid interactions. Upon completion of the final cycle of minimization, the modified region was removed from the structure, and side chain geometry was checked using the program PROCHECK (53Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, the modified regions of the HIV-1 RT structure, as well as nucleic acid, nucleotide, and Mg2+ ions were removed from the file and used to generate a new Protein Data Bank file (3DRTSS). Mutations were introduced into a modified 3Dpol-coding sequence by using overlap-extension PCR (54Aiyar A. Xiang Y. Leis J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed in Escherichia coli by using a ubiquitin fusion system. The ubiquitin fusion system, PCR conditions, and modified gene have been described previously (55Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Ghosh S.K.B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The D238F clone was engineered such that it contained a silent NheI site. The sequence of the forward oligonucleotide is 5′-GAC TAC ACA GGG TATTTC GCT AGC CTC AGC CCT-3′; the codon changing Asp to Phe is underlined, and the NheI site is in boldface type. A wild-type reverse oligonucleotide was employed (oligonucleotide 10, Table I). Briefly, two separate PCR reactions were performed: one reaction with the pET-Ub-SacII for oligonucleotide and the Asp-238 WT rev; the other with D238 wild-type rev for and pET-3D-BamHI rev. Both reactions employed pET26b-Ub-3D (55Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Ghosh S.K.B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as template. Products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and used as the template in the next round of PCR with a 1:10 molar ratio of the wild-type:D238F-modified fragments. The AflII for andAvrII reverse oligonucleotides were used as the sole primers for this cycle of PCR. Product was purified, digested withAvrII and AflII, and ligated into pET26b-Ub-3D that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. Plasmids were screened for the presence of the NheI site. The remaining mutant 3Dpol genes were constructed by using PCR as described above and subcloned into the D238F vector between theAflII and AvrII restriction sites and screened for the loss of the NheI site.

The N297F derivative was not soluble when induced in E. coli at 25 °C. The concentration of all 3Dpol derivatives was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 71,480m−1 cm−1(56Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal.

[α-32P]UTP was diluted to 0.1 μCi/μl in distilled deionized H2O, and 1 μl was spotted in triplicate onto TLC plates. TLC plates were developed in 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Imaging and quantitation were performed by using the ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. The purity was used to correct the specific activity of UTP in reactions in order to calculate accurate concentrations of product.

In cultured vascular endothelial cells, TGF-β induces the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain, a mitogen and chemoattractant, at the level of transcription. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying this process are not presently understood. In this study, we performed serial 5′ deletion and transient transfection analysis to define a region in the PDGF-B promoter mediating inducible responsiveness to TGF-β. This region contains an atypical nucleotide recognition element for the Smad family of transcriptional regulators. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that nuclear proteins bound to this site in a transient and specific manner. Supershift studies demonstrated the physical association of Smad4 with the promoter. Overexpression of Smad4 activated the PDGF-B promoter and superinduced PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in cells exposed to TGF-β. Moreover, simultaneous cotransfection of Smad3 and Smad4 activated the PDGF-B promoter. This effect was attenuated when Smad4 was substituted with its dominant negative counterpart. Mutation of the −81CAGA−78 motif in the PDGF-B promoter abrogated Smad-inducible promoter-dependent expression. Overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 transactivated the PDGF-B promoter in a synergistic manner.

Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar). These diverse biological effects are mediated by the activity of cell surface, heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor activating a specific set of recently discovered positive and negative regulatory transcription factors known as Smads. The Smad family, mammalian homologues of the Drosophila geneMad (2.Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 3.Nakao A. Imamura T.

Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8, the receptor-associated Smads, are direct substrates of the type I receptor. Smad4, a common mediator Smad, is not directly phosphorylated by the receptor. Rather, it physically associates with other Smads in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear translocation as a complex. Smad6 and Smad7 are “anti-Smads” that have been found to inhibit TGF-β-induced Smad-dependent activation. A role for Smad family members in TGF-β signal transduction has been defined in a large number of promoters, including the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (3.Nakao A. Imamura T.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for cells of mesenchymal origin. It consists of two chains, A and B, held together in homodimeric or heterodimeric configuration by disulfide bonds. The three isoforms of PDGF (AA, BB, and AB) modulate biological responsiveness by interacting specifically with two (α and β) cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors; α binds the A-chain and the B-chain, whereas β binds only to the B-chain. The PDGF ligand receptor system has strongly been implicated to play roles in a large number of normal and pathologic settings, such as embryonic development, wound healing embryo, tumorigenesis, and atherosclerosis. For example, PDGF-A and PDGF-B mRNA and protein are present in human atherosclerotic tissue (8.Barrett T.B. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The PDGF-B promoter is also negatively regulated by the zinc finger protein, ZNF174, which interacts with the transcriptional start site (29.Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Shows T. Collins T. J. Biol.

Steady-state PDGF-B mRNA expression is increased in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to TGF-β (30.Daniel T.O. Gibbs V.C. Milfay D.F. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11893-11896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on studies determined that this is regulated at the level of transcription (31.Kavanaugh W.M. Harsh G.R., IV Starksen N.F. Rocco C.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8470-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) mediating the induction of PDGF-B by TGF-β have not yet been elucidated. Because Smads play a regulatory role in TGF-β signaling, in this paper we investigated whether this family of transcriptional regulators control TGF-β induction of PDGF-B. Here, we used deletion analysis to define a region in the proximal PDGF-B promoter mediating responsiveness to TGF-β. Nuclear proteins from endothelial cells exposed to TGF-β bind to this region in an inducible and specific manner. Transfection studies demonstrate that the PDGF-B promoter is activated by a number of Smad factors, individually and synergistically. Dominant negative mutants of Smad4 blocked Smad and TGF-β induction of the PDGF-B promoter. These findings demonstrate the involvement of Smads in the regulation of PDGF-B expression by TGF-β. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were use in experiments between passages 4 and 8. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 IU/ml penicillin, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. At 50–60% confluency, the cells were transfected with the indicated amount of plasmid DNA and 2 μg of theRenilla luciferase reporter plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega) using the modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (32.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). After incubation overnight at 37 °C at 3% CO2, the cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with 0.5% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before exposure to 10 ng/ml of TGF-β (Promega). The cells were incubated for a further 24 h before harvesting by washing twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and scraping in 1 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega). The suspension was freeze/thawed and spun, and the supernatant used to determine luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. The Firefly luciferase activity was determined using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs) and normalized againstRenilla activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 100-mm dishes. Growth-arrested endothelial cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β for the times indicated and harvested. Cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold Solution A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 5 min. The suspension was microfuged at 13,000 rpm, and the cytosolic fraction was removed. The nuclei were resuspended and lysed in 20 μl of ice-cold Solution C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) by gentle shaking for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, and the nuclear extract was combined 1:1 with ice-cold Solution D (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclear extracts were snap frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until use. Binding conditions were essentially as described (33.Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A. Mauvel A.

In general, 4–6 μg of nuclear extract and 150,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide were incubated in 20 μl containing 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 0.4 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice. In supershift studies, 4 μg of affinity-purified antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the binding mixture at 4 °C overnight prior to the addition of probe. Bound complexes were separated from free probe by nondenaturing (5%) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE running buffer at 200 V (constant voltage). The gels were vacuum dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at −80 °C. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, before being lysed on ice in 1× RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Lysates containing 10 μg of protein were prepared in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 30 mm DTT) and boiled for 3 min with 0.5 m iodoacetamide added before loading on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel. Gels were blotted onto Immobilon-P (polyvinylidine difluoride) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 100 V, dried, and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% skim milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 and PBS, pH 7.4. Three 15-min washes with 0.05% Tween-PBS were made prior to 1 h of incubation with the primary antibody (1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween-PBS) at 22 °C. The membrane blots were washed again before 1 h of incubation at 22 °C with rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody (1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween-PBS) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). The blots were washed again before chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (NEN Life Science Products). Previous investigations have determined that TGF-β can induce PDGF-B expression in vascular endothelial cells at the level of transcription (31.Kavanaugh W.M. Harsh G.R., IV Starksen N.F. Rocco C.M.

To understand the molecular basis for this effect, we performed transient transfection analysis using a nested series of Firefly luciferase-based reporter constructs bearing various sized fragments of the PDGF-B promoter. The endothelial cells were cotransfected with a Renilla luciferase-based expression vector to correct for transfection efficiency. PDGF-B promoter-dependent reporter activity increased in cells transfected with constructs RA-luc, NA-luc, and SDA-luc (26.Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11792-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whose 5′ end points extend 398, 251, and 103 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site (27.Rao C.D.

However, TGF-β-inducible reporter activity was no longer observed in transfectants harboring construct SPA-luc, whose expression is driven by 64 base pairs of the PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 1 A) and retains binding sites for Sp1, Sp3, and Egr-1 (19.Khachigian L.M.

These findings suggested that these transcription factors may not play a direct regulatory role in TGF-β-inducible PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression. Rather, TGF-β-activation is mediated by the region located between nucleotides −103 and −64 in the PDGF-B promoter, which, interestingly, bears a putative atypical nucleotide recognition element for the Smad family of transcription factors, whose core motif is 5′-CAGA-3′ (5.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) (TableI). TGF-β activation of the PDGF-B promoter-reporter construct SDA-luc (Fig. 1 A), which contains a single CAGA motif (−81/−78), compares favorably with TGF-β activation of construct (CAGA)6-TK-luc (Fig.1 B), which contains six copies of the AGCCAGACA element located at position −730 in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (5.Dennler S.

Using nuclear extracts of growth-quiescent cells, several distinct nucleoprotein complexes were detected (Fig.2, lane 2). Within 30 min of incubation with TGF-β, a single inducible complex was observed (Fig.2, lane 3, indicated by arrow) that remained elevated even after exposure to TGF-β for 3 h, but not 4 h (Fig. 2). To demonstrate that nuclear protein(s) interact with this region in a specific fashion, we performed oligonucleotide competition experiments in EMSA. A 75-fold molar excess of unlabeled Oligo-93/-63 virtually abrogated the appearance of the inducible complex (Fig.3 A, indicated byarrow). In contrast, the same fold molar excess of an irrelevant oligonucleotide LMSSREm3 (20.Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) had no effect on the formation of this complex (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, when the CAGA sequence in Oligo-93/-63 was deleted to produce Oligo-93/-63Δ2, a 75-fold molar excess of the latter oligonucleotide failed to interfere with nucleoprotein complex formation (Fig. 3 A), nor could it directly support formation of the TGF-β-inducible complex (Fig.3 B, indicated by arrow). We performed supershift analysis to shed light on the identity of the nuclear proteins interacting with 32P-Oligo-93/-63. Inclusion of polyclonal antibodies specifically targeting Smad4 in EMSA produced a distinct supershift (Fig. 4,right panel, lane 3, indicated by S), which was not observed when an identical amount of polyclonal antibodies raised against Egr-1 were used (Fig. 4, right panel, lane 4). To ensure that the Smad4 shift was not the product of a nonspecific interaction between the antibody and the radiolabeled probe, nuclear extract was omitted from the EMSA reaction. This strategy did not produce a supershift with either antibody (Fig.4, left panel, lanes 2 and 3). The inability of Smad4 antibodies to affect the intensity of nucleoprotein complex or effect a complete supershift has previously been observed by other investigators in EMSA (4.Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M.

The specific nature of the supershift nevertheless indicates the involvement of Smad4. These findings demonstrate the presence of Smad4 in endothelial nuclei and its physical association with the PDGF-B promoter. To determine whether Smad4 plays a role in TGF-β-inducible PDGF-B promoter-dependent gene expression, we performed transient transfection analysis using cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven expression vectors generating wild type and dominant negative forms of Smad4. TGF-β induced PDGF-B promoter-dependent luciferase activity in cells transfected with the empty expression vector (Fig.5 A, compare firstand second columns). Overexpression of wild type Smad4 (CMV-Smad4) activated the PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 5 A,third column, and Fig. 7,third column), which further increased upon exposure of the transfectants to TGF-β (Fig. 5 A, sixth column). In contrast, in cells transfected with the dominant negative Smad4 expression vector, DPC4(1–514), the capacity of TGF-β to augment Smad4-inducible PDGF-B promoter expression was inhibited (Fig.5 A, seventh column). These findings demonstrate the capacity of Smad4 to transactivate the PDGF-B promoter, alone and in concert with exposure to TGF-β. Renilla luciferase activity generated by the normalizing plasmid pRL-TK was independent of Smad cotransfection or exposure to TGF-β (data not shown), indicating specificity. The comparable increase in TGF-β- and Smad-inducible PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression (Fig. 5 A,second and third columns) is consistent with previous findings by different groups in other promoters (6.Jonk L.J.C.

That Smad protein was generated in endothelial cells following transfection was confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis (Fig.5 B).Figure 7Smad3 transactivates the PDGF-B promoter alone and together with Smad4. Endothelial cells were transfected with 10 μg of SDA-luc, 2 μg of pRL-TK, and 3 μg (black bars) of pcDNA3, CMV-Smad3, or Smad4 or a total of 6 μg (open bars) of pcDNA3, pCMV5, CMV-Smad3/CMV-Smad4, or CMV-Smad3/DPC4(1–514). The cells were growth-arrested after transfection and harvested after 24 h prior to determination of luciferase activity by luminometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate the functional significance of the CAGA-binding site in the proximal PDGF-B promoter, we mutated the PDGF-B−81CAGA−78 in Oligo-93/-63 to generate Oligo-93/-63TTTT. A 100-fold molar excess of Oligo-93/-63TTTT failed to block the formation of the TGF-β-inducible nucleoprotein complex using the 32P-labeled wild type PDGF-B promoter fragment (compare Fig. 6 A with Fig. 3 A). Introduction of this mutation into SDA-luc generated SDAm7-luc. Cotransfection experiments revealed that the intact−81CAGA−78 element is crucial for Smad3-inducible PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression (Fig.6 B). We next mobilized six copies of the−83GCCAGAAG−76 motif into the polylinker region of pGL3-prom, driven by the SV40 promoter, in efforts to establish portability of the element and demonstrate greater transactivation upon cotransfection with Smad3. However, the heterologous promoter bearing this sequence in either the forward or the reverse orientation failed to generate any additional reporter activity (data not shown). These findings, which are not entirely unexpected, suggest that additional cis-acting elements in the PDGF-B promoter are required; these may be absent, disrupted, or mis-spaced in the heterologous construct. Previous studies have found that Smad proteins functionally cooperate over nucleotide elements in the promoters of a number of different genes (2.Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 3.Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated a functional role for Smad4 in the regulation of PDGF-B promoter activity, we next determined whether this Smad member collaborates with other Smads to modulate PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression. Transient transfection studies revealed that Smad3, like Smad4, activates the PDGF-B promoter in endothelial cells (Fig. 7,second column). Simultaneous transfection of Smad3 and Smad4 further activated the PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 7, sixth column). This effect was markedly attenuated if Smad4 was substituted by its dominant negative counterpart (Fig. 7, seventh column). We explored whether Smad2, like Smad3 and Smad4, activates the PDGF-B promoter. Overexpression of Smad2 alone induced PDGF-B promoter-dependent reporter gene expression (Fig.8 A, second column). Coexpression of both Smad2 and Smad3 resulted in synergistic activation (Fig. 8 A, fifth column). In contrast, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were not able to activate the shorter PDGF-B promoter-reporter construct, SPA-luc (Fig. 8 B), thus demonstrating that Smad activation of the PDGF-B promoter is sequence-specific. Physical and cooperative interactions between these Smad proteins have previously been demonstrated by other investigators (3.Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 38.Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that TGF-β induction of the PDGF-B promoter in vascular endothelial cells is mediated by the Smad family of transcriptional regulators. Serial 5′ deletion and transient transfection analysis defined a region in the PDGF-B promoter mediating inducible responsiveness to TGF-β. This region contains an atypical nucleotide recognition element for the Smad family that preserves the 5′-CAGA-3′ motif. EMSA revealed that nuclear proteins bound to this site in an inducible, transient, and specific manner. This nucleoprotein complex was detected within 30 min of exposure to TGF-β, consistent with rapid Smad translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and its interaction with the PAI-1 promoter (4.Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Formation of the TGF-β-inducible complex was blocked by a molar excess of unlabeled Oligo-93/-63 but was unaffected by an oligonucleotide bearing a deletion of the−81CAGA−78 motif (Oligo-93/-63Δ2) or one in which the −81CAGA−78 motif was mutated to−81TTTT−78 (Oligo-93/-63TTTT). Overexpression of Smad4 activated the PDGF-B promoter and superinduced PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression in endothelial cells exposed to TGF-β. Simultaneous expression of Smad3 and Smad4, or Smad2 and Smad3, activated the PDGF-B promoter. Mutation of the−81CAGA−78 motif in the PDGF-B promoter (SDAm7-Luc) abrogated Smad-inducible reporter gene expression. These findings demonstrate the existence of a novel Smad-binding element in the PDGF-B promoter. TGF-β activation of the PDGF-B promoter was blocked by overexpression of cDNA encoding a truncated, dominant negative form of Smad4 (amino acids 1–514). Conversely, exogenous wild type Smad4 augmented TGF-β-inducible PDGF-B expression, testing the fidelity of Smad4 activation of PDGF-B in a manner consistent with TGF-β induction of the PAI-1 promoter (35.Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynk R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 38.Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The dominant negative approach has been used previously by other groups to define the involvement of Smad4 in signal transduction stimulated by TGF-β. For example, TGF-β-activation of the p21/WAF/Cip1 promoter in HepG2 cells is repressed by dominant negative Smad4 (7.Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of Smad4 lacking its carboxyl terminus attenuates TGF-β-inducible PAI-1 promoter-dependent expression to levels comparable with those in cells expressing truncated forms of the type I and II receptors (39.Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Smad4 mutant also inhibited additive Smad3 and Smad4 activation. These data demonstrate that Smad4 is necessary and sufficient for TGF-β induction of the PDGF-B promoter. It is becoming increasingly clear that Smad proteins can undergo combinatorial interactions with a diverse array of transcription factors other than themselves. For example, Smad proteins functionally interact with Sp1 in the regulation of the p21/WAF/Cip1 promoter (7.Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), NF-κB in the type VII collagen promoter (40.Kon A. Vindevoghel L. Kouba D.J. Fujimura Y. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), AP1 in the c-Jun promoter (41.Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) in the PAI-1 promoter. Smads also functionally interact with CREB-binding protein (42.Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SIP-1, a zinc finger/homeodomain repressor, has recently been found to interact with several Smads and down-regulate Xbra expression (43.Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.-T. Bondmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20489-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). PDGF-B transcription in endothelial cells is regulated by additional factors such as Sp1 (19.Khachigian L.M. Fries J.W.U. Benz M.W. Bonthron D.T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22647-22656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Egr-1 (21.Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Smad regulation of PDGF-B expression may in certain settings also involve cooperative interaction(s) with these other factors, particularly because their nucleotide recognition elements lie in relative close proximity to the Smad-binding site in the PDGF-B promoter. Smad regulation of PDGF-B transcription may also occur in vascular pathologic settings. For example, endothelial denudation or injury by mechanical means in rats leads to the inducible expression of TGF-β (21.Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T.

This is followed by vascular cell migration and proliferation and the eventual formation of a neointima. The response of the artery wall to injury may involve Smad activation by endogenous TGF-β, which converts from the latent form to the active form (49.Statius van Eps R.G. LaMuraglia G.M. J. Vasc. Surg. 1997; 25: 1044-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Smads, in turn, may induce the expression of PDGF-B and perhaps other growth regulatory molecules that modulate cell movement and replication. In developing human atherosclerotic lesions, TGF-β and PDGF-B are both overexpressed (50.Evanko S.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Gold L.I. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 533-546PubMed Google Scholar,51.Bobik A. Agrotis A. Kanellakis P. Dilley R. Krushinsky A. Smirnov V. Tararak E. Condron M. Kostolias G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). TGF-β and PDGF-B are also present in restenotic lesions following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and bypass grafts (11.Ueda M. Becker A.E. Kasayuki N. Kojima A. Morita Y. Tanaka S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 831-843PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Nikol S. Huehns T.Y. Weir L. Wight T.N. Hofling B. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). That the TGF-β-inducible gene, βig-h3, is overexpressed in atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions suggests that TGF-β may indeed be capable of modulating gene expression in the vessel wall (53.O'Brien E.R. Bennett K.L. Garvin M.R. Zderic T.W. Hinohara T. Simpson J.B. Kimura T. Nobuyoshi M. Mizgala H. Purchio A. Schwartz S.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whether Smads are activated by arterial injury has not yet been demonstrated. Still, it is tempting to speculate that this family of transcriptional mediators may play an important mechanistic role in the vascular response to injury by regulating the inducible expression of at least one growth factor by TGF-β.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Changes in the functional activity of integrins can be induced by agonists that interact with heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors. For example, in platelets thrombin, ADP, or thromboxane A2can all induce signals leading to activation of the integrin αIIbβ3 (4.Shattil S.J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar); interaction of αIIbβ3 with vWf1 in the blood vessel wall leads to irreversible adhesion and cell spreading (6.Phillips D. Charo I. Scarborough R. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), whereas interaction with fibrinogen in plasma leads to platelet aggregate formation at the site of injury. Investigation of the signaling molecules involved in G-protein receptor-induced αIIbβ3 activation has implicated roles for protein kinase C and the actin filament-based cytoskeleton (7.Qi W. Loh E. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15271-15278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8.Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because platelet aggregation can lead to thrombotic events, there is considerable interest in elucidating the mechanisms involved in αIIbβ3 activation. To this end, efforts have been made to reconstitute αIIbβ3activation in several transfected cell systems. However, attempts to activate αIIbβ3 by induction of signaling pathways involved in thrombin-induced activation have been unsuccessful (9.O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10.Kieffer N. Fitzgerald L. Wolf D. Cheresh D. Phillips D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An exception is an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphocyte system in which αIIbβ3 can be activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, an agonist that acts on a G-protein-coupled receptor (7.Qi W. Loh E. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15271-15278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11.Loh E. Beaverson K. Vilaire G. Qi W. Poncz M. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18631-18636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the suggestion has been made that the pathway involved in αIIbβ3 activation is specific for hematopoietic cells (11.Loh E. Beaverson K. Vilaire G. Qi W. Poncz M. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18631-18636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although integrin activation has been studied in much detail following G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, it is becoming apparent that other receptor families may activate integrins. For example, the presence of serum accelerates integrin-induced adhesion in cultured cells, suggesting that growth factor receptor signaling activates pathways that influence integrin activity (12.Gullberg D.

Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, engagement of adhesion receptors in leukocytes and platelets may regulate integrin function (14.Blanks J.E. Moll T.

This is a transient, low affinity interaction that, under conditions of flow, results in rolling of platelets; the subsequent interaction of the integrins αIIbβ3 and α2β1 with their ligands in the vessel wall causes irreversible adhesion (16.Savage B.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In vitro, the interaction between GPIb-IX and vWf can be induced by exposing platelets to shear forces comparable to those in the vasculature (21.Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I.

Lamb M.A. Brinkhous K.M. Blood. 1989; 74: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or ristocetin (26.Howard M.A. Firkin B.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1971; 26: 362-369PubMed Google Scholar). Such studies have revealed that the GPIb-IX-vWF interaction induces intracellular signaling (27.Kroll M.H. Harris T.S. Moake J.L. Handin R.I. Schafer A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1568-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28.Chow T.W. Hellums J.D. Moake J.L. Kroll M.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is clear that GPIb-IX-vWf interactions lead to altered functional activity of αIIbβ3 (16.Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Blood. 1987; 69: 625-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear whether this results directly from activation of signaling pathways by GPIb-IX-vWf interactions or whether activation of additional membrane receptors, for example by ADP or by thromboxane secreted as a consequence of GPIb-IX signaling, is required. It also is not known whether interaction of αIIbβ3 with vWf results from GPIb-IX-induced αIIbβ3activation or from a GPIb-IX-induced alteration in the conformation of vWf that allows it to interact with αIIbβ3. GPIb-IX contains GPIbα disulfide-linked to GPIbβ; this dimer is non-covalently associated with GPIX (29.Berndt M.C. Gregory C. Kabral A. Zola H. Fournier D. Castaldi P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). GPIbα contains the domain that interacts with vWf. The cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα interacts with actin-binding protein (ABP), linking the GPIb-IX complex to the skeleton that coats the intracellular surface of the lipid bilayer (30.Cunningham J.G.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα also contains a binding site for the putative signaling molecule 14-3-3 (35.Du X. Fox J.E.B. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the importance of ABP or 14-3-3 in allowing GPIb-IX to transmit signals leading to altered integrin function. GPIb-IX can interact with another transmembrane protein, GPV (36.Modderman P.W. Admiraal L.G. Sonnenberg A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 364-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The potential importance of GPV in allowing GPIb-IX to induce altered αIIbβ3 function is not known. In the present study, we have provided evidence that signaling across GPIb-IX leads to activation of αIIbβ3 in platelets. Moreover, we have established a CHO cell system in which αIIbβ3 and GPIb-IX are expressed. Signaling across GPIb-IX in this system leads to αIIbβ3 activation even in the absence of GPV and the binding sites for 14-3-3 and ABP. Taken together, these studies show that the function of integrin adhesion receptors can be regulated not only by interaction of soluble ligands with heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors but also by signals transmitted following occupancy of a non-integrin adhesion receptor. Moreover, they suggest that signaling molecules used by GPIb-IX to induce αIIbβ3 activation differ from those used by the thrombin receptor. The monoclonal antibody against αIIbβ3 used for FACS analysis was purchased from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME) and that used for inhibition of cell spreading was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The polyclonal antibodies against αvβ3 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The F(ab′)2 fragment against αIIbβ3 (clone CRC64) was a kind gift of Tatiana Byzova (The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland). Monoclonal antibodies against GPIbα (mAb Ib-4 and mAb Ib-23) were generously provided by Dr. B. Steiner (Hoffmann-La Roche). A monoclonal antibody against GPIb-IX was purchased from Immunotech. The polyclonal antibody against GPV was generously provided by Dr. D. Phillips (COR Therapeutics Inc., San Francisco). Fluorescently labeled PAC-1 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. S. J. Shattil (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The antibodies against major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (clone W6.32) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and against VCAM-1 were purchased from Chemicon. Venous blood was drawn from healthy donors, and from patients M. M. and N. L. with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (whose platelets lack αIIbβ3 (38.George J.N. Nurden A.T. Phillips D.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1084-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). Blood from the thrombasthenic patients was kindly made available by Robert L. Abel of Christiana Hospital, Newark, DE. Platelets were isolated by centrifugation and washed as described previously (39.Fox J.E.B. Aggerbeck L.P. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4882-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 109 platelets/ml at 37 °C in a Tyrode's buffer containing 138 mm sodium chloride, 2.9 mm potassium chloride, 12 mmsodium bicarbonate, 0.36 mm sodium phosphate, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm calcium chloride, and 0.4 mm magnesium chloride, pH 7.4. Platelet suspensions were stirred in the presence of 4 μg/ml vWf (American Bioproducts, Parsippany, NJ) and 1 mg/ml ristocetin (Sigma) for 5 min. In some experiments 200 μg/ml fibrinogen (isolated from human plasma and kindly provided by Dr. Stanley D'Souza of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland) was included. In others, platelets were preincubated with apyrase (2 units/ml) and aspirin (1 mm) for 30 min. Incubations were terminated by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 10 mmEGTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mg/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 100 mm benzamidine (Sigma), 2 mmsodium orthovanadate (Fisher), and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), pH 7.4 (40.Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were immediately centrifuged at 15,600 × g at 4 °C for 4 min to obtain the low speed detergent-insoluble pellet. Detergent-insoluble and -soluble fractions were solubilized by addition of an SDS-containing buffer in the presence of reducing agent (40.Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), denatured at 95 °C, and electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins present in the fractions were detected by transferring samples to nitrocellulose and incubating the resulting Western blots with antibodies against proteins of interest. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and stably transfected with the cDNA encoding GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX along with psv2-neo plasmid containing resistance to neomycin as described previously (30.Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To obtain CHO cells co-expressing αIIbβ3, the cDNA's encoding the amino acid sequences for αIIb and β3 were subcloned into pDX vector. CHO cells expressing GPIb-IX complex were transfected with 10 μg of each of the plasmids along with 1 μg of psv2-hph vector DNA containing hygromycin B resistance gene (ATCC). For some experiments, cells containing GPIb-IX-V complex were transfected with αIIb and β3 cDNAs. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable CHO cells were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing growth medium. The expression of αIIbβ3 on the cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry using αIIbβ3 complex-specific antibody (Immunotech), and the expression of GPIb-IX was analyzed using a monoclonal antibody against the complex GPIb-IX (mAb SZ1, Immunotech). Clones of transfected cells were selected using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) after labeling of the cells with antibodies directed against GPIb-IX or αIIbβ3. Platelet suspensions were allowed to settle onto dishes that had been previously coated with 5 μg/ml vWf (American Bioproducts, Parsippany, NJ) in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml ristocetin (Sigma). In some experiments, platelets were preincubated for 30 min with an antibody against GPIbα (mAb Ib-23) (10 μg/ml) which inhibits the interaction between GPIb-IX and vWf or with an antibody against αIIbβ3 (10 μg/ml). In other experiments, as indicated, platelets were preincubated for 30 min with 4 mm Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide (Sigma) or for 30 min with 2 units/ml of apyrase (Sigma) and 1 mm aspirin (Sigma). After 30 min of spreading, platelets were fixed, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and actin filaments stained with 1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) as described previously (30.Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37.Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml botrocetin (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland) in serum-free media and plated on Lab-Tek glass chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) that had been previously coated with 5 μg/ml vWf and saturated with 3% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 4 mm RGDS, 2 mm EDTA, or 20 μg/ml antibodies against αvβ3 or F(ab′)2 fragment of antibody against αIIbβ3. After 30 min to 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and actin filaments stained with TRITC-labeled phalloidin. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica DMR-HC fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS-SP Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a Micromax cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Inc., Trenton, NJ) and Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Platelet suspensions were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with fluorescently labeled PAC-1 monoclonal antibody in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml ristocetin and 10 μg/ml vWf. Platelets were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, and the binding of PAC-1 was quantitated by flow cytometry. Binding of PAC-1 to GPIb-IX/αIIbβ3-expressing CHO cells was assessed in the same way except that incubations were performed for 15 min and the cells washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde prior to analysis by flow cytometry. GPIb-IX can bind to vWf in the blood vessel wall but is not able to bind to vWf immobilized on glass unless a modulator such as ristocetin or botrocetin is present (25.Read M.S. Smith S.V. Lamb M.A. Brinkhous K.M. Blood. 1989; 74: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Howard M.A. Firkin B.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1971; 26: 362-369PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if platelets are allowed to settle onto vWf-coated glass they do not adhere unless ristocetin is present (Fig. 1, comparepanels A and B). αIIbβ3 is not able to bind to vWf unless it has become activated (10.Kieffer N. Fitzgerald L. Wolf D. Cheresh D. Phillips D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 41.Ruggeri Z.M. Bader R. De Marco L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6038-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); thus all of the binding induced in the presence of ristocetin results from interaction of GPIb-IX with vWf. This can be demonstrated by using antibodies against GPIb-IX (Fig. 1,panel C), which totally inhibit platelet binding. Although αIIbβ3 is not able to bind to vWf when GPIb-IX-vWf interactions are prevented, αIIbβ3 is converted to a form that can bind vWf once GPIb-IX-vWf interactions have taken place. This is not seen as an increased number of adherent platelets, because activation of αIIbβ3 only occurs in platelets that are already adherent through GPIb-IX. However, it is detected by the spreading that occurs once αIIbβ3 has bound ligand and transmits signals leading to cytoskeletal reorganizations (Fig. 1, panel A). The fact that spreading results from αIIbβ3-induced signaling is demonstrated inpanel D in which antibodies against αIIbβ3 prevented spreading or inpanel E in which RGDS (which inhibits the interaction of αIIbβ3 with ligand but does not affect that of GPIb-IX with vWf) markedly reduced spreading. Platelets that lacked αIIbβ3 (from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia) adhered but showed little spreading (data not shown). Both adhesion and spreading occurred even in the presence of aspirin and apyrase (panel F) supporting the idea that integrin activation occurred as a direct consequence of GPIb-IX-induced signaling and was not due to ADP or thromboxane secreted from the platelet. To determine whether the GPIb-IX-induced conversion of αIIbβ3 to a form that can bind vWf results from an altered functional state of the integrin (rather than from a GPIb-IX-induced change in the conformation of vWf) that allows αIIbβ3 to bind to vWf, we determined whether GPIb-IX-induced signaling also altered the ability of αIIbβ3 to bind the fibrinogen mimetic monoclonal antibody PAC-1 (8.Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the soluble ligand fibrinogen. The binding of PAC-1 to platelets in suspension was quantitated by flow cytometry. Because of problems associated with measuring binding of ligand to aggregated cells, the experiments were performed in the absence of stirring. As shown in Fig. 2, we were able to detect an increase in the binding of PAC-1 following incubation with vWf (p = 0.001, unpaired ttest). Moreover, this increase was diminished by the presence of a F(ab′)2 fragment of an αIIbβ3antibody (p = 0.01). A consequence of ligand binding to αIIbβ3in suspensions of aggregating platelets is the incorporation of αIIbβ3 into the insoluble fraction that can be sedimented by centrifugation of Triton X-100 lysates at lowg forces (typically 15,600 × g) (40.Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Kouns W.C. Fox C.F. Lamoreaux W.J. Coons L.B. Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13891-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,43.Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Edwards H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, as another method of determining whether GPIb-IX-induced signaling induced fibrinogen binding in platelet suspensions, we stirred platelets with ristocetin and vWf in the presence and absence of fibrinogen, isolated the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletons, and assayed for the presence of αIIbβ3 in the detergent-insoluble fractions. Because the presence of ristocetin in detergent-lysed platelets is known to affect the sedimentation properties of the platelet membrane skeleton, we included a control that contained ristocetin alone. Fig. 3 shows that, as expected, the presence of ristocetin caused most of the GPIb-IX, which is associated with the membrane skeleton, to be recovered in the low speed detergent-insoluble pellet (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, in contrast to GPIb-IX, most of the αIIbβ3 remained in the detergent-soluble fraction unless vWf was present in the incubation (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 4, and 6). The vWf-induced redistribution of αIIbβ3 to the low speed pellet was initiated by interaction between GPIb-IX and vWf as it was prevented by inclusion of antibodies that inhibited this interaction (data not shown). The redistribution was not initiated by thromboxane A2 or by secreted ADP, as similar redistributions were detected in samples in which platelets were preincubated with aspirin and apyrase (lanes 6 of Fig. 3). The finding that αIIbβ3 was incorporated into the cytoskeleton even in the absence of fibrinogen is consistent with the observation in spreading platelets (Fig. 1) that signaling induced by GP-Ib-IX-vWf interactions leads to association of vWf with αIIbβ3. However, inclusion of fibrinogen, which is the preferred ligand for αIIbβ3 in plasma, in the incubations, led to an even greater incorporation of αIIbβ3into the cytoskeleton supporting the idea that GPIb-IX-induced signaling converts αIIbβ3 to a form that can bind soluble ligand (compare lanes 3 and4 of Fig. 3). Quantitation of Western blots by densitometry revealed that the amount of αIIbβ3 present in the low speed cytoskeletal fraction when fibrinogen was present was 1.3-fold that of the amount when only vWf was present (p = 0.01, paired t test, three different experiments). Fibrinogen alone was not sufficient to induce a significant redistribution of αIIbβ3 into the low speed pellet (Fig. 3, lane 5) showing the importance of GPIb-IX-vWf-induced signaling in initiating an event that allows fibrinogen to induce αIIbβ3activation. With the exception of B-lymphocytes, previous attempts to induce integrin activation in transfected cell systems by activation of signaling pathways involved in thrombin-induced activation in platelets have been unsuccessful. To determine whether GPIb-IX-induced signaling pathways could lead to activation of αIIbβ3 in a nucleated cell model, we transfected CHO cells with the cDNA for αIIbβ3 in the presence or absence of the three subunits of the GPIb-IX complex (GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX). Clones expressing similar amounts of αIIbβ3(as assessed by FACS analysis) were selected in order to compare spreading (Fig. 4, panel A). To determine whether GPIb-IX transmitted signals in these cells, cells were allowed to settle onto vWf-coated dishes in the presence of the modulator botrocetin. As shown in Fig. 4(panel B), cells transfected with αIIbβ3 alone showed little adhesion to the vWf-coated dishes; those that settled showed little spreading. In contrast, cells that also contained GPIb-IX attached to vWf and spread (Fig. 4, panel C). Quantitation of 10 random fields taken from two representative experiments showed that 17 ± 4.0 (S.D.) cells adhered/field when GPIb-IX was absent and 54 ± 9.4 (S.D.) cells/field adhered when GPIb-IX was present. The importance of GPIb-IX-vWf interactions in mediating adhesion was also shown by decreased attachment if botrocetin was omitted or if an antibody against GPIbα was included (data not shown). In contrast, the spreading of the adherent cells was induced by signaling across integrins, as shown by in"

In this report, we present evidence that a collagen triple helix can also be formed in the Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 peptide, if the proline (Pro) in the Xaa position is replaced with 4-trans-hydroxyproline (Hyp). Furthermore, replacement of Pro with Hyp in the sequence Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr(β-d-Gal))10-NH2increases the T m of the triple helix by 15.7 °C. It is generally believed that Hyp in the Xaa position destabilizes the triple helix because (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 form stable triple helices but the peptide (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 does not. Our data suggest that the destabilizing effect of Hyp relative to Pro in the Xaa position is only true in the case of (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10. Increasing concentrations of galactose in the solvent stabilize the triple helix of Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 but to a much lesser extent than that achieved by covalently linked galactose.

N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl The collagens of both vertebrates and invertebrates share the same characteristic repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa tripeptide units that are required for the formation of the collagen triple helix. In vertebrates and most invertebrates, Xaa is often proline and Yaa is often 4-trans-hydroxyproline, and the thermal stability of a triple helix from a particular species increases as the total content of these imino acids increases (1Burjanadze T.V. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An exception to this correlation is the cuticle collagen of the deep sea hydrothermal vent wormRiftia pachyptila. This collagen has a relatively high thermal stability (T m = 37 °C) despite a low content of Pro/Hyp residues (∼5%) (2Gaill F. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Engel J. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis and partial sequencing of the cuticle collagen revealed that there is a high content of threonine residues and that these are glycosylated, mainly with di- and trisaccharides of galactose (3Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observation of di- and trisaccharides of galactose is consistent with the carbohydrate compositions of the cuticle collagens ofLumbricus terrestris (earthworm) and Nereis virens (clamworm). Also consistent is the positional specificity of Hyp, which for these collagens seems to primarily occur in the Xaa position rather than the Yaa position (4Sharma Y.D. Tanzer M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 5Goldstein A. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5478-5483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the L. terrestris cuticle collagen, the sequence -Gly-Hyp-Ser- accounts for 4–5% of the total hydroxyproline content (5Goldstein A. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5478-5483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the vertebrate collagens, 4-Hyp is found exclusively in the Yaa position, and studies of collagen-like peptides show that although the peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10formed stable triple helices, the peptide (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10did not (6Inouye K.E. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Kishida Y. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From this study it was concluded that Hyp in the Xaa position does not contribute to the stability and is destabilizing to the triple helix. Indeed, even though the Hyp content of the L. terrestris cuticle collagen is high (16–18%), the thermal stability is low (T m = 22 °C) (7Harrington W.F. Rao N.V. Ramachandran G.N. Conformation of Biopolymers. Academic Press, New York1967: 513-531Crossref Google Scholar). Also, for theR. pachyptila cuticle collagen, which has a low content of Pro/Hyp residues (∼5%), it was suggested that glycosylation of Thr with galactose must compensate for the presence of Hyp in the Xaa position to achieve the high observed thermal stability (3Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that substitution of Thr by Thr-O-(β-d-galactose) in the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 induces the formation of a collagen triple helix, with the latter peptide having essentially a random coil structure in aqueous solution (8Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this report we extend these studies to investigate the replacement of Pro by Hyp in the Xaa position of the peptides Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2and Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr(βGal))10-NH2. Peptides were synthesized using a Milligen 9050 peptide synthesizer. Couplings were carried out on a PAL-PEG-PS resin (Perseptive Biosystems, 0.16 mmol/g) using Fmoc1(N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids (Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Hyp(tBu)-OH, Perseptive Biosystems, 4.0 eq) and (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (Perseptive Biosystems, 4.0 eq)-mediated peptide couplings. The glycopeptide was synthesized using Fmoc-O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)-Thr-OH, which was prepared according to Elofsson et al. (9Elofsson M. Walse B. Kihlberg J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 7613-7616Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography. Treatment of the glycopeptide with 6 mm sodium methoxide in methanol overnight removed the acetyl protecting groups on the sugar (10Kihlberg J. Elofsson M. Salvador L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 221-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The peptide was again purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and all peptides were characterized by amino acid analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter using a Peltier thermostatted cell holder and a 1-mm path length rectangular cell. All measurements were performed in water, and peptide concentrations in all cases were 100 μm. Concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The wavelength spectra represent an average of 8 scans. Thermal transitions were recorded from 5 to 70 °C at 223 nm, and the temperature was raised at a rate of 12 °C/h. The thermal transitions were fit to the all-or-none equation as described (11Engel J. Chen H.-T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to calculate the T m, ΔH0(van't Hoff), and ΔS0.d-Galactose was purchased from Sigma. A stock solution of galactose (0.41 g/ml) was prepared by dissolving galactose in water and measuring the optical rotation in a Perkin-Elmer Model 241 MC polarimeter, using a 10-cm cell at room temperature. The concentration was determined based upon an [α]D value of +80.2 as listed in the Merck Index. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out on a Beckman Model E analytical ultracentrifuge using double-sector cells. Peptides were dissolved in water to 0.5 and 0.3 mg/ml for the peptides Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr(βGal))10-NH2, respectively. The temperature was regulated to 4.3 °C, and the wavelength for monitoring was at 230 nm. Weight-average molecular weights were determined by fitting the data using Scientist®.(Micromath, Salt Lake City, Utah). Partial specific volumes of 0.71 cm3/g for Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10 -NH2 and 0.67 cm3/g for Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr(βGal)10-NH2 were calculated from the amino acid composition and galactose content (12Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However no value has been published for hydroxyproline, so the value for proline was used. The temperature dependence of the partial heat capacity was measured in an MC-2 differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The heating rate was 13 °C/h, and the data were collected and analyzed using the software provided by the manufacturer. Previous evidence using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr(β-d-Gal)10-NH2formed a collagen triple helix whereas the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 could not (8Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A compares the CD spectra of Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 (8Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to that of Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 and in water at 5 °C. Only the latter peptide exhibits the CD spectral characteristics of a collagen triple helix, with a positive ellipticity [θ] at 223 nm and a large negative minimum at 198 nm (13Brown III F.R. Hopfinger A.J. Blout E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This ellipticity value at 198 nm for Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 (−30,000 degrees cm2 dmol−1) is similar to what is observed for the peptide (Pro-Ser-Gly)n, ([θ]198 nm = −27,400 degrees cm2dmol−1), which even at fairly high molecular weights (18,000) exhibits a mostly random-coil structure (13Brown III F.R. Hopfinger A.J. Blout E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of the CD spectrum of Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 is shown in Fig.1 B and exhibits a highly cooperative transition with aT m of 19.2 °C. Equilibrium sedimentation of the peptide in water gave a weight-average molecular weight of 9780 ± 100, which is slightly higher than the expected mass of the trimer (8315 Da) and is presumably due to an error in the calculated partial specific volume and/or the presence of a small amount of aggregates. The far-UV CD spectra of Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr(βGal))10-NH2 is shown in Fig.2 A, along with the CD spectrum of Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr(βGal))10-NH2, which has been reported recently (8Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The overall shape of the spectra is the same, with the Hyp peptide having a slightly lower ellipticity at 198 nm and a slightly larger ellipticity at 220 nm. The insetshows the CD spectra at 70 °C for both peptides, which is above their respective T m (see Fig. 2 B). The ellipticity values at 200 nm are similar, suggesting that the differences in the CD at 5 °C are not due to a concentration artifact. Fig. 2 B shows the dependence of the ellipticity at 223 nm as a function of temperature for both Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr(βGal))10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr(βGal))10-NH2. TheT m of the Gly-Hyp-Thr(βGal) peptide is 54.8 °C, whereas the T m of the Gly-Pro-Thr(βGal) peptide is 39.2 °C. Equilibrium sedimentation of the former peptide gave a weight-average molecular weight of 12,650 ± 100, slightly less than the calculated mass of the trimer (13,150 Da), probably due to an error in the calculated partial specific volume and/or the presence of a small amount of monomeric chains. To determine if galactose, by itself, could have a similar influence as having the galactose covalently linked to threonine, we measured the thermal stability of both Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2 in increasing concentrations of galactose in water (Fig.3, A and B). Fig.3 A shows the influence of galactose at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0m on the CD spectra of Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-NH2 and Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2. Little difference in the CD of either peptide is observed at around 220 nm. For the peptide Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr)10-NH2, theT m was measured by again monitoring the change in ellipticity at 223 nm as a function of temperature. A linear increase in T m is observed as the concentration of galactose increases (Fig. 3 B). We estimated of the effective concentration of galactose required to match that of having the carbohydrate covalently linked to threonine. Based upon the predicted dimensions from molecular modeling of the peptide Ac-(Gly-Pro-Thr(βGal)5-NHCH3, the effective concentration is about 1.6 m. However, theT m at 2 m galactose is only about 33 °C compared with the near 55 °C T m for Ac-(Gly-Hyp-Thr(βGal))10-NH2. The above data show the favorable influence of glycosylation on the thermal stability of the triple helix, as has been shown (8Bann J.G. Peyton D.H. Bächinger H.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous measurements on the effects of various sugars and polyols on the stability of the triple helix of calf skin collagen suggested that the observed linear increase in T m with increasing concentrations of sugars is due to an effect on the structure of water (14Gekko K. Koga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The influence of various solvents on the stability of the peptide (Pro-Ser-Gly)n was studied (15Brown III F.R. Di Corato A. Lorenzi G.P. Blout E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although (Pro-Ser-Gly)n could not form a triple helix in water, this polypeptide had the propensity to form a triple helix, because in the solvent 1,3-propanediol the molecules exhibited the CD spectral features of a triple helix. A similar observation was made with the peptide H-(Gly-Pro-Thr)10-Gly-Pro-Cys-Cys-OH, which in the solvent 1,2-propanediol also forms a triple helix (3Mann K. Mechling D.E. Bächinger H.P. Eckerskorn C. Gaill F. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of other solvents to stabilize the triple helix was also investigated by Brown et al. (15Brown III F.R. Di Corato A. Lorenzi G.P. Blout E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and it was found that both neat trifluoroethanol and hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol destabilize the triple helix, whereas the polyhydric alcohols glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,3-propanediol are stabilizing. It was suggested from these studies that the weaker hydrogen bonding solvents provide a more favorable environment than water in which to form the interchain hydrogen bonds. Presumably the effect of sugars and polyols would be manifested in a decrease in the activity of water and the ability of water to interact with the polypeptide backbone. Thus, peptide backbone-water hydrogen bonds would be disfavored relative to peptide-peptide hydrogen bonds. A possible mechanism of stabilization by O-glycosylation then is to change the local environment of the peptide backbone such that water-backbone interactions are disfavored and the interchain hydrogen bonds become favored. While the values for ΔH0 and ΔS0 for the galactosylated peptides are very similar to the values reported for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 (see TableI), the transition curve for (Gly-Hyp-Thr)10 is much steeper. This is reflected by a much larger enthalpy change for this peptide. This large change in enthalpy was confirmed by calorimetry. One possible explanation is that when threonine and hydroxyproline are contiguous, there is a strongly enthalpic interaction (probably a hydrogen bond) between the side-chain OH groups within a chain, between chains, or with water molecules. This interaction is compensated by a very large loss in entropy, possibly the side-chain movement of threonine or in the movement of water molecules (bound to the side chains).Table IComparison of thermodynamic parameters for the triple helix ⇄ coil transition of various peptidesPeptideT m1-aMelting temperaturesT m are concentration-dependent and are indicated for the concentration c.

Open table in a new tab The stabilizing influence of Hyp in the Xaa position may be explained by either an increase in the number of stable hydrogen bonds with water (16Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) or through a stereoelectronic inductive effect (17Eberhardt E.S. Panasik Jr., N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12261-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We favor the latter hypothesis, because based upon the water binding mechanism the peptide Gly-Pro-Thr (and Gly-Pro-Ser) should form a stable triple helix as was suggested recently (18Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The OH group of Hyp is effective at withdrawing electrons away from the imide bond and results in a change in the equilibrium constant for cis ⇆ transisomerization, favoring the trans isomer. Because all peptide bonds in the triple helix are trans, there is a cumulative increase in stability as the number of stabletrans isomers increases. Thus, having Hyp in the Xaa position would increase the stability of the triple helix by also increasing the number of trans isomers. Why then does (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 not form a triple helix? One possibility is that the stereoconfiguration of the proline ring in the Yaa position is altered if the Pro in the Xaa position is Hyp. The recent crystal structures (19Nagarajan V. Kamitori S. Okuyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Kramer R.Z. Vitagliano L. Bella J. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Brodsky B. Zagari A. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) show that the Pro in the Xaa position is in general puckered down, while the Hyp or Pro in the Yaa position is always puckered up. This configuration in puckering between two contiguous prolines or with Pro-Hyp may not be favored if the Hyp is in the Xaa position and may result in an upward puckering in the Xaa and a downward puckering for Pro in the Yaa. This could then in turn change the Xaa psi angle between the two proline residues, favoring a value other than around 160o as reported for collagen and collagen-like peptides (19Nagarajan V. Kamitori S. Okuyama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Kramer R.Z. Vitagliano L. Bella J. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Brodsky B. Zagari A. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The presence of Hyp in the Xaa position for the cuticle collagens ofL. terrestris, N. virens, and R. pachyptila suggest that a novel hydroxylating enzyme is present in these organisms that is distinct in specificity from the normal vertebrate prolyl-4-hydroxylase (21Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Such an enzyme has been described from the subcuticular epithelium of L. terrestris (22Adams E. Lamon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7591-7597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these studies, this enzyme would also be required for the normal stability of the triple helix of these collagens. We thank J. Gambee for help with peptide synthesis and amino acid analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1979756343,"In order to better understand the relative contribution of the different UV components of sunlight to solar mutagenesis, the distribution of the bipyrimidine photolesions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), (6-4) photoproducts ((6–4)PP), and their Dewar valence photoisomers (DewarPP) was examined in Chinese hamster ovary cells irradiated with UVC, UVB, or UVA radiation or simulated sunlight. The absolute amount of each type of photoproduct was measured by using a calibrated and sensitive immuno-dot-blot assay. As already established for UVC and UVB, we report the production of CPD by UVA radiation, at a yield in accordance with the DNA absorption spectrum. At biologically relevant doses, DewarPP were more efficiently produced by simulated solar light than by UVB (ratios of DewarPP to (6-4)PP of 1:3 and 1:8, respectively), but were detected neither after UVA nor after UVC radiation. The comparative rates of formation for CPD, (6-4)PP and DewarPP are 1:0.25 for UVC, 1:0.12:0.014 for UVB, and 1:0.18:0.06 for simulated sunlight. The repair rates of these photoproducts were also studied in nucleotide excision repair-proficient cells irradiated with UVB, UVA radiation, or simulated sunlight. Interestingly, DewarPP were eliminated slowly, inefficiently, and at the same rate as CPD. In contrast, removal of (6-4) photoproducts was rapid and completed 24 h after exposure. Altogether, our results indicate that, in addition to CPD and (6-4)PP, DewarPP may play a role in solar cytotoxicity and mutagenesis."

G., Morton, L. F., Peachey, A. R., Tuckwell, D. S., Farndale, R. W., and Barnes, M. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35–40). Platelet adhesion to these ligands is completely dependent on α2β1 in the presence of 2 mmMg2+. However, we show here that this interaction was abolished in the presence of 25 μm EGTA. Adhesion of Glanzmann's thrombasthenic platelets, which lack the fibrinogen receptor αIIbβ3, was also inhibited by micromolar EGTA. Mg2+-dependent adhesion of platelets was restored by the addition of 10 μmCa2+, but millimolar Ca2+ was inhibitory. Binding of isolated α2β1 to GFOGER-GPP was 70% inhibited by 50 μm EGTA but, as with intact platelets, was fully restored by the addition of micromolar Ca2+. 2 mm Ca2+ did not inhibit binding of isolated α2β1 to collagen or to GFOGER-GPP. Binding of recombinant α2 I-domain was not inhibited by EGTA, nor did millimolar Ca2+ inhibit binding. Our data suggest that high affinity Ca2+ binding to α2β1, outside the I-domain, is essential for adhesion to collagen. This is the first demonstration of a Ca2+ requirement in α2β1function."

Activity was restored when the inactivated enzyme was treated with reducing agents. Inactivation of creatine kinase by gliotoxin was accompanied by the formation of a 37-kDa form of the enzyme. This oxidized form of creatine kinase was rapidly reconverted to the 42-kDa species by the addition of reducing agents concomitant with restoration of activity. A 1:1 mixture of the oxidized and reduced monomer forms of creatine kinase as shown on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was equivalent to the activity of the fully reduced form of the enzyme consistent with only one reduced monomer of the dimer necessary for complete activity. Conversion of the second monomeric species of the dimer to the oxidized form by gliotoxin correlated with loss of activity. Our data are consistent with gliotoxin inducing the formation of an internal disulfide bond in creatine kinase by initially binding and possibly activating a cysteine residue on the protein, followed by reaction with a second neighboring thiol. The recently published crystal structure of creatine kinase suggests the disulfide is formed between Cys-282 and Cys-73. The biological activity of gliotoxin is dependent on the presence of a strained disulfide bond that can react with accessible cysteine residues on proteins. Rabbit muscle creatine kinase contains 4 cysteines per 42-kDa subunit and is active in solution as a dimer. Only Cys-282 has been identified as essential for activity. Modification of this residue results in loss of activity of the enzyme.

The recently published crystal structure of creatine kinase suggests the disulfide is formed between Cys-282 and Cys-73. epipolythiodioxopiperazine Gliotoxin is a member of the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP)1 class of biologically active fungal metabolites that is characterized by the presence of a bridged disulfide ring that is essential for activity (1Waring P.

Immunol. 1986; 23: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ETP toxins are produced by a number of fungi includingAspergillus fumigatus and have been shown to rapidly accumulate in cells (3Waring P. Newcombe N.R. Edel M. Lin Q.H. Jiang H. Sjaarda A. Piva T. Mullbacher A. Toxicon. 1988; 32: 491-504Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the perceived role of ETP toxins as fungal chemical defense agents. ETP toxins may contribute to the etiology of animal and human fungal diseases (4Bodey G. Bueltmann B. Duguid W. Gibbs D. Hanak H. Naoe S. Okudaira M. Scevola D. van't Wout J. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol.

Creatine kinase is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the reversible formation of ATP from creatine phosphate and ADP (11Watts D.C. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, NY1973: 384-451Google Scholar). Creatine kinase has been shown to be coupled to the action of ATP-dependent membrane ion pumps functioning in the rapid regeneration of ATP from ADP (12Walliman T. Schlosser T. Eppenberger H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5238-5246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rossi A.M. Eppenberger H.M. Volpe P. Cotrufo R. Walliman T. J. Biol.

Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of creatine kinase have been shown to display activity against a number of tumor cell lines (15Lillie J.W. O'Keefe M. Valinski H. Hamlin H.A. Varban M.L. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3172-3178PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle creatine kinase is believed to function as a non-covalently bound dimer of two identical 42-kDa monomers (16Walliman T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Because creatine kinase is sensitive to inactivation by reactive oxygen species and to thiol-specific agents, we examined the effect of gliotoxin on creatine kinase activity to gain information on intracellular targets for ETP toxins. In this study, we have shown the novel conversion of creatine kinase to a 37-kDa oxidized form consistent with intracellular disulfide formation and consequent loss of activity. The active 42-kDa native protein was regenerated on treatment with reducing agents. In addition, we propose that a single functioning reduced monomer in the creatine kinase dimer is sufficient for full activity whereas the second monomeric component in the oxidized form does not affect overall activity. Formation of the doubly oxidized dimer results in complete loss of activity. The intramolecular disulfide bond is most probably formed between the essential Cys-282 and Cys-73, which are physically in close proximity (17Rao J.K.M. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin, dithiothreitol, and glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Pepsin from porcine gastric mucosa was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Radiolabeled gliotoxin was prepared and purified using Penicillium terlikowskii fed with35S-labeled inorganic sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (3Waring P. Newcombe N.R. Edel M. Lin Q.H. Jiang H. Sjaarda A. Piva T. Mullbacher A. Toxicon. 1988; 32: 491-504Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle creatine kinase was purchased from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals and used without further purification. The kinase displayed a single major band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 42 kDa in the presence of dithiothreitol. A single contaminant that was identified as phosphoglycerate mutase was found in the Sigma sample but was present at less than 10% of the total protein. Activity was measured using either the enzyme-coupled method (18Tanzer M.L. Gilvarg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3201-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the thymol blue assay (19Yao Q.Z. Tian M. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2740-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) typically in the absence of reducing agents with a Carey UV-visible spectrophotometer. Both assays gave comparable results. Creatine kinase at 1 mg/ml (25 μm based on the monomer of 42 kDa) was incubated in NaOH/glycine buffer, pH 9, at 37 oC in a total volume of 1 ml for different time intervals with gliotoxin. A 5-μl aliquot was removed to assess enzyme activity. In some experiments, reducing agents were added to the reaction mixture either at zero time or after complete inactivation of the enzyme. Samples (30 μl) were also taken for non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was carried out using published procedures in the absence of reducing agent (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue. Autoradiography was carried out on dried gels using Kodak Biomax MR x-ray film with enhancing screens. Creatine kinase treated with 35S-labeled gliotoxin (100 μm) for 6 h was washed through a Centriprep-10 filter to remove unbound gliotoxin and digested with pepsin at 1% w/w for 3 h at 37 oC in 10% formic acid. Peptides were purified by two-dimensional chromatography using a thin layer electrophoresis system (Hunter). The first dimension (electrophoresis at 1 kV and 45 mA for 40 min) used 5% butyl alcohol, 2.5% acetic acid, 2.5% pyridine, and 90% water, pH 4.7, and the second dimension (chromatography over 5–6 h) used 39% butyl alcohol, 30% pyridine, 6% acetic acid, and 25% water as the mobile phase. The plate was air-dried, and labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. The labeled spots on the cellulose were placed in an Eppendorf tube with 100 μl of distilled water and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and were incubated overnight with complete transfer to the membrane. Sequencing was then carried out as described previously (6Waring P. Khan T. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17929-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of binding of gliotoxin to creatine kinase was determined by first generating a standard curve using graded concentrations of gliotoxin at known specific activity that were run on polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to film, and the bands were quantified using an enhanced laser densitometer (Ultrascan XL). A known mass of [35S]gliotoxin-labeled creatine kinase was also run in gels and similarly quantified, thus enabling the mass of gliotoxin associated with a known mass of protein to be calculated. Gels were exposed to allow for only those signals that fell in the linear portion of the standard curve to avoid saturation effects. Prior to drying and autoradiography, gels were also lightly stained with Coomassie Blue to determine the ratio of the 42-kDa (reduced) to 37-kDa (oxidized) forms of the enzyme. Incubation of creatine kinase with gliotoxin resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent loss of activity (Fig.1). Greater than 80% inactivation occurred by 6 h with 100 μm toxin. Gliotoxin at 1 and 10 μm had little effect on activity whereas the effect of 50 μm toxin was equivalent to 100 μm toxin (data not shown). We detected little or no inactivation in the first 90–120 min of incubation of creatine kinase with gliotoxin at 100 μm. The profile of inactivation is consistent with a time-dependent covalent interaction of gliotoxin with creatine kinase. Creatine kinase activity at 6 h in the presence of 50 μm gliotoxin was 25 ± 1.3% of control. In the continuous presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol or glutathione and gliotoxin, kinase activity was 93 ± 3 and 73 ± 13%, respectively. A trivial explanation for the protection seen in pretreatment with reducing agents is that the gliotoxin is now in the reduced form at time 0 and cannot easily form mixed disulfides with cysteine residues in the enzyme. More significant is the restoration of activity by dithiothreitol or glutathione after inactivation. In a separate experiment, 50 μm gliotoxin resulted in 19.5 ± 1% of the control activity at 6 h. Addition of either 1 mm dithiothreitol or glutathione at the 6-h point and re-assay 1 h later resulted in restoration of activity to 73.5 ± 1 and 56.2 ± 3% of the control, respectively. These results are consistent with inactivation caused by covalent modification of protein thiol(s) by gliotoxin and reversed by reduction of a newly formed S–S bond. The addition of reducing agents to ETP toxins has been shown to produce reactive oxygen species by inducing redox cycling of the dithiol to the disulfide form of the toxin (21Munday R. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1987; 7: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) although this is not observed with creatine kinase. Preliminary examination of native creatine kinase on polyacrylamide gels often revealed a second band of an apparent mass of 37 kDa that was present in varying amounts (Fig.2 A). This band was most apparent using longer and higher resolution gels in the absence of reducing agents. Microsequencing of this band showed this to be identical with native creatine kinase (data not shown). Reducing agents diminished or completely eliminated this band and correspondingly increased the 42-kDa band (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) implying that the 37-kDa band was an oxidized form of creatine kinase. To prepare the reduced form free from the 37-kDa form, creatine kinase was treated with 500 μm dithiothreitol and then exhaustively dialyzed to remove potentially interfering dithiothreitol. On some occasions, significant amounts of up to 50% of the 37-kDa species were formed after prolonged dialysis as shown in Fig.2 B, lane 1. The activity of the dialyzed sample when compared with creatine kinase stored in 500 μmdithiothreitol (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) was unaffected. In a separate experiment we determined that the presence of 100 μm gliotoxin resulted in the rapid formation of this new band at the expense of the 42-kDa band (Fig.3). Almost complete conversion occurs by 6 h concomitant with loss of greater than 80% of the enzyme activity. Fig. 3 shows the biphasic production of the 37-kDa oxidized form. Complete conversion to 50% of the oxidized 37-kDa form of creatine kinase occurs within minutes with a slower complete conversion over 6 h. Addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol resulted in conversion to the 42-kDa form (Fig. 4) with the restoration of enzymic activity. Gliotoxin at 10 μm, which has a negligible effect on enzyme activity (data not shown), also resulted in significant conversion to the oxidized form. As shown below, this new band cannot be attributed simply to the addition of molecule(s) of gliotoxin to creatine kinase.Figure 4Conversion of gliotoxin-treated creatine kinase from the oxidized to the reduced form with dithiothreitol. Lane 1, creatine kinase was treated with 100 μm gliotoxin for 6 h; lane 2, creatine kinase was treated with 10 μm gliotoxin for 6 h;lane 3, untreated creatine kinase; lane 4, untreated creatine kinase and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 60 min; lane 5, creatine kinase was treated with 10 μm gliotoxin for 6 h and 1 mmdithiothreitol for 60 min; lane 6, creatine kinase was treated with 100 μm gliotoxin for 6 h and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 60 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We consistently observed that the oxidized form of creatine kinase is formed within minutes of treatment with gliotoxin (Fig. 3) and that significant amounts of the 37-kDa form were produced with no loss in activity. We measured both the relative proportion of the 37-kDa band and the activity of the enzyme in the same experiment. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the amount of the 37-kDa form of creatine kinase and activity. There was no loss of activity until 50% of the protein had been converted to the 37-kDa form. The data in Fig. 5 are consistent with our proposal that it is the oxidation of the second monomer of the creatine kinase dimer that correlates with loss of activity. The solid lines in Fig. 5 were constructed as follows. All points corresponding to a proportion of ≥ 50% of the oxidized 37-kDa form were ignored, and a best fit line was constructed. Similarly, all points which corresponded to ≤ 50% of the oxidized form were then ignored to generate a second line of best fit. The data are consistent with initial oxidation of one monomer in the dimer (with no loss in total activity) followed by oxidation of the second monomer, which then results in loss of activity. Thedotted line in Fig. 5 is the theoretical line for this latter model shown in Scheme FS1. Autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels of creatine kinase treated with 35S-labeled gliotoxin clearly showed that both the 42- and 37-kDa forms could be covalently labeled (data not shown). A conventional approach of estimating the number of moles of toxin bound per mol of protein would give only an average stoichiometry and would therefore contain no information on the relative binding to the two forms. We used the alternative method described under “Materials and Methods” to determine stoichiometry. TableI shows the result of such an analysis. At 5 min, there was an almost exact 1:1 mixture of reduced/oxidized monomers of creatine kinase with only a fraction of either form labeled. This indicates that the conversion of reduced to oxidized creatine kinase can occur without any permanent covalent binding of the toxin to the monomer. By 3 h, there was 1 gliotoxin associated with the 37-kDa form and an average of 1.5 gliotoxin molecules associated with the 42-kDa form. At 4.5 h, there was 68% conversion with again only 1 mol of gliotoxin associated with the 37-kDa form. The remaining 32% of the 42-kDa form was associated with more than 3 mol of gliotoxin.Table IThe Stoichiometry of gliotoxin bound to creatine kinaseTime1-aTime after treatment with 100 μm gliotoxin.Composition1-bRatio of oxidized to reduced form of creatine kinase after treatment; untreated was 81% reduced (Red.) and 19% oxidized (Ox.).No. of gliotoxin bound1-cNumber of gliotoxin molecules bound per subunit (either the oxidized or reduced form).%5 min51 Ox.0.0875 min49 Red.<0.0803 h56 Ox.1.093 h44 Red.1.474.5 h68 Ox.0.944.5 h32 Red.3.41-a Time after treatment with 100 μm gliotoxin.1-b Ratio of oxidized to reduced form of creatine kinase after treatment; untreated was 81% reduced (Red.) and 19% oxidized (Ox.).1-c Number of gliotoxin molecules bound per subunit (either the oxidized or reduced form). Open table in a new tab Treatment with 10 μm gliotoxin, which results in a significant conversion of reduced to oxidized monomer of creatine kinase, showed less than 8% binding to creatine kinase even at 6 h (data not shown). Formation of the 37-kDa species was not simply due to the effect of increased covalent binding to gliotoxin. Neither the covalently modified reduced or oxidized form was altered in mobility relative to unmodified protein at 6 h. Pepsin in formic acid was used for digests to minimize scrambling of the radiolabel. A number of radiolabeled peptides were detected in digests of creatine kinase labeled with [35S]gliotoxin. The labeled peptide fragments that were isolated showed significant labeling of only Cys-253 and Cys-282. No peptides corresponding to Cys-73 and only trace amounts corresponding to Cys-145 were detected. A typical experiment revealed four radiolabeled spots with two-dimensional chromatography. Of these, sequencing of two showed peptide residues consistent with binding to only Cys-253 (Arg-Arg-Phe-Cys253-Val-Gly). Sequencing of the other two labeled spots showed peptide residues from Cys-253 and in lesser amounts Cys-282 (Val-Leu-Thr-Cys282-Pro-Ser-Asn-Leu). These results establish binding to Cys-253 at 6 h and possibly some lesser binding to Cys-282. The reactive cysteine in creatine kinase has been shown to be exclusively Cys-282 (22Buechter D.D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Kenyon G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2173-2178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Clottes E. Couthon F. Denoroy L. Vial C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) whereas the other cysteine residues (Cys-253, Cys-145, and Cys-73) are only accessible when the enzyme is denatured. Only two thiol groups per dimer are accessible top-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid during early denaturation, and these have been shown to be the two Cys-282 residues on each monomer (23Clottes E. Couthon F. Denoroy L. Vial C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At SDS/protein ratios exceeding 200, Cys-145 and Cys-253 become accessible. Cys-73 cannot be modified byp-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid even after complete denaturation by SDS (23Clottes E. Couthon F. Denoroy L. Vial C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cys-253 can become exposed under pressure (24Tanaka N. Tonai T. Kunugi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cys-145 is positioned near the monomer/monomer interface (17Rao J.K.M. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and may become exposed upon dimer dissociation. Rabbit muscle creatine kinase forms a dimer in solution (25Dawson D.M. Eppenberger H.M. Kaplan N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 21: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and it is proposed that this is the active form (26Degani Y. Degani C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5917-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) although there is evidence that the monomer can be active (27Wang X-C. Zhou H-M. Wang Z-X. Tsou C-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Grossman S.H. Gray K.A. Lense J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has demonstrated differential activity of the two Cys-282 residues on each monomer of the dimer. In the presence of Mg2+, ADP, creatine, and nitrate, which together form a “transition state analogue,” the reactive thiol groups react at significantly different rates (29Price N.C. Hunter M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 445: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A detailed kinetic study using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and iodoacetic acid confirmed the biphasic nature of the reaction with Cys-282 (30Wang Z-X. Preiss B. Tsou C-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Some modifying groups such as S-cyanide may initially bind to essential thiols and subsequently migrate or is lost, thus restoring enzymatic activity (31Hou L-X. Vollmer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been shown that regenerated creatine kinase following inactivation by S-thiomethylation is active and has only a single reactive thiol per dimer (32Hou L-X. Zhou J-X. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that the slower reacting Cys-282 pair of the dimer is required for activity with the faster reacting Cys-282 thiol, providing protection. The essential role of Cys-282 in catalysis has been the source of much investigation. Recent mutagenesis studies have shown that Cys-282 may play a role in substrate binding by maintaining the conformation of the active site but is not essential for catalysis (33Furter R. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of rabbit muscle creatine kinase has shown that Cys-282 is close to the active site region of the enzyme (17Rao J.K.M. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A faster running form of creatine kinase monomer has been identified using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was postulated as an oxidized non-reducible form of the enzyme that did not involve the essential Cys-282 (34Wang X-C. Wang F. Zou X.M. Zhou H.M. Sci. China Ser. B. 1994; 37: 964-974Google Scholar). The formation of internal disulfides in proteins is sufficient to induce conformational changes producing detectable alterations in mobility on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (35Hames, B. D. in Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins, A Practical Approach (Hames, B. D., and Rickwood, D., eds) pp. 1–139, Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom.Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence for a subtle relationship between the oxidized and reduced forms of the monomers of creatine kinase and enzymic activity. Formation of up to 50% of the 37-kDa form when assessed by a 1:1 distribution on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis leaves the activity unchanged. This is consistent with the proposal (32Hou L-X. Zhou J-X. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that only a single active thiol is required per dimer if in our results only one of the two monomers of the dimer is oxidized (SchemeFS1). The crystal structure of creatine kinase (17Rao J.K.M. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) shows that an internal disulfide can only be formed between Cys-282 and Cys-73. These residues are about 7 Å apart, and thus some movement in the region containing Cys-282 would be required to bring them close enough for reaction. 2G. Chelvanayagam, personal communication. This movement may be induced by covalent binding of gliotoxin to Cys-282. Reformation of the 42-kDa species by dithiothreitol is consistent with formation of such an internal disulfide. Further oxidation of the second monomer would account for subsequent loss of activity because the essential Cys-282 would now be internally modified in both monomers. Dithiothreitol releases free Cys-282 in both monomers and restores activity. Initial binding to Cys-282 forming a covalently bound complex as shown in Scheme FS2 is supported by our observation that peptides, albeit generally in minor amounts, corresponding to Cys-282 can be isolated from digests of modified creatine kinase. This activates Cys-282 to internal disulfide formation by Cys-73 with the subsequent loss of bound gliotoxin, a mechanism formally similar to reduction of disulfide bonds by glutathione (36Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This proposal is consistent with very little gliotoxin covalently associated with creatine kinase at 5 min even though half of the monomers have been converted to the 37-kDa form with no loss in activity. Monomer cross-linking does not occur because an 84-kDa species is not detected. The slower conversion of the second monomer to the 37-kDa form results in loss of all activity, enzyme denaturation, and modification of Cys-253 consistent with a single gliotoxin molecule associated with the oxidized form at 3 and 4.5 h. The increased binding to the minor 42-kDa form at 4.5 h may reflect further binding of gliotoxin to free thiol groups although labeled peptides corresponding to other residues were not detected. When gliotoxin forms a mixed disulfide, the second thiol of the toxin is exposed (Scheme FS2). Thus it may be possible for this thiol to react with a second gliotoxin resulting in an increase in associated label. The inactivation profile in Fig. 5 clearly supports our proposal that conversion to the 37-kDa form results in inactivation only when the second monomer of the dimer is so affected. We have identified a novel route to inactivation of rabbit muscle creatine kinase by the fungal toxin gliotoxin involving formation of an internal disulfide bond probably between the essential Cys-282 and Cys-73. This is the first direct evidence of the protective effect ascribed to modification of one monomer of the creatine kinase dimer via Cys-282 against a redox-active toxin. Gliotoxin has been shown to induce apoptosis in cells, and one possible cellular target for gliotoxin may be the mitochondria that play an essential role in apoptotic death (37Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is significant that gliotoxin has been shown to release calcium from isolated mitochondria by modification of as yet unidentified neighboring thiol groups (38Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13401-13405Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,39Silva J.P. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Redox Report. 1997; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial creatine kinase may be a component of the multiprotein mitochondrial pore (14Beutner G. Ruck A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and the possibility that gliotoxin is interacting with these organelles via creatine kinase is under investigation. Gliotoxin and its analogs can also induce intracellular calcium fluxes (40Beaver J.P. Waring P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 489-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possibly by allowing direct entry of calcium through the plasma membrane. 3A. M. Hurne, C. L. L. Chai, and P. Waring, manuscript in preparation. Inhibition of creatine kinase that is associated with plasma membrane ATP-dependent calcium pumps would disable this route of calcium extrusion and allow uncontrolled calcium increases.

https://openalex.org/W2042209823,"We present time-series spectropolarimetric observations of sunspots in the Ca II infrared triplet lines, which show a periodic occurrence of anomalous, asymmetric, circular polarization profiles in the umbral chromosphere. The profiles may be caused by the periodic development of an unresolved atmospheric component in a downward flowing magnetized environment. This active component with upward directed velocities as high as 10 kilometers per second is connected to the umbral flash (UF) phenomenon. We can explain the observations with a semiempirical model of the chromospheric oscillation and of the sunspot magnetized atmospheric plasma during a UF event."

N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4019) Google Scholar, 2.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). High blood levels of cholesterol correlate with atherosclerosis, and the former is further related to the contents of cholesterol and saturated fat in the diet. Most of the plasma cholesterol is present in low density lipoproteins (LDL),1 an essential component of the plasma lipid transport system. The metabolism of LDL involves recognition of its protein moiety apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) by specific receptors in the plasma membrane, followed by endocytotic uptake (for a review, see Ref. 3.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). The development of atherosclerosis is initiated by interactions of LDL with the arterial wall. Although the subsequent events have remained elusive, several lines of evidence point out the importance of LDL aggregation, alterations in the endothelium, macrophage chemotaxis and foam cell formation, and muscle cell migration and alteration to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (2.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). Oxidation of LDL has been recognized to represent a major pathogenic factor in the progression of atherosclerosis (4.Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 5.Heinecke J.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6.Parthasarathy S. Santanam N. Ramachandran S. Meilhac O. J. Lipid. Res. 1999; 40: 2143-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) involved has remained elusive. This modification of LDL leads to a proteolytic fragmentation of apoB-100 as well as formation of oxidized lipids. Moreover, several cellular effects have been shown to be induced by oxidized LDL, including proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, cellular cytotoxicity, procoagulant effect, increased antigenicity, and cell adhesion and recruitment (reviewed in Ref. 6.Parthasarathy S. Santanam N. Ramachandran S. Meilhac O. J. Lipid. Res. 1999; 40: 2143-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, LDL from atherosclerotic lesions is aggregated or has an increased tendency to aggregate (7.Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Aggregation of LDL can be induced in vitroand in vivo by several different mechanisms including vortexing (8.Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), accumulation of ceramide (9.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and binding to negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (10.Srinivasan S.R. Dolan P. Radhakrishnamurthy B. Berenson G.S. Atherosclerosis. 1972; 16: 95-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11.Camejo G. Lalaguna F. Lopez F. Starosta R. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 35: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and anionic phospholipids (12.Lauraeus S. Holopainen J.M. Taskinen M.-R. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated to indicate that the sphingomyelin content of LDL and deranged sphingomyelin metabolism play roles in the development of atherosclerosis (13.Jeong T.-S. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X.-C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In atherosclerotic lesions, the concentration of sphingomyelin is increased compared with normal arterial tissue. The hydrolytic product derived from sphingomyelin, ceramide, has also been shown to be enriched in plaques (9.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Ceramide has been suggested to function as a second messenger in apoptosis, growth suppression, differentiation, and cell senescence (14.Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) and to enhance the formation of atherosclerotic plaques (15.Kruth H.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In cellular membranes, ceramide is formed in addition to synthesis upon the removal of the phosphocholine moiety of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase. At an early stage in apoptosis, activation of sphingomyelinase is observed (16.Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Kolesnick R.N. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar), and subjecting cells to the action of externally added sphingomyelinase has been shown to cause apoptosis (17.Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The exact role of apoptosis in coronary heart disease remains unknown. Yet, the association of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia with an increased rate of apoptosis suggests that both apoptosis and inflammatory changes could have roles in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, involving the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway (18.Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19.Geng Y.J. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 251-266PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Han D.K.M. Haudenschild C.C. Hong M.K. Tinkle B.T. Leon M.B. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 267-277PubMed Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate sphingomyelinase activity to be associated with human plasma LDL. We hypothesize that the increased ceramide content of cells involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques is at least partly the result of this enzyme activity. Physiologically, the sphingomyelinase associated with human plasma LDL could provide a non-receptor-mediated mechanism for endocytic uptake of LDL cholesterol by cells. Hepes, EDTA, SOPC, and POPC were from Sigma, and Bodipy-ceramide and Bodipy-sphingomyelin were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). C16:0-sphingomyelin was purchased from Northern Lipids Inc. (Vancouver, Canada), DMPG was from Coatsome (Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan), and [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (specific activity 2.07 GBq/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CaCl2 dihydrate and MgCl2 hexahydrate were from Merck. The purity of the above lipids was checked by thin layer chromatography and revealed no impurities (21.Holopainen J.M. Angelova M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The concentrations of Bodipy-sphingomyelin and Bodipy-ceramide were determined spectrophotometrically using 91,000 cm−1 at 505 nm as their molar extinction coefficient. Concentrations of the other lipids were determined gravimetrically using a high precision electrobalance (Cahn, Cerritos, CA). Pro analysis grade solvents were from Merck. Human plasma VLDL (density fraction <1.006 g/ml), LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml), HDL2 (d = 1.063–1.125 g/ml), and HDL3 (d = 1.125–1.215 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from pooled or single donor plasma from healthy subjects (22.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdom J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6486) Google Scholar). For removal of KBr, LDL was dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (buffer A) at 4 °C. The mobility and purity of LDL was checked by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel at pH 8.6 (23.Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed in the presence of 8% SDS revealed no evidence for degradation of apoB-100. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated LDL (2.5 mg/ml) was first dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight. Thereafter, 12 μm CuSO4 was added, and the incubation continued for 24 h (25.Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of the lipid stock solutions were mixed in chloroform to obtain the desired compositions with Bodipy-sphingomyelin or Bodipy-ceramide (mole fraction (x) = 0.05) or [14C]sphingomyelin (x = 0.02) included as probes. The resulting mixtures were then evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and traces of solvent were subsequently removed by evacuating under reduced pressure for at least 12 h. The lipid residues were hydrated at 50 °C in buffer A to yield the desired lipid concentrations. The lipids were maintained at this temperature for 30 min prior to irradiation for 2 min in a bath type ultrasonicator (NEY Ultrasonik 104H, Yucaipa, CA). The resulting dispersions were subsequently processed to large unilamellar vesicles by extrusion through Millipore (Bedford, MA) 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate filters using a Liposofast-Pneumatic (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). Sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12) cleaves hydrolytically the phosphoester bond of sphingomyelin, yielding ceramide and phosphocholine. Preliminary qualitative observation of sphingomyelinase activity was done using liposomes composed of POPC/DMPG/C16:0-sphingomyelin/Bodipy-sphingomyelin (mole fractions 0.7:0.1:0.15:0.05; 22.5 μm total lipid). The negatively charged DMPG was present to enhance the association of LDL with the liposomes (12.Lauraeus S. Holopainen J.M. Taskinen M.-R. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The above liposomes were incubated (for 24 h at 37 °C) with isolated human plasma LDL (0.125 mg/ml) in buffer A. Ceramide was isolated on TLC and thereafter visualized by UV illumination. In order to determine the time course of hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide, [14C]sphingomyelin (x = 0.02, 2 kBq) was included in POPC/DMPG/C16:0-sphingomyelin (0.7:0.1:0.18, molar fraction) liposomes. Subsequently, the enzyme reactions were started at 37 °C by the addition of human plasma LDL (0.125 mg/ml). Final concentration of lipids was 22.5 μm in 2 ml of buffer A. At the indicated time points, the reactions were stopped by adding 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v). The lower organic phase was separated and concentrated by evaporating the solvents, after which 50 μl of chloroform was added to dissolve the lipids. [14C]sphingomyelin was separated from the reaction mixture on a TLC plate using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v) as a solvent system. Hydrolysis of [14C]sphingomyelin was quantitated on TLC plates using a BAS-1800 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were repeated at least twice. Lipid stock solutions were mixed in chloroform to obtain the desired composition, with Bodipy-sphingomyelin (x = 0.05) included as a fluorescent probe. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and subsequent evacuation under reduced pressure for at least 12 h. The dry residue was dissolved in diethylether/methanol (9:1, v/v) to yield 1 mm final total lipid concentration. Approximately 1 μl of this solution was applied onto the surface of a Pt-electrode (26.Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1986; 81: 303-311Crossref Google Scholar), which was then dried with a stream of nitrogen and evacuation in vacuum for 1 h. A glass chamber with the attached electrodes and with a quartz window bottom was placed on the stage of a Zeiss IM-35 inverted fluorescence microscope. A 0.2-V AC voltage (f = 4 Hz) was applied prior to adding 1.3 ml of 0.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. During the first minute of hydration, the voltage was raised to 1 V. After 24 h, the AC field was turned off, and giant liposomes were observed through a Nikon ELWD (× 20) objective. The excitation and emission wavelengths were selected with filters (Melles-Griot) transmitting in the range of 420–480 nm and >500 nm, respectively. Fluorescence images were taken with a Peltier-cooled digital camera (C4742-95, Hamamatsu, Japan) connected to a computer. Micropipettes with inner tip diameters of approximately 1 μm (27.Schnorf M. Potrykus I. Neuhaus G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were made from borosilicate capillaries (1.2-mm outer diameter) by a microprocessor-controlled horizontal puller (P-87, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). LDL in buffer A at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml was injected to the microcapillary from the open end before excess pressure was used to form a small drop on the tip of the capillary. This first drop was washed with water to ensure that the capillary was open. The micropipette was then rapidly immersed into the aqueous phase and adjusted close to the surface of the GUV. Small aliquots of LDL were applied onto the outer surface of individual giant vesicles with a pneumatic microinjector (PLI-100, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY). For easier handling, only vesicles attached to the electrode surface were used. Amino acid sequences of human apoB-100 and Bacillus cereus, Leptospira interrogans, and Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase were retrieved from Swiss-Prot and aligned with CLUSTAL W (version 1.74, Pôle Bio-Informatique; Ref. 28.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar) and the local similarity program SIM (29.Huang X. Miller W.A. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In the course of our investigations on the properties and metabolic processing of LDL, we came to the conclusion that it would be worthwhile to explore the possibility that sphingomyelinase activity was associated with LDL. In a qualitative assay, we used sphingomyelin contained in liposomes (POPC/DMPG/C16:0-sphingomyelin, mole fraction 0.7:0.1:0.15, respectively) and also incorporating the fluorescent sphingomyelin analog Bodipy-sphingomyelin (x = 0.05) as a tracer. Isolated human plasma LDL (0.125 mg/ml) was added, and after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C lipids were isolated on TLC and visualized by UV illumination (Fig. 1). The formation of ceramide is evident in the presence of LDL but not in the control lacking this lipoprotein. Other lipoproteins,viz. human plasma VLDL, HDL2, and HDL3, were also devoid of sphingomyelinase activity (data not shown). The time course of enzymatic hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in POPC/DMPG/C16:0-sphingomyelin (0.7:0.1:0.2, mole fraction) LUVs was determined by following the loss of [14C]sphingomyelin radioactivity by TLC and radioimaging (Fig.2). Initial degradation of sphingomyelin was relatively slow, and no hydrolysis was evident after the first 30 min. After 90 min, approximately 33% of the radioactive sphingomyelin was degraded, and upon further incubation for 3 h, the extent of hydrolysis increased to approximately 35%. Of the 9 nmol of sphingomyelin in the LUV substrate, >95% was converted into ceramide within 24 h. Importantly, the extent of hydrolysis exceeded 50% of the initial sphingomyelin in the bilayer. This indicates rearrangements in the transbilayer lipid distribution in the course of the enzyme reaction, in keeping with our previous observations (30.Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Reasons for the lag are unclear at present yet could be related to lipid packing. Accordingly, the activity of sphingomyelinase toward sphingomyelin monolayers remained constant up to a surface pressure of 18 millinewtons/meter, whereas increasing the pressure attenuated the hydrolysis and prolonged the lag time (31.Fanani M.L. Maggio B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sphingomyelinase activity of different LDL samples exhibited considerable variation. Accordingly, six different LDL preparations either pooled or from a single donor were used, and the maximum hydrolysis in 24 h varied from 5 to 100% of the total sphingomyelin present. The reason(s) for this variation remains unknown. The activities from single donors did not correlate with age, sex, or body mass index (data not shown), and further investigations are needed to address this issue. One possibility could be a varying degree of initial oxidation between the LDL preparations (see below). The conjugated lipid dienes generated during lipid peroxidation of LDL exhibit an absorption maximum around 234 nm and can be directly measured from aqueous LDL solution (25.Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). In order to determine if the sphingomyelinase activity associated with LDL was connected to its oxidation, we measured the latter by absorbance at 234 nm in the presence of the substrate. After 24 h of incubation, there was negligible decrease in absorbance at 234 nm (data not shown), indicating a lack of enhanced LDL oxidation in the course of its interaction with liposomes. Concomitantly, during the first 3 h of incubation, aggregation of LDL was evident as increased light scattering at a 90° angle at 500 nm (data not shown). The formation of larger mass aggregates was subsequently followed by precipitation, indicated by a decrease in scattering intensity after 24 h of incubation. However, LDL oxidized by copper (25.Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar) was completely devoid of sphingomyelinase activity (Fig. 2). This finding is in keeping with the known effects of oxidation on LDL. More specifically, oxidation induces the formation of a number of proteolytic fragments from the single polypeptide chain constituting apoB-100, which could thus disrupt the conformation of apoB-100 required for the proper orientation of the residues responsible for the sphingomyelinase activity (32.Fong L.G. Parthasarathy S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid. Res. 1987; 28: 1466-1477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated using LUVs that in contrast to sphingomyelin, ceramide forms microdomains in both fluid and gel state phosphatidylcholine membranes (30.Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33.Holopainen J.M. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 88: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34.Holopainen, J. M., Lemmich, J., Richter, F., Mouritsen, O. G., Rapp, G., and Kinnunen, P. K. J. (2000) Biophys. J., in pressGoogle Scholar). We have also shown that subjecting sphingomyelin containing GUVs to the action of externally applied sphingomyelinase resulted first in the rapid formation of ceramide-enriched microdomains, with subsequent formation of “endocytotic” vesicles in the internal cavity of the giant liposome (21.Holopainen J.M. Angelova M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to explore the possibility that a similar process could be induced by the sphingomyelinase activity associated with LDL. Giant SOPC/C16:0-sphingomyelin (0.75:0.25 molar ratio) liposomes were visualized by fluorescence microscopy of the included fluorescent lipid tracer Bodipy-sphingomyelin (x = 0.05; Fig. 3). Uniform distribution of Bodipy-sphingomyelin is evident at the resolution of the optical microscope (Fig. 3 A), in accordance with the miscibility of sphingomyelin in phosphatidylcholine membranes (30.Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the effects of LDL on the fluid giant liposome membrane, we attempted to add lipoprotein to the vesicle surface by microinjection. However, LDL was strongly aggregated onto the micropipette tip. The reason for this remains uncertain at this stage. One possibility is that the aggregate formation is due to small vesicles present in solution. Accordingly, the aggregated LDL on the tip was brought by micromanipulator to the GUV surface. Within approximately 90 s, a brightly fluorescent area below the tip of the micropipette become observable (Fig. 3 B). Thereafter, ∼3 min after the addition of LDL, small vesicles became visible in the interior of the giant liposome (Fig. 3 C), their number increasing with time (Fig. 3 D). The three-dimensional structures for LDL and bacterial sphingomyelinase are not available and, especially in the case of apoB-100, are hard to predict. Yet, in order to identify a putative region of LDL responsible for its sphingomyelinase activity, we compared the amino acid sequence of human apoB-100 with those of B. cereus, L. interrogans, and S. aureus sphingomyelinase. Three homologous regions were identified by SIM in the sequences of apoB-100 and B. cereus sphingomyelinase consisting of 24, 39, and 43 amino acids and having 38, 36, and 28% identical amino acids, respectively (Fig. 4). Comparison of apoB-100 with three different isoforms of B. cereussphingomyelinase reveals that out of the total 305 amino acids of this enzyme, 65 (21%) align with the sequence of apoB-100. Previous sequence comparisons have shown DNase I to share common mechanistic characteristics with sphingomyelinase and identified tentatively eight amino acids in the sequence of sphingomyelinase to be important in substrate recognition (35.Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36.Matsuo Y. Yamada A. Tsukamoto K. Tamura H.-O. Ikezava H. Nakamura H. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, out of these functionally important amino acids, six are conserved, and one is weakly similar also in the alignment of B. cereussphingomyelinase and apoB-100 (Fig. 4). Alignment of human apoB-100 with B. cereus, L. interrogans, and S. aureus sequences gives 30 amino acids that are common in all (Fig.4). The results presented here demonstrate that isolated human plasma LDL possesses sphingomyelinase activity when using sphingomyelin-containing liposomes as a substrate. Whether this activity is an intrinsic property of apoB-100 or is due to an unidentified relatively tightly associated sphingomyelinase that is not detached from LDL during ultracentrifugation and dialysis remains to be established. From a functional point of view, however, this question may not be important, since the sphingomyelinase activity seems to be tightly associated with LDL and should thus be involved in its interactions in vivo as well as in vitro. Based on the sequence comparison between sphingomyelinase and apoB-100, it seems possible that this enzymatic activity could be an intrinsic property of apoB-100. Moreover, electrophoresis of LDL preparations in 1% agarose gel did not reveal impurities (data not shown). To this end, sphingomyelinase activity of LDL is abolished by oxidation, similarly to the phospholipase A2 activity of apoB-100 (37.Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9741-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other lipoproteins, VLDL, HDL2, and HDL3, were inactive. Lack of sphingomyelinase activity in apoB-100 of VLDL does not contradict the notion that sphingomyelinase activity would be contained in the apoB-100 moiety of LDL. Accordingly, evidence for different apoB-100 conformations derives from the studies of Catapano et al. (38.Catapano A.L. Gianturco S.H. Kinnunen P.K.J. Eisenberg S. Gotto Jr., A.M. Smith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1007-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that internalization of VLDL by cultured fibroblasts by the apoB-100 receptor-mediated pathway and the subsequent suppression of hydroxymethylglutaroyl-CoA reductase require prior catabolic processing of isolated VLDL to an in vitro LDL by lipoprotein lipase. This sensitivity of apoB-100 to its lipid environment would unfortunately make ambiguous the use of apo-100 constructs to determine if the sphingomyelinase activity of LDL is inherent to apoB-100. The phospholipids of LDL consist mostly of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine (approximately 30 and 66 mol %, respectively), and the surface of LDL is further ordered into lipid microdomains (39.Sommer A. Prenner E. Gorges R. Stütz H. Grillhofer H. Konstner G.M. Paltauf F. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24217-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Murphy H.C. Ala-Korpela M.

It has been suggested that the apoB-100 moiety interacts preferentially with phosphatidylcholine, and it has also been shown that the acyl chains of fluorescent phosphatidylcholine are cleaved by apoB-100, revealing the presence of both phospholipase A1 and A2 activities (39.Sommer A. Prenner E. Gorges R. Stütz H. Grillhofer H. Konstner G.M. Paltauf F. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24217-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Murphy H.C. Ala-Korpela M.

Yedgar S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The surface of LDL displays compositional microheterogeneity that may affect LDL metabolismin vivo (40.Murphy H.C. Ala-Korpela M. White J.J. Raoof A. Bell J.D. Barbard M.L. Burns S.P. Iles R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as well as the folding of apoB-100. In keeping with the above, it seems feasible to suggest that the sphingomyelin present on the LDL surface is protected from the autocatalytic hydrolysis by the sphingomyelinase activity associated with apoB-100. Treating LDL with B. cereus sphingomyelinase results in its profound aggregation; however, this process was very slow compared with the formation of ceramide (9.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our previous work (30.Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) showed that in POPC/C16:0-sphingomyelin LUVs the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin was nearly complete within ∼2.5 min, whereas the formation of ceramide-enriched domains was slow (∼100 min), thus implying that for LDL the formation of ceramide-enriched lipid domains could mediate particle aggregation. Exposure of human blood macrophages to LDL, especially its oxidized or acetylated form, induced a 40% elevation of the endogenous level of ceramide by increasing both neutral and acidic sphingomyelinase activity (42.Kinscherf R. Claus R. Deigner H.P. Nauen O. Gehrke C. Hermetter A. Ruβwurm S. Daneil V. Hack V. Metz J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both native and oxidized LDL have been demonstrated to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis in smooth muscle cells (43.Augé N. Andrieu N. Nègre-Salvayre A. Thiers J.-C. Levade T. Salvayre R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19251-19255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). While the above observations reveal a link between LDL and ceramide formation in cells, the possibility that sphingomyelinase activity would be an intrinsic property of LDL was not considered. In this respect it is of interest to note that Parthasarathy et al. (44.Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) demonstrated that apoB-100 possesses phospholipase A2 activity, which is reduced upon oxidative modifications (37.Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9741-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Using a fluorescent phosphatidylcholine derivative incorporated into LDL, it was further shown that both phospholipase A1 and A2activities were present (41.Reisfeld N. Lichtenberg D. Dagan A. Yedgar S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, human plasma PAF acetylhydrolase activity has been demonstrated to be associated with LDL (45.Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the identification of the putative active site of LDL remains uncertain at present, the alignment of apoB-100 with sphingomyelinase from B. cereus, L. interrogans, and S. aureus is intriguing (Fig. 4). In keeping with the suggested functionally important residues (35.Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 36.Matsuo Y. Yamada A. Tsukamoto K. Tamura H.-O. Ikezava H. Nakamura H. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in sphingomyelinase, it is tempting to speculate that a catalytically active His-Ser-Asp triad common to a wide range of lipolytic enzymes is present also in apoB-100 (Fig. 4). We have previously shown that sphingomyelinase can induce vectorial budding of small vesicles from either the inner or outer leaflet of a single-walled giant vesicle (diameter >100 μm), depending on to which side of the bilayer the enzyme is added (21.Holopainen J.M. Angelova M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that “endocytosis” can be induced in GUVs also by LDL. Evidence for non-receptor-mediated uptake by rat luteal cells of LDL cholesterol without concomitant apoB-100 ingestion has been presented (46.Reaven E. Chen Y.D. Spicher M. Hwang S.F. Mondon C.E. Azhar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1971-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, aggregated LDL has been shown to enter the cells by surface-connected compartments by a mechanism not involving the LDL receptor (47.Zhang W.Y. Gaynor P.M. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 31700-317006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence that the sphingomyelinase activity of LDL would be involved in these events, it is tempting to speculate that the process would be mediated by this activity present in apoB-100. Combined with our previous findings (21.Holopainen J.M. Angelova M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), our present results suggest that these observations could involve the sphingomyelinase activity of LDL. It has been shown in in vitro experiments that LDL binds to the proteoglycans on the endothelial wall (48.Hurt-Camejo E. Olsson U. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. Camejo G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as well as to its receptors in the plasma membranes of cells (3.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, it seems feasible that this interaction between LDL and lipids could be involved in the possible in vivo effects of the sphingomyelinase activity. More specifically, after binding to its cell surface receptors, the LDL particle could be able to hydrolyze sphingomyelin in the adjacent plasma membranes and cause local accumulation of ceramide. We have previously shown that even at low contents ceramide becomes enriched into microdomains (30.Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33.Holopainen J.M. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 88: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34.Holopainen, J. M., Lemmich, J., Richter, F., Mouritsen, O. G., Rapp, G., and Kinnunen, P. K. J. (2000) Biophys. J., in pressGoogle Scholar). To this end, using microinjection and fluorescence microscopy of fluid giant phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin liposomes, we observed rapid formation of ceramide-enriched microdomains and changes in membrane morphology upon the action of sphingomyelinase (21.Holopainen J.M. Angelova M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Both endocytosis and shedding could be induced by the asymmetric sphingomyelinase-catalyzed generation of ceramide in either the outer or the inner leaflet, respectively, of these giant liposomes. These microdomains could thus serve as local vehicles for the transport of LDL through the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, there is evidence for the involvement of sphingomyelinase in the entry of Neisseria gonorrhoeae into human cells (49.Grassmé H. Gulbins E. Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1997; 91: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This mode of endocytosis could be mediated by the hydrolytic action of sphingomyelinase on the plasma membrane of the infected cells in manner similar to that described here. We have suggested this sphingomyelinase-mediated “autoendocytosis” to represent an ancient mechanism for the uptake of various ligands into the cells (21.Holopainen J.M. Angelova M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A variety of cell types present in atherosclerotic lesions secrete sphingomyelinase (9.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 50.Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini M. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a possible role for this enzyme in the development of atherosclerosis. An early event observed in atherosclerosis is the aggregation of LDL. Interestingly, treating LDL with sphingomyelinase induces aggregation and macrophage foam cell formation in vitro (9.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 51.Xu X.-X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24849-24858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Xu S.W. Swenson T.L Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregated LDL from human atherosclerotic lesions is readily hydrolyzed by extracellular sphingomyelinase (53.Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The ceramide content of aggregated LDL in lesions was 10–50-fold higher than plasma LDL (9.Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, unaggregated lesional LDL was not enriched in ceramide, suggesting that the aggregation of LDL was necessary for the formation of this lipid. Accordingly, the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide could be in part due to the sphingomyelinase activity associated with LDL itself.

https://openalex.org/W2049752561,"To examine the structural basis of the intrinsic fluorescence changes that occur during the MgATPase cycle of myosin, we generated three mutants of smooth muscle myosin motor domain essential light chain (MDE) containing a single conserved tryptophan residue located at Trp-441 (W441-MDE), Trp-512 (W512-MDE), or Trp-597 (W597-MDE). Although W441- and W597-MDE were insensitive to nucleotide binding, the fluorescence intensity of W512-MDE increased in the presence of MgADP-berellium fluoride (BeFX) (31%), MgADP-AlF4− (31%), MgATP (36%), and MgADP (30%) compared with the nucleotide-free environment (rigor), which was similar to the results of wild type-MDE. Thus, Trp-512 may be the sole ATP-sensitive tryptophan residue in myosin. In addition, acrylamide quenching indicated that Trp-512 was more protected from solvent in the presence of MgATP or MgADP-AlF4− than in the presence of MgADP-BeFX, MgADP, or in rigor. Furthermore, the degree of energy transfer from Trp-512 to 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-labeled nucleotides was greater in the presence of MgADP-BeFX, MgATP, or MgADP-AlF4− than MgADP. We conclude that the conformation of the rigid relay loop containing Trp-512 is altered upon MgATP hydrolysis and during the transition from weak to strong actin binding, establishing a communication pathway from the active site to the actin-binding and converter/lever arm regions of myosin during muscle contraction.

In addition, solution techniques that include monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of myosin have proven extremely valuable for examining the enzymatic and kinetic properties of the molecule (7Johnson K.A.

The following kinetic scheme of the myosin MgATPase cycle was developed based on observed changes in intrinsic fluorescence corresponding to structural changes within myosin, where M represents myosin and an asterisk represents enhanced protein fluorescence (14Bagshaw C.R. Eccelston J.F. Ekstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).M+ATP↔M·ATP↔M*·ATP↔M**·ADP·Pi↔M*·ADP·Pi↔M*·ADP+Pi↔M·ADP↔M+ADPREACTION 1 In this reaction myosin first forms a collision complex with ATP followed by an isomerization to the M*·ATP complex, which results in the first level of fluorescence enhancement (*). During the rapid reversible process of ATP hydrolysis, a structural change induces an additional fluorescence enhancement (**). Then, following hydrolysis of ATP the fluorescence decreases back to the first level of enhancement (*), which is thought to correspond to the rate-limiting structural change resulting in phosphate release. The phosphate release step then shifts myosin from a weak to strong binding conformation and is the step believed to be associated with force generation during muscle contraction. The release of ADP is a much faster two-step process in which the second step results in a decrease in fluorescence to basal levels. Thus, examining the conformational changes that result in alterations in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence may lead to important insights about the structural properties of the myosin MgATPase cycle. Dynamic structural information about domain motions within myosin during its MgATPase cycle has been pursued extensively (reviewed in Ref. 15Goldman Y.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies have demonstrated key rearrangements in the light chain-binding region (residues 781–820 highlighted inpink in Fig. 1), also referred to as the lever arm, providing a structural mechanism for force generation (reviewed in Ref.16Highsmith S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9791-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance studies, utilizing a probe on the regulatory light chain have shown a 30° rotation of this region (17Baker J.E. Brust-Mascher I. Ramachandran S. LaConte L.E. Thomas D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lever arm region rotates relative to the catalytic domain during muscle contraction. In addition, fluorescence studies utilizing a fluorescent probe at the regulatory light chain demonstrated rotation of the lever arm in contracting muscle fibers (15Goldman Y.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have revealed that smooth muscle myosin decorated on actin filaments undergoes a large structural change (30–35 Å) of the lever arm upon ADP release (18Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleotide analogs, which trap myosin in specific nucleotide states, have been useful in elucidating the structural properties of the normally short-lived stages of the MgATPase cycle. Structural studies suggest that MgADP-BeFX1corresponds to the M·ATP state, and MgADP-AlF4− corresponds to the transition state of ATP hydrolysis (19Rayment I. Smith C. Yount R.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 671-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas MgATP present at saturating levels at 20 °C represents primarily the M·ADP·Pi state (20Woledge R. Curtin N. Homsher E. Energetic Aspects of Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, London1985: 155-158Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments have shown that the lever arm is further away from the catalytic domain in the MgATP state simulated by MgADP-BeFX, moves closer in the MgADP·Pistate simulated by MgADP-AlF4− or MgADP-Vi, and moves further away again in the MgADP and rigor states (21Suzuki Y. Yasunaga T. Ohkura R. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Nature. 1998; 396: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Xiao M. Li H. Snyder G.E. Cooke R.R. Yount R.G. Selvin P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15309-15314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although many studies have demonstrated rotation of the lever arm relative to the catalytic domain during the contractile cycle, the structural details of how conformational changes in the catalytic domain are communicated to the lever arm are currently unclear. The converter region (residues 709–780, highlighted in bluein Fig. 1), a flexible region connecting the lever arm to the motor domain, may be responsible for allowing the lever arm to rotate relative to the catalytic domain. Structural studies have demonstrated large differences in the converter region when comparing the crystal structures of myosin in different nucleotide states (5Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 6Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C.

Furthermore, the rigid relay loop (residues 512–518, highlighted inred in Fig. 1), which provides a link between the active site and the converter domain as well as actin-binding regions, contains a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp-512 in smooth muscle myosin) that may be sensitive to nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis (24Johnson Jr., W.C.

Thus, examination of conformational changes in Trp-512 of myosin during different stages of the contractile cycle may lead to important insights into the coupling pathways that propagate through the rigid relay loop to the actin-binding and converter/lever arm regions of myosin. Also, it is still unclear whether other tryptophan residues that are conserved among skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty) myosin II (Trp-441 and Trp-597 in smooth muscle myosin) play a role in the intrinsic fluorescence changes that have been demonstrated in all three myosin isoforms (7Johnson K.A.

In the current study, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was used to examine changes in the environment of three conserved tryptophans (441, 512, and 597) during the MgATPase cycle of smooth muscle myosin. Three different fragments of smooth muscle myosin, containing the motor domain with the essential light chain (MDE), were engineered to contain a single tryptophan located at each of these positions; 441, 512, or 597. The tryptophan fluorescence from W441-MDE, W512-MDE, and W597-MDE was examined in the presence and absence of nucleotides as well as nucleotide analogs to investigate the contribution of each of these tryptophans to the changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence observed in different stages of the MgATPase cycle. In addition, we examined the movements that occur in the rigid relay loop by monitoring the amount of FRET between Trp-512 and mant-labeled nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. We have identified structural changes that occur in the rigid relay loop upon nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis, providing new insights into the structural pathways that couple the active site to the actin-binding and converter/lever arm regions of myosin. mant-labeled ATP and ADP were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). KCl, NaCl, ethylene glycol bis(-aminoethyl ether), BeCl2, AlCl3, NaF, ATP, and ADP were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were the highest quality available. A stock solution of BeCl2 (Be, atomic absorption standard solution, in 1% HCl) was adjusted to pH 5.0 by addition of 1 n NaOH. Stock solutions of 1 mNaF were freshly prepared each day. Our standard buffer was MOPS buffer at pH 7.4 and 4 °C (20 mm MOPS, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm NaN3), and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added when necessary. Imidazole buffer at pH 7.4 and 4 °C (10 mm imidazole-HCl, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was used during protein purification steps only (described below). We performed site-directed mutagenesis on a clone of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain containing the motor domain and essential light chain binding regions (residues 1–819, kindly provided by Kathleen M. Trybus, University of Vermont) to produce three mutants, each containing a single tryptophan residue. We constructed these mutants containing a single conserved tryptophan residue, Trp-441, Trp-512, or Trp-597, by mutating six of the seven endogenous MDE tryptophans to phenylalanine or methionine in the case of Trp-546 (highlighted as space-filling models in Fig. 1). We also constructed as a mutant containing no tryptophans (Null-MDE) and a molecule containing all seven native tryptophans (WT-MDE) described previously (27Yengo C.M. Fagnant P.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12944-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope sequence (DYKDDDK) was attached at the C terminus of all MDE constructs for purification purposes (28Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar). The baculovirus system was used to express all MDE constructs by co-infecting Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the desired myosin heavy chain and essential light chain sequences. Following incubation with baculovirus for three days, the Sf9 cells were lysed, fractionated between 40 and 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed overnight in imidazole buffer at 4 °C. The dialyzate was bound to an anti-FLAG antibody column, eluted with the homologous peptide, and dialyzed overnight into MOPS buffer with 1 mmdithiothreitol present. The degree of purity of the MDE was assessed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) using Coomassie-stained gels. Purified MDE concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad microplate assay and WT-MDE as a standard. All experiments were performed on two or three different MDE preparations. Actin was purified from chicken pectoralis muscle using an acetone powder method described previously (31Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified actin was determined spectophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 (mg/ml)−1·cm−1 at 290 nm. MDE trapped with ADP-BeFX or ADP-AlF4−was prepared as described previously (32Werber M.M. Peyser Y.M. Mulrad A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7190-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.6 μm purified MDE in MOPS buffer at pH 7.4 was mixed with 1 mm MgCl2, 3 μm ADP ormantADP, 2 mm NaF, and 0.2 mmAlCl3 or BeCl2 for 20 min at room temperature. The MDE-analog complexes formed with greater than 85% efficiency based on the inhibition of their ammonium (0.4 mNH4+Cl, 35 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0 at 20 °C) ATPase activities. Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in low ionic strength MOPS buffer using the method of White (33White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Purified MDE was assayed at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in the presence of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 μmactin, and inorganic phosphate production was measured colormetrically every 10 min for a 70-min period. The average ATPase rates (nmol Pi·(nmol MDE)−1·s−1) of two separate preparations of W441-, W512-, W597-, and WT-MDE were plotted as a function of actin concentration and fit with a nonlinear least squares method using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Values of Vmax and K m were determined using Michaelis-Menton kinetics. A Quantamaster fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) equipped with a 75-W Xenon arc lamp as an excitation source, excitation/emission monochrometers, and a WG-320 cut-off emission filter was used to measure steady state fluorescence from tryptophan andmant-labeled nucleotides. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were measured by exciting the sample at 295 nm and collecting the emitted fluorescence at 305–400 nm. mant-labeled nucleotides were excited at 360 nm, and the emission spectrum was measured at 380–500 nm. The excitation spectra ofmant-labeled nucleotides were collected at 250–400 nm with an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Slit widths were set at a resolution of 2 nm. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for variations in the wavelength sensitivity of the detector system and the presence of Raman scatter and background fluorescence in the appropriate buffer solution. Quantum yields (Φ) for tryptophan were calculated by a comparative method (34Parker C.A. Reese W.T. Analyst. 1960; 85: 587-600Crossref Google Scholar) using l-tryptophan as a standard (Φ = 0.14) (35Valeur B. Weber G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1977; 25: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectrum of each of the three mutants was measured in the presence of 2 mm MgADP or MgATP, as well as in the absence of nucleotide. In addition, the fluorescence spectrum of W512-MDE was measured complexed with the nucleotide analogs, MgADP-AlF4− and MgADP-BeFX. The binding of mantATP or mantADP to W512-MDE was examined by titrating increasing concentrations of mantADP or mantATP with 0.6 μm W512-MDE and monitoring the 2-fold increase in fluorescence of mant at 440 nm, which occurs upon binding to myosin (12Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Acrylamide quenching was used to determine the degree of exposure to solvent of Trp-512 in the presence of nucleotide and nucleotide analogs. The decrease in fluorescence intensity at the λmax was measured as a function of increasing acrylamide concentrations ([Q]). The fluorescence in the absence of quencher (F 0) divided by the fluorescence in the presence of quencher (F) was used to quantify the relative change in fluorescence from acrylamide quenching (F 0/F).F 0/F was plotted as a function of [Q] and fit to the Stern-Volmer relationship, taking into account both static (V) the and dynamic quenching (K SV) constants:F 0/F = (1 +K SV[Q])(expV[Q]) (36Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The static quenching value, which determines the amount of upward curvature of the Stern-Volmer plot, was determined by manually varying V and found to be similar (V = 3.0m−1) in all cases. Thus, the dynamic quenching constant was determined by fitting the Stern-Volmer plots by a nonlinear least squares method using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA), whereas V was held constant at 3.0m−1. FRET was used to measure the distance between the donor fluorophores, Trp-512, and acceptor fluorophores, mant-labeled nucleotides, using the Förster energy transfer theory (37Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 305-309Google Scholar). We measured the efficiency (E) of energy transfer by examining the increase in the acceptor excitation intensity upon donor excitation using the following equation. E=[FDA285/FDA360−ɛA285/ɛA360]·ɛA360/ɛD285Equation 1 where F DA285 andF DA360 are the intensities from the excitation spectrum of the acceptor in the presence of the donor, corrected by subtracting the fluorescence from the unbound mantnucleotides, and εA285, εA360, and εD285 are the extinction coefficients of the acceptor at 285 nm (3.0 × 102m−1·cm−1) and 360 nm (5.0 × 103m−1·cm−1) and the donor at 285 nm (5.5 × 103m−1·cm−1) (38Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), respectively. The distance (r) between the donor and acceptor fluorophores can be calculated with Equation 2.r=R0(E−1−1)1/6ÅEquation 2 where R 0 is the Förster critical distance at which energy transfer is equal to 50%. The distance R 0 is calculated from Equation 3.R0=9.79×103(K2JQDn−4)1/6ÅEquation 3 where n is the refractive index of the buffer (≈1.4), Q D is the quantum yield of W512-MDE determined in the presence of MgADP, MgADP-BeFX, MgADP-AlF4−, MgATP, and the absence of nucleotide (0.31, 0.31, 0.31, 0.33, and 0.22, respectively),K2 is the orientation factor assuming free rotation of the donor and acceptor fluorophore (23) (39Eftink M.R. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1991; 35: 127-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andJ is the spectral overlap integral in cm3·m−1 given by Equation 4(40Fairclough R.H. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 347-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).J=∫FD(λ)ɛΛ(λ)λ4dλEquation 4 where F D(λ) is the normalized total integrated intensity of the unquenched donor group andε A is the extinction coefficient of the acceptor in m−1·cm−1.J was numerically integrated at 1-nm intervals and determined to be 5.18 × 10−15m−1·cm3 in all nucleotide states studied, where λ is the wavelength in centimeters. Because the presence of various nucleotides changed only the intensity and not the shape of the fluorescence emission spectra from W512-MDE, the calculated value of J was relatively insensitive to the nucleotide present at the active site of W512-MDE. Functional assays were performed to examine the impact of the conservative mutations made to generate the smooth muscle myosin single tryptophan-containing mutants, W441-, W512, and W597-MDE. All MDE constructs were expressed and purified to similar levels (>90%) and yields (1–2 mg/1 × 109Sf9 cells). All three mutants displayed Vmax values that were reduced 4–5-fold and K m values 2–4-fold lower than WT-MDE (Table I). Previously, similar MDE mutants were shown to decorate actin with the classic arrowhead appearance as demonstrated by electron microscopy (27Yengo C.M. Fagnant P.M. Chrin L. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12944-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and thus W441-, W512-, and W597-MDE are likely to bind actin similarly. Most importantly, despite alterations in the ATPase rates, all three mutants display enhanced MgATPase rates in the presence of actin.Table IEnzymatic analysis of MDE mutantsMDE mutantMgATPase rates at 70 μmactinV maxK Ms−1s−1μmWT-MDE0.37 ± 0.020.7662W441-MDE0.15 ± 0.020.1714W512-MDE0.09 ± 0.010.1333W597-MDE0.10 ± 0.010.1839The MgATPase rates [nmol P1 · (nmol MDE)−1 · s−1] in the presence of 70 μm actin after subtracting the basal rate of all three mutants are compared with WT-MDE.

Values are given as the means ± S.D. V max and K M values were calculated by plotting actin-activated ATPase rates as a function of actin concentration and fitting the curves to Michaelis-Menton kinetics. We examined the fluorescence properties of W441-, W512-, and W597-MDE in the presence of nucleotides and nucleotide analogs to determine how the structural properties of these conserved tryptophans were altered throughout the MgATPase cycle. The fluorescence spectra and emission peak maxima of W441- and W597-MDE (334 and 332 nm, respectively) were unchanged in the presence of either MgATP or MgADP (data not shown). In contrast, the fluorescence properties of W512-MDE demonstrated a 31.0 ± 1.1% increase in the peak fluorescence intensity (336 nm) in the presence of MgADP-BeFX(i.e. the M·ATP state), a 30.7 ± 2.5% increase in the presence of MgADP-AlF4−(i.e. the transition state between the M·ATP and M·ADP·Pi states), a 36.1 ± 1.1% increase in the presence of MgATP (i.e. predominantly the M·ADP·Pi state), and a 30.1 ± 2.1% increase in the presence of MgADP (i.e. the M·ADP state), when compared with the nucleotide-free or rigor environment (i.e.the M state) (Fig. 2 B and Table II). Interestingly, the fluorescence spectrum of WT-MDE demonstrated an increase in its peak fluorescence intensity of 8.9 ± 2.1% in the presence of MgADP-BeFX, 13.2 ± 1.2% in the presence of MgADP-AlF4−, 18.4 ± 0.0% in the presence of MgATP, and 12.1 ± 0.0% in the presence of MgADP compared with the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 2 A and TableII). Although the fluorescence enhancement of W512-MDE was 2–3-fold greater than WT-MDE, the level of enhancement followed a similar pattern: greatest in the presence of MgATP, slightly lower in the presence of MgADP-AlF4−, MgADP-BeFX, and MgADP, and lowest in the nucleotide-free state. Thus, Trp-512 appears to be the sole tryptophan of those conserved between skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and Dicty myosin II that is sensitive to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and its enhancement profile was similar to previous studies on smooth muscle myosin (8Rosenfeld S.S.

The dynamic quenching constants (K SV) (means ± S.E. of the fit) of W512-MDE in the presence of MgADP-BeFX, MgADP-AlF4−, MgATP, MgADP, and in rigor are compared. To examine the solvent exposure of Trp-512 in different nucleotide states, we performed acrylamide quenching experiments on W512-MDE in the presence of MgADP-BeFX, MgADP-AlF4−, MgATP, MgADP, and in the absence of nucleotide (rigor) (Fig.3 and Table II). The Stern-Volmer relationship was used to quantitatively determine the amount of acrylamide quenching (see “Experimental Procedures”). The dynamic quenching constants of W512-MDE, indicative of the quenching that occurs by interaction of acrylamide with the excited state of tryptophan, were calculated to be 2.81 ± 0.04m−1, 1.96 ± 0.05m−1, 1.93 ± 0.09m−1, 2.96 ± 0.07m−1, and 3.05 ± 0.03m−1 in the presence of MgADP-BeFX, MgADP-AlF4−, MgATP, MgADP, and rigor, respectively (Table II). These data suggest that Trp-512 remains in a solvent exposed conformation upon MgATP binding, becomes more protected from solvent during the process of and following ATP hydrolysis, adopts a more solvent exposed conformation following Pi release, and remains in a similar environment upon ADP release. We examined the amount of FRET from Trp-512 to mant-labeled nucleotides and nucleotide analogs (MgATP, MgADP, MgADP-BeFX, MgADP-AlF4−), to monitor changes in the distance between Trp-512 and the active site of myosin in different nucleotide states. Binding of mantATP or mantADP to W512-MDE was examined by titrating 0.6 μm W512-MDE with mant-labeled nucleotides (0.5–5.0 μm) and monitoring the enhanced fluores"

The mechanism of involvement of the microtubules and PKC in this event is not fully understood. Dynamitin is a subunit of dynactin, which is important for linking the microtubule-dependent motor protein dynein to vesicle membranes. We report that dynamitin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein and that dynamitin binds directly to macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rice C kinase substrate (MacMARCKS), a membrane-associated PKC substrate involved in macrophage spreading and integrin activation. Dynamitin was found to copurify with MacMARCKS both during MacMARCKS purification with conventional chromatography and during the immunoabsorption of MacMARCKS using anti-MacMARCKS antibody. Vice versa, MacMARCKS was also found to cosediment with the 20 S dynactin complex. We determined that the effector domain of MacMARCKS is required to interact with the N-terminal domain of dynamitin. MacMARCKS and dynamitin also partially colocalized at peripheral regions of macrophages and in the cell-cell border of 293 epithelial cells. Treatment with phorbol esters abolished this colocalization. Disrupting the interaction with a short peptide derived from the MacMARCKS-binding domain of dynamitin caused macrophages to spread and flatten.

Particularly in macrophages, depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole causes the spreading macrophages to retract quickly into a spherical shape (11Cheung H.T. Terry D.S. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, cell spreading is impaired when microtubules are disassembled (8Ivanova O.Y. Margolis J.M. Vasiliev J.M.

Kinesin, the plus end-directed microtubule-dependent motor protein, has also been implicated in cell spreading, because anti-kinesin antibody decreases cell spreading when injected into cells (10Rodionov V.I.

However, it is not clear whether the microtubule cytoskeleton provides merely a structural support or plays a more active role such as regulating focal adhesion assembly. Recently, studies have revealed that cell adhesion and spreading closely correlates with microtubule function; the integrity of microtubules can influence both the growth of actin stress fibers and the assembly of focal adhesion points (12Bershadsky A.

Because dynamitin overexpression dissociated dynein from the mitotic kinetochore (32Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J.

This interaction may regulate the association of dynactin to membrane, because the association of MacMARCKS to the membrane is regulated by PKC (36Vergeres G. Manenti S. Weber T. Sturzinger C. J.

Both MARCKS and MacMARCKS participate in PKC-dependent cell spreading (47Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 48Myat M.M. Anderson S. Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the role of MacMARCKS in cell spreading may be mediated by its regulation of the activation of β2 integrin (49Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 51Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS is also involved in vesicle redistribution (52Chang S. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1174-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between dynamitin and MacMARCKS may explain the involvement of microtubules in cell adhesion and spreading and may provide a regulatory mechanism for the link between dynactin and the membrane cargoes.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here show that dynamitin-2 binds to the PKC substrate MacMARCKS under both in vitro and in vivo conditions and that this binding is regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MacMARCKS. In addition to the in vitrobinding assay using purified fusion proteins, the in vivointeraction between dynamitin and MacMARCKS was demonstrated in three different ways including coimmunoabsorption and copurification in both directions. The N-terminal domain of dynamitin, very well conserved among different species (34Valetti C. Wetzel D.M. Schrader M. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Kreis T.E. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), is required in this interaction. The effector domain of MacMARCKS, which contains the phosphorylation sites (serines 93 and 104), is also required for the interaction.The PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MacMARCKS regulates its binding to dynamitin both in vitro and in vivo. When MacMARCKS was phosphorylated in vitro with purified PKC, it no longer binds to the dynamitin. In PMA-treated cells, MacMARCKS was heavily phosphorylated by PKC (38Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this case, dynamitin was no longer coimmunoprecipitated with MacMARCKS. Therefore, we concluded that phosphorylation of MacMARCKS by PKC is an important regulation of dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction.PKC is known to phosphorylate serines 93 and 104 of MacMARCKS (38Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), consistent with our finding that the effector domain mediates the interaction with dynamitin. As expected, the substitution of aspartic acid at these two sites to mimic phosphorylation resulted in decreased binding to dynamitin; however, substitution of alanine also resulted in decreased binding, suggesting that serines 93 and 104 may represent critical residues for the interaction between MacMARCKS and dynamitin. Currently, the affinity and stoichiometery of the MacMARCKS-dynamitin interaction are unknown, but future research in this area may shed light on the involvement of the serine residues.Experiments in vivo further suggest that the MacMARCKS-dynamitin interaction may be involved in cell spreading. Microinjection of the N-terminal MacMARCKS-binding peptide of dynamitin (MB) caused macrophages to spread, whereas injection of the C-terminal peptide of dynamitin showed no such effect. In addition, a functional MacMARCKS is required for this effect of MB, because injection of this peptide into cells expressing MacMARCKS mutant showed no effect. These data agree with the reported function of MacMARCKS in regulating cell spreading (47Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and suggest one of the possible functions of MacMARCKS-dynamitin interaction.It is not surprising that dynamitin, a protein involved in microtubule function, participates in cell spreading. The involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton in cell adhesion and spreading has been well documented, and such an involvement is more prominent in macrophages than in fibroblasts. Recent reports suggest that microtubules do not merely provide a structural reinforcement during cell spreading but also are involved in regulating focal adhesion (12Bershadsky A. Chausolvsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recently, the p62 subunit of dynactin was shown to be involved in cell adhesion (66Garces J.A. Clark I.B. Meyer D.I. Vallee R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because dynamitin is an important regulator of the dynactin and microtubule function, it is feasible for dynamitin to be involved in cell spreading. Our data show that injecting the MacMARCKS-binding peptide of dynamitin disrupts MacMARCKS-dynamitin interaction and promotes macrophage spreading. These observations suggest that the binding of dynamitin with MacMARCKS inhibits cell spreading. This suggestion is also reasonable because MacMARCKS is involved in PMA-stimulated macrophage spreading (47Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) through its regulation of the activation of β2 integrin (49Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our recent study shows that MacMARCKS acts on the cytoskeletal constraint on the mobility of integrin molecules (51Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Not only is it feasible that dynamitin may be involved in macrophage spreading, it is also feasible that the role of dynamitin in cell spreading occurs through its interaction with MacMARCKS, whose role in macrophage spreading is known through its regulation of the β2 integrin (47Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 49Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 51Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An important question regarding the dynamitin/dynactin complex is how this complex connects dynein motor protein to cargo membrane (15Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Vallee R.B. Vaughan K.T. Echeverri C.J. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although a bridge between spectrum and Arp is proposed, a regulatory mechanism is still needed. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that the dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction may be part of the proposed bridge and may provide a regulation to this complex through PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MacMARCKS. Many microtubule-related functions are regulated by phosphorylation. For example, dynein-dependent vesicle transportation is regulated by phosphorylation (63Dillman J.F. Pfister K.K. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 226SPubMed Google Scholar, 64Lin S.X. Ferro K.L. Collins C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also regulates kinesin activity (62McIlvain J.M.J. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MacMARCKS is a PKC substrate, and it not only is required for integrin activation at cell surface but also associates with intracellular membrane compartments such as secretory vesicles of neuronal cells and phagosomes of macrophages (52Chang S. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1174-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 57Zhu Z. Bao Z. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17652-17655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction is regulated by PKC. Therefore, its interaction with dynamitin would be an ideal candidate to regulate the dynactin-membrane association.The key issue is how dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction may be involved in cell spreading. We believe that MacMARCKS may hold the key. MacMARCKS is required for PMA-stimulated cell spreading through its regulation of β2 integrin (47Li J. Zhu Z. Bao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12985-12990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 49Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 50Yue L. Bao Z. Li J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), an adhesion molecule essential for cell spreading. The first step of integrin activation is release of cytoskeletal constraint on the integrin molecules so that integrin diffuses faster on the cell membrane and has a better chance of binding a ligand (67Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.T. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Our recent data suggest that MacMARCKS, after being phosphorylated by PKC, is responsible for breaking the cytoskeleton complex that restrains the integrin molecules (51Zhou X.-M. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20217-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS might also participate in establishing focal adhesion, which is a later stage of integrin activation. It is possible that dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction might be part of the cytoskeletal complex that restrains integrin molecules. When MacMARCKS is phosphorylated by PKC, it no longer binds to dynamitin, and concomitantly, the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin is released. It is important to note that PMA and GST-MB both caused the dissociation of dynamitin-2 from MacMARCKS and that both treatments stimulated cell spreading, which raises the possibility that PKC-regulated dissociation of MacMARCKS from dynamitin-2 may be an important step during cell spreading. This possibility remains to be tested.Because dynamitin is involved in dynactin/dynein function, our data also suggest the potential involvement of dynactin/dynein in cell spreading in addition to its known function in vesicle and spindle organization. This speculation is in agreement with the finding that the p62 subunit of dynactin is also involved in cell adhesion (66Garces J.A. Clark I.B. Meyer D.I. Vallee R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Kinesin, another microtubule-dependent motor protein, has already been shown to be involved in cell spreading and lysosomal distribution (10Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Tanaka E. Bershadsky A.D. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note the opposite effects of blocking kinesin function and interfering with dynamitin-2 function. Although blocking kinesin inhibits cell spreading (10Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Tanaka E. Bershadsky A.D. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the formation of tubule lysosome (68Hollenbeck P.J. Swanson J.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), interfering with dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction promotes cell spreading and formation of tubular lysosomes (data not shown).As a working hypothesis, we propose that by interacting with MacMARCKS, which associates with plasma membranes, dynamitin may bridge the microtubule motor proteins to the plasma membranes. Therefore, dynamitin/microtubule may be a part of the unknown cytoskeletal complex that constrains integrin molecules at the resting stage to keep cells round. PKC is likely to regulate this bridge, because the interaction between dynamitin and MacMARCKS is regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation. As a consequence of MacMARCKS phosphorylation, dynamitin-MacMARCKS interaction is disrupted, freeing integrin to bind its ligand and mediate cell spreading.If this hypothesis is true, how is it that depolymerization of microtubules causes macrophages to become round rather than to spread? A possible explanation is that integrin activation and cell spreading involve first breaking of the cytoskeleton and then reestablishing the cytoskeletal link later at focal adhesion points. Therefore, a total breakdown of microtubules by nocodazol causes cells to become round because the drug may further affect the integrity of focal adhesion point. Cell adhesion and spreading are essential for many physiological processes, including immune cell activation, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation and differentiation (1Hynes R.O.

The crystal structures of two oxidation states of cytochromecd 1 from Paracoccus pantotrophus(formerly Thiosphaera pantotropha (7Rainey F.A. Kelly D.P. Stackebrandt E. Burghardt J. Hiraishi A. Wood A.P. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1999; 49: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) have revealed some unexpected features (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W.

Biol. 1997; 269: 440-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The oxidized protein was found to have bis-histidinyl coordination of the c-type cytochrome center, which is located in a mainly α-helical protein domain. Thed 1 heme, which is bound by an eight-bladed β-propeller structure, has its iron atom axially liganded by the phenolic oxygen of a tyrosine residue of the c heme domain and by a histidine residue provided by the β-propeller domain. The fully reduced protein has altered ligation at both heme iron centers. Remarkably, the c heme domain undergoes a conformational change causing one of the histidine ligands to the heme iron to be replaced by a methionine sulfur. The d 1 heme iron in the reduced state retains its histidine ligand but loses the tyrosine ligand and so becomes 5-coordinate and thus able to bind substrate. Indeed, the diffusion of nitrite into crystals of the reduced enzyme allowed the determination of structures of the enzyme with either the substrate nitrite, or the product nitric oxide, bound to the d 1 heme iron (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These structural observations raised several questions, prominent among which is the issue of what determines the axial ligands to thec heme iron. At least two factors, either singly or in combination, are likely to be involved. These are (a) the oxidation state of the c heme and (b) whether Tyr25 is bound to the d 1 heme iron. This tyrosine residue is separated by only 7 residues from His17, which is one of the axial ligands to thec heme iron in the oxidized state. Thus, it is plausible that dissociation of Tyr25 may be coordinately linked to the dissociation of His17. The proposed mechanism of cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase involves nitrite binding to the ferrousd 1 heme, formation of nitric oxide (a one-electron reduction), and displacement of this reaction product from the ferric heme (8Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the P. pantotrophus enzyme, residue Tyr25 has been suggested to promote loss of nitric oxide (8Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As a probe of this mechanism we have studied the binding of cyanide to the enzyme. Cyanide usually has a much higher affinity for ferric compared with ferrous heme (11Antonini E. Brunori M. Newberger A. Tatum T.L. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). However, ferrousd 1 heme binds nitrite (NO2−), and thus we have sought to elucidate the factors that stabilize the binding of anions to cytochrome cd 1. On the basis of the results of our study we have made correlations between the properties of several types of anion reductase that have active site heme. Cytochrome cd 1 from P. pantotrophus was purified according to Moir et al.(12Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A Sephacryl S-200 HR column was employed as an additional, final step to ensure homogenous enzyme. The concentration of enzyme solutions was determined using the published extinction coefficient (13Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Brown crystals of the oxidized enzyme were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C, using a protein concentration of 40 mg/ml and 2.2–2.3 m ammonium sulfate, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, as precipitants (14Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1211-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions ofa = 106.5 Å, b = 60.9 Å,c = 100.1 Å, β = 111.9° (at 100 K). For cyanide binding to the reduced form of the enzyme, a crystal was first reduced in crystallization mother liquor containing 50 mmsodium dithionite. When the crystal appeared green from all directions (after several minutes), it was transferred into mother liquor containing 50 mm potassium cyanide for half an hour. In a different experiment, crystals of cytochromecd 1, which had undergone reduction by dithionite followed by soaking in cyanide, were then reoxidized by soaking for 10 min in crystallization buffer containing 50 mm potassium ferricyanide. All solutions contained 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and soaked crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas for x-ray data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the beam line BW7B, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Hamburg using radiation with a wavelength of 0.83 Å. An image plate detector (MAR345) was used to collect a 1.59-Å resolution data set. Data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structure factors were derived from intensities using the program TRUNCATE from the CCP4 package (16Collaborative Computational Project, No 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Refinement of the structure was carried out by alternate cycles of X-PLOR (17Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and manual refitting using O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The refinement was based on the room temperature 2.0-Å resolution model of the reduced enzyme (Protein Data Bank code: 1aof (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)). In the first step, the two independent molecules were refined as rigid body groups against the low temperature data at 2-Å resolution. The model was then subjected to simulated annealing and positional refinement using weak noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, gradually extending the resolution to the final 1.59 Å in four cycles. A bulk solvent correction allowed all measured data to be used. The Fe–C (cyanide) bond distance was restrained to 2.00 Å (refined to 1.98 Å in both subunits), based on high resolution small molecular structures; no angle restraints were used for the bound cyanide. Water molecules were added to the atomic model at the positions of large positive peaks (>3.0 ς) in the difference electron density, but only at places where the resulting water molecule fell into an appropriate hydrogen-bonding environment. Restrained isotropic temperature factor refinements were carried out for each individual atom. The final model contains residues 36–559 in subunit A, 25–559 in subunit B, ac-type heme, a d 1-type heme, the bound cyanide ligand in both subunits, and 2 glycerol and 1348 water molecules.

Open table in a new tab Potassium cyanide stock solutions were standardized by titration against AgNO3 in the presence of ammonia and KI (19Vogel A.I. Jeffery G.H. Vogel's Textbook of Quantitative Chemical Analysis. 5th Ed. Longman Scientific, Harlow, UK1989: 309-310Google Scholar). To determine equilibrium binding parameters, cyanide was titrated into a solution of dithionite-reduced nitrite reductase in a cuvette sealed with a septum; the solutions were thoroughly deoxygenated with humidified argon prior to use. After each addition of cyanide, made by Hamilton syringe, the solution was allowed to equilibrate and binding was monitored by absorption spectroscopy. Once it had been established that cyanide bound exclusively to the d 1 heme, the absorbance increase at 632 nm due to cyanide binding was monitored. This is a wavelength at which the d 1 heme, but not thec heme, absorbs (13Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A spectrum with maximum binding of cyanide (representing the end point of the titration) was obtained after addition of a large excess of cyanide to the cuvette. Hence, at each titration point it was possible to determine the concentrations of free and bound cyanide. There are no reports in the literature describing the formation of complexes of cyanide with cytochrome cd 1 from either P. pantotrophus or its close relative P. denitrificans. Incubation of oxidized enzyme solution with 10 mm cyanide at pH 7.0 resulted in no detectable change in the visible absorption spectrum, strongly indicating that cyanide was unable to bind either heme center of P. pantotrophuscytochrome cd 1. In contrast, when cyanide was added to a solution of reduced enzyme, there were significant changes in the visible absorption spectrum (Fig.1 A). These changes were most pronounced above 600 nm, where only the d 1 heme absorbs (13Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and there were virtually no changes to those regions of the spectrum previously assigned to the c heme. It can therefore be concluded that cyanide binds specifically to thed 1 heme of the reduced enzyme under these conditions. The reason for the failure of cyanide to bind to the oxidized enzyme might be that it is kinetically unable to displace Tyr25 from the d 1 heme. Thus, an attempt was made to oxidize the reduced enzyme-cyanide complex. When this complex was treated with ferricyanide, the visible absorption spectrum changed but did not exactly return to the spectrum of the fully oxidized enzyme (Fig. 1 B). However, it is similar and there are bands characteristic of His/Tyr-ligatedd 1 heme (434 nm (shoulder), 640 nm, 702 nm) (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar,21Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggests that reoxidation of the solution enzyme-cyanide complex produces a mixed species consisting mostly of enzyme in the “as isolated” conformation with a minor component, possibly incorporating ferric heme d 1-CN. If so, the implication is that Tyr25 is able to displace CN− from ferric heme d 1. The dissociation constant (K d) for cyanide binding to reduced P. pantotrophus cytochromecd 1 at 25 °C was determined by titration of cyanide into a solution of reduced enzyme. Clearly no data could be obtained for either the ferric, “as isolated” enzyme, to which cyanide does not bind, nor for the ferricyanide-reoxidized enzyme-CN complex. K d was found to be 0.7 ± 0.2 × 10−6m at pH 7.0. This value was essentially independent of pH in the range 7.0–9.0, suggesting that proton uptake did not accompany cyanide binding. Isosbestic points during the titration indicated the presence of a two-state mixture of reduced enzyme and enzyme-CN complex. A Hill plot gave a value for the Hill coefficient of 0.85 ± 0.06 (data not shown). Following these observations, we determined the structure of reduced enzyme with cyanide bound, by the following procedure. Cytochromecd 1 was crystallized in the oxidized state and reduced with dithionite; then cyanide was diffused into the crystals as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical crystals obtained this way diffracted x-rays beyond 2-Å resolution, and the structure was refined using the coordinates of the fully reduced enzyme as a starting model (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The resultant structure, obtained at 1.59 Å, was essentially identical to that seen previously except that cyanide was clearly visible, bound to both d 1 heme iron atoms of the dimeric protein. The differences in structure between the two monomers of the dimer, subunits A and B, were preserved with cyanide bound. These differences include more disorder in thec heme domain in subunit A than in subunit B. Figs.2 A and 2 B show the details of the cyanide coordinated d 1 heme for the A and B subunits, respectively. We assume that the carbon atom of cyanide is bound to the heme iron, as is the case for many other heme proteins (e.g. sulfite reductase (22Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12120-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase (23Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35005-35011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). This assumption is supported by the B-factor values. In the model with a carbon to iron bond, the B-factors of C and N atoms were refined to similar values, 9.1 and 10.6 Å2 in subunit A, and 7.7 and 8.2 Å2 in subunit B, respectively. When the cyanide was modeled to bind to the heme iron via its nitrogen atom,i.e. when the C and N atomic-scattering factors were swapped, the B-factors of the N and C atoms differed more, 10.5 and 8.0 Å2 (in subunit A) and 9.6 and 5.9 Å2 (in subunit B), respectively. The results of this analysis clearly favored Fe–C bond formation for two reasons. First, atoms in the same chemical groups should show similar B-factors, because of their similar chemical environment. Second, smaller B values (thus less mobility) are associated with tighter binding. The nitrogen atom of cyanide is within hydrogen bonding distance of the Nε2 atoms of both histidines (His345 and His388; 2.96 Å and 2.78 Å for subunit A; 2.75 Å and 3.10 Å for subunit B), which have previously been proposed as proton donors to the oxygen atom of the substrate nitrite that is destined to become water (8Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bonding pattern contrasts with that seen when another diatomic species, NO, is bound to thed 1 heme (Fig. 2 C (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)). In the latter case there are no such hydrogen bonds formed (Fig. 2, A andB). Unlike nitric oxide, the cyanide ligand has a negative charge formally localized on the nitrogen atom, which may account for the hydrogen bonding patterns seen in Fig. 2. The cyanide is bound to the B subunit d 1 heme iron with an Fe–C–N angle of 164°. A striking feature is the presence of Tyr25, which if protonated could be hydrogen-bonded to the nitrogen atom of the cyanide ligand (distance, 3.10 Å). Similar to the unliganded-reduced structure (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), the d 1 heme ring adopts a saddle shape and is not distorted further by the cyanide binding. The c heme domains have His/Met coordination to the heme iron, as seen in the fully reduced unliganded structure. The A subunit shows the same features at the d 1 heme site except that no electron density for Tyr25 could be identified, just as was found for the reduced unliganded structure (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Instead, there is a water molecule in a slightly different position, but still within hydrogen bonding distance (3.18 Å) of the cyanide ligand of this A subunit; hence the Fe–C–N angle in subunit A is 146°. Recent high resolution structures of sulfite reductase (22Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12120-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase (23Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35005-35011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) show similar cyanide binding geometry with the heme groups, where cyanide ligands are also hydrogen-bonded to basic Arg, His, and Lys residues. In an attempt to obtain the structure of the oxidized enzyme with cyanide bound, crystals that were reduced and exposed to cyanide, as described above, were subsequently treated with potassium ferricyanide. X-ray diffraction data collected from those crystals showed unambiguously that the native fully oxidized structure was regained; therefore, cyanide had dissociated (data not shown). It can be concluded that it is a thermodynamic rather than a kinetic factor that prevents binding of cyanide to the oxidized as isolated enzyme. The structure and characterization of cyanide binding to P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd 1 gives a number of insights into the properties of the enzyme and its catalysis of the nitrite reductase reaction. The present work shows that only the reduced form of the enzyme can bind cyanide. Oxidation of the enzyme-cyanide complex with ferricyanide clearly provides a sufficient driving force for displacement of the cyanide ligand by Tyr25 and switching from His/Met to His/His ligation at thec heme iron. In previous work it has been proposed that the return of the Tyr25 ligand to the d 1heme could be a mechanism for displacing the physiological reaction product, nitric oxide (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This has yet to be demonstrated directly, but our results show that in general terms this displacement mechanism is feasible. Cyanide generally binds very strongly to the ferric state of heme iron as a result of both sigma bond donation from cyanide and electrostatic interaction. Typical dissociation constants are 1 × 10−9m for human hemoglobin (11Antonini E. Brunori M. Newberger A. Tatum T.L. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 24Viola F. Aime S. Coletta M. Desideri A. Fasano M. Paoletti S. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 62: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 2.5 × 10−4m for mitochondrial (horse) cytochromec (24Viola F. Aime S. Coletta M. Desideri A. Fasano M. Paoletti S. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 62: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), 2 × 10−6m for horseradish peroxidase (25Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 153-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and 7 × 10−7m for cytochrome aa 3 oxidase (26van Buuren K.J. Nicholis P. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 258-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In general, the affinity of cyanide for this oxidation state of heme can be expected to be greater than the affinities of either nitric oxide or the phenolate ion side chain of tyrosine. Cyanide binding to ferric heme is weaker the greater the deviation from linearity of the M–C–N bond (27Yu N.-T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 350-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but our structure suggests, at least for the ferrous state, that cyanide can bind to cytochrome cd 1with only relatively small deviation from linearity. Consequently, a geometric factor is unlikely to account for failure to observe cyanide binding to the ferric form given that, apart from the dissociation of tyrosine 25, there is little change with oxidation state in the structure around the d 1 heme site. Therefore, the simplest interpretation of our results is that they show that the energetics of tyrosine re-ligation are sufficiently favorable to drive off other ligands with up to the affinity exhibited by cyanide, from all ferric cytochrome cd1. The likely explanation for this is a chelate effect; if Tyr25 binds thed 1 heme and His17 the cheme cooperatively, the entropy decrease is minimized. Thus, the enthalpically favorable ferric iron-histidine and iron-tyrosine bonds can be formed with a sufficiently negative ΔG to permit displacement of cyanide. Given that cyanide is readily displaced from all ferric cytochromecd 1, one must also consider the possibility that the d 1 heme itself binds cyanide weakly. However, in a study where d 1 heme was incorporated into the heme binding pocket of apomyoglobin, its affinity for cyanide, in the ferric state, was 10−5m. This value was only 50 times lower than the dissociation constant for cyanide from native myoglobin containing heme b (28Steup M.B. Muhoberac B.B. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 37: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the absence of structural data, this could reflect a poor fit of thed 1 heme into myoglobin, and it indicates that cyanide binding is not intrinsically weak. Thed 1 heme is a chemically unique species, only found in cytochromes cd 1. It is a dioxo-isobacteriochlorin (3,8-dioxo-17-acrylateporphyrindione), the ring being reduced by 4-electrons compared with protoporphyrin IX. In addition, three further electron-withdrawing substituents are bound to the ring; two carbonyl groups and an acrylate group, conjugated with the porphyrin (2Wu W. Chang C.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3149-3150Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The effects of these structural features on the chemical properties of the heme are still poorly understood. However, the d 1 heme ring is very acidic compared with protoporphyrin IX (28Steup M.B. Muhoberac B.B. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 37: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the reduction potential of the ring with iron bound is increased by ∼200 millivolts, relative to free porphyrin or isobacteriochlorin (29Barkigia K.M. Chang C.K. Fajer J. Renner M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1701-1707Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ferric heme iron also has an unusual inverted electronic ground state (dxz,dyz)4(dxy)1 compared with the more common (dxy)2(dxz,dyz)3 (21Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but this does not obviously correlate with weak cyanide binding. Biosynthesis of heme d 1 is particularly demanding (30Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar), yet the reason for requiring it has not been convincingly explained. In previous work (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), structures of P. pantotrophuscytochrome cd 1 with either nitrite or nitric oxide bound to the d 1 heme showed thec heme with His/His coordination. The contrast between those structures and the present ferrous enzyme-cyanide complex (cheme His/Met) suggests that, in the former cases the c heme must have been oxidized (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Unlike nitrite, cyanide cannot be reduced and therefore cannot have oxidized the heme centers in the structure presented in this paper. It was not possible to definitively establish the oxidation state of the d 1 heme in the earlier structures (6Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and if it were ferrous that may account for the failure in that work of Tyr25 to rebind.

Treatment of the cells with antagonists or antisense oligonucleotide of the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) significantly inhibited secretion of apoB100-VLDL and triglyceride. Similar inhibitory effect of the iPLA2 antagonists was observed on apoB48-VLDL secretion, but secretion of high density lipoprotein particles (such as apoAI- and apoB48-high density lipoprotein) or proteins in general was unaffected. The iPLA2 antagonist did not affect the synthesis of apoB100 or triglyceride, nor did it affect the activities of phospholipase D, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, or microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. Inactivation of iPLA2 resulted in impaired apoB100-VLDL assembly as shown by decreased apoB100-VLDL and triglyceride within the microsomal lumen, with concomitant increase in apoB100 association with the microsomal membranes.

Each VLDL particle contains various amounts of TG and a single copy of apoB100. The rat liver synthesizes a truncated form, apoB48 (collinear with the N-terminal 48% of apoB100), that also has the ability to assemble VLDL (1Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The subcellular compartment where VLDL is assembled has not been unambiguously determined. Immunohistochemical and electronmicroscopic studies proposed that rat liver VLDL was assembled at the junction of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).

Biochemical studies, however, suggested that association of lipid with apoB could occur not only post-translationally (3Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) are both achieved post-translationally and require the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). These studies support the model known as “two-step” assembly, which theorizes that the initial product is a primordial dense particle that is subsequently assembled with bulk TG to form a mature VLDL. The stepwise VLDL assembly also occurs in primary hepatocytes (7Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The post-translational model for VLDL assembly is established on the basis of kinetic analysis that observes the time taken by apoB and TG to be assembled. It is noticed that there exists a temporal delay between the moment when apoB translation reaches completion and the time when VLDL is matured. In the case of apoB100, assembly of apoB100-VLDL1 is undetectable until 15–20 min after apoB synthesis (9Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Such a lag period was also observed for TG incorporation into hepatic apoB48-VLDL (7Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since ER is a highly dynamic organelle that continuously undergoes vesiculation and fusion, the delayed apoB100-VLDL1 maturation may reflect the time needed for the movement of apoB100 (and TG as well) from the site of synthesis to the site of assembly. Data suggesting the involvement of ER vesiculation in VLDL assembly are obtained from studies with brefeldin A (10Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At a low dose of brefeldin A, assembly of VLDL is inhibited but assembly of dense particles remains normal. Thus, membrane trafficking mediated by vesiculation and fusion may be essential for bulk TG incorporation into VLDL. It has been recognized that changes in membrane lipid composition regulated by lipid catalyzing enzymes dramatically affect membrane vesiculation and fusion (13Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to understand the role of enzyme activities that remodel biological membranes in VLDL assembly.Two families of cytosolic phospholipase A2(PLA2, EC 3.1.1.4.) have been characterized, namely cPLA2 (α, β, and γ forms) and iPLA2. Although the β form of cPLA2 is expressed in the liver (14Song C. Chang X.J. Bean K.M. Proia M.S. Knopf J.L. Kriz R.W. J. Biol.

The iPLA2 also consists of multiple isoforms, which are derived from alternative splicing of a single gene (17Ma Z. Wang X. Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9607-9616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlike cPLA2, iPLA2 does not have a Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding domain (18Clark J.D. Lin L.-L.

The iPLA2displays broad substrate specificity and can be inhibited by a suicide substrate, bromoenol lactone (BEL) (23Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13499-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is suggested that phospholipid turnover may be associated with VLDL secretion in rat liver cells treated with oleate (30Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A potential role of phospholipid turnover in VLDL secretion was first suggested by a work (31Bar-On H. Roheim P.S. Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 248: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that showed ∼50% of VLDL-TG secreted from rat liver might use fatty acids derived from phospholipid deacylation. However, it remains to be determined if phospholipid turnover plays a role in the process of bulk TG incorporation into VLDL. Here, we examined the role of iPLA2-mediated phospholipid turnover in oleate-induced hepatic VLDL assembly/secretion.DISCUSSIONMultiple lines of evidence from the current work suggest that the assembly of VLDL requires iPLA2 activity. The inhibitory effect of iPLA2 antagonists (chemical inhibitors or antisense oligonucleotides) is rather specific to the assembly and secretion of TG-rich VLDL (e.g. B100-VLDL1 and B48-VLDL) but not the secretion of small lipoproteins such as HDL. The specific inhibitory effect of iPLA2 antagonists toward VLDL assembly is reminiscent of observations derived from studies under many other pathophysiological or pharmacological conditions where VLDL secretion is impaired but HDL secretion is normal. Several notable examples related to phospholipid metabolism include inhibition of PC synthesis by choline deficiency (44Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of PE methylation by bezafibrate (45Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and treatment with monomethylethanolamine (46Rusiñol A.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13318-13325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, an unidentified step essential for bulk TG incorporation into VLDL is impaired, but the normal ER-to-Golgi trafficking remains functional. Thus, the current study of iPLA2-mediated phospholipid turnover, together with previous observations, highlight the existence of a possible vesicular transport system that is specialized for TG-rich VLDL assembly/secretion.It is now clear that bulk TG incorporation into VLDL is achieved post-translationally (3Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 310: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, less clear is the mechanism by which bulk TG is incorporated. Abundant TG availability is essential, but it alone is not sufficient to drive VLDL assembly, as exemplified by studies with hepatic cells treated with n-3 fatty acids (48Lang C.A. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2079-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 50Wang H. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18514-18520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or insulin (51Sparks C.E. Sparks J.D. Bolognino M. Salhanick A. Strumph P.S. Amatruda J.M. Metabolism. 1986; 35: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8854-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where active TG synthesis does not result in VLDL production. In certain hepatoblastoma cell lines (e.g. HepG2 cells), TG synthesis can be effectively stimulated by oleate, but formation of VLDL is not achieved (53Gibbons G.F. Khurana R. Odwell A. Seelaender M.C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1801-1808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, PLA2 antagonists can impair VLDL assembly in McA-RH7777 cells, while TG synthesis remains unaffected (Fig. 6,A and B). Hence, factors other than TG availability must play an important role in facilitating VLDL assembly. Over the past several years, our understanding of the requirements for hepatic VLDL assembly/secretion has been advanced significantly by extensive biochemical and genetic studies, which have established an important role for various proteins (e.g. MTP (Ref. 36Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), apoB (Ref. 54Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and brefeldin A-sensitive factors (Refs. 10Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 12Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) as auxiliary factors of VLDL assembly. The current observation that PLA2 inhibition results in impaired bulk TG incorporation into VLDL in the face of normal apoB synthesis and apoB translocation across the microsomal membrane indicates that the process is important at the post-translational stage. These observations, together with the results that inhibition of iPLA2 is associated with decreased microsomal lumenal B100-VLDL1 and increased B100 association with microsomal membranes (Figs. 6 and 7), suggest strongly that PLA2 is a novel auxiliary factor of VLDL assembly. The concept of PLA2 activity acting as an auxiliary factor for hepatic VLDL assembly is also suggested by our data that intracellular phospholipid deacylation is augmented by oleate used to stimulate VLDL assembly/secretion. Data showing that a variety of iPLA2antagonists potently block PC deacylation and B100-VLDL1 or B48-VLDL secretion provide additional evidence supporting this concept.The mechanism whereby iPLA2 acts as such an auxiliary factor of VLDL assembly is unclear. To date, two roles have been ascribed to phospholipid metabolism in the biosynthesis of VLDL. The first role concerns phospholipid as a constituent of lipoproteins; thus, active synthesis of phospholipids, particularly PC, provides substrates for VLDL assembly (44Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Verkade H.J. Fast D.G. Rusiñol A.E. Scraba D.G. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second role highlights that phospholipid acts as a fatty acid reservoir; therefore, through its turnover, phospholipid supplies fatty acyl moieties for TG synthesis (30Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several pieces of evidence derived from the current work suggest that oleate and iPLA2 antagonists do not exert their effect on VLDL assembly merely by affecting PC synthesis or substrate channeling between PC and TG. First, although exogenous oleate increased PC synthesis (measured by increased incorporation of [3H]glycerol) was observed previously (9Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and in current studies (data not shown), there was no change in microsomal membrane-associated PC mass as quantified by both mass spectrometry analysis (the present study) and by chemical measurement (previous observation in Ref. 9Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enhanced incorporation of [3H]glycerol into PC upon oleate treatment reflects not so much synthesis as turnover. Second, although oleate indeed enhanced channeling of oleoyl moieties from PC to TG (Fig. 1 B), which agreed with previous observations made using oleate-treated primary rat hepatocytes (3Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inactivation of iPLA2 by antagonist did not alter this oleoyl chain channeling into TG (data not shown). In fact, under no circumstances had iPLA2 inactivation affected TG synthesis. Therefore, the impaired VLDL assembly/secretion by iPLA2 antagonist is not simply a consequence of TG availability. Third, the inhibitory effect of BEL on VLDL assembly was observed only when the antagonist was added before but not after oleate treatment (Fig. 8). This result is critical and suggests that changes in phospholipid composition or membrane structure may be more important than phospholipid synthesis in facilitating bulk TG incorporation into VLDL. The finding that the species of microsome-associated phospholipids, particularly that of oleoyl-enriched PE (Fig. 9), can be significantly influenced by oleate or PLA2 antagonist raises the possibility that priming of membrane milieu plays an important role in the process of VLDL assembly.Changes in phospholipid composition render significant biological consequences. Alteration in membrane shape (56Fujii T. Tamura A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and membrane curvature (57Scales S.J. Sheller R.H. Nature. 1999; 401: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is associated with membrane vesiculation and tubulation (13Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 58Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Söling H.-D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Glycerolipids containing monounsaturated acyl chains (e.g.oleoyl chain) are shown to activate proteins essential for the coating of budding vesicles (59Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and membrane fusion (60Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membrane Biol. 1995; 146: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition to their direct effect on membrane curvature, distinct phospholipid species can regulate membrane fusion by changing the secondary structure of peptide in fusion protein (61Pécheur E.-I. Martin I. Bienvenüe A. Ruysschaert J.-M. Hoekstra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that deacylation/reacylation of phospholipid, induced by oleate, provides a means for oleoyl chain to be incorporated into phospholipid species and for subsequent generation of lysophospholipid, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid. Generation and proper localization of these oleoyl-rich glycerolipid species may be important for the event of bulk TG incorporation into VLDL. Once such a primed membrane is established (e.g. in the case of pretreatment of cells with oleate), inhibition of PLA2 activity with antagonists may not exert an acute effect on bulk TG incorporation into VLDL. The activity of PLA2, including iPLA2, present in cytosol of cells, is shown to participate in endosome fusion of macrophages (62Mayorga L.S. Colombo M.I. Lennartz M. Brown E.J. Rahman K.H. Weiss R.

Our current results, although inconclusive, reveal a possible function of iPLA2-mediated phospholipid remodeling in VLDL assembly/secretion. However, whether the impaired VLDL assembly/secretion by iPLA2 inhibition is the results of perturbed membrane movement essential for bulk TG incorporation remains to be determined. Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)1 are assembled in the liver and secreted as triglyceride (TG)-rich particles. Each VLDL particle contains various amounts of TG and a single copy of apoB100. The rat liver synthesizes a truncated form, apoB48 (collinear with the N-terminal 48% of apoB100), that also has the ability to assemble VLDL (1Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The subcellular compartment where VLDL is assembled has not been unambiguously determined. Immunohistochemical and electronmicroscopic studies proposed that rat liver VLDL was assembled at the junction of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).

These studies support the model known as “two-step” assembly, which theorizes that the initial product is a primordial dense particle that is subsequently assembled with bulk TG to form a mature VLDL. The stepwise VLDL assembly also occurs in primary hepatocytes (7Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The post-translational model for VLDL assembly is established on the basis of kinetic analysis that observes the time taken by apoB and TG to be assembled. It is noticed that there exists a temporal delay between the moment when apoB translation reaches completion and the time when VLDL is matured. In the case of apoB100, assembly of apoB100-VLDL1 is undetectable until 15–20 min after apoB synthesis (9Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Such a lag period was also observed for TG incorporation into hepatic apoB48-VLDL (7Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since ER is a highly dynamic organelle that continuously undergoes vesiculation and fusion, the delayed apoB100-VLDL1 maturation may reflect the time needed for the movement of apoB100 (and TG as well) from the site of synthesis to the site of assembly. Data suggesting the involvement of ER vesiculation in VLDL assembly are obtained from studies with brefeldin A (10Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At a low dose of brefeldin A, assembly of VLDL is inhibited but assembly of dense particles remains normal. Thus, membrane trafficking mediated by vesiculation and fusion may be essential for bulk TG incorporation into VLDL. It has been recognized that changes in membrane lipid composition regulated by lipid catalyzing enzymes dramatically affect membrane vesiculation and fusion (13Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to understand the role of enzyme activities that remodel biological membranes in VLDL assembly.

The phosphorylated nucleoside analogs are incorporated into DNA and cause cell death or inhibit viral replication. Cellular DNA is replicated both in the nucleus and in the mitochondria, and nucleoside analogs may interfere with DNA replication in both these subcellular locations. In the present study we created a cell model system where nucleoside analogs were phosphorylated, and thereby pharmacologically activated, in either the nucleus, cytosol, or mitochondria of cancer cells. The system was based on the reconstitution of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells with genetically engineered dCK targeted to the different subcellular compartments. The nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by dCK in the mitochondria were predominantly incorporated into mitochondrial DNA, whereas the nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the nucleus or cytosol were incorporated into nuclear DNA. We further show that the nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the mitochondria induced cell death by an apoptotic program. These data showed that the subcellular site of nucleoside analog phosphorylation is an important determinant for incorporation of nucleoside analogs into nuclear or mitochondrial DNA.

Other nucleoside analogs, such as 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine and 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine, are used in treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection (3Balzarini J. Pharm. World Sci. 1994; 16: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The nucleoside analogs are transported across the cell membrane by nucleoside transporters and are phosphorylated in cells by nucleoside and nucleotide kinases to their pharmacologically active triphosphate forms. The nucleoside analog triphosphates compete with the deoxyribonucleotides as substrates of cellular or viral DNA polymerases. Incorporation of nucleoside analogs into the elongating DNA strands induces cell death or inhibits viral replication (3Balzarini J. Pharm.

Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Blood. 1997; 90: 270-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first and rate-limiting phosphorylation step of most nucleoside analogs is catalyzed by the deoxyribonucleoside kinases as follows: deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), and thymidine kinases 1 and 2 (TK1 and TK2) (3Balzarini J. Pharm. World Sci. 1994; 16: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 6Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). TK1 is a cytosolic enzyme, and dCK is located in the cytosol or nucleus, whereas both dGK and TK2 are mitochondrial enzymes (7Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The rate-limiting step of nucleoside analog phosphorylation occurs accordingly in different subcellular compartments depending on which nucleoside kinase catalyzes the reaction. The effects of nucleoside analogs on mitochondria have been intensively studied since several pyrimidine nucleoside analogs used in antiviral therapy damage mitochondrial DNA and thereby interfere with mitochondrial function (12Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 13Lewis W. Levine E.S. Griniuviene B. Tankersley K.O. Colacino J.M. Sommadossi J.P. Watanabe K.A. Perrino F.W.

The mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide pool has been suggested to be separated from the cytosolic/nuclear pool (15Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Davis A.F. Clayton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Accordingly, nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinases may become trapped within the mitochondria and affect mitochondrial, but not nuclear, DNA. We have recently shown that overexpression of human mitochondrial dGK in cancer cell lines enhances the sensitivity to cytotoxic nucleoside analogs (18Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mitochondrial nucleoside kinases may be important for the pharmacological activation of nucleoside analogs. In order to study the compartmentalization of nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the mitochondria, we reconstituted a dCK-deficient cell line with genetically engineered dCK mutants targeted to either the cytosol, nucleus, or mitochondria. This cell model system allowed us to study subcellular compartmentalization of nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the three different compartments. In summary, we showed that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the mitochondria became trapped in this compartment and that the subcellular location of nucleoside analog phosphorylation is an important determinant for the incorporation of nucleoside analogs into nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. The pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) was used for all plasmids constructed. The wild-type nucDCK-GFP and the mutant cytDCK-GFP were constructed as described (7Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence encoding the 31-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial import signal of cytochrome coxidase subunit VIII was cloned upstream of GFP or cytDCK-GFP cDNA to create COX-GFP and mitDCK-GFP (19Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The plasmids were purified with the maxi-prep kit (Qiagen), and the DNA sequences were verified by automated laser fluorescence sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The dCK-deficient CHO cell line (a gift from Dr. W. Plunkett, Houston, TX) (20Harris B.A. Saunders P.P. Plunkett W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured at 37 °C in McCoy 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and GFP fluorescence was observed in the living cells 48 h after transfection (7Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For generation of stably transfected cells, the cells were subcultured 1:5 3 days after transfection, and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. Geneticin-resistant cell colonies with green fluorescence were isolated and continuously cultured (7Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein extracts of the mitochondrial and cytosolic subcellular fractions were prepared as described (10Söderlund J.C.F. Arnér E.S.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 370: 201-204Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane blots were probed for 1 h with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH). A secondary alkaline phosphatase conjugate anti-IgG antibody (Sigma) was applied for 1 h, and the alkaline phosphatase was visualized by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). The dCK assays were performed as described (10Söderlund J.C.F. Arnér E.S.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 370: 201-204Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar,21Arnér E.S.J. Spasokoukotskaja T. Eriksson S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 2 μm [8-3H]CdA (20 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals Inc.) and 8 μm unlabeled CdA (Sigma) were used in each reaction. The cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides (Nunc Inc.) for 24 h. Cells were labeled with 0.8 μm[3H]2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine (Moravek Biochem), 0.7 μm[3H]1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Moravek Biochem), or 0.2 μm [3H]thymidine (DuPont) for 6–20 h. The slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed 10 min in methanol:acetic acid (3:1), and washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, once with water, and once with methanol. The slides were coated with Hypercoat photoemulsion (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed 1–3 weeks at 4 °C. The autoradiographs were developed using D-11 developer (Eastman Kodak Co.). 2 × 103 cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates, and AraC (Sigma), CdA (Sigma) or dFdC (Lilly) was added after 24 h. Cell survival was determined by the metrotetrazolium assay (Cell Proliferation Kit I, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after 4 days of drug exposure. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's paired t test. Apoptosis was determined by caspase-3 activity and DNA laddering. 50 μm dFdC, CdA, or cisplatin was used for all experiments. For caspase-3 assays, 2 × 106 cells were harvested after 6 h of drug incubation. Caspase-3 activity assay was performed with the ApoAlert Colorimetric assay kit (CLONTECH). For the DNA laddering analysis, 2 × 105 cells were harvested after 48 h of drug incubation, and the DNA was extracted (22Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). We constructed three plasmids to express the cDNA of human dCK targeted to the nucleus, cytosol, or mitochondria (Fig. 1 A). dCK was expressed as a fusion protein to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in order to visualize easily the subcellular location of the recombinant enzymein vivo. Wild-type dCK-GFP (nucDCK-GFP) is predominantly located in the cell nucleus, and a mutant lacking the N-terminal nuclear localization signal (cytDCK-GFP) is retained in the cytosol (7Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The N-terminal mitochondrial import signal of cytochromec oxidase subunit VIII can be fused to heterologous proteins, such as GFP (COX-GFP) (19Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), to target these proteins to the mitochondria. We fused the cytochrome c oxidase mitochondrial import signal to the N terminus of the cytosolic dCK mutant to target dCK to the mitochondria (mitDCK-GFP). dCK-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with the plasmids, and stably transfected cell clones were isolated. Visualization of GFP by fluorescence microscopy showed predominantly nuclear fluorescence for the nucDCK-GFP construct and cytosolic fluorescence for the cytDCK-GFP construct (Fig. 1 B). The cells transfected with the mitDCK-GFP plasmid showed an irregular dotted fluorescence pattern around a non-fluorescent nucleus (Fig. 1 B). This pattern is similar to the fluorescence pattern of the mitochondrial COX-GFP protein (Fig. 1 B) as well as to other mitochondrial proteins fused to GFP (18Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To verify further the mitochondrial location of mitDCK-GFP, we separated cytosolic and mitochondrial protein fractions and used an anti-GFP antibody to detect the fusion proteins by Western blot (Fig. 2 A). A major band of ≈54 kDa was detected in the cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, fraction of the cells expressing nucDCK-GFP or cytDCK-GFP. In contrast, a band of similar size was detected in the mitochondrial, but not cytosolic, fraction of cells expressing mitDCK-GFP. We conclude that the three plasmids target dCK-GFP to the three different subcellular compartments.Figure 2Expression and activity of dCK-GFP in the transfected cells. A, Western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibodies of cytosolic (C) and mitochondrial (M) subcellular protein fractions of CHO cells expressing nucDCK-GFP, cytDCK-GFP, and mitDCK-GFP. B, dCK activity, determined as CdA phosphorylation, in crude extracts of the untransfected and transfected CHO cells. wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We determined the dCK activity in the transfected cells to verify its enzymatic activity. The dCK activity, determined as phosphorylation of the nucleoside analog CdA, was ≈4-fold higher in the dCK-expressing cells than in the dCK-deficient parent cell line (Fig. 2 B). There was no significant difference in dCK activity between the cells overexpressing dCK-GFP in the cytosol, nucleus, or mitochondria. Phosphorylation of CdA detected in the dCK-deficient parent cells is probably due to mitochondrial dGK, because CdA phosphorylation is catalyzed by both dCK and dGK (23Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We used an autoradiography method to distinguish between incorporation of nucleoside analogs into nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (Fig.3). [3H]dThd was used as a control, and it was incorporated into nuclear DNA of all cell lines independently of dCK expression as expected. A lightly dotted [3H]dThd autoradiography pattern was detected outside the nucleus, representing dThd incorporation into mitochondrial DNA (16Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AraC is predominantly phosphorylated by dCK (24Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and as expected, no incorporation of [3H]AraC into DNA was detected in the dCK-deficient cells. The cells expressing nucDCK-GFP and cytDCK-GFP both efficiently incorporated [3H]AraC into nuclear DNA. In contrast, the cells expressing mitDCK-GFP showed an irregularly dotted autoradiography pattern distributed throughout the cells, indicating that the nucleoside analog was incorporated into mitochondrial DNA. Cells incubated with [3H]CdA showed a similar pattern as those incubated with AraC, except for dCK-deficient cells that incorporated CdA into mitochondrial DNA, probably due to CdA phosphorylation catalyzed by mitochondrial dGK (23Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In summary, our data showed that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in either the cytosol or the nucleus were incorporated into nuclear DNA, whereas nucleoside analogs phosphorylated within the mitochondria became trapped in this compartment and were not incorporated into nuclear DNA. The sensitivity of the transfected cells to the nucleoside analogs dFdC, AraC, and CdA was determined (Fig. 4). The three dCK overexpressing cell lines were more sensitive to the nucleoside analogs than the dCK-deficient parent cell line. The cell lines overexpressing dCK in the nucleus or in the cytosol cells exhibited ≈50–400-fold lower IC50 for the investigated compounds compared with the untransfected cells. There was no difference in nucleoside analog sensitivity between the cells expressing dCK in the nucleus or the cytosol. However, the cells expressing mitochondrial dCK were less sensitive compared with the cells expressing cytosolic or nuclear dCK and exhibited only a 2–30-fold decrease in IC50 compared with the dCK-deficient parent cell line. Nucleoside analogs that interfere with nuclear DNA replication induce cell death by apoptosis similar to several other drugs that damage nuclear DNA (25Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V.

A. 1998; 95: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To address the question, whether nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the mitochondria induce apoptosis, we determined the presence of inter-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity after incubation with nucleoside analogs. Cells expressing dCK in either the cytosol, nucleus, or mitochondria that were incubated with either CdA (Fig.5) or dFdC (data not shown) showed caspase-3 activation and DNA laddering indicating cell death by an apoptotic pathway. We have in the present study demonstrated that the subcellular site of nucleoside analog phosphorylation is an important determinant for the incorporation of these compounds into nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the mitochondria became trapped in this compartment and were incorporated into mitochondrial but not nuclear DNA. A major implication of these findings is that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated by the mitochondrial nucleoside kinases dGK and TK2 are likely to affect mitochondrial DNA rather than nuclear DNA. Several antiviral nucleoside analogs such as 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine and fialuridine damage mitochondrial DNA and thereby cause adverse effects (12Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 13Lewis W. Levine E.S. Griniuviene B. Tankersley K.O. Colacino J.M. Sommadossi J.P. Watanabe K.A. Perrino F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3592-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Chen C.-H. Vazques-Padua M. Cheng Y.-C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 625-628PubMed Google Scholar). 3′-Azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine and fialuridine are substrates of both cytosolic TK1 as well as mitochondrial TK2 (28Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wang J. Eriksson S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1555-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the data presented in the current paper, it is likely that the intramitochondrial phosphorylation of these compounds catalyzed by TK2 results in selective mitochondrial DNA damage. However, the anti-human immunodeficiency virus nucleoside analogs 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine also cause mitochondrial DNA damage, although this compound is phosphorylated by dCK and not by the mitochondrial nucleoside kinases (14Chen C.-H. Vazques-Padua M. Cheng Y.-C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 625-628PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen C.-H. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2856-2859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to exist a mechanism for import of phosphorylated nucleoside analogs into mitochondria. Recently, a mitochondrial dCTP transport protein was identified that further supports this hypothesis (31Bridges E.G. Jiang Z. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we believe that nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment can be imported into the mitochondria, whereas no mechanism exists for export of phosphorylated nucleoside analogs from the mitochondria to the cytosol. The mitochondrial genome encodes enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, and defective expression of these enzymes results in disruption of cellular aerobic metabolism and cell death. The pyrimidine antiviral nucleoside analogs that damage mitochondrial DNA have been reported to cause either depletion of mitochondrial DNA or become incorporated into mitochondrial DNA and thereby interfere with mitochondrial DNA replication or transcription (12Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 13Lewis W. Levine E.S. Griniuviene B. Tankersley K.O. Colacino J.M. Sommadossi J.P. Watanabe K.A. Perrino F.W.

In contrast to the rapid induction of cell death caused by incorporation of nucleoside analogs into nuclear DNA, the effects on mitochondria by the antiviral nucleoside analogs are delayed and occur after weeks of drug exposure. In the present study, we detected cell death by an apoptotic pathway already within days of exposure to the anti-cancer nucleoside analogs that were phosphorylated in mitochondria and incorporated into mitochondrial DNA. Nucleoside analogs phosphorylated in the cytosolic/nuclear compartment, such as AraC and CdA, have previously been shown to induce apoptosis (25Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S.

A. 1998; 95: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but little is known about induction of apoptosis by mitochondrial DNA lesions. An early event in apoptosis caused by nuclear DNA-damaging agents is the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. The released cytosolic cytochrome c binds, together with dATP, to the apoptotic protease-activating factor-1, and the complex activates the caspase cascade that executes the apoptotic program (32Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4457) Google Scholar). The mechanism and regulation of cytochrome crelease from mitochondria are still to a large extent unknown, and we do not yet know whether apoptosis induced by nucleoside analog phosphorylation in mitochondria is associated with this phenomena. However, we cannot presently exclude that there is a small leakage of phosphorylated nucleoside analogs from mitochondria to the nucleus that we were unable to detect by the methods used in the present study, and it is possible that the activation of caspases results from nuclear DNA damage. We are currently initiating studies to resolve this issue. The cytosolic/nuclear nucleoside kinases have different substrate specificities compared with the mitochondrial nucleoside kinases. Our data suggest that it may be possible to minimize mitochondrial DNA damage by designing novel nucleoside analogs that are not phosphorylated by the mitochondrial enzymes. It may also be possible to develop cytotoxic nucleoside analogs that specifically target mitochondrial DNA. There are important differences between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA physiology. Nucleoside analogs that affect nuclear DNA replication are primarily effective in the S-phase of the cell cycle when nuclear DNA replication occurs. However, their efficiency is decreased by the large increase in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis via the de novo pathway in S-phase cells that compete with the nucleoside analogs as substrates for the DNA polymerases. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA is replicated independently of nuclear DNA throughout the cell cycle (33Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1977; 11: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial dNTP pools are separated from the cytosolic pool where the de novodeoxyribonucleotide synthesis occurs (15Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the cell nucleus contains several efficient DNA repair systems that remove incorporated nucleoside analogs that cause chain termination or mismatch base pairing. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA repair systems are inefficient in repairing DNA strand breaks as compared with the nuclear system (34Bogenhagen D.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1276-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The differences described above suggest that nucleoside analogs targeting nuclear and mitochondrial DNA may exhibit different pharmacological profiles that could be used for the development of novel anti-cancer chemotherapy regimes."

Previous studies of the domain structure revealed that near full topoisomerase I activity can be reconstituted in vitro by fragment complementation between recombinant polypeptides approximating the core and COOH-terminal domains. Here we demonstrate that deletion of linker residues Asp660 to Lys688 yields an active enzyme (topo70ΔL) that purifies as both a monomer and a dimer. The dimer is shown to result from domain swapping involving the COOH-terminal and core domains of the two subunits. The monomeric form is insensitive to the anti-tumor agent camptothecin and distributive during in vitro plasmid relaxation assays, whereas the dimeric form is camptothecin-sensitive and processive. However, the addition of camptothecin to enzyme/DNA mixtures causes enhancement of SDS-induced breakage by both monomeric and dimeric forms of the mutant enzyme. The similarity of the dimeric form to the wild type enzyme suggests that some structural feature of the dimer is providing a surrogate linker.

Cleavage occurs by a transesterification reaction involving nucleophilic attack by an active site tyrosine on a DNA phosphodiester bond resulting in the formation of a covalent DNA 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage. In the religation phase, a similar transesterification reaction involves attack by the free DNA 5′-hydroxyl that reseals the phosphodiester bond and releases the enzyme from the DNA (1Champoux J.J.

As suggested by its mode of action, the cytotoxic effects of camptothecin require the presence of active topoisomerase I in the cell. The topoisomerase I gene, TOP1, is dispensable in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae (29Thrash C. Voelkel K. DiNardo S. Sternglanz R. J. Biol.

The unconserved NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–214) is highly charged, contains four putative nuclear localization signals (36Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is extremely sensitive to proteases, and is dispensable for in vitroenzymatic activity (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C.

A form of the enzyme missing the first 174 amino acids (topo70)1(Fig. 1, panel A) has been described that retains all of thein vitro enzymatic properties normally ascribed to the full-length enzyme (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The conserved core domain (residues 215–635) has a globular structure and is relatively protease-resistant. A short, unconserved protease-sensitive linker region (residues 636–712) connects the core to the highly conserved and protease-resistant COOH-terminal domain (residues 713–765). The COOH-terminal domain contains the active site tyrosine at position 723. We have previously shown that human topoisomerase I activity can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing a 58-kDa core fragment corresponding to residues 175–659 (topo58) with any one of a series of COOH-terminal fragments ranging in size from 12 (topo12, residues 658–765) to 6.3 kDa (topo6.3, residues 713–765) (Fig. 1,panel A) (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The core and COOH-terminal fragments bind to form a 1:1 complex, and both topo58/12 and topo58/6.3 display nearly the same plasmid relaxation activity under standard assay conditions as the full-length enzyme or topo70 (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The reconstituted enzymes (topo58/12 and topo58/6.3) differ from intact topo70 by exhibiting a reduced affinity for DNA and a cleavage-religation equilibrium that is strongly biased toward religation (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To define further the role of the linker region, we have characterized a form of the enzyme produced by a deletion in the coding region that removes approximately the distal 40% (residues Asp660 to Lys688) of the coiled-coil linker region (2Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). We show here that during the purification of the resulting topo70ΔL protein, both the anticipated monomer and a smaller amount of an unusual dimeric species are found. Although both forms are enzymatically active, they differ with respect to their processivities and their responses to camptothecin in a plasmid relaxation assay. Plasmids were constructed using conventional cloning techniques (42) and propagated using the Escherichia coli strain TOP10F′ (mcrA, Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC), φ80ΔlacZΔM15, ΔlacX74, deoR, recA1, araD139, Δ(ara, leu)7697, galU, galK, rpsL, endA1, nupG (F′:lacIq Tn10 tetr)) (Invitrogen). The construction of each plasmid was verified by restriction enzyme analysis and dideoxy sequencing of both critical junction sequences and sequences subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Sequence coordinates for the topoisomerase I cDNA are numbered according to D'Arpa et al. (38D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie H.D. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When performing oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, double-stranded plasmids were first introduced into E. coli strain CJ236 (dut-1, ung-1, thi-1, relA1/pCJ105 (CmrF′)). Phagemid DNA was rescued from the strain using the helper phage M13K07. The single-stranded DNA was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis following the procedure of Kunkelet al. (43Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In a three-fragment ligation reaction, the plasmid pADH1-topoI was constructed by replacing the GAL4 DNA binding domain sequence in GBT9 (HindIII411 (end-filled) toBamHI880) (44Bartel P.L. Cheng-ting C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 153-179Google Scholar) with sequences encoding the human topoisomerase I cDNA. The 5′ end of the human topoisomerase I cDNA (BamHI (end-filled) toAvrII2386) was derived from the plasmid pHT100 (36Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ end of the topoisomerase I cDNA (AvrII2386 to PstI) was derived from pKM10 (9Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar). The HindIII1310 toPvuII2111 sequences in the pGBT9 backbone of pADH1-topoI (encoding the 5′ end of the TRP1 selectable marker) were replaced with a HindIII to SmaI fragment encoding the URA3 selectable marker from the plasmid YEp24 (American Type Culture Collection 37051). TheHindIII site at the 5′ end of the newly insertedURA3 selectable marker was eliminated by partially digesting the DNA with HindIII, filling in the overhangs with T4 polymerase, and ligating the DNA. An ∼1.5-kbp SphI fragment from pADH1-topoI(URA) (encompassing the junction between the 3′ end of the ADH1 promoter and the 5′ end of the human topoisomerase I cDNA) was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pGEM3zf(−). The resulting plasmid was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in order to restore a BamHI site to the 5′ end of the topoisomerase I cDNA. The mutagenized plasmid has the sequence 5′GGATCCACATG3′ at the 5′ end of the topoisomerase I cDNA. The BamHI site is underlined, and the methionine start codon for topoisomerase I is indicated in bold. The ∼1.5-kbp SphI fragment of pADH1-topoI(URA) was replaced with the equivalent ∼1.5-kbp fragment from pGEMADH5′-topoI. The resulting expression construct encodes the full-length human topoisomerase I driven by the ADH1 promoter. An ∼2.9-kbp BamHI (end-filled) to PstI fragment from the plasmid pET11a-topo70(Y/F) (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

The resulting plasmid encodes a fusion protein comprised of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GB) fused to the active site mutant (Y723F) form of topo70. An ∼2.9-kbp BamHI (end-filled) toPstI fragment from pAc-topo58 (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was inserted into the polylinker of pGBT9 to generate pGB-topo58 which encodes a fusion protein comprised of the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to topo58. The ∼0.9-kbp EcoRI toHindIII fragment from pGB-topo58 was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II KS(+). The resulting plasmid was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in order to restore a BamHI site to the 5′ end of the topo58 cDNA. The resulting plasmid has the following nucleotide sequence at the junction between the 3′ end of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the 5′ end of topo58, 5′TCGCCGGAATTCCCGGGGATCCCTATAAATATG3′. The BamHI site is underlined, and codon 147 of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the methionine start codon for topo58 are indicated in bold. An ∼1.5-kbp BamHI to HindIII fragment spanning the region between the ADH1 promoter and the 5′-half of the topoisomerase I cDNA was removed from pADH1B-topoI(URA) and replaced with the ∼0.9-kbp BamHI to HindIII fragment from pBSGB-topo58. The resulting plasmid, called pADH1B-topo70(URA), encodes the topo70 enzyme (Fig. 1, panel A). The plasmid pADH1B-topo70Phe(URA) was generated by replacing the ∼1.9-kbp HindIII to EcoRI sequences from pADH1B-topo70(URA) with an ∼1.9-kbp HindIII toEcoRI fragment from pGB-topo70Phe. The resulting plasmid expresses the topo70Phe protein. The HindIII1662 toEcoRI3641 fragment of the topoisomerase I cDNA in pADH1-topoI(URA) was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pGEM3zf(−). The resulting plasmid was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to remove the nucleotides between 2188 and 2276 in the topoisomerase I cDNA sequence, deleting the coding region from Asp660 to Lys688. The ∼1.9-kbp HindIII toEcoRI fragment that encodes the 3′ end of the topo70 cDNA was removed from pADH1B-topo70(URA) and replaced with the ∼1.8-kbp HindIII to EcoRI fragment from pGEM3′-topoIΔL. The resulting plasmid encodes the topo70ΔL protein that is missing amino acids from residue 660 to residue 688 (Fig. 1,panel A). The isolation of topo70-expressing recombinant baculovirus, the culture and infection of Sf9 insect cells, and the purification of the various proteins have been described previously (34Stewart L.

The generation of the topo58/6.3, and topo58/12 reconstituted proteins is described elsewhere (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The topo70ΔL coding sequences were removed from pADH1Btopo70ΔL(URA) as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment and ligated into pFASTBAC 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). A similar plasmid containing the Y723F mutation was used to derive the coding region for topo70ΔLPhe. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the topo70ΔL and topo70ΔLPhe proteins were generated with the Bac-to-Bac expression system according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The wild type and active site mutant topo70ΔL proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously for the wild type enzyme (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purification procedure involved chromatography over phosphocellulose, Mono Q (5H/R), and Mono S (5H/R) columns using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The topo70ΔL protein eluted from the Mono S column in two distinct peaks, one at ∼140 mm and the other at ∼170 mm KPO4 in the approximate ratio of 3:1. The two peaks were kept separate, dialyzed into Storage Buffer (50% glycerol, 10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and stored at −20 °C. The generation of plasmid pGST-topo12 and the purification of the GST-topo12 fusion in the BL21 (Novagen) strain of E. coli were described previously (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pGST-topo12 protein is composed of GST followed by a factor Xa cleavage site, two extraneous amino acids (Gly-Ile), and residues Leu658–Phe765 of topoisomerase I (Fig. 1,panel A). The purification of topo12 by factor Xa cleavage of the GST fusion protein and subsequent purification by Mono S column (5H/R) chromatography were described previously (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed with the various expression plasmids using the lithium acetate procedure (45Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 46Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic dextrose (SD) medium lacking the appropriate supplements to maintain plasmid selection. At least four independent clones were selected from each transformation. Camptothecin sensitivity assays were performed using S. cerevisiae strain JN2-134 (MATa rad52::LEU2 trp1 ade2-1 his7 ura3-52 ise1 top1-1) (10Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar). The lactone form of camptothecin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO at 3.5 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. Plasmid-containing JN2-134 cells were tested for camptothecin sensitivity on solid media containing the drug as described (10Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of exponentially growing cells were diluted in sterile water, and equivalent aliquots of each dilution were spread on SD agar medium lacking uracil. The media also contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and either 10 μg/ml camptothecin (final concentration, 0.05% Me2SO) or 0.05% Me2SO alone as a control. Plates were incubated at 30 °C until colonies were clearly visible on the Me2SO control plates, usually 4–5 days. The numbers of colonies on each plate visible to the unaided eye (>0.2 mm) were counted. Expression of the recombinant fragments of human topoisomerase I in the yeast cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of extracts prepared by disruption with glass beads according to the procedure described by Jazwinski (47Jazwinski S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 154-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Western blot transfer and immunoblot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-human topoisomerase I serum were carried out as described previously (33Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation procedures used to estimate the apparent molecular mass of the low and high salt pools of topo70ΔL were carried out as described previously (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The 25-mer oligonucleotide (5′GAAAAAAGACTTAGAAAAATTTTTA3′) was purified, 5′-end-labeled, and used as the substrate for the SDS cleavage assays as described previously (41Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μl samples were prepared so that each contained 317 nm purified enzyme. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2.5 μl of 5′-32P-end-labeled single-stranded (suicide cleavage) or duplex 25-mer (SDS cleavage) DNA substrate to give a final concentration of 1.43 μm. The final reaction conditions were 138 mm KCl, 12 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 5.5% Me2SO, with or without 50 μmcamptothecin. After a 45-min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were adjusted to 1% SDS, boiled, and fractionated by 8–17% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and the radiolabeled cleavage products were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The standard reaction mixtures for topoisomerase relaxation assays contained 10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Reaction Buffer). Enzyme Dilution Buffer contained 10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For the serial dilution assays, protein samples were serially diluted 2-fold in Dilution Buffer, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of diluted enzyme to 15 μl of Reaction Buffer containing 0.5 μg of supercoiled pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid substrate DNA (Stratagene). After 10 min at 37 °C the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of Stop Dye (2.5% SDS, 25% Ficoll 400, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanol, 25 mmEDTA), and one-half of each sample was analyzed by electrophoresis in an 0.8% agarose gel. For the time course assays, the enzyme was diluted to 3 ng/μl in Dilution Buffer, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 12 μl of diluted enzyme to 228 μl of Reaction Buffer containing 25 ng/μl of plasmid DNA. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and at the indicated time points 20-μl aliquots were removed into 5 μl of Stop Dye to terminate the reaction. The DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed with UV illumination. Subtilisin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted to the indicated concentration in 10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Purified proteins stored at −20 °C were diluted to 1.25 mg/ml in Storage Buffer. 6 μl of subtilisin at 4 μg/ml was aliquoted into tubes; for the no digestion control reactions, l μl of 30 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was also added to the tubes. 4 μl of diluted protein was added to the subtilisin and subtilisin plus PMSF tubes to begin the proteolysis reaction, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 30 mm PMSF, and reactions were placed on ice. Half of the sample (5.5 μl) was removed into 4 μl of Native Load Buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm histidine, 6 mm MOPS, pH 6.6, 0.04% methyl green) and analyzed by Native-PAGE, and 4 μl of SDS Load Buffer (20% glycerol, 5% w/v SDS, 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 0.03% bromphenol blue) was added to the remaining reaction to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Native protein analysis was carried out by continuous gel electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide using 25 mmhistidine, 30 mm MOPS Running Buffer, pH 6.6, run from anode to cathode (49McLellan T. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Native gels were pre-run for 1–1.5 h at 4 °C at 200 V, and after loading the samples the gels were run for 1 h at 200 V and 4 °C. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue or Silver staining. To determine the biochemical consequences of deleting a portion of the linker region of human topoisomerase I, recombinant baculoviruses were constructed that express the topo70 form of the protein deleted for amino acids 660–688 (topo70ΔL) (Fig. 1, panel A). Both topo70ΔL and the catalytically inactive topo70ΔLPhe (Y723F mutation) were purified from infected Sf9 insect cells. One of the final steps in the purification procedure involved elution from a Mono S (H5/R) cation exchange column using a 50–200 mm KPO4 gradient. Unlike topo70 that elutes as a single species from the column (34Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J"
https://openalex.org/W2061052500,"TAFII105 is a TFIID-associated factor highly expressed in B lymphocytes. This subunit is found in a small portion of TFIID complexes and is homologous to human TAFII130 and Drosophila TAFII110. In the present study we show that TAFII105 is involved in transcription activation directed by the B cell-specific octamer element found in many B cell-specific genes. B cells overexpressing TAFII105 display higher octamer-dependent transcription, whereas expression of a C-terminal truncated form of TAFII105 inhibits octamer transcription in a dominant negative manner. In addition, antibodies directed against TAFII105 specifically inhibit octamer-dependent transcription. Reporter gene analysis revealed that TAFII105 elevates octamer transcription in the presence of OCA-B, a cofactor subunit of Oct1 and Oct2 proteins. In vitro binding assays and functional studies established that the effect of TAFII105 on octamer activity involves interaction of TAFII105 with octamer-binding complexes via the C-terminal activation domain of OCA-B. These findings link TAFII105 coactivator function to B cell-specific transcription. TAFII105 is a TFIID-associated factor highly expressed in B lymphocytes.

TATA-binding protein associated factor major late promoter polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin The program of B cell-specific gene expression during development is highly controlled and is governed by gene-specific organization of DNA regulatory elements and combinatorial interactions of ubiquitous and cell type-specific transcription factors and cofactors. In recent years significant progress has been made in identifying and understanding the physiological role of transcription factors involved in B cell development (1.Henderson A. Calame K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the mechanism underlying the transcription activation process by these factors. Considering the accumulating evidence indicating that interactions of activators with various components of the general transcription apparatus are essential for transcription activation process, it is reasonable that similar mechanisms apply also for B cell transcription factors. Several studies implicated the basal transcription factor TFIID as potential target for specific activation domains of activators (2.Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3.Horikoshi M. Wang C.K. Fujii H. Cromlish J.A. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TFIID is required for directing core promoter recognition and pre-initiation complex assembly (9.Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem.

A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription studies have indicated that the TAF subunits play a crucial role as activation domain mediators (coactivators) through direct interaction with activators (11.Chen J.L. Attardi L. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12.Thut C.J. Chen J.L. Klemm R. Tjian R.

In addition, certain TAFs also function as promoter selectivity factors (14.Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15.Burke T.W. Kadonada J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Several reports suggested that certain TAFs play an important role in gene-specific transcriptional activation in vivo in high eukaryotes (16.May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I.

Recent genetic experiments in yeast with individual TAF mutants suggested that, whereas some TAFs are essential for transcription of the majority of class II genes (21.Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), certain TAFs are not generally required for transcription activation (27.Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M.A. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28.Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K.

Due to a lack of additional genetic studies in metazoans, little is known about the transcription regulatory pathways that specifically require the activities of the TAFs. Previously we have cloned a subunit of TFIID, TAFII105, that is related to the coactivator subunit hTAFII130 and toDrosophila TAFII110 (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The C-terminal third of these subunits is highly conserved (17.Mengus G. May M. Carry L. Chambon P. Davidson I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1381-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The N terminus of TAFII105 is significantly more diverged and was shown to be involved in interaction with activation domains of activators (19.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unlike most TAF subunits that are conserved from yeast to human, no homolog has been found for the family of hTAFII105, hTAFII130, and dTAFII110 proteins in yeast, suggesting that these TAFs might be involved in transcription regulatory pathways that do not exist in yeast. TAFII105 was originally identified as TFIID-associated polypeptide that is highly abundant in purified TFIID complex isolated from mature B cell line (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the expression pattern of a transcription factor usually correlates with its function, it was postulated that TAFII105 may be involved in B cell-specific transcription (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TAFII105 appears to be present only in a subset of TFIID complexes, and therefore is likely to function in the context of a specific set of genes. Consistent with these assumptions, our previous analysis of TAFII105 function revealed that it acts as an activation domain-specific coactivator of p65/RelA, a subunit of the NF-κB family of transcription factors (19.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These studies also indicated that the p65·TAFII105 complex is involved in cytokine-mediated gene expression and anti-apoptotic gene activation (19.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the role of TAFII105 in transcription regulation mediated by the octamer motif. The octamer motif plays a crucial role in directing the B cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin and other B cell-specific genes. This motif is found in the promoters and enhancers of all immunoglobulin genes and is essential for the B cell-specific expression of these genes (31.Staudt L.M. Lenardo M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Two octamer-binding factors are expressed in B cells, a ubiquitous protein Oct1 and the B cell-specific factor Oct2. These proteins associate with a B cell-specific cofactor OCA-B also known as OBF-1 and Bob1 (32.Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33.Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 34.Strubin M. Newell J.M. Mattias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). OCA-B interacts with Oct1 and Oct2 via its N terminus and provides a strong activation domain to this complex. Our studies reveal that TAFII105 plays a transcription coactivator role required for a high level of B cell-specific octamer activity. Dissection of the molecular mechanism involved in the effect of TAFII105 on octamer transcription revealed that TAFII105 interacts with octamer-binding complexes through direct interaction with the cofactor OCA-B. This interaction is required for TAFII105 enhancement of octamer-dependent activity and is mediated by the C-terminal activation domain of OCA-B and the coactivation domain of TAFII105. These results suggest that TAFII105 is an additional regulatory component of octamer-dependent B cell-specific gene expression, acting as coactivator for octamer-binding complexes. For the in vitro transcription reactions we used nuclear extract prepared from the B cell line Daudi. The reaction mixture (18 μl) contained 3 μl of extract, 6 μl of transcription buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 100 mm KCl; 2 mm MgCl2; 0.2 mm EDTA; 20% glycerol; and 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.6 μl of 0.1m MgCl2, 40 units of RNasin, and 200 ng of DNA template. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Then 2 μl of the nucleotide mixture was added (for IgH and 2xOct/IgH G-less reporters: 5 mm ATP and UTP, 1 mm3′-O-methyl-GTP, and 100 μm[α-32P]CTP; and for the major late promoter (MLP) U-less reporter: 5 mm ATP and GTP and 100 μm[α-32P]CTP), and the reaction was incubated for additional 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of stop mixture (2 m NH4AC; 10 mm EDTA; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; and 0.25 μg/ml tRNA), phenol chloroform extracted, and ethanol precipitated and run on a 6% sequencing gel. When antibodies were used in the assay, they were pre-incubated with the transcription mixture in the absence of the DNA template for 30 min, followed by the procedure described above. Anti-TAFII105 antibodies used in the transcription are polyclonal antibodies directed against amino acids 1–552 (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The anti-HBV core antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Y Shaul. Full-length OCA-B was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a Daudi cell cDNA library and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGAATTCCATATGCTCTGGCAAAAACCCACAG -3′; 5′- TCCCAGTTTCAGGGAACAGGA-3′. For in vitro transcription and translation of OCA-B, the PCR fragment was digested by NdeI and was cloned into NdeI-StuI sites of a pTβstop vector. The sequence of the PCR fragment was determined and found to be correct. A mammalian expression vector for OCA-B (pCGN-OCA-B) was generated in two steps. AnNdeI-Ecl136II fragment from pTβ-OCA-B was first subcloned into NdeI-HincII sites of pBSNLS-HA downstream to a nuclear localization signal and HA tag. Next, aSmaI fragment from this plasmid was inserted into theSmaI site of pCGN vector (35.Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). TAFII105 expression plasmid was created by inserting an NcoI (filled in) and a BglII fragment from pVLHA-TAFII105 into SmaI-BamHI sites of pCGN. TAFII105 retroviral expression vector (pBabe-105) was generated using a three-point ligation reaction. AnEcl136II-NcoI fragment from pCGN-105ΔC containing the thymidine kinase leader sequence and anNcoI-SalI fragment from the pTβ-TAFII105 plasmid, encoding for TAFII105, were ligated into SnaBI-SalI sites of a pBabe-neo vector. pTβ-TAFII105 was created by inserting anNdeI fragment from pVLFlag-TAFII105, previously described (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) into the NdeI site of pTβstop. TAFII105ΔN plasmid fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was generated by PCR using: 5′-CGATGAGGATGACATCAATG-3′ and T7 primers. Bluescript-TAFII105 was used as a template with the proofreading PWO enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR product was ligated into StuI-EcoRI sites of the pTβstop vector, followed by subcloning intoNcoI-EcoRI sites of vector pGEX. TAFII130ΔC (a), fused to GST, was cloned by digesting the TAFII130ΔC plasmid withNcoI-HincII, at amino acids 484–757, and cloning into NcoI-StuI of vector pGEX-2TKN. The fragment GST-130ΔC (b), amino acids 100–468, was cloned using aNcoI-StuI digest and inserted into the pGEX-2TKN vector in the NcoI-StuI sites. The Oct-TATA reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (see below) containing a single octamer motif as aHindIII-Blunt fragment into theHindIII-Ecl136II sites upstream to a minimal α-actin core promoter (−40 to +80) of pLuc-α-actin vector. Octamer oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-AGCTTTCAGGGTATGCAAATTATTAAGTCTCG-3′ and 5′-CGAGACTTAATAATTTGCATACCCTGAA-3′. The construct Oct TATA/SV40 was generated by subcloning an Oct TATAHindIII-NarI fragment from pOct-TATA intoHindIII-NarI of pGL2-enhancer vector (Promega). An Oct-less/SV40 construct was created by inserting aSacI-NarI fragment from pLuc-α-actin plasmid into theSacI-NarI sites of pGL2-enhancer plasmid. The 4xOct wild type and 4xOct mutant plasmids were a generous gift from Dr. T. Wirth. The J chain reporter plasmid was kindly provided by the late M. Koshland, and the Igκ luciferase was described previously (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid 2xOct/IgH, used for in vitrotranscription, was constructed by using two oligonucleotides; 5′-AATAATTTGCATACCCTAATTTGCATACG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGTATGCAAATTAGGGTATGCAAATTATT-3′. The two oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into IgH (G-less cassette) inEcoRI-Ecl136II sites. To obtain the OCA-B 1–230 mutant, pCGN-OCA-B was first digested with XbaI, followed by a partial digest with HincII, and the fragment was subcloned intoXbaI-SmaI of the pCGN vector. pTβ-OCA-B 1–230 was constructed by inserting an NdeI-HincII (partial digest) fragment into NdeI-StuI sites of pTβstop vector. Details on the generation of Gal4-OCA-B fusion proteins can be given by request. The N and C termini of TAFII105, and TAFII130 N-terminal fragments were expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads.35S-labeled Oct1, Oct2, and various OCA-B-derived proteins were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and rabbit reticulocytes lysate (Promega TNT kit), and incubated with the different GST-purified proteins in 0.1 m KCl HEMG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9; 100 mm KCl; 12.5 mm MgCl2; 0.2 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer and twice with 0.2m KCl HEMG buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in protein sample buffer followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. Nuclear extract from BJAB cells was prepared as described (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 50 μl of nuclear extract (15 mg/ml) in 0.1 m HEMG + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were incubated with GST105ΔC or with GST beads as described above. After the washes, bound proteins were eluted with 1m NaCl HEMG, loaded onto an SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot, using anti-OCA-B, anti-Oct2, and anti-RelB antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). 293 cells (embryonic kidney fibroblasts) were maintained in F-12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the standard CaPO4 method. For reporter assays, subconfluent cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids in a 24-well multidish using a total of 0.8 μg of plasmid, usually 100 ng of the reporter gene, 400 ng of pCGN-OCA-B, and 200 ng of pCGN-TAFII105. The amount of CMV vector in each transfection was kept constant. BJAB (human), S194 (mouse), mature B cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections to S194 stably expressing TAFII105 were done according to the DEAE-dextran method, using 0.5–1 μg of reporter plasmid in a total of 8.5 μg of DNA, in 100-mm dishes. To analyze the effect of dominant negative TAFII105, a transfection assay was performed using 3 μg of reporter plasmid and 12 μg of TAFII105ΔC plasmid. The amount of CMV vector in each transfection was kept constant. A pool of S194 cells expressing TAFII105 was generated in two steps. First, TAFII105 retroviral particles were produced in 293 cells. Briefly, 293 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 50-mm plates 24 h before transfection. Shortly before transfection, medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum containing 25 μm chloroquine. 10 μg of DNA containing pBabe-TAFII105 and ψ helper vector at a 1:1 ratio were transfected into the cells using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method. After 8 h, the medium was replaced with a fresh one. Supernatant containing viral particles was harvested 48 h after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. To infect S194 cells with the virus, 2 ml of the viral supernatant and polybrene (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) were used to infect 0.5 × 106 cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 2.5 h, an additional 8 ml of RPMI/10% fetal calf serum was added to each plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1–1.5 days before addition of G418 (1 mg/ml; the active component is ∼0.5 mg/ml). Medium was changed every 3–4 days. Pools of G418-resistant cells were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-TAFII105 polyclonal antibodies. As a first step in testing the possible involvement of TAFII105 in octamer-dependent transcription, we established a pool of S194 B cells constitutively expressing hTAFII105. These and control cells were transfected with two different octamer-dependent luciferase reporter genes (Fig. 1 B), one contains four tandem octamer sites and the other has a single octamer site upstream to a minimal core promoter element. As shown in Fig.1 B, octamer-dependent luciferase activity is higher in TAFII105-expressing cells. The activities of reporter plasmids containing mutated octamer motifs or lacking octamer motif were almost undetectable and were unaffected by TAFII105 expression (columns 5–8). Although the fold of induction of octamer activity was not high, it was highly reproducible. Considering the results shown in the subsequent figures, it may be explained by the low level of ectopic expression TAFII105 achieved in S194 cells relative to human 293 cells (Fig.1 A). Next, we tested the potential of a C-terminal truncated form of TAFII105 (TAFII105ΔC) to inhibit octamer transcription. This mutant is deleted of the C-terminal TFIID-binding domain and was previously shown to act as a dominant negative mutant of TAFII105 function (19.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). BJAB and S194 B cell lines were transfected with octamer-dependent reporter plasmid together with expression plasmid for TAFII105ΔC. As shown in Fig. 1 C, TAFII105ΔC inhibited octamer transcription in both cell lines. To examine more directly the involvement of TAFII105 in octamer-dependent transcription, we performed in vitro transcription reactions using a reporter plasmid composed of two octamer elements upstream of a minimal IgH core promoter (Fig.1 D, upper panel) and nuclear extract prepared from the Daudi B cell line. As expected, the transcription level of the octamer-containing reporter plasmid was significantly higher than the core promoter alone (Fig. 1 D, lower panel,lanes 1 and 2) confirming that octamer-binding proteins mediate octamer transcription in vitro. Antibodies directed against TAFII105 N-terminal domain decreased 95% of octamer-dependent transcription (compare lanes 2 and 3), whereas control antibodies have no effect on octamer transcription (compare lanes 2 and 4). By contrast, less then 8% reduction was observed on transcription mediated by the adenovirus major late core promoter, consistent with our previous finding that approximately 10% of the TFIID contain TAFII105 in Daudi nuclear extract (MLP, lanes 5–7). Taken together, these results suggest that TAFII105 is involved in octamer-mediated transcription in B cells. In B cells, gene activation through an octamer motif is regulated by two octamer-specific binding proteins Oct1 and Oct2 and a B cell-specific cofactor OCA-B (36.Matthias P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). OCA-B is recruited to the octamer site by direct interaction with the POU domains of Oct1 and Oct2 and activates octamer-specific transcription by providing a transcription activation function to Oct1 and Oct2 (32.Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33.Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 34.Strubin M. Newell J.M. Mattias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To examine the role of TAFII105 in octamer-mediated transcription, the effect of OCA-B and TAFII105 expression on octamer-dependent transcription activity was tested using transient transfection experiments in the human kidney fibroblast cell line 293. In these cells OCA-B is brought to the promoter by the ubiquitously expressed Oct1 protein. Luciferase reporter plasmid containing a minimal core promoter element and an upstream octamer site were cotransfected together with OCA-B or TAFII105 expression plasmids and luciferase activity was determined. To observe a coactivation effect by both proteins, we used limiting amounts of each factor. As shown in Fig.2 A, expression of TAFII105 and OCA-B resulted in a marked increase of octamer activity relative to the expression of each of these proteins alone (compare column 4 with columns 2 and3). This stimulation is specific because coexpression of TAFII130, a TFIID subunit related to TAFII105, has no stimulatory effect on octamer activity (data not shown). Moreover, TAFII105 fails to stimulate the reporter plasmid-lacking octamer site in the presence or absence of OCA-B (columns 5–8), ruling out the possibility that TAFII105 affects core promoter function. To examine the role of TAFII105 in transcription of physiologically relevant genes, we used a luciferase reporter gene driven by promoters of two B cell-specific genes, immunoglobulin kappa light chain (Igκ) and J chain. The proximal promoter region of both genes contains an octamer site. As expected, the promoter activity of these genes in non-B cells is very low (Fig. 2, B andC). Cotransfection of either OCA-B or TAFII105 with these reporter plasmids, has minor effect on Igκ and J chain promoter activities (Fig. 2, B and C,columns 2 and 3). However, transfection of OCA-B and TAFII105 with the B cell-specific reporter genes resulted in strong stimulation of reporter gene activity, suggesting that OCA-B and TAFII105 collaborate to stimulate the activity of these promoters. The potentiation of OCA-B activity by TAFII105 in the context of the native promoters is greater then that observed with the artificial promoter (Fig. 2 A), raising the possibility that the organization of the native promoters is more suitable for activation by OCA-B and TAFII105. Taken together, these results suggest that TAFII105 coactivator function on the octamer element is mediated by OCA-B. To determine the mechanism involved in TAFII105 action on octamer transcription, we tested whether octamer factors can interact with TAFII105. For this purpose nuclear extract prepared from the B cell line BJAB was incubated with immobilized TAFII105 (N terminus, amino acids 1–552), and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies specific to Oct2 and OCA-B. As shown in Fig.3 A, both Oct2 and OCA-B were retained on TAFII105-containing beads but not on GST beads. The binding of Oct2 and OCA-B is specific because RelB, another B cell transcription factor, failed to associate with GST-TAFII105 on the same experiment. Because OCA-B is complexed in B cells with Oct1 and Oct2, we tested which of these proteins binds directly to TAFII105. Each of the proteins Oct1, Oct2, and OCA-B was in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocytes lysate and used for binding assay with Sepharose-bound N-terminal or C-terminal fragments of TAFII105. As shown in Fig. 3 B, among the proteins tested, only OCA-B specifically and efficiently interacts with the N-terminal domain of TAFII105. The binding of OCA-B to the TAFII105 N terminus is specific because it does not interact with protein fragments derived from the N terminus of hTAFII130 (Fig. 3 C), which is consistent with the low level of homology between TAFII105 and TAFII130 within this region. Considering the inhibition of octamer activity in B cells by a C-terminal truncated form of TAFII105 (Fig. 1 C) and the direct association of OCA-B with this domain, it is reasonable to assume that this mutant exerts its inhibitory effect by competing with native TAFII105 protein for OCA-B binding. To obtain further evidence that the effect of TAFII105 on octamer-dependent transcription is mediated by OCA-B, we have constructed a mutant of OCA-B lacking the last 26 amino acids (OCA-B 1–230) and analyzed it for TAFII105 binding capacity and transcription activity. As shown in Fig. 4 A, deletion of the last 26 residues significantly reduced TAFII105 binding. This mutant is incapable of stimulating octamer transcription in 293 cells (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with TAFII105 reduced binding capacity, co-expression of TAFII105 with the OCA-B 1–230 mutant fails to enhance its activity (Fig.4 B). These results suggest that the interaction between TAFII105 and OCA-B is important for activation of octamer-dependent transcription. Previous studies have indicated that OCA-B contains two transcription activation domains. One domain is mapped to position 65–122, and the second domain resides within the extreme C-terminal region (37.Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vlier P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38.Pfisterer P. Zwilling S. Hess J. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29870-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39.Luo Y. Ge H. Stevens S. Xiao H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3803-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine which of the activation domains is involved in TAFII105 coactivation function and to further confirm that OCA-B directly mediates TAFII105 effect, different OCA-B domains were fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig.5 A). These Gal4 fusion proteins were cotransfected with luciferase reporter gene driven by Gal4 sites upstream to a minimal core promoter. Gal4 DNA binding domain alone (Gal4-DBD) lacks transcription activity and is not induced by TAFII105 (Fig. 5 B, columns 3 and4). OCA-B mutants 1–230 and 1–122 but not 1–100, stimulate the reporter activity (columns 5, 7, and 9) suggesting that residues within the region of 100–122 of OCA-B are crucial for the N-terminal activation function. However, these C-terminal truncated proteins are not responsive to TAFII105 expression (columns 6, 8, and 10). An N-terminal truncation of OCA-B (amino acids 100–256) also contains a strong activation domain (column 11). The activity of this mutant is elevated by TAFII105 expression (column 12), confirming that coactivation by TAFII105 is mediated by the C-terminal activation domain. Interestingly, OCA-B mutant 1–230 is active in the context of fusion with Gal4 DBD, whereas it is inactive in the context of the native protein, raising the possibility that the N-terminal activation domain of OCA-B 1–230 is hidden and becomes exposed in the fusion form. Detailed analysis of B cell-specific transcription regulation by the octamer motif revealed the involvement of two octamer-binding factors, the ubiquitous Oct1 and the B cell-restricted Oct2. These factors are not sufficient to reconstitute a high level of octamer activity observed in B cells. This activity is fulfilled by OCA-B, a B cell-specific cofactor (also termed OBF-1 and Bob1) that is specifically brought to octamer sites by the Oct1 and Oct2 proteins (32.Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33.Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 34.Strubin M. Newell J.M. Mattias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In the present study we provide evidence that octamer-dependent activity in B cells is more complex and also involves the B cell-enriched TFIID subunit TAFII105 as transcription coactivator for octamer-binding complexes. Using in vitro transcription studies we show that octamer-mediated transcription, reconstituted with B cell nuclear extract, is TAFII105-dependent. Protein-protein interaction assays and reporter gene analysis revealed that OCA-B but not Oct1 or Oct2 directly binds TAFII105 and that this interaction is essential for stimulation of octamer activity. Furthermore, we show that cooperation between OCA-B and TAFII105 is more efficient on native B cell-specific promoters carrying the octamer motif. Consistent with a coactivator model, this interaction is mediated by the main OCA-B activation domain and the N-terminal coactivation domain of TAFII105. Given the high concentration of OCA-B and TAFII105-TFIID in the nucleus of B lymphocytes, these two proteins are likely to efficiently associate and stimulate the transcription of specific octamer-containing target genes in B cells. Because OCA-B stimulates transcription in B cells only through proximal octamer sites (38.Pfisterer P. Zwilling S. Hess J. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29870-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether TAFII105 is also involved in transcription activation of a distally located octamer motif that requires Oct2 and another unidentified B cell-restricted cofactor (40.Wirth T. Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Konig H. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unlike core TFIID-associated factors, TAFII105 is found in a relatively small portion of TFIID complexes, 5–10% in certain mature B cell lines and 0.5–1% in non-B cells (30.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian T. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAFII105-containing TFIID is likely to be involved in transcription regulation of small fraction of genes. Given that the amount of TFIID in the cell is limiting, activators capable of TAFII105 binding might have an advantage in competing for limiting TFIID and can more efficiently recruit TAFII105-TFIID to their gene target. This is particularly important for genes that should be rapidly induced and highly transcribed such as immunoglobulin genes following antigenic stimulation, or as we have previously shown, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced anti-apoptotic genes (19.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The last C-terminal 26 amino acid residues of OCA-B contain an activation domain crucial for OCA-B function. Deletion of this region abrogates the ability of OCA-B to stimulate octamer-dependent transcription. This result is similar to an earlier report in which mutation of acidic amino acid residues within this region significantly impaired OCA-B activity in vitro and in transfected HeLa cells (39.Luo Y. Ge H. Stevens S. Xiao H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3803-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that direct interaction between TAFII105 and OCA-B is involved in octamer transcription in vivo, TAFII105 failed to stimulate transcription activation by the OCA-B protein lacking the C-terminal domain (OCA-B 1–230) and to efficiently bind this mutant protein. Besides the C-terminal activation domain, another activation domain within OCA-B was identified and mapped to amino acid residues 65–122 (37.Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vlier P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38.Pfisterer P. Zwilling S. Hess J. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29870-29880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our studies revealed that the N-terminal activation domain is not targeted by TAFII105. On the basis of the failure of OCA-B 1–230 to stimulate transcription and the facts that larger C-terminal deletions of OCA-B (37.Gstaiger M. Georgiev O. van Leeuwen H. van der Vlier P. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as well as C-terminal truncated Gal4 fusion protein of OCA-B (1–230 and 1–122) are transcriptionally active, it is possible that the region within amino acids 192–230 contains an activation inhibitory function. Previous biochemical analysis of OCA-B activity revealed that the USA component PC4 is required for transcription activation by OCA-B in a partially purified transcription system (39.Luo Y. Ge H. Stevens S. Xiao H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3803-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, using a PC4-depleted HeLa nuclear extract, these authors also revealed the existence of an additional and redundant OCA-B coactivator activity. It should be noted that cooperation of TAFII105 and OCA-B for transcriptional activation in HeLa cells was not observed (data not shown). These findings together with the present study indicate that OCA-B can utilize alternative pathways for transcription activation in different cell types. It is also possible that in vivo, under some circumstances, different OCA-B coactivators might cooperate during different steps of the transcription activation process. Consistent with this notion is the finding that the coactivation function of PC4 is dependent on TAFs (41.Malik S. Guermah M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42.Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Certain in vitro transcription studies indicated that TAFs are absolutely required for transcription activation (9.Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10.Hoffmann A. Oelgeschlager T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, recent studies revealed a mechanism of transcription activation that is TAF-independent (43.Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 44.Oelgeschlager T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The existence of transcription activation pathways with redundant coactivator activities raises the interesting possibility that in vivo, gene-specific regulation is determined by the combinatorial action of different sets of coactivators, therefore providing an additional level of control."

Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Among the Cdks that regulate G1 progression, Cdk2 is activated by association with cyclin E (17.Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and also dephosphorylation of the Thr-14 and Tyr-15 inhibitory residues located near the ATP binding domain (15.Draetta G. Curr.

Cyclin binding is required for the kinase cyclin-associated kinase (CAK) to phosphorylate the activating Thr-160 in Cdk2 (18.Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 40-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19.Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar), and inhibitory subunits (cyclin kinase inhibitors) act in part to block cyclin-associated kinase (CAK)-dependent activation of Cdks (20.Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cyclin destruction is a regulated process, and recent results have shown that cyclin E is targeted for proteasome processing through ubiquitination-dependent mechanisms (21.Clurman B.E.

Compartmentalization is also an important component in directing the action of Cdk complexes. Hence, it was shown that the N terminus domain is essential for the differential intracellular localization of human cyclins A and B (26.Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and cyclin B was shown to be localized in the Golgi complex (27.Jackman M. Firth M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The process of receptor-tyrosine kinase endocytosis itself was shown to be dependent upon signal motifs contained within the cytosolic domains of the receptors (28.Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase tail of the receptors is thought to be required for a maximal rate of endocytosis (34.Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was implicated in both the early (35.Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and late events of endocytosis (36.Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A number of putative substrates whose functions are currently under investigation have been identified, suggesting that the action of internalized tyrosine kinases on endocytic transport is made up of several components. These proteins include annexin 1 (36.Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R.

Also, signaling proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases are now clearly implicated along the entire trafficking pathway; they are presumed to favor the recruitment of GTPases that function in vesicle budding and fusion (45.De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). During screening for endosomal tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, we identified a 34-kDa protein. We show here that an active and insulin-regulated pool of Cdk2-cyclin E complexes is located in hepatic plasma membrane (PM) and ENs. Murine receptor grade EGF was purchased from Collaborative Research (Waltham, MA). Insulin was from Sigma. 125I-EGF was prepared using the chloramine-T method (specific activity 100–200 μCi/μg). Rabbit polyclonal monospecific antibodies raised against Cdk1, Cdk2, cyclin E (H12), and cyclin A (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti- p27 kip1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (kindly provided by Dr. Claude Labrie, Laval University). Cdk2 complexes were isolated with agarose-conjugated Cdk2 (M2) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The compound bpV(phen) and the polyclonal antibodies raised against the 960 region of the β-subunit were provided by Dr. B. I. Posner (McGill University). The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (p-Tyr 02) was provided by Dr. M. Tremblay (Laval University). Wheat germ lectin (WGL) and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Histone H1, horseradish peroxidase (HRP; type VI-A), 3′,5′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and peroxide of hydrogen (H2O2) were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (1000–3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. The vector pGEX-2T and GSH-Sepharose beads were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The restriction and modification enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI,NdeI, and T4 DNA ligase) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Promega (Madison, WI). The entire intronless DNA sequence ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe p13 suc1 protein subcloned in the expression vector pRK172 (a gift of Dr. Doré through Dr. Sirard, Laval University) was cut with NdeI, filled in with Klenow polymerase, and excised with EcoRI. The resulting 300-base pair blunt-cohesive fragment was ligated in frame into a pGEX-2T expression vector in which the BamHI site had been digested, filled in, and then redigested with EcoRI.Escherichia coli BL21DE3 was transformed and plated, and transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance. Clones expressing the 36-kDa fusion protein GST-p13 suc1 were amplified, and the fusion protein was linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The T47D cell line (human breast carcinoma mutated for p53) was provided by Dr. Mirault (Laval University). Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Fisher or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nylon-supported nitrocellulose filters BA-S 85 were obtained from Mandel (St. Laurent, Québec, Canada). PolyScreen membranes and the Renaissance enhanced luminescence detection system were from NEN Life Science Products. Integrated optical density values were obtained by scanning the films using a Bio Image System with Visage software (Millipore Corp., Ann Harbor, MI). Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (female, 140–150 g, body weight) were purchased from Charles River Ltd. (St. Constant, Québec, Canada). They were fasted overnight and anesthetized with Somnotol. They were injected with insulin via the jugular vein at the noted doses. For the vesicular fusion assay, the rats were injected via the jugular vein with HRP (1 mg/100 g) or with125I-EGF (1 μg/100 g, body weight; 0.4 μCi/μg) 5 min prior to sacrifice. Work was done with the approval of the Laval University Animal Care Committee. Livers were rapidly excised and minced in ice-cold homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before homogenization. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C in the presence of the same buffer but with varying concentrations of sucrose. The combined fraction of endosomes and Golgi elements (G/E) was prepared as described previously (46.Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously characterized in terms of enzyme markers and receptor-mediated endocytosis, silver-stained gel electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. Both the stacked saccules of the Golgi apparatus and the endosomes with their characteristic content of lipoprotein-like particles were observed. The endosomal fractions representing the late (Li) and early (Gi) ENs were prepared from the parent light mitochondrial (L) and microsomal (P) fractions of liver homogenates, respectively (47.Khan M.N. Savoie S. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8462-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Faure R. Gaulin J.-F. Bourgoin S Fortier S. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 1: 132-139Google Scholar). The yield of the G/E fractions was 0.51 ± 0.06 mg protein/g, liver weight (n = 15) and similar to that described by Khan et al. (46.Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yield for the other endosomal fractions was as follows: Li, 0.97 ± 0.19 mg of protein/g, liver weight; Lh, 0.59 ± 0.10 mg of protein/g, liver weight; Gi, 0.21 ± 0.08 mg of protein/g, liver weight; Gh, 0.47 ± 0.13 mg of protein/g, liver weight, n = 6. The PM was prepared as described previously (46.Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used directly. A yield of 2.1 ± 0.9 mg of protein/g of liver (n = 9) was obtained. The cytosolic fraction was generated by centrifuging the homogenate at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (Cyt) was collected (5 ml/g of liver, 14 ± 1.2 mg of protein/ml, n = 21) and used immediately. For lectin purification of proteins, G/E endosomes were solubilized by agitation at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove undissolved materials, and the supernatant was applied to WGL-Sepharose (5-ml packed columns, five cycles at 4 °C). The columns were washed with 40 column volumes of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm vanadate, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 50 × g for 2 min. Glycoproteins were eluted by resuspension of each column in 0.3 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine for 60 min at 4 °C. The columns were spun to yield the eluates (112 ± 22 μg/ml,n = 12). Protein contents in the fractions were determined by a modification of the Bradford's method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cdk2 activity was assessed in vitro by histone H1 phosphorylation as described previously (49.Faure R. Vincent M. Dufour M. Shaver A. Posner B.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and modified as follows. Freshly isolated cytosol or solubilized membranes (0.5 mg of cell fraction protein) were immediately incubated in the presence of the Cdk2 antibody (1 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 120 min at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture for an additional 45 min. After brief centrifugation, the resulting immunoprecipitates were rinsed twice in cold kinase buffer (40 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitates were mixed in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm MgCl2, 25 mm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 10 μg of histone H1. The incubation proceeded for 20 min at 25 °C in a water bath and was stopped by applying a 50-μl aliquot onto a piece of Whatman P81 paper (2.5 cm2). The paper squares were washed three times with water and air-dried, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The phosphorylation of ENs in vitro and KOH treatment of the gels was done as previously reported (50.Contreres J.O. Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22007-22013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 51.Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was done with Statview (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). The fusion reaction and the density shift procedures were adapted from Woodman and Warren (52.Woodman P.G. Warren G. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and Courtoyet al. (53.Courtoy P.J. Quintart J. Baudhuin P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), respectively. ENs (G/E) containing HRP or125I-EGF were isolated, pelleted, and immediately resuspended (1 mg of protein/ml) in the sucrose-imidazole buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium azide, 3 mmimidazole, pH 7.0). The two populations of ENs (0.5 mg of protein cell fraction each) were combined with 0.5 ml (3.85 mg of protein) of diluted (1:1) Cdk2-depleted cytosol, and the volume was adjusted to 3.70 ml with sucrose-imidazole buffer. 200 μl of active Cdk2 isolated on GST/p13 suc1 affinity chromatography the same day from solubilized ENs (5 mg of protein cell fraction) was added. In the control reaction, 200 μl of elution buffer was added (25 mm GSH in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). The fusion reaction was started at 37 °C by adding 100 μl of a mixture containing ATP and GTP to a final concentration of 5 and 0.2 mm, respectively, along with a trinucleotide-regenerating system (54.Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The reaction continued for 15 min and was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm and 0.5 ml of 2.4 m sucrose-imidazole buffer. The DAB polymerization reaction was initiated at room temperature by adding 0.5 ml of DAB solution (55 mm DAB, 0.74 m sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) and 32 μl of 6% H2O2 in 0.25 m sucrose-imidazole buffer. The incubation continued for 30 min with gentle agitation. The HRP-containing ENs were then separated from the other elements by centrifugation over a density gradient for 3.25 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of each tube, and the refraction index was measured to determine density (refractometer from Fisher). Aliquots of each fractions were assessed for 125I content using a γ-counter (Wallac Wizard). Shifted endosomes containing 125I represented 18–26% (8000–26,000 cpm; n = 6) of the total pool of125I-containing ENs. Following the incubation of ENs in the presence of 1 mm ATP (50.Contreres J.O. Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22007-22013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), solubilization and WGL-Sepharose affinity chromatography, a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were observed. Among them we have identified with specific antibodies the EGFR (170 kDa) and its main substrate p55 Shc (55.Wada I. Lai W.H. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (data not shown) as well as the 43-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (48.Faure R. Gaulin J.-F. Bourgoin S Fortier S. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 1: 132-139Google Scholar). By partial proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry, a number of other proteins, mainly proteases or protease inhibitors, 2A. Fiset, G. Poirier, S. Fortier, and R. Faune, manuscript in preparation. were also identified (Fig. 1 A). Based on its apparent molecular weight and previous putative function in vesicular fusion (8.Tuomikoski T. Felix M.A. Doree M. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1989; 342: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the 34-kDa protein was a mitotic kinase. The incubations in the presence of GST-p13 suc1 beads resulted in 30% depletion of the 34-kDa bands (Fig.1 B). This can be explained in part by the presence of a fragment of a protein related to VASAP-60 (56.Brulé S. Rabahi F. Faure R. Beckers J.-F. Silversides D.W. Lussier J.G. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The incubations in the presence of [γ-P32]ATP confirmed the presence of a 32–34-kDa protein associated with GST-p13 suc1 beads. Three phosphorylated isoforms were observed, including a more slowly migrating alkali-resistant one, characteristic of Tyr-15 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). Since the appropriate temporal activation of cyclin-E Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 is required for the G1-to-S and S phase progressions, respectively (15.Draetta G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), we then examined the presence of the activators cyclin E and cyclin A by using monospecific antibodies. Cyclin E, but not cyclin A, was recovered in the endosomal glycoprotein fraction (Fig. 1 D). Since there was minimal contamination (less than 1%) by cytosolic proteins in our fractions, these results made credible the presence of a mitotic kinase and its activator cyclin E in endosomal and/or Golgi elements and also showed that cyclin E and a mitotic kinase, presumably Cdk2, have the capacity to associate directly or indirectly with glycoproteins. The presence of Cdk2 in the G/E, PM, and cytosolic fractions but not in a nuclear fraction (not shown) was confirmed by either direct immunoblotting or affinity precipitation using GST-p13 beads (Fig. 2). Approximately 75% of the total Cdk2 was located in the cytosol, 15% in the PM, and 5% in the G/E fractions (Fig. 2 B). The G/E fraction used in this study was shown to contain Golgi elements but to be essentially free of plasmalemma and other subcellular constituents (47.Khan M.N. Savoie S. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8462-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Faure R. Gaulin J.-F. Bourgoin S Fortier S. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 1: 132-139Google Scholar, 57.Bergeron J.J. Searle N. Khan M.N. Posner B.I. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1756-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This was affirmed here by the detection of the slower migrating Cdk2 isoform in the cytosolic fraction, which was barely detected in the G/E and PM fractions (Fig. 2 A). The faster migrating isoform detected in the PM and G/E fractions was characteristic of phosphorylation at the activating Thr-267 (18.Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 40-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We concluded then that a relatively small but consistent and presumably active pool of Cdk2 was associated with membranes. To refine the compartmentalization of Cdk2, we purified L ENs originating from the parent light mitochondrial fraction and G ENs originating from the parent P Golgi fraction (47.Khan M.N. Savoie S. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8462-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Cdk2 was enriched in Li ENs, a highly homogeneous fraction containing late ENs and a negligible amount of the marker enzymes sialyltransferase and galactosyltransferase. A 50% less intense signal was systematically detected in the Gi fraction representing early ENs contaminated (approximately 50%) by Golgi elements (Fig. 2 A). The other fractions (Lh, Gh) contain less characterized ENs but are rich (approximately 80%) in Golgi components and displayed a weak signal for Cdk2 (Fig. 2 A). We investigated whether fluid phase endocytosed HRP could gain access to Cdk2 to verify its endosomal localization. This experiment was based on the fact that intraluminal polymerization of the HRP substrate DAB induces loss of antigenicity partly due to the elimination of detergent-soluble proteins (58.Ajioka R.S. Kaplan J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Intravenous injection of HRP, isolation of G/E fractions, and subsequent polymerization of DAB in vitro was followed by a time-dependent loss of signal for Cdk2 in the detergent-soluble fraction. In contrast, the signal for Cdk2 was not affected in the PM fraction 15 min after the injection of HRP (Fig.3 A). To determine the nature of the association of Cdk2 with membranes, ENs (G/E) were treated with high salts and carbonate, pH 10 (51.Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicated that Cdk2 was firmly associated to ENs. The signal for Cdk2 was lost, however, following the treatment of permeabilized or nonpermeabilized ENs with a protease, favoring the idea that Cdk2 is cytosol-oriented (Fig.3 B).Figure 2Localization of Cdk2 in endosomes, plasma membrane, and cytosolic fractions of rat liver.

https://openalex.org/W1966131625,"DNA replication and repair require a specific mechanism to join the 3′- and 5′-ends of two strands to maintain DNA continuity. In order to understand the details of this process, we studied the activity of the 5′ nucleases with substrates containing an RNA template strand. By comparing the eubacterial and archaeal 5′ nucleases, we show that the polymerase domain of the eubacterial enzymes is critical for the activity of the 5′ nuclease domain on RNA containing substrates. Analysis of the activity of chimeric enzymes between the DNA polymerases from Thermus aquaticus(TaqPol) and Thermus thermophilus (TthPol) reveals two regions, in the “thumb” and in the “palm” subdomains, critical for RNA-dependent 5′ nuclease activity. There are two critical amino acids in those regions that are responsible for the high activity of TthPol on RNA containing substrates. Mutating glycine 418 and glutamic acid 507 of TaqPol to lysine and glutamine, respectively, increases its RNA-dependent 5′ nuclease activity 4–10-fold. Furthermore, the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity is controlled by a completely different region of TaqPol and TthPol, and mutations in this region do not affect the 5′ nuclease activity. The results presented here suggest a novel substrate binding mode of the eubacterial DNA polymerase enzymes, called a 5′ nuclease mode, that is distinct from the polymerizing and editing modes described previously.

The precise removal of the displaced arm by the 5′ nuclease creates a nicked structure repaired by DNA ligase (9Kaiser M.W. Lyamicheva N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L. Lyamichev V.I. J. Biol.

Previously, we studied the substrate specificity of seven eubacterial and archaeal structure-specific 5′ exonucleases with DNA substrates (9Kaiser M.W. Lyamicheva N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L. Lyamichev V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21387-21394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The enzymes showed very similar specificities, despite their limited level of sequence similarity and different structural organization; eubacterial 5′ nucleases are discrete domains of the DNA polymerases, whereas in archaea the 5′ nucleases are separate polypeptides. Comparison of the 5′ nuclease activities ofTaq DNA polymerase (TaqPol)1 and its isolated nuclease domain (TaqExo) showed that the 5′ nuclease domain can function independently, although the polymerase domain influences the 5′ nuclease activity by imposing additional stringency on substrate recognition and by increasing substrate binding (9Kaiser M.W.

A specific substrate for the 5′ nucleases that resembles DNA undergoing displacement synthesis can be created with synthetic oligonucleotides. This substrate, termed the “overlapping substrate,” is formed by annealing adjacent upstream and downstream oligonucleotides on a template strand, also called the target strand. The duplexes formed by the two oligonucleotides must overlap by at least one base pair for efficient cleavage by the 5′ nucleases (9Kaiser M.W. Lyamicheva N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L.

The upstream oligonucleotide in this substrate is completely annealed to the target except for the 3′ terminal nucleotide that may interact with the 5′ nuclease. The downstream oligonucleotide consists of the target specific region and the 5′ arm region that is not annealed to the target and cleaved by the 5′ nuclease to create the nicked substrate (9Kaiser M.W.

In this method, called the invasive signal amplification reaction, cleavage of the downstream oligonucleotide is dependent upon the presence of a particular target sequence in a sample. Each target molecule can generate more than 103 reporter molecules by rapid turnover of the downstream oligonucleotide at elevated temperatures (11Lyamichev V. Mast A.L. Hall J.G. Prudent J.R.

Neri B.P. Mol. Diagn. 1999; 4: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The invasive signal amplification reaction can also be used for quantitative RNA detection, although this would require an investigation of the ability of the structure-specific 5′ nucleases to cleave the overlapping substrate with an RNA target. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of substrate recognition by the structure-specific 5′ nucleases and to develop an enzyme for RNA detection using the invasive signal amplification assay, we compared the activity of eubacterial and archaeal 5′ nucleases using an overlapping substrate containing an RNA target. We find that only the eubacterial DNA polymerases TaqPol and TthPol possess RNA template-dependent 5′ nuclease activity, although it is significantly reduced compared with the 5′ nuclease activity with a DNA target. Of the two enzymes, TthPol has a higher RNA-dependent 5′ nuclease activity than TaqPol. We have used this observation to investigate the activity of chimeric enzymes constructed from TthPol and TaqPol, and we have identified two regions in the polymerase domain involved in substrate recognition of 5′ nuclease substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis studies reveal that lysine 420 and glutamine 509 of TthPol are the amino acids in these regions that are critical for the 5′ nuclease activity on RNA-containing substrates. Mutating the analogous amino acids of TaqPol (G418K and E507Q) to match TthPol at those positions increases the RNA-dependent 5′ nuclease activity of TaqPol 4–10-fold but has no effect on its DNA- or RNA-dependent polymerase activities. Based on these results, we propose a novel 5′ nuclease-specific mode of substrate binding by eubacterial DNA polymerases. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was done with the Advantage cDNA polymerase chain reaction kit (CLONTECH). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Chemicals and buffers were from Fisher unless otherwise noted. TthPol, TaqPol, TaqExo, and archaeal FEN1 enzymes from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, andPyrococcus furiosus were cloned, expressed, purified, and quantitated as described (9Kaiser M.W.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the TaqPol and TthPol genes was performed with the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Using site-directed mutagenesis, three new unique restriction sites, NotI, BstBI, andNdeI, were created in the TaqPol gene at positions approximately corresponding to amino acids 328, 382, and 443, respectively. The same restriction sites were also introduced at the homologous positions 330, 384, and 443 of the TthPol gene. TheNotI sites were created by using mutagenic primers 5′-GCCGCCAGGGGCGGCCGCGTCCACCGGGCC and 5′-GCCTGCAGGG GCGGCCGCGTGCACCGGGCA, which correspond to the sense strands of the TaqPol and TthPol genes, respectively. The BstI and NdeI sites were introduced into both genes using sense strand mutagenic primers 5′-CTCCTGGACCC TTCGAACACCACCCC and 5′-GTCCTGGCCCATATGGAGGCCAC. The mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface type, and the corresponding restriction sites are underlined. Chimeric constructs were created by substituting homologous fragments between the cloned TaqPol and TthPol genes using the common unique restriction sites EcoRI, NotI, BstBI, NdeI,BamHI, and SalI and standard cloning techniques.

Briefly, the cartridge was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and enzyme extract dialyzed against the same buffer was loaded on the column and then eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–2 m) in the same buffer. The HPLC-purified protein was dialyzed and stored as described above. Expression of the TthPol-TaqPol chimeric genes yielded proteins of the expected size. The enzymes were purified to homogeneity according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9Kaiser M.W. Lyamicheva N. Ma W. Miller C. Neri B. Fors L. Lyamichev V.I. J. Biol.

The downstream and upstream oligonucleotides and the IL-6 DNA target were synthesized on a PerSeptive Biosystems instrument using standard phosphoramidite chemistry (Glen Research). The synthetic RNA-DNA chimeric IrT target labeled with biotin at the 5′-end was synthesized utilizing 2′-ACE RNA chemistry (Dharmacon Research). The 2′-protecting groups were removed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis according to the manufacturer's procedure. The downstream probes labeled with 5′-fluorescein or 5′-tetrachlorofluorescein at their 5′ ends were purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

All oligonucleotides were finally purified by separation on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by excision and elution of the major band. Oligonucleotide concentration was determined by measuring absorption at 260 nm. The biotin-labeled IrT target was incubated with a 5-fold excess of streptavidin (Promega) in a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml tRNA at room temperature for 10 min. Unless otherwise indicated, RNA template-dependent probe cycling reactions were carried out in 10 μl of a reaction buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml tRNA, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgSO4. The substrates and 5′ nuclease enzymes were mixed with the reaction buffer lacking MgSO4 and overlaid with Chill-out liquid wax (MJ Research). The enzyme and substrate concentrations are specified in the figure legends of Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Reactions were brought up to reaction temperature, started by the addition of MgSO4, and incubated for the specified length of time. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 95% formamide containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.02% methyl violet (Sigma). Samples were heated to 90 °C for 1 min immediately before electrophoresis through a 20% denaturing acrylamide gel (19:1 cross-linked) containing 7 m urea in a buffer of 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1.4 mm EDTA. Gels were then scanned on an FMBIO-100 fluorescence gel scanner (Hitachi) using a 505-nm emission filter. The fraction of cleaved product was determined from intensities of bands corresponding to uncut and cut substrate with FMBIO Analysis software (version 6.0; Hitachi). The fraction of cleavage product did not exceed 20% to ensure that measurements approximated initial cleavage rates. The cycling cleavage rate was defined as the concentration of the cut downstream probe divided by the target concentration and the time of the reaction (in minutes).Figure 3Activities of TaqPol , TthPol , and TaqTth chimeric enzymes with IL-6 RNA target.

The cleavage kinetics for each enzyme and each substrate concentration were measured at 46 °C. The fraction of cleaved product was determined as described above and plotted as a function of reaction time. The initial cleavage rates were determined from the slopes in the linear range of the cleavage kinetics and were defined as the concentration of cut product divided by the enzyme concentration and the time of the reaction (in minutes). The Michaelis constantK m and the maximal catalytic ratek cat of each enzyme with the IrT substrate were determined from the plots of the initial cleavage rateversus the substrate concentration. Primer extension reactions were carried out in 10 μl of buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 mm KCl. In each reaction, 40 ng of enzyme were used to extend 10 μm(dT)25–30 primer in the presence of either 10 μm poly(A)286 or 1 μmpoly(dA)273 template, 45 μm dTTP, and 5 μm 5′-fluorescein-dUTP at 60 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 10 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.02% methyl violet dye). Samples (3 μl) were fractionated on a 15% denaturing acrylamide gel (19:1 cross-linked), and the fraction of incorporated 5′-fluorescein-dUTP was quantitated using an FMBIO-100 fluorescence gel scanner (Hitachi) equipped with a 505-nm emission filter as described above. The 5′ nuclease activity assay was designed similarly to the invasive signal amplification reaction described previously (11Lyamichev V. Mast A.L. Hall J.G. Prudent J.R. Kaiser M.W. Takova T.

The IL-6 substrate used in these experiments consists of the downstream and upstream oligonucleotides annealed with either RNA or DNA target (the terms “target” and “template” will be used interchangeably) as shown in Fig.1 A. The fluorescently labeled downstream oligonucleotide, also called the probe, is specifically cleaved by the 5′ nuclease at the site where the upstream oligonucleotide overlaps or “invades” the probe (9Kaiser M.W.

Brow M.A. Varvel V.E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6143-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The invasive signal amplification reaction is carried out under conditions of limiting target and excess probe. At the optimal reaction temperature, which occurs at the melting temperature of the probe, a single target molecule gives rise to multiple cleaved probes due to a rapid probe exchange.2 The cleavage rate of this reaction is determined as the number of the probe molecules cleaved per target molecule per minute. In agreement with the previous results,2 all enzymes showed high cleavage activity with the IL-6 DNA target (Fig. 1 B). When the DNA target was replaced with the IL-6 RNA target, only TthPol and TaqPol were able to cleave the probe, although at a reduced rate compared with the DNA target (Fig. 1 C). The cleavage rates of TaqPol and TthPol with the RNA target are only 0.2 and 0.8 min−1, respectively, which is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than the cleavage rates on the DNA substrate with the same sequence (the rates were determined from the data shown in Fig. 1, B and C, as described under “Experimental Procedures”). All other enzymes, including the TaqExo nuclease domain and the archaeal 5′ nucleases, showed no RNA-dependent 5′ nuclease activity. The common feature of these 5′ nucleases is the absence of a polymerase domain. Thus, it would be logical to assume that the polymerase domain is involved in the ability of the eubacterial enzymes to cleave the substrate with an RNA target. DNA polymerase enzymes from Thermus species, like all DNA polymerase I homologues, consist of two distinctive domains, the 5′ nuclease and the polymerase domains, shown schematically in Fig.2. The polymerase domain comprises the C-terminal two-thirds of the proteins, and it is responsible for both DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, whereas the N-terminal one-third contains the 5′ nuclease domain. According to a commonly accepted nomenclature (17Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), the polymerase domain has been described as having a physical form resembling a right hand. The palm region consists of, roughly, amino acids 300–500 of a genus Thermus DNA polymerase I, the thumb region includes amino acids 500–650, and the fingers region is formed by the remaining amino acids from 650 to 830 (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequences of TaqPol and TthPol share about 87% identity and greater than 92% similarity. We took advantage of this high degree of sequence similarity between the enzymes to construct a series of chimeric enzymes between TthPol and TaqPol. The chimeric constructs shown in Fig. 2 were created by swapping DNA fragments defined by the restriction endonuclease sites, EcoRI and BamHI, common for both genes, the SalI site in the cloning vector, and the new sites, NotI, BstBI, andNdeI, created at the homologous positions of both genes by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.2). Since TthPol has a 4-fold higher cleavage rate with the IL-6 RNA template than TaqPol (Fig. 1 C), the activities of the chimeric enzymes were rated relative to TthPol and used as a parameter to identify the region(s) affecting RNA template-dependent 5′ nuclease activity. The activity of each chimeric enzyme was evaluated using the invasive signal amplification assay with the IL-6 RNA target (Fig.1 A); the cleavage rates shown in Fig.3 were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Comparison of the cleavage rates of the first two chimeras, TaqTth(N) and TthTaq(N), created by swapping the polymerase and 5′ nuclease domains at the NotI site (Fig.2), shows that TaqTth(N) has the same activity as TthPol, whereas its counterpart TthTaq(N) retains the activity of TaqPol (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the higher cleavage rate of TthPol is associated with its polymerase domain, which is consistent with an important role for the polymerase domain in the 5′ nuclease activity (9Kaiser M.W.

The next step was to identify the minimal region of TthPol polymerase domain that would give rise to the TthPol-like 5′ nuclease activity when substituted for the corresponding region of the TaqPol sequence. To this end, we selected the TaqTth(N) chimera to generate a series of new constructs by replacin"
https://openalex.org/W2062068633,"The human α-globin gene complex includes three functional globin genes (5′-ζ2-α2-α1–3′) regulated by a common positive regulatory element named HS-40 displaying strong erythroid-specific enhancer activity. How this enhancer activity can be shared between different promoters present at different positions in the same complex is poorly understood. To address this question, we used homologous recombination to target the insertion of marker genes driven by cytomegalovirus or long terminal repeat promoters in both possible orientations either upstream or downstream from the HS-40 region into the single human α-globin gene locus present in hybrid mouse erythroleukemia cells. We also used CRE recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to target the insertion of a tagged α-globin gene at the same position downstream from HS-40. All these insertions led to a similar decrease in the HS-40-dependent transcription of downstream human α-globin genes in differentiated cells. Interestingly, this decrease is associated with the strong activation of the proximal newly inserted α-globin gene, whereas in marked contrast, the transcription of the non-erythroid marker genes remains insensitive to HS-40. Taken together, these results indicate that the enhancer activity of HS-40 can be trapped by non-erythroid promoters in both upstream and downstream directions without necessarily leading to their own activation.

This complex includes three functional genes, the embryonic ζ2 gene and the two fetal/adult α2 and α1 genes, which are arranged in the order 5′-ζ2-α2-α1–3′ of their expression during development (1Higgs D.R. Higgs D.R. Weatherall D.J. Bailliere's Clinical Haematology. 6. Bailliere Tindall Ltd., London1993: 117-150Google Scholar). Although the α-globin genes are transcribed exclusively in erythroid cells, the whole complex is located in a GC-rich isochore, within an early replicating and constitutively DNase I-sensitive chromatin domain in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells (2Craddock C.F.

The human α-globin gene complex is also surrounded by several widely expressed genes, including the −14 gene of unknown function, which is located in the opposite transcriptional orientation, 14 kb1 upstream from the ζ2 gene (5Vickers M.A. Vyas P. Harris P.C. Simmons D.L. Higgs D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3437-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Vyas P. Vickers M.A. Picketts D.J. Higgs D.R. Genomics. 1995; 29: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the erythroid-specific transcriptional activation of all α-globin genes present in the locus is controlled by a single positive regulatory element, named HS-40, which corresponds to a DNase I-hypersensitive site located 40 kb upstream from the ζ2 gene (7Higgs D.R.

Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HS-40 is characterized by a high density of DNA-binding sites for ubiquitous and erythroid-specific transcription factors (8Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J.A. Gourdon G. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell.

Despite this strong enhancer activity, the expression level of globin genes linked to the HS-40 element in transgenic mice remains sensitive to position effects, is not copy number-dependent, and tends to decrease in adults. Natural or targeted deletions of HS-40 lead to a complete loss of globin gene transcriptional activation in erythroid cells, but do not affect the DNase I sensitivity or the replication timing of the whole complex (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hatton C.S. Wilkie A.O. Drysdale H.C. Wood W.G. Vickers M.A. Sharpe J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression level of the −14 gene is independent of HS-40 despite the location of HS-40 in its fifth intron (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HS-40 regulatory element thus appears to be involved in the erythroid-specific and selective transcriptional activation of all globin genes belonging to the complex, but the mechanisms responsible for this selective activation are still poorly understood. One way to approach an understanding of these mechanisms is to investigate how this HS-40-mediated transcriptional activation of human α-globin genes can be affected by the insertion of new genes into the complex. In this study, we addressed these questions by using homologous recombination and CRE recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to target the insertion of either an extra α-globin gene or a marker gene driven by the non-erythroid promoter immediately upstream or downstream from HS-40 into the single chromosome 16 present in hybrid mouse erythroleukemia cells. We found that all of these insertions led to a similar drastic reduction of the HS-40-dependent transcription of resident α-globin genes, regardless of the position, the orientation, or the identity of the newly inserted gene. Although this down-regulation is associated with the strong activation of the newly inserted α-globin gene, this is not the case for newly inserted non-erythroid marker genes, the transcription of which appears to be independent of HS-40. Taken together, these results suggest that the enhancer activity of HS-40 spreads in both upstream and downstream directions and can be trapped by non-erythroid promoters without necessarily leading to their own activation. All experiments were performed in the mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) hybrid cell line LT585P3, which contains a single copy of normal human chromosome 16 (18, 22). Cells were cultured as already described (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erythroid terminal differentiation of the cells was induced by the addition of 5 mm hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA; Sigma) to the culture medium for 4 days. All four plasmids used to target the insertion of the LTR-neo gene are derived from a single starting plasmid, pHS-40. This pHS-40 plasmid is based on pUC18 in which 9.2 kb of isogenic genomic DNA overlapping the HS-40 regulatory region has been cloned. This isogenic DNA was cloned as two cassettes: a 4.1-kb HindIII genomic fragment including HS-40 was directly cloned in pUC18, and the downstream adjacent 5.1-kbHindIII genomic fragment was cloned as aSalI-XhoI fragment to leave a uniqueSalI site for inserting the LTR-neo gene between the two isogenic cassettes. In addition, pHS-40 contains a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase XhoI-HindIII gene cassette, derived from a pIC19R/MCI-tk plasmid (23Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1988; 44: 319-328Google Scholar), which was cloned immediately downstream from the 3′-homology arm. The LTR-neogene derives from the pGEM-I-FLP-neo plasmid (24Fiering S. Kim S.G. Epner E.E. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8469-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is driven by the enhancer/promoter of the Friend retrovirus long terminal repeat and is flanked on both sides by FLP recombinase targets (24Fiering S. Kim S.G. Epner E.E. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8469-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pHS-neoS targeting plasmid was thus obtained by subcloning the LTR-neo gene (taken as aSalI-XhoI fragment) into the singleSalI site of pHS-40 and in the same transcriptional orientation as that of resident α-globin genes. The pHS-neoAS targeting plasmid was obtained similarly by subcloning the LTR-neo gene cassette in reverse orientation. The other two plasmids used to target the insertion of the LTR-neo gene upstream from HS-40 were obtained from the same pHS-40 starting plasmid in which a 1.1-kb HpaI fragment including the HS-40 site was first removed and replaced by the LTR-neo gene (taken as a HincII fragment) in either orientation. The HpaI fragment containing HS-40 was then reinserted in the correct orientation into the singleSalI site remaining downstream from the LTR-neogene. The pneoS-HS targeting plasmid thus contains the LTR-neo gene in the same transcriptional orientation as that of the resident α-globin genes, whereas the pneoAS-HS targeting plasmid contains the LTR-neo gene in reverse orientation. The CMV-hygroTKgene, which is a hygroTK gene fusion driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was first isolated as a XhoI fragment from a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. P. Greenberg (Fred Hutchinson Research Center) and cloned using BamHI linkers between two inverted Lox sequences L1 and 1L (25Bouhassira E.E. Westerman K. Leboulch P. Blood. 1997; 90: 3332-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Feng Y.Q. Seibler J. Alami R. Eisen A. Westerman K. Leboulch P. Fiering S.N. Bouhassira E.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The resulting L1-CMV-hygroTK-1L cassette isolated as aXhoI-PvuII fragment was then subcloned into the single SalI site of plasmid pHS-40 in the same transcriptional orientation as that of resident α-globin genes, thus leading to the targeting plasmid pCMV-hygroTK. All targeting plasmids were linearized at the unique ScaI site present in the pUC18 sequence before transfection. The human αT-globin gene was previously cloned from the genomic DNA of an α+-thalassemic patient homozygous for the rightward 3.7-kb deletion that generates an α2/α1 fusion gene (27Morlé F. Lopez B. Henni T. Godet J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1245-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This αT-globin gene carries a two-nucleotide deletion at positions −2 and −3 preceding the ATG initiation codon, which is responsible for reduced translation efficiency, but which does not affect the transcription of the gene (28Morlé F. Starck J. Godet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3279-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The αT-globin gene cassette was taken as a 1.5-kb PstI fragment and cloned using BamHI linkers between two inverted Lox sequences L1 and 1L, thus generating the pαT gene exchange plasmid. Hybrid MEL cells (107) were transfected by electroporation using 20 μg of each linearized targeting plasmid as described previously (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, surviving cells were plated in selective medium containing 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10 μm ganciclovir (Syntex Research Co.) for cells transfected with the pLTR-neo targeting plasmids or containing 1 mg/ml hygromycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for cells transfected with the pCMV-hygroTK targeting plasmid. After 15 days, individual resistant clones were analyzed by Southern blotting using an HS-40 probe to identify homologous recombinant clones. A yeast FLP recombinase expression vector (pHook-3-FLP) was obtained by subcloning a XbaI fragment containing the FLP coding sequence driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and derived from vector pCFIZ (24Fiering S. Kim S.G. Epner E.E. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8469-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in the polylinker of the pHook-3 plasmid (Invitrogen), which itself contains a gene encoding Zeocin resistance. Cells (107) from clones harboring insertion of the LTR-neo gene were transfected by electroporation using 30 μg of pHook-3-FLP DNA. After 24 h, cells were placed in selective medium (300 μg/ml Zeocin; CAYLA). Among the Zeocin-resistant clones, G418-sensitive clones were analyzed by Southern blotting to verify excision of the LTR-neogene. Recombinase-mediated inversion of the CMV-hygroTKgene was obtained through the transient expression of CRE recombinase. For this purpose, 106 cells of a clone harboring targeted insertion of the L1-CMV-hygroTK-1L cassette were cotransfected using DAC-30 (Eurogentec), 1 μg of expression plasmid DNA encoding the CRE recombinase (pCMV-CRE), and 1 μg of expression plasmid DNA encoding green fluorescent protein (pSV40-GFP). Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells expressing green fluorescent protein were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and recloned in the presence of hygromycin. Isolated clones were then amplified and analyzed by Southern blotting. Recombinase-mediated exchange of the hygroTK gene by the αT-globin gene was obtained similarly by cotransfecting 106 cells of a clone harboring targeted insertion of the CMV-hygroTK gene using 1 μg of pCMV-CRE, 1 μg of pSV40-GFP, and 2 μg of pαT plasmid carrying the tagged human α-globin gene flanked by two inverted Lox sequences. Purified green fluorescent protein-positive cells were then cloned in medium containing 10 μm ganciclovir. Individual ganciclovir-resistant clones were amplified and analyzed by Southern blotting to verify the insertion of the αT-globin gene. Total cellular RNA was prepared using RNA-plusTM(Quantum Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 8 μg of total RNA and the following labeled antisense RNA probes: (i) a human riboprobe (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is expected to produce a single protected fragment of 133 nucleotides with normal α-globin mRNA and two protected fragments of 97 and 34 nucleotides with αT-globin mRNA carrying a deletion of two nucleotides at positions −2 and −3 preceding the AUG initiation codon; (ii) a mouse α-globin riboprobe that includes 180 nucleotides complementary to the 3′-end of the first exon of the mouse α-globin gene and that gives a protected fragment of 75 nucleotides with mouse α-globin mRNA; (iii) a neo riboprobe (pT3TKN) that is expected to produce a protected fragment of 260 nucleotides with transcripts of the LTR-neo gene (24Fiering S. Kim S.G. Epner E.E. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8469-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); (iv) a hygromycin riboprobe (pT7HY) that contains theBamHI-EcoRI fragment including the hygromycin coding sequence from the L1-CMV-hygroTK-1L gene and that is expected to produce a protected fragment of 258 nucleotides with transcripts of the CMV-hygroTK gene. Radioactive signals corresponding to each specific protected fragment were quantified using a GS-525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Cells (108) from a 2-day culture in the presence of 5 mm HMBA were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 5 min on ice in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion made in buffer A, resuspended in glycerol buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 75 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen in 100-μl aliquots containing 5 × 107 nuclei. Nuclei were thawed on ice by adding an equal volume of transcription buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 300 mm KCl) supplemented with 5 mm each ATP, GTP and CTP; 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 100 units/ml RNasin (Promega). Transcription reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by centrifugation for 30 s. Labeled nuclei were resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5m NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 containing 40 units of RNase-free DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Deproteinization was performed for 30 min at 37 °C after the addition of proteinase K (500 μg/ml) and SDS (0.5%). Labeled RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 2 m ammonium acetate, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in DNase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 10 units of RNase-free DNase. RNA was purified again by phenol/chloroform extraction and two rounds of ethanol precipitation, resuspended in water, and hybridized to membranes (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) loaded with unlabeled DNA probes. Membranes were loaded using a slot-blot apparatus with a 5 μg of DNA/slot concentrations of the following denatured DNA probes: the pMC1neo plasmid (23Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1988; 44: 319-328Google Scholar), mouse β-major globin 5-kbEcoRI fragment, and pGEMT plasmid. Membranes were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 20 μg/ml yeast tRNA and hybridized overnight with labeled RNA under the same conditions. Membranes were washed for 15 min in 1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and for 5 min in 0.1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Hybridization signals were revealed by autoradiography and quantified using the Molecular Imager and Molecular Analyst software. Four different DNA constructs were designed to target the insertion of an LTR-neo gene on either side of HS-40 and in both possible orientations by homologous recombination (Fig.1 A). Each of these DNA constructs was introduced by electroporation into hybrid MEL cells carrying a single copy of human chromosome 16. G418- and ganciclovir-resistant clones obtained were analyzed individually by Southern blotting using a human HS-40 hybridization probe. As schematically presented in Fig. 1 A, the targeted integration of the LTR-neo gene was expected to lead to the conversion of the normal 20-kb BamHI fragment to shorterBamHI fragments of 11.3, 12.3, 9, or 14.7 kb depending on the transfected targeting DNA construct. Five correctly targeted clones were identified among 301 clones obtained after transfection with the pHS-neoS construct (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–7), and one correctly targeted clone was identified among 300, 150, or 225 clones obtained after transfection with the pneoS-HS (lane 8), pHS-neoAS (lane 9), or pneoAS-HS (lane 10) construct. Further Southern blot analyses using other restriction endonucleases and either an HS-40 or a human α-globin probe confirmed that all eight clones displayed the expected targeted insertions (data not shown). The eight targeted clones described above as well as parental cells and the previously described clone containing a targeted replacement of HS-40 by the same LTR-neo gene (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown for 4 days in the presence or absence of HMBA, a chemical inducer of differentiation. Equal amounts of total cellular RNA prepared from induced and uninduced cells were then analyzed by RNase protection assay using a mixture of probes allowing the specific detection of human and mouse α-globin and neo gene transcripts. Typical results obtained from three different experiments are shown in Fig. 2 A. These data indicate that the eight clones harboring a targeted insertion of the LTR-neo gene in the vicinity of HS-40 displayed a marked reduction of the HMBA-induced increase in the expression of human α-globin genes (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 13–20 with lane 12). Quantitative analysis revealed that the levels of human α-globin mRNA in uninduced cells did not significantly differ between parental cells and cells harboring insertions of the LTR-neogene either adjacent to or in place of HS-40 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the levels of human α-globin mRNA in induced cells were markedly reduced in all cells harboring insertions of the LTR-neo gene compared with parental cells (Fig.2 C). Interestingly, the levels of human α-globin mRNA in the eight clones harboring insertions of the LTR-neo gene in the vicinity of HS-40 still remained 5–25-fold above the background level observed in clone ΔHS-neo (Fig. 2 C, compare bars 2–9 with bar 10), in which the LTR-neo gene has been inserted in place of HS-40 (18Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These levels correspond to a 3–8-fold reduction of the human α-globin mRNA level observed in induced parental cells compared with a >60-fold reduction in clone ΔHS-neo. Since only one example of clones neoS-HS, HS-neoAS, and neoAS-HS could be analyzed, the possibility remained that the reduction of the levels of human α-globin mRNA in these clones was due to clonal variation rather than the direct effect of the inserted LTR-neo gene. To exclude this possibility, we verified that excision of the LTR-neo gene in these three clones was indeed able to rescue a level of human α-globin mRNA in induced cells similar to that in parental cells. For this purpose, each clone was transfected with an expression vector encoding FLP recombinase (24Fiering S. Kim S.G. Epner E.E. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8469-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); and in each case, one G418-sensitive clone, potentially lacking the LTR-neo gene, was then selected for further analyses. Southern blot analysis using an HS-40 probe revealed the presence of a 20-kb BamHI fragment identical to the fragment present in parental cells (Fig.3 A), thus demonstrating the excision of the LTR-neo gene. As expected, RNase protection analysis using human and mouse α-globin probes performed in induced cells revealed that all three clones that lost the LTR-neo gene recovered a level of human α-globin mRNA similar to that observed in parental cells (Fig. 3,B and C). Taken together, these data establish that insertions of an LTR-neo gene near the HS-40 regulatory region of the human α-globin gene complex markedly reduce, but do not abolish, the HS-40-mediated transcriptional activation of the downstream human α-globin genes in hybrid MEL cells. This negative effect on the transcription of downstream α-globin genes appears to occur whether the LTR-neo gene is upstream or downstream from HS-40 and regardless of the chromosomal orientation of the inserted LTR-neo gene. One possible explanation for the above observations could be that HS-40 preferentially activates the LTR-neo gene inserted into the human α-globin locus at the expense of downstream human α-globin genes. According to this hypothesis, transcriptional activity of the LTR-neo gene should be higher in induced cells harboring the inserted LTR-neo gene in the vicinity of HS-40 than in induced cells harboring the same LTR-neo gene in place of HS-40. Unexpectedly, both types of induced cells displayed similar levels of neo gene transcripts (Fig. 2 E, comparebars 2–9 with bar 10). However, these levels of neo gene transcripts might not reflect the real transcriptional activities of the genes due to the eventual saturation of the degradation process, which is known to affect selectively non-erythroid gene transcripts during the terminal differentiation of MEL cells (29Krowzynski A. Yenofsky R. Brawerman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 18: 231-239Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to use a nuclear run-on assay to compare more directly the transcriptional activities of the LTR-neo gene in induced cells from clone Δneo-HS as well as from one example of clones harboring the LTR-neo gene in the four different positions and orientations with respect to HS-40. Induced parental cells were used as a negative control. Briefly, nuclei were prepared from each type of cell and incubated in vitro in the presence of labeled UTP, and labeled nuclear transcripts were hybridized to membranes loaded with neo, mouse β-globin, and empty vector DNA probes (Fig. 4 A). Hybridization signals were quantified, and the neo gene signals were standardized to the β-globin gene signals to allow the direct comparison of the transcriptional activities of the LTR-neogene between the different types of cells (Fig. 4 B). As estimated by this assay, the maximum difference in the transcriptional activities of the LTR-neo gene between the five analyzed clones was 3-fold. The transcriptional activities of the LTR-neo gene in the four clones harboring insertions near HS-40 were alternatively higher, as in clones HS-neoS andneoAS-HS (Fig. 4 B, bars 2 and4), or lower, as in clones neoS-HS and HS-neoAS (Fig. 4 B, bars 3 and 5), than that in the clone harboring the insertion in place of HS-40 (bar 6). Furthermore, the variations in the transcriptional activities of the neogene estimated in the different clones harboring the insertions near HS-40 did not correlate with the variations in the reduction of human α-globin gene expression. Taken together, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of the LTR-neo gene inserted into the human α-globin gene is not affected by induction of differentiation and therefore does not apparently benefit from HS-40-mediated activation. This unexpected result led us to investigate the effect of the insertion of a new α-globin gene, instead of the LTR-neo gene, at the same downstream position near HS-40. In a previous study, we identified a two-nucleotide deletion at positions −2 and −3 preceding the ATG initiation codon in one human α+-thalasse"

Histone mRNA 3′-end formation is an essential regulatory step producing an mRNA with a hairpin structure at the 3′-end. This requires the interaction of the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) with a purine-rich spacer element and of the hairpin-binding protein with the hairpin element, respectively, in the 3′-untranslated region of histone RNA. Here, we demonstrate that bona fide histone RNA 3′ processing takes place in Xenopus egg extracts in a reaction dependent on the addition of synthetic U7 RNA that is assembled into a ribonucleoprotein particle by protein components available in the extract. In addition to reconstituted U7 snRNP, Xenopushairpin-binding protein SLBP1 is necessary for efficient processing. Histone RNA 3′ processing is not affected by addition of non-destructible cyclin B, which drives the egg extract into M phase, but SLBP1 is phosphorylated in this extract. SPH-1, theXenopus homologue of human p80-coilin found in coiled bodies, is associated with U7 snRNPs. However, this does not depend on the U7 RNA being able to process histone RNA and also occurs with U1 snRNPs; therefore, association of SPH1 cannot be considered as a hallmark of a functional U7 snRNP.

Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In processing reactions in vitro, HBP bound to the hairpin RNA facilitates the formation of the 3′ processing complex composed of histone RNA, U7 snRNP, HBP, and presumably still other factors (12Wang Z.F.

Interestingly,Xenopus oocytes contain two hairpin-binding proteins: SLBP1 involved in histone RNA 3′ processing and SLBP2, which is thought to be involved in the translational silencing of histone mRNA in oocytes (28Wang Z.F. Ingledue T.C. Dominski Z. Sanchez R. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In isolated Xenopus oocytes, histone RNA substrates are processed either by endogenous U7 snRNPs or, when these are inactivated using antisense oligonucleotides, in a reaction requiring synthetic U7 RNA injected into the nucleus or cytoplasm (15Strub K. Birnstiel M.L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Birchmeier C. Grosschedel R. Birnstiel M.L.

A. 1984; 81: 1057-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This complementation is dependent on the Sm site sequence required for association of Sm protein with U small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Interestingly, U7 Sm OPT RNA with a U2 Sm site, as well as U7 Sm MUT RNA with a destroyed Sm site (Fig. 1 A), are not able to process histone RNA (20Stefanovic B. Hackl W. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking studies have demonstrated different associations of proteins with U7 and U7 Sm OPT RNA, indicating that (i) Sm protein assembly is required, but not sufficient for processing, and that (ii) the U7 Sm site is necessary for assembly of U7-specific proteins (20Stefanovic B. Hackl W. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, Sm proteins and U7 RNA are concentrated in C-type snurposomes or coiled bodies (32Wu C.H. Gall J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6257-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Xenopus SLBP1 is also localized in coiled bodies (33Abbott J. Marzluff W.F. Gall J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a common compartmentalization of histone RNA 3′ processing factors. Thus,Xenopus oocytes contain all of the components of the histone RNA-processing machinery. Materials required for organelle biogenesis and cell cycle progression are stockpiled in Xenopus eggs for use during early development. In addition, the egg is arrested in metaphase and thus many components are stored in a mitotic, disassembled form. Extracts derived from eggs can be made to spontaneously enter interphase, and such extracts are capable of reconstituting nuclei that are structurally and functionally similar to somatic cell nuclei. Such reconstituted nuclei contain coiled body-like structures (34Bauer D.W. Murphy C. Wu Z. Wu C.H. Gall J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and undergo semiconservative DNA replication (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). Alternatively, extracts can be made that are arrested in mitosis, either as a consequence of the stabilization of endogenous cyclin B/cdc2 kinase, or by the re-introduction into interphase extracts of indestructible recombinant cyclin B (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). Thus, extracts derived from Xenopus eggs provide a unique opportunity for in vitro analysis of the biochemistry and cell biology of nuclear assembly and function, and also of cell cycle progression (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). This encouraged us to test whether such extracts can be used as a source of factors for histone RNA 3′ processing. Here we demonstrate for the first time de novo assembly of U7 snRNP from synthetic RNA and proteins derived fromXenopus egg extract. We show that histone pre-mRNA processing can be reconstituted in this cell free system and that assembly and operation of processing complexes does not require the prior assembly of an interphase nucleus. As expected, we find endogenous U7 RNA in extracts, but surprisingly, we show that histone RNA processing in this system is dependent on de novo U7 snRNP assembly from exogenously added U7 RNA. We show that both the histone hairpin and SLBP1 have important functions in processing. SLBP1 is a mitotic phosphoprotein, phosphorylated in vitro by the mitotic kinase cyclin B/cdc2; however SLBP processing function is not dependent on phosphorylation status. Finally we show that SPH-1, theXenopus homologue of human p80-coilin, associates with snRNAs with a functional Sm site but is not a hallmark of a functional U7 snRNP. RNAs were prepared in vitro by Sp6 or T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription from linearized plasmids or partially single-stranded oligonucleotides and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis.

The short histone hairpin RNA wtHPs RNA (5′-GGACAAAAGGCCCUUUUCAGGGCCACC) was transcribed from oligonucleotides (note that these RNA molecules are lacking six nucleotides at the 5′-end present in wtHP RNA used previously (13Martin F.

For the synthesis of uniformly labeled RNA [α-32P]UTP and for the synthesis of capped RNA m7GpppG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was included in the transcription reaction.

RNA was stored in H2O. Recombinant cyclin B was as described (38Smythe C. Newport J.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 787-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TheXenopus SLBP1 cDNA was described (12Wang Z.F. Whitfield M.L. Ingledue III, T.C. Dominski Z. Marzluff W.F.

Marzluff. Recombinant His-tagged human HBP (hHBP) and SLBP1 were produced in SF21 cells using a modified version of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies) for protein expression and purified by Ni-affinity column chromatography using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (39Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cyclin B/cdc2 kinase complex was prepared as described (40Pfaller R. Smythe C. Newport J.W.

Gall and concentrated ∼5-fold by ultrafiltration. Sheep anti-SLBP1 antiserum was raised against peptides RPAPSRWSQGRK and KAVPRHLREPNVHPR of the Xenopus SLBP1. Serum was concentrated by ultrafiltration to a concentration corresponding to 130 mg/ml IgG and was added to binding reactions at a final concentration of 37 mg/ml. The antiserum, but not the preimmune serum, recognizes complexes formed by in vitro translated SLBP1 and32P-labeled wtHP RNA (not shown). For Western blot analysis, antibodies were affinity-purified by binding to recombinant SLBP1 transferred onto nitrocellulose and subsequent elution at low pH. Unless indicated otherwise, 30–60 fmol of32P-labeled RNA was incubated with extract or protein (usually 50–60% of reaction volume) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega) in 8–20 μl for 20–30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the reaction products were analyzed directly by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described (24Schaller A. Martin F. Müller B. J. Biol.

Unless indicated otherwise, 30 fmol of32P-labeled or 200 fmol of non-labeled m7GpppG-capped U7 RNA or a corresponding volume of H2O were mixed with 6 μl of the indicated extract and incubated for 30–40 min at room temperature. The mixture was then adjusted with 20 mm EDTA, 0.3 mg/ml tRNA, and 1 unit/μl RNasin (in 10 μl) and incubated for further 10 min at room temperature. Then, unless indicated otherwise, 40 fmol of m7GpppG-capped 32P-labeled wild-type histone 12/12 pre-mRNA fragments (25Streit A. Wittop Koning T. Soldati D. Melin L. Schümperli D.

The reactions were stopped by addition of 1 volume of 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K, 10 mm EDTA and incubated for at least 20 min at room temperature. The samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The reaction products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography or by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Processing reactions with K21 nuclear extract and histone RNA fragments were performed as described (44Stauber C. Soldati D. Lüscher B. Schümperli D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 74-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above. Xenopus eggs were lysed by low speed centrifugation and then fractionated by high speed centrifugation into a cytosolic S200 fraction and a membrane fraction as described (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). For histone RNA 3′ processing and detection of U7 snRNP and Xenopus HBP, substrate RNAs were added to nuclear reconstitution extract (NRE). Briefly, NRE was composed of 1 volume of S200 fraction, 1/10 volume membrane fraction, an ATP-regenerating system (20 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mg/ml phosphocreatine kinase), and up to 1500 Xenopus sperm chromatin per microliter (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). Where indicated, NRE was supplemented with recombinant cyclin B to produce mitotic extract (ME), or with EDTA, or microcystin (CalBiochem). Unless stated otherwise, these mixtures were then incubated for 90–120 min prior to any subsequent reactions. Alternatively, S200 fraction supplemented with ATP-regenerating system was used instead of NRE. Preimmune serum antibodies and anti-SLBP1 antibodies were covalently linked to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using dimethyl pimelimidate (45Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For immunodepletion, 45–50 μl of NRE were mixed with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose-coupled antibodies washed five times with 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl and mixed on a wheel for 80–100 min at room temperature. The extract was then cleared by two subsequent spins (15 s at 12,000 × g), and the supernatants were used immediately or stored at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitations, protein G-Sepharose beads washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl (ST) were incubated with monoclonal Y12 and H1 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, unbound antibody was removed by four washes with ST. 30–90 fmol of 32P-labeled U7 or U1 RNA were incubated in 30–100 μl of S200 fraction supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system and 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, reaction mixtures were diluted by addition of 1 volume of ST and then mixed with the antibodies coupled to protein G-Sepharose. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were concentrated by centrifugation and the supernatants were removed. The beads were then washed three times with ST, and subsequently, the amounts of 32P in pellet and bead fractions were measured by Cerenkov counting. To recover the RNA, beads were supplemented with 100 μl of 0.33 m sodium acetate, 50 mg/ml tRNA and 20 μl of 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K, 10 mm EDTA. Similarly, the supernatants were supplemented with 10–20 μl of 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K, 10 mm EDTA. Incubations were done for at least 20 min at room temperature and were followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. For the detection of SLBP1 modification, normally a 1/15 to 1/10 volumein vitro transcription/translation mixture was added to the egg extract. After incubations at room temperature, reaction mixtures were supplemented with at least 2 volumes of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Detection of protein was achieved using the PhosphorImager. Reactions were done in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP 6 nm [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 0.14 mg/ml SLBP1 (or histone H1), and 0.5 μl of cyclin B/cdc2 kinase in a volume of 5 μl. Incubations were done at 30 °C. Xenopus egg extracts are rich in components used for the first rapid cell divisions during embryonic development. Fractionation of Xenopus eggs produces a membrane fraction and a cytosolic S200 fraction (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). These can be mixed to form a nuclear reconstitution extract (NRE), which, in the presence of DNA or chromatin, is able to assemble nuclei that undergo semiconservative DNA replication in vitro (35Smythe C. Newport J.N. Hamkalo B.A. Elgin S.C.R. Functional Organization of the Nucleus: A Laboratory Guide. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 449-468Google Scholar). First, we tested whether endogenous U7 snRNPs, which are functional in oocytes (20Stefanovic B. Hackl W. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), are able to process synthetic histone mRNA. Because we did not detect any processing (data not shown and see Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6below), we wondered whether this was due to the absence of the U7 snRNA from the Xenopus egg extract preparation used. We therefore prepared RNA from oocytes and from various stages of theXenopus egg extract preparation and estimated the amount of U7 RNA present by detecting U7 RNA by primer extension from U7 RNA-specific primers. The efficiency of primer extension was then compared with primer extension in control reactions with known amounts of synthetic Xenopus U7 RNA. This comparison indicated that the amounts of U7 RNA in oocytes, eggs, and in NRE were very similar, corresponding to the proportion of primer extended with 0.3, 0.2, and 0.3 pmol of synthetic U7 RNA, respectively (data not shown). U7 was present in both the cytosolic S200 and in the membrane fraction used for reconstitution at a ratio of ∼2:1 (data not shown). No significant loss of U7 RNA occurred at the different stages of the preparation. This suggests that the absence of processing in our reactions was not caused by the absence of U7 snRNP. Attempts to further investigate this lack of processing activity, which included testing whether the Xenopus U7 RNA 5′-end was accessible for hybridization to oligonucleotides, were not conclusive. We therefore decided to test whether addition of synthetic U7 snRNA would restore processing activity in these extracts.Figure 5Histone RNA 3′ processing inXenopus egg extracts is stimulated by the presence of a wild-type histone hairpin RNA sequence and by hairpin-binding proteins. A, wild-type (12/12) and mutant (B/12) hairpin RNA sequences inserted between A-28 and A-45 of the histone RNA shown in Fig. 1 B. B, 12 μl of NRE was supplemented with either 1.2 μl of H2O or 1.2 μl of 200 nm U7 RNA and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, 5-μl aliquots of each mixture were used in processing reactions with either 32P-labeled 12/12 RNA (lanes 7 and 8) or 32P-labeled B/12 RNA (lanes 5 and 6). The reactions were performed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Processing reactions with K21 nuclear extract (lane 1–4) were done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, NRE was treated with either preimmune serum or anti-SLBP1 serum coupled to protein G-Sepharose as described. Aliquots (3 μl) of NRE (lane 2) NRE treated with preimmune serum (mock-depleted NRE, lane 3) or NRE treated with the antiserum (ΔSLBP1 NRE, lane 4) were mixed with 32P-labeled wtHPs RNA as described, and complexes were analyzed by EMSA. D, for processing reactions, aliquots (6 μl) of NRE or of SLBP1-depleted NRE were supplemented with U7 RNA and for reactions shown in lanes 3and 4, with 1 μl of SLBP1 or hHBP (0.2 mg/ml). EDTA, tRNA, and finally 32P-labeled 12/12 histone RNA were added subsequently as described. After 3-h incubation, the reactions were stopped and the products analyzed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6SLBP1 modification and histone RNA 3′ processing in ME.

https://openalex.org/W2048727793,"To investigate the mechanism of double strand DNA break formation in mammalian cells, an in vitro assay was established using closed circular DNA containing two uracils on opposite DNA strands (18 and 30 base pairs apart) and extracts prepared from human cells. In this assay, formation of double strand breaks was detected by the conversion of circular DNA to linear DNA. Approximately 4-fold more double strand DNA breaks were produced by extracts from cells deficient in DNA ligase I (46BR) relative to those produced by extracts from control cells (MRC5, derived from a clinically normal individual). In parallel with the amount of double strand DNA breaks, extracts from 46BR cells produced longer repair patches (up to 24 bases in length) than those from MRC5 cells (typically"

C., Sisken, J. E., Neve, R. L., and Vanaman, T. C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 13843–13848). Cells lacking plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1 did not attach to collagen-coated plates as tightly as controls, suggesting that a defect in adhesion might be underlying the inability to extend neurites. We report here that cell lines lacking plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1 do not produce α1 integrin, which is required for both collagen adherence and neurite extension. Because α1 integrin gene transcription can be down-regulated by glucocorticoids, the response of cells to glucocorticoids was investigated. Cortisol-dependent transactivation from the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in cells lacking plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1 was stimulated 145–216-fold over untreated cells compared with 15–26-fold for controls. This increase was not due to increased binding affinity of the receptor for cortisol, an increased number of cortisol-binding sites, or increased translocation of the receptor to the nucleus. Expression of additional glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes required for neurite extension must also be altered in cells missing the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1 because constitutive expression of α1 integrin did not restore their nerve growth factor-mediated neurite extension capability. The impact of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 1 on other signaling systems and the resultant profound yet subtle effects on PC6 cells strongly suggests that it plays an important role in modulating signal transduction pathways downstream of Ca2+-mediated signals. We have previously shown that inhibition of expression of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 1 in PC6 cells leads to loss of nerve growth factor-mediated neurite extension (Brandt, P.

The discovery of multiple PMCA genes and multiple alternatively spliced mRNAs deriving from the primary transcripts of these genes, yielding 25 or more possible isoforms (for review see Ref. 1Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 397-471Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggests that perhaps there is more to the function of the PMCAs than simple calcium homeostasis. This idea was further bolstered by the observation that all of the PMCA isoforms have unique temporal, developmental, and cell-specific expression patterns, implying that they may play unique roles that depend on the calcium handling requirements of particular cell types at various stages of differentiation and development (1Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 397-471Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2Brandt P. Neve R.L. J.

Vanaman T.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One observation that has consistently been made for PMCA mRNAs is that PMCA1b is seen in all mammalian tissues and cells examined (1Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 397-471Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This would suggest that if there is a housekeeping function for PMCAs, PMCA1b might be the isoform carrying out that role. Other isoforms would then be expressed as needed by cells to meet their special calcium handling requirements. However, when expression of all PMCA1 proteins was blocked with an antisense RNA that prevented translation of PMCA1 mRNAs in the pheochromocytoma cell line, PC6 (a PC12 derivative (5Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), there were no major discernible effects on the undifferentiated cells (6Brandt P.C. Sisken J.E. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If PMCA1b had been solely responsible for maintenance of resting calcium levels, then these levels should have been elevated in PMCA1(−) cells. However, a major increase in resting cytosolic calcium was not observed within the limits of the detection using aequorin. In fact, the only change in calcium homeostasis seen was a modest decrease in the rate of removal of cytosolic calcium following stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent release with bradykinin. Clearly, other calcium handling mechanisms in the cell compensated for the loss of PMCA1. The fact that loss of all PMCA1 isoforms had minimal effects on undifferentiated cells suggests that PMCA1 isoforms play some other role in the cell. PC6 cells lacking PMCA1 can no longer extend neurites in response to NGF (6Brandt P.C. Sisken J.E. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or other differentiating agents, 2P. C. Brandt, unpublished observation. despite the fact that NGF signaling pathways are intact. Also, PC12 cells treated with NGF (7Hammes A. Oberdorf S. Strehler E.E. Stauffer T. Carafoli E. Vetter H. Neyses L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or myocytes differentiatedby contact (4Brandt P. Vanaman T.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) up-regulate splicing of PMCA1a and c, which are isoforms found exclusively in excitable tissues. These data, taken together, provide a basis for hypothesizing that PMCA1 isoforms may play a role in the signaling pathways involved in controlling steps in excitable cell differentiation. To test this hypothesis, studies were undertaken to identify alterations in regulatory pathways in PMCA1(−) cells that prevent them from extending neurites in response to NGF. As detailed here, it was found that cells lacking PMCA1 have an elevated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transactivation response that may be repressing expression of genes necessary for neurite extension. The cell lines used in these experiments were described previously (6Brandt P.C. Sisken J.E. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The wild type cell line is PC6, a derivative of PC12 cells developed by Pittman et al. (5Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RSV9-2 and RSV9-9 are two cell lines expressing PMCA1 antisense RNA that inhibit expression of PMCA1 protein to immunologically undetectable levels (6Brandt P.C. Sisken J.E. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These are referred to in the text as “PMCA1(−)” cell lines. RSV14-2 and RSV14-4 are two control cell lines expressing the same PMCA1 cDNA sequence in the sense orientation. If translated, this cDNA would encode only the first 89 amino acids of PMCA1. However, this fragment has never been detected. Unless otherwise specified, cells were maintained in PC6 medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Sigma), 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc. or Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin (Sigma), and streptomycin (Sigma)). Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air environment at 37 °C. All experiments and routine passaging of cells were carried out in Cell+ tissue culture dishes from Sarstedt (Newton, NC) except for collagen binding assays. Where noted, fetal bovine serum that had been stripped of steroids by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal (Hyclone) was substituted for normal fetal bovine serum and horse serum in the medium. The procedure for preparing collagen-coated plates was essentially as described by Turner et al. (8Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 510-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 35-mm plastic bacterial culture dishes (Falcon 1008) were coated with 0, 10, or 50 μg/ml calf skin collagen, Type I, in 50 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, overnight at 37 °C. The dishes were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Sigma) and used immediately. 100,00035S-labeled cells in 2 ml of PC6 medium were added to each plate. The cells had previously been labeled overnight with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in the form of TransLabel (ICN, Irvine, CA) in PC6 medium deficient in methionine and cysteine. Cells were allowed to attach for 1 h under standard incubation conditions after which a sheer force was applied by placing the cells on an orbital platform rotating at 90 rpm for 30 s. The detached cells were immediately removed by aspiration. Loosely attached cells were removed by carefully adding 2 ml of DPBS and applying a sheer force for an additional 30 s. The cells were washed again, and those still attached were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce) in PBS and 35S content assayed by liquid scintillation counting of the lysates. A control of 105 cells was also lysed and counted so that the fraction of bound cells could be determined by the ratio of the radioactivity in the bound cells to the controls. 106–107cells were washed in Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free DPBS, dislodged from their plates by titration in Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free DPBS, and collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml freshly prepared NHS-sulfo-biotin (Pierce) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with constant mixing by inversion. The cells were then pelleted and washed two times with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS). For direct immunoprecipitation of integrins, cells were lysed by incubation in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin) on ice for 1 h, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min (9Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3287-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α1 integrin was initially immunoprecipitated with the 3A3 monoclonal antibody (9Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3287-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Dr. David Turner, SUNY-Syracuse Health Science Center). In later experiments, a commercially available hamster antibody against rat α1 integrin was used (Pharmingen, San Diego). β1 integrin was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (generous gift of Dr. Louis Reichardt, University of California, San Francisco). Approximately 20 μg of IgG was added to 0.5 mg of cell extract and incubated 1 h at 4 °C. In the case of the hamster antibody, 25 μg of rabbit anti-hamster IgG was added after 1 h of incubation with the anti-α1integrin primary antibody, and treatment was continued for an additional hour. Immune complexes were then recovered by incubating reactions with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) for rabbit antibodies or protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) for mouse antibodies at 4 °C with constant mixing by inversion for 1 h. The complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, and prepared for SDS-PAGE as follows. The integrins were released from the Sepharose beads by heating the samples at 68 °C for 10 min in standard Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agent, and the proteins were resolved on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels used for fluorographic detection of35S-labeled proteins were impregnated with Enhance fluor (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and placed on XAR-5 x-ray film overnight at −70 °C. For Western blots or detection of biotin-linked proteins, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from gels to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Biotinylated proteins were detected by blocking the blot in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (v/v) (TBST) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder for 1 h at 25 °C and then incubating the membrane in Extravidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) for 1 h. The blot was washed four times in TBST and developed with AttoPhos (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fluorescent signal generated by AttoPhos was detected on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. Cells plated the previous evening at 60–70% confluence in 35- or 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the plasmids pMMTV-CAT and pCMVβgal with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' recommended protocols. After the DNA-lipid complex was added to cells in DMEM containing 5% steroid-free (charcoal/dextran-treated) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), the cells were incubated overnight. The next day, the medium was removed, and fresh DMEM containing 5% steroid-free fetal bovine serum and 1 μm cortisol or an equal volume of vehicle (ethanol) was added to the cultures, which were then allowed to incubate an additional 24 h. Cortisol was added from a 1 mm stock made in ethanol, so the final ethanol concentration never exceeded 0.1% (v/v). The cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped from the plate in a minimal volume of PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by three rounds of freeze-thaw from −70 °C to 37 °C. After freeze-thaw lysis, debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured according to the method of Seed and Sheen (10Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) using [14C]chloramphenicol from NEN Life Science Products and butyryl coenzyme A from Sigma. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by hydrolysis of o-nitrophenylgalactopyranoside (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Protein content of extracts was measured by bicinchoninic acid complex formation with reduced copper ion (Pierce). To control for variations in transfection efficiency among different cell lines CAT activity from the MMTV promoter was normalized to β-galactosidase activity constitutively expressed under control of the CMV promoter. All experiments were done in triplicate or greater. The number of glucocorticoid-binding sites and the affinity of those binding sites in PMCA1(−) cells and controls was determined by whole cell binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (11Werb Z. Foley R. Munck A. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 147: 1684-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The procedure followed was a slightly modified version of that previously used by Zhou et al. (12Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31130-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells at 60–70% confluence in 10-cm dishes were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone, or an equal amount of ethanol, in DMEM containing 5% steroid-free fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment, the cells were washed one time in DPBS, collected in 5 ml of DPBS by scraping, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of PKC sonication buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin, and 0.1 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml aprotinin) and incubated at room temperature for 2 min followed by 5 min on ice. Nonidet P-40 was added to 1% final concentration, and the cells were passed through a 20-gauge needle. The total MgCl2concentration was adjusted to 5 mm, and nuclei were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were washed two times with PKC sonication buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, and the washes were pooled with the cytosolic fraction. The nuclei were resuspended and disrupted in 300 μl of PKC sonication buffer containing 0.3% SDS. 100 μg of total cytosolic or nuclear fractions from each sample were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% milk powder in TBST for 1 h followed by incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the glucocorticoid receptor (SC-1004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:2000 dilution in 5% milk/TBST for 1 h. The blots were washed four times with TBST, and immunoreactive material was detected by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. After washing in TBST, AttoPhos was applied to the blots, and fluorescent products were detected on a PhosphorImager as described above. The rat α1 integrin cDNA (13Ignatius M.J. Large T.H. Houde M. Tawil J.W. Barton A. Esch F. Carbonetto S. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Dr. Louis Reichardt, University of California, San Francisco) was cloned behind the constitutively expressed CMV promoter of the plasmid pCB6+. The resultant plasmid was designated pα1-I. RSV9-2 and RSV9-9 cells were co-transfected with pα1-I and pWE3 (ATCC) at a 10 to 1 molar ratio using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. pWE3 encodes a puromycin-resistance gene and recombinants were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Expression of α1 integrin in individual isolates was determined by cell surface labeling with NHS-sulfo-biotin as described above. α1 integrin positive clones were plated and exposed to 100 ng/ml 2.5S murine NGF for two weeks in PC6 medium. Previously, we had reported that blockade of PMCA1 protein synthesis with antisense RNA led to the inability of PC6 cells to extend neuritic processes when treated with NGF (6Brandt P.C. Sisken J.E. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While trying to understand the mechanisms underlying this result, it was observed that RSV9-2 and RSV9-9, the two PMCA1(−) cell lines, did not attach to standard tissue culture plastic as well as the controls. Examination of the literature showed that for PC12 cells, the parental line of PC6, neutralizing antibodies to α1 integrin blocked neurite extension (9Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3287-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore elected to determine whether changes in α1 integrin binding or expression might explain the altered adherence and inability of PMCA1(−) cell lines to extend neurites. PC12 cells contain two αβ1 integrin pairs, α1β1 and α3β1, of which the α1β1 integrin pair is required for neurite extension (14Tawil N.J. Houde M. Blacher R. Esch F. Reichardt L.F. Turner D.C. Carbonetto S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6540-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether a functional α1β1 pair was being expressed, the ability PMCA1(−) cells to bind to collagen was assayed because collagen is the preferred substrate for α1β1 integrins. Equal numbers of labeled cells were applied to untreated, nontissue culture plastic dishes that had been precoated with 0, 10, or 50 μg/ml calf skin collagen, type I, and a sheer force was applied. The cells remaining on the plate were quantified and expressed as a percentage of those initially plated (Fig.1 A). When no collagen was applied to the plates, 12–15% of all cells attached. This probably represents nonspecific interactions with the plastic that allow weak binding. When the concentration of the coating collagen was raised to 10 μg/ml, the attachment of the control cell lines increased to between 25 and 50%, whereas the PMCA1(−) cell lines remained at ∼12%. This would suggest that the PMCA1(−) cells do not have a functional collagen receptor on their surface. This was further confirmed by the demonstration that increasing the collagen concentration to 50 μg/ml decreased the attachment of PMCA1(−) cells to less than 5%. This is likely due to the loss of the nonspecific binding sites on the plate at higher concentrations of collagen, which are therefore unavailable for PMCA1(−) cell attachment. Having determined that there was decreased α1β1-dependent attachment in PMCA1(−) cells, the expression of these two integrins was examined. First, a study was conducted to determine whether the α1subunit was expressed on the cell surface. Intact cells were labeled with NHS-sulfo-biotin, and the α1 integrin was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot with detection by an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Fig. 1 B shows that α1integrin was not present on the cell surface of PMCA1(−) cells but was in the wild type and control lines. To determine whether α1 integrin was synthesized but possibly not successfully transported to the cell surface, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and α1 integrin was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and fluorographed. As seen in Fig. 1 B, no α1integrin was detected in PMCA1(−) cell lines. To determine whether the expression of all integrins was affected in PMCA1(−) cells, β1 integrin was also immunoprecipitated from extracts with β1 integrin-specific antibodies. Cells again were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and then surface labeled with NHS-sulfo-biotin. The β1 integrin antibody used for immunoprecipitation was able to co-precipitate any associated α integrins. In this way, it could be determined whether there was an up-regulation of α3 integrin or induction of another α integrin to compensate for the loss of α1. Half of the precipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and detected with avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, whereas the other half were resolved and fluorographed directly. The resulting fluorograms shown in Fig. 1 (C andD) confirmed the previous finding that α1integrin was not produced in PMCA1(−) cell lines. The cell surface labeling protocol employed in these studies does not label β1 integrin with high efficiency. Therefore, it is not clearly seen in the blot shown in Fig. 1 D. However, the β1 integrin is easily seen in the 35S-labeled samples shown to the right in Fig. 1 C. These results show that synthesis of β1 integrin production is not concomitantly decreased with the loss of α1 integrin in PMCA1(−) cells. Also, α3integrin did not appear to be up-regulated in PMCA1(−) cells to compensate for the loss of α1 integrin. The identity of α3 integrin was independently determined by separate immunoprecipitation experiments with α3 integrin-specific antibodies (data not shown). The band migrating between α3 and β1 integrins in Fig. 1 Cis still observed and may be a previously unidentified α integrin in PC6 cells. However, even if it is an α integrin, it also does not appear to be consistently up- or down-regulated by the loss of α1 integrin in PMCA1(−) cells. Zhang et al. (15Zhang Z. Tarone G. Turner D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in some PC12 cell lines (the parental line of PC6) transcription of the α1 integrin gene can be down-regulated by glucocorticoids. To determine whether a more responsive GR might be responsible for down-regulation of α1 integrin in PMCA1(−) cells, cortisol-dependent transcription of the CAT reporter gene under control of the MMTV promoter was assayed. The MMTV promoter contains several tandem glucocorticoid response elements and is responsive to GR-mediated transcriptional activation. The cells were co-transfected with pMMTV-CAT and pCMVβgal and analyzed for induction of cortisol-stimulated transcription of the CAT gene in steroid-free medium that was normalized to constitutive β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. As seen in Fig. 2, the PMCA1(−) cells are much more responsive to cortisol than controls. The cortisol-induced GR transactivation of controls was 15.3–25.8-fold, whereas the PMCA1(−) cell lines showed 145- and 216-fold induction for RSV9-2 and RSV9-9, respectively. The nearly 10-fold elevation in glucocorticoid responsiveness could be explained by variety of mechanisms. One possibility is that there is an increase in the total number of glucocorticoid-binding sites, either because of more total receptor molecules or because of increased formation of the corticosteroid-binding competent “activated” 9S receptor complex (16Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the cytosol. As a first step in determining whether either of these possibilities may have contributed to elevated glucocorticoid response seen in PMCA1(−) cells, the number of binding sites and their affinity were determined by whole cell binding assays of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. As seen in Fig.3 A, these analyses showed that there was no increase in the number of glucocorticoid-binding sites (∼4300 sites/cell) or the affinity of those binding sites for the steroid (∼1.8 × 10−9m). Because changes in binding of glucocorticoids by the glucocorticoid receptor did not appear to be responsible for enhanced glucocorticoid receptor response, studies were performed to determine whether there was an alteration in the amount of steroid-bound receptor translocated into the nuclei of PMCA1(−) cell lines. Cells were stimulated with dexamethasone and fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic components. The fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the GR was detected by immunoblotting with a GR-specific polyclonal antibody as shown in Fig.3 B. Although the bulk of the receptor remained in the cytosol after treatment with dexamethasone, there was a clear increase in the amount of GR detected in the nucleus after treatment with cortisol in all cell lines. There did not appear to be an appreciable difference in the amount of total GR translocated in the PMCA1(−) cells compared with the controls. Nor was there an increase in the total amount of GR in PMCA1(−) cell lines. However, one noticeable difference was the presence of a pair of bands in the control cell extracts, designated GR′, that were greatly diminished or missing in samples from the PMCA1(−) cell lines. The identity of these bands has not yet been established. However, they may represent forms of the GR altered by phosphorylation or some other regulatory posttranslational modification that is lacking in PMCA1(−) cells. To determine whether loss of α1 integrin was the sole lesion preventing neurite extension, a rat α1 integrin cDNA was constitutively expressed in PMCA1(−) cells. Puromycin-resistant clones were selected and screened for cell surface expression of α1 integrin. Positive clones were tested for the ability to extend neurites in response to NGF. The data in Fig. 4 show the expression of α1 integrin in selected clones. Because the number of cells used for labeling with NHS-sulfo-biotin varied between 106 and 107, the relative intensity of the α1 integrin bands was not absolutely quantitative, but in most cases the expression was on the order of that seen in wild type cells. For unknown reasons, of the 12 puromycin-resistant RSV9-2 clones examined only two were found to express detectable levels of α1 integrin, and those were at low levels compared with the expression seen in the α1 integrin-positive RSV9-9 clones. Clones expressing α1 integrin were exposed to 100 ng/ml 2.5 S murine NGF for 2 weeks. The constitutive expression of α1 integrin did not compensate for its loss in PMCA1(−) cells because none of the clones were able to extend neurites longer than the parental PMCA1(−) cell lines (Fig. 4). This suggests that multiple components necessary for NGF-dependent neuronal differentiation are affected by loss of PMCA1. In the last ten years, the number of PMCA isoform mRNAs that have been cloned has reached at least 25 (1). These isoforms have shown unique temporal and spatial expression in tissues (2Brandt P.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Hammes A. Oberdorf S. Strehler E.E. Stauffer T. Carafoli E. Vetter H. Neyses L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although it has not yet been shown that each of these mRNAs is translated into a functional protein, the complexity of their expression would suggest that they are used to address specific calcium handling requirements of the multitude of different cell types in animals. In an attempt to understand the need for so many different PMCA isoforms, all members of the PMCA1 family of proteins were blocked with antisense RNA in PC6 cells (6Brandt P.C. Sisken J.E. Neve R.L. Vanaman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was found that although PMCA1(−) cells were essentially indistinguishable from sense RNA controls and the wild type cell lines in the undifferentiated state, they were unable to extend neuritic processes when treated with NGF. The data presented here showed that a cell surface protein essential for neurite extension, α1 integrin (9Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3287-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not present in PMCA1(−) cells. This was not the sole cause of loss of the ability to extend neurites, however, because stable expression of α1 integrin in PMCA1(−) cells did not restore this capability. This is not entirely surprising. Because the PC12 and PC6 cell lines are similar to the adreno-neural precursor cells of the neural crest, they can be differentiated into a sympathetic-like, dopaminergic neurons on treatment with NGF or a chromaffin-like cell (28Fujita K. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 80: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Bach L.A. Leeding K.S. Leng S.L. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 155: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the former case, NGF induces a variety of genes necessary for the support of the dopaminergic neuron phenotype such as neurofilaments and enzymes necessary for conversion of catechols to dopamine. In the latter case, chromaffin cells do not extend axons or dendrites, so production of the proteins necessary for this purpose, such as α1 integrin and L1 can be down-regulated (15Zhang Z. Tarone G. Turner D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stewart H.J. Turner D. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 914-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,31Grant N.J. Claudepierre T. Aunis D. Langley K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla are normally bathed in a high concentration of cortisol from the adjacent zonae fasciculata and reticularis, it is reasonable to expect that this hormone might control down-regulation of proteins necessary for the neuronal phenotype. In fact, it has been shown that PC12 cells treated with cortisol down-regulate expression of α1 integrin (15Zhang Z. Tarone G. Turner D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PMCA1(−) cells may down-regulate other proteins necessary for extending neurites by the same mechanism used to down-regulate α1 integrin expression. This may explain why simply expressing α1 integrin constitutively does not restore NGF-mediated neurite extension. The mechanisms that underlie the increase in GR transactivation in PMCA1(−) cells (Fig. 3) are not known at this time. However, it is possible that there is an alteration in calcium-regulated signaling pathways that control the GR transactivation response. Regulation of GR activity by calcium has not been extensively studied, but there are several points at which calcium may indirectly regulate GR activity (27Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The results presented here provide the first indication that plasma membrane calcium pumps play a role in signal transduction that may be more complex than simply removing calcium after a calcium-mediated signal has been transduced in the cell. These data show that loss of one family of PMCAs, the PMCA1 family, in the neuron-like cell line, PC6, leads to elevated GR activity and loss of α1integrin, two very important signal transducing molecules in their own right. The impact of PMCA1 isoforms on other signaling systems and the resultant profound, yet subtle, effects on PC6 cells, strongly suggests that it plays an important role in modulating signal transduction pathways downstream of Ca2+-mediated signals itself and lends credence to the idea that the multitude of different PMCA isoforms is due, at least in part, to a complex role in signal transduction pathways."
