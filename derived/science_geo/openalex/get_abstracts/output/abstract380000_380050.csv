https://openalex.org/W1966297423,"The growing competition and ""publish or perish"" culture in academia might conflict with the objectivity and integrity of research, because it forces scientists to produce ""publishable"" results at all costs. Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report ""negative"" results (results that fail to support the tested hypothesis). Therefore, if publication pressures increase scientific bias, the frequency of ""positive"" results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and ""productive"" academic environments. This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US. Across all disciplines, papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that, according to NSF data, produced more academic papers per capita. The size of this effect increased when controlling for state's per capita R&D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results, including discipline and methodology. Although the confounding effect of institutions' prestige could not be excluded (researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments), these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists' productivity but also their bias. The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high."
https://openalex.org/W2038873665,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1 (ALDH1) has been proved useful for the identification of cancer stem cells. However, our knowledge of the expression and activity of ALDH1 in common epithelial cancers and their corresponding normal tissues is still largely absent. Therefore, we characterized ALDH1 expression in 24 types of normal tissues and a large collection of epithelial tumor specimens (six cancer types, n = 792) by immunohistochemical staining. Using the ALDEFUOR assay, ALDH1 activity was also examined in 16 primary tumor specimens and 43 established epithelial cancer cell lines. In addition, an ovarian cancer transgenic mouse model and 7 murine ovarian cancer cell lines were analyzed. We found that the expression levels and patterns of ALDH1 in epithelial cancers are remarkably distinct, and they correlate with their corresponding normal tissues. ALDH1 protein expression levels are positively correlated with ALDH1 enzymatic activity measured by ALDEFLUOR assay. Long-term in vitro culture doesn't significantly affect ALDH1 activity in epithelial tumor cells. Consistent with research on other cancers, we found that high ALDH1 expression is significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes in serous ovarian cancer patients (n = 439, p = 0.0036). Finally, ALDH(br) tumor cells exhibit cancer stem cell properties and are resistant to chemotherapy. As a novel cancer stem cell marker, ALDH1 can be used for tumors whose corresponding normal tissues express ALDH1 in relatively restricted or limited levels such as breast, lung, ovarian or colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2045461902,"Background Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as 3 or more consecutive miscarriages, is widely attributed either to repeated chromosomal instability in the conceptus or to uterine factors that are poorly defined. We tested the hypothesis that abnormal cyclic differentiation of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) into specialized decidual cells predisposes to RPL, based on the observation that this process may not only be indispensable for placenta formation in pregnancy but also for embryo recognition and selection at time of implantation. Methodology/Principal Findings Analysis of mid-secretory endometrial biopsies demonstrated that RPL is associated with decreased expression of the decidual marker prolactin (PRL) but increased levels of prokineticin-1 (PROK1), a cytokine that promotes implantation. These in vivo findings were entirely recapitulated when ESCs were purified from patients with and without a history of RPL and decidualized in culture. In addition to attenuated PRL production and prolonged and enhanced PROK1 expression, RPL was further associated with a complete dysregulation of both markers upon treatment of ESC cultures with human chorionic gonadotropin, a glycoprotein hormone abundantly expressed by the implanting embryo. We postulated that impaired embryo recognition and selection would clinically be associated with increased fecundity, defined by short time-to-pregnancy (TTP) intervals. Woman-based analysis of the mean and mode TTP in a cohort of 560 RPL patients showed that 40% can be considered “superfertile”, defined by a mean TTP of 3 months or less. Conclusions Impaired cyclic decidualization of the endometrium facilitates implantation yet predisposes to subsequent pregnancy failure by disabling natural embryo selection and by disrupting the maternal responses to embryonic signals. These findings suggest a novel pathological pathway that unifies maternal and embryonic causes of RPL."
https://openalex.org/W2065346340,"Pregnancy is widely viewed as dependent upon an intimate dialogue, mediated by locally secreted factors between a developmentally competent embryo and a receptive endometrium. Reproductive success in humans is however limited, largely because of the high prevalence of chromosomally abnormal preimplantation embryos. Moreover, the transient period of endometrial receptivity in humans uniquely coincides with differentiation of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) into highly specialized decidual cells, which in the absence of pregnancy invariably triggers menstruation. The role of cyclic decidualization of the endometrium in the implantation process and the nature of the decidual cytokines and growth factors that mediate the crosstalk with the embryo are unknown.We employed a human co-culture model, consisting of decidualizing ESCs and single hatched blastocysts, to identify the soluble factors involved in implantation. Over the 3-day co-culture period, approximately 75% of embryos arrested whereas the remainder showed normal development. The levels of 14 implantation factors secreted by the stromal cells were determined by multiplex immunoassay. Surprisingly, the presence of a developing embryo had no significant effect on decidual secretions, apart from a modest reduction in IL-5 levels. In contrast, arresting embryos triggered a strong response, characterized by selective inhibition of IL-1beta, -6, -10, -17, -18, eotaxin, and HB-EGF secretion. Co-cultures were repeated with undifferentiated ESCs but none of the secreted cytokines were affected by the presence of a developing or arresting embryo.Human ESCs become biosensors of embryo quality upon differentiation into decidual cells. In view of the high incidence of gross chromosomal errors in human preimplantation embryos, cyclic decidualization followed by menstrual shedding may represent a mechanism of natural embryo selection that limits maternal investment in developmentally impaired pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W1976076274,"Background Over 14 million people die each year from infectious diseases despite extensive vaccine use [1]. The needle and syringe—first invented in 1853—is still the primary delivery device, injecting liquid vaccine into muscle. Vaccines could be far more effective if they were precisely delivered into the narrow layer just beneath the skin surface that contains a much higher density of potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) essential to generate a protective immune response. We hypothesized that successful vaccination could be achieved this way with far lower antigen doses than required by the needle and syringe. Methodology/Principal Findings To meet this objective, using a probability-based theoretical analysis for targeting skin APCs, we designed the Nanopatch™, which contains an array of densely packed projections (21025/cm2) invisible to the human eye (110 µm in length, tapering to tips with a sharpness of <1000 nm), that are dry-coated with vaccine and applied to the skin for two minutes. Here we show that the Nanopatches deliver a seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluvax® 2008) to directly contact thousands of APCs, in excellent agreement with theoretical prediction. By physically targeting vaccine directly to these cells we induced protective levels of functional antibody responses in mice and also protection against an influenza virus challenge that are comparable to the vaccine delivered intramuscularly with the needle and syringe—but with less than 1/100th of the delivered antigen. Conclusions/Significance Our results represent a marked improvement—an order of magnitude greater than reported by others—for injected doses administered by other delivery methods, without reliance on an added adjuvant, and with only a single vaccination. This study provides a proven mathematical/engineering delivery device template for extension into human studies—and we speculate that successful translation of these findings into humans could uniquely assist with problems of vaccine shortages and distribution—together with alleviating fear of the needle and the need for trained practitioners to administer vaccine, e.g., during an influenza pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W1983760621,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular, H2O2, is essential for full activation of VEGF receptor2 (VEGFR2) signaling involved in endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) is a major secreted extracellular enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to H2O2, and anchors to EC surface through heparin-binding domain (HBD). Mice lacking ecSOD show impaired postnatal angiogenesis. However, it is unknown whether ecSOD-derived H2O2 regulates VEGF signaling. Here we show that gene transfer of ecSOD, but not ecSOD lacking HBD (ecSOD-ΔHBD), increases H2O2 levels in adductor muscle of mice, and promotes angiogenesis after hindlimb ischemia. Mice lacking ecSOD show reduction of H2O2 in non-ischemic and ischemic limbs. In vitro, overexpression of ecSOD, but not ecSOD-ΔHBD, in cultured medium in ECs enhances VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (VEGFR2-pY), which is prevented by short-term pretreatment with catalase that scavenges extracellular H2O2. Either exogenous H2O2 (<500 µM), which is diffusible, or nitric oxide donor has no effect on VEGF-induced VEGFR2-pY. These suggest that ecSOD binding to ECs via HBD is required for localized generation of extracellular H2O2 to regulate VEGFR2-pY. Mechanistically, VEGF-induced VEGFR2-pY in caveolae/lipid rafts, but non-lipid rafts, is enhanced by ecSOD, which localizes at lipid rafts via HBD. One of the targets of ROS is protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). ecSOD induces oxidation and inactivation of both PTP1B and DEP1, which negatively regulates VEGFR2-pY, in caveolae/lipid rafts, but not non-lipid rafts. Disruption of caveolae/lipid rafts, or PTPs inhibitor orthovanadate, or siRNAs for PTP1B and DEP1 enhances VEGF-induced VEGFR2-pY, which prevents ecSOD-induced effect. Functionally, ecSOD promotes VEGF-stimulated EC migration and proliferation. In summary, extracellular H2O2 generated by ecSOD localized at caveolae/lipid rafts via HBD promotes VEGFR2 signaling via oxidative inactivation of PTPs in these microdomains. Thus, ecSOD is a potential therapeutic target for angiogenesis-dependent cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1993347488,"Background Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are among the first-line sentinels for immune detection and responsiveness to pathogens. The TLR2 subfamily of TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR6) form heterodimers with each other and are thus able to recognize a broad range of components from several microbes such as yeast, Gram-positive bacteria and protozoa. Until now, TLR2 activation by bacterial ligands has long been associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines but not type I interferon responses. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a variety of transgenic mice, here we provide in vivo and in vitro data showing that TLR2 activation does in fact induce interferon-beta and that this occurs via MyD88-IRF1 and -IRF7 pathways. Interestingly, by microscopy we demonstrate that although a cell surface receptor, TLR2 dependent induction of type I interferons occurs in endolysosomal compartments where it is translocated to upon ligand engagement. Furthermore, we could show that blocking receptor internalization or endolysosomal acidification inhibits the ability of TLR2 to trigger the induction type I interferon but not pro-inflammatory responses. Conclusion/Significance The results indicate that TLR2 activation induces pro-inflammatory and type I interferon responses from distinct subcellular sites: the plasma membrane and endolysosomal compartments respectively. Apart from identifying and characterizing a novel pathway for induction of type I interferons, the present study offers new insights into how TLR signaling discriminates and regulates the nature of responses to be elicited against extracellular and endocytosed microbes. These findings may also have clinical implication. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs following activation of TLRs is a central pathologic event in several hyper-inflammatory conditions. The discovery that the induction of pro-inflammatory and type I IFN responses can be uncoupled through pharmacological manipulation of endolysosomal acidification suggests new avenues for potential therapeutic intervention against inflammations and sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2038767323,"Macrophage phagocytosis is an essential biological process in host defense and requires large amounts of energy. To date, glucose is believed to represent the prime substrate for ATP production in macrophages. To investigate the relative contribution of free fatty acids (FFAs) in this process, we determined the phagocytosis rates in normal mouse macrophages and macrophages of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-deficient mice. ATGL was shown to be the rate-limiting enzyme for the hydrolysis of lipid droplet-associated triacylglycerol (TG) in many tissues. Here, we demonstrate that Atgl−/− macrophages fail to efficiently hydrolyze cellular TG stores leading to decreased cellular FFA concentrations and concomitant accumulation of lipid droplets, even in the absence of exogenous lipid loading. The reduced availability of FFAs results in decreased cellular ATP concentrations and impaired phagocytosis suggesting that fatty acids must first go through a cycle of esterification and re-hydrolysis before they are available as energy substrate. Exogenously added glucose cannot fully compensate for the phagocytotic defect in Atgl−/− macrophages. Hence, phagocytosis was also decreased in vivo when Atgl−/− mice were challenged with bacterial particles. These findings imply that phagocytosis in macrophages depends on the availability of FFAs and that ATGL is required for their hydrolytic release from cellular TG stores. This novel mechanism links ATGL-mediated lipolysis to macrophage function in host defense and opens the way to explore possible roles of ATGL in immune response, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.

A critical role of macrophages in host defense and resolution of inflammation is to phagocytose pathogens and cellular debris, which are then enclosed in specific vacuoles called phagosomes. Phagosomes then fuse with lysosomes, yielding phagolysosomes where enzymatic degradation occurs. Phagocytosis is a process that demands a large supply of energy, most likely to combat infections and remove debris in damaged tissues. Normally, glucose is the favored fuel to generate ATP. In vitro, however, macrophages also generate ATP from glutamine, lactate, keto acids, and fatty acids (FAs) 2The abbreviations used are: FAfatty acidATGLadipose triglyceride lipaseTGtriacylglycerolCEcholesteryl estersFCfree cholesterolFFAfree fatty acidLPLlipoprotein lipaseMPMmurine peritoneal macrophagesacacetylatedaggaggregatedDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineLPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumLDLlow density lipoproteinVLDLvery LDLWTwild typeBMMbone marrow-derived macrophage. to varying degrees (1Speert D.P.

FAs in the circulation are bound to albumin or transported in esterified forms within TG-rich lipoproteins, notably VLDL. VLDL causes accumulation of TG and FAs in macrophages through uptake of FAs produced by extracellular LPL-mediated VLDL lipolysis or by endocytosis of whole VLDL particles and VLDL remnants, whose TG stores are subsequently hydrolyzed in lysosomes (4Bates S.R.

Essentially all mammalian cells, including macrophages, generate lipid droplets as storage organelles consisting of neutral lipids (cholesteryl esters (CE) and TG), phospholipids, unesterified free cholesterol (FC), and lipid droplet-associated proteins (12Brasaemle D.L.

In the setting of atherosclerosis, macrophages have an enormous capacity to take up cholesterol-rich apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, pinocytosis, and phagocytosis (15Kruth H.S.

This process results in the accumulation of CE droplets in the cytoplasm of the cells, giving them a “foamy” appearance. Intimal macrophage foam cells are a characteristic feature of atherosclerotic lesions. Excess intracellular accumulation of FFAs can be toxic to cells (17Unger R.H. Orci L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells protect themselves from this overload by esterifying and thereby neutralizing excess FAs into TG and CE. The consequences of FC versus CE accumulation in macrophages have been thoroughly studied (18Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, much less is known about the molecular and (patho)physiological effects of FA versus TG accumulation in macrophages. Both FAs and FC are released from lipid droplets by intracellular lipases.

The lipolytic defect and consequently the reduced availability of FAs in Atgl−/− macrophages decrease the capacity for phagocytosis even in the presence of glucose. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the standards established by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research, Division of Genetic Engineering and Animal Experiments (Vienna, Austria).

Peritoneal macrophages were obtained 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml of 3% thioglycollate. Macrophages were cultured in DMEM, 10% LPDS (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin for 2 h. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with PBS, and if not stated otherwise, the adherent macrophages were cultured in high glucose (25 mm) DMEM containing 4 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10% LPDS. In some experiments, macrophages were incubated in DMEM containing 0, 6, or 25 mm glucose. LDL and VLDL were isolated from human plasma by density gradient ultracentrifugation, and LDL was acetylated as described previously (32Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl.

For isolation of bone marrow-derived macrophages, femur and tibia were removed and flushed with 2 ml of DMEM. Bone marrow cells were plated in DMEM, 10% LPDS, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin and differentiated into macrophages by addition of 10 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 8 days. Total RNA from macrophages and foam cells was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA from white and brown adipose tissues was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed by using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics) using the QuantifastTM SYBR® Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primer sequences are available upon request. Amplification of human porphobilinogen deaminase and murine hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase as housekeeping genes was performed on all samples as internal controls for variations in mRNA amounts. Equivalent amounts of protein homogenates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to murine ATGL (1:200), hormone-sensitive lipase (1:800) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and a monoclonal anti-mouse β-actin (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Specifically bound immunoglobulins were detected in a second reaction with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG conjugate and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare). MPM were washed two times with PBS and sonicated (Labsonic B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) twice for 10 s in 100 mm potassium phosphate lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin (pH 7.0)). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were quantitated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). One hundred μg of protein from cell lysates were incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 h with 100 μl of substrate. TG substrate contained 25 nmol of triolein/assay and 40,000 cpm/nmol [9,10-3H]triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as tracer. CE substrate contained 20 nmol of cholesteryl oleate/assay and 50,000 cpm/nmol of cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (Amersham Biosciences) as tracer. All lipid substrates were prepared by sonication (Labsonic, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) as described previously (33Holm C. Osterlund T. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. Lipase and Phospholipase Protocols. Vol. 109. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 109-121Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/hexane (10:9:7, v/v) and 1 ml of 100 mm potassium carbonate, 100 mm boric acid (pH 10.5). After centrifugation (800 × g, 20 min), the radioactivity in 1 ml of the upper phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and the release of FFA was calculated. Lipids from MPM were extracted with 2 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen, redissolved in 100 μl of Triton X-100 in chloroform, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 μl of distilled water for 15 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (30 μl) were used for enzymatic measurements of TG (Diagnostic Systems, Holzheim, Germany), total cholesterol (Greiner Diagnostics AG, Bahlingen, Germany), and FC (Diagnostic Systems, Holzheim, Germany) concentrations. Protein was quantitated using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) after dissolving the proteins of extracted cells in 2 ml of 0.3 m NaOH for 1 h at room temperature. MPM grown on a Melinex Film (Gröpl, Tulln, Austria) were fixed in 0.06 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 90 min at room temperature. MPM were rinsed twice in 0.06 m phosphate buffer for 10 min and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 h. The cells were then rinsed four times for 10 min in 0.06 m phosphate buffer and dehydrated in 50, 70, 90, and 100% cold acetone for 20 min each. Thereafter, cells were infiltrated by 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 mixtures of 100% acetone and agar 100 epoxy resin (Gröpl, Tulln, Austria) and pure agar 100 epoxy resin for 4 h. The cells were then placed in agar 100 epoxy resin at room temperature for 8 h, transferred into embedding molds, and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (75 nm) were cut with a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and stained with lead citrate for 5 min and with uranyl acetate for 15 min. Images were taken on a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope equipped with a plate camera system. MPM from WT and Atgl−/− mice were plated on chamber slides in DMEM, 10% LPDS for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and lipid droplets were visualized after Nile Red staining (2.5 μg/ml) by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an LSM 510 META microscope system (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Pictures (×63) were taken at excitation 543 nm, and signals were recorded using a 560-nm long pass filter. Quantification of lipid droplet-containing cells in MPM and foam cells was performed in at least 150 cells per group using Zeiss LSM Image Browser (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Vienna, Austria). One hundred μg of freshly prepared acLDL/ml were enriched with 1 μCi of [1,2-3H]cholesterol (Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany). One hundred μg of VLDL/ml were enriched with 1 μCi of [9,10-3H]triolein (GE Healthcare). The mixtures were overlaid with argon and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C under continuous shaking. Labeled lipoproteins were separated from unincorporated [3H]cholesterol or [9,10-3H]triolein and desalted by exclusion chromatography on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) using PBS as eluent. MPM of Atgl−/− and WT mice were plated in 12-well plates and incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]acLDL and [3H]VLDL at 37 °C for 24 h, respectively. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein content was quantitated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For determination of oleate uptake and incorporation of oleate into lipid subclasses, MPM of Atgl−/− and WT mice were plated in 12-well plates and incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]oleate (GE Healthcare) and 200 μm oleate in DMEM containing 1% FFA-free bovine serum albumin for 6 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with PBS and dried, and the lipids were extracted with 1 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) on a rotary shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. Five-μl aliquots were assayed for oleate uptake by scintillation counting. Lipids were dried under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in 100 μl of human serum/chloroform/methanol (1:1:1, v/v) and separated by thin layer chromatography (hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid, 65:35:1). The bands were excised, and the incorporation of [3H]oleate into various lipid subclasses was quantitated by scintillation counting. MPM were incubated in 12 wells with 1 ml of medium, 2% FFA-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 2 units of heparin for 1 h at 37 °C. For the substrate preparation per sample, 0.6 μCi of [3H]triolein, 920 ng of nonradioactive glycerol trioleate, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in chloroform were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Forty μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) and 80 μl of double distilled H2O were added, and the mixture was sonicated six times (1 min on and 1 min off) on ice. Then 40 μl of heat-inactivated human serum containing apoCII as activator (obtained from a pool of donors, heated at 50 °C for 1 h and stored at −20 °C) and 40 μl of 10% FFA-free bovine serum albumin were added to the substrate. For the analysis, 200 μl of the substrate were incubated with 100 μl of the sample for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3.25 ml of a mixture of methanol/chloroform/heptane (1.41:1.25:1, v/v) and 1 ml of 100 mm potassium carbonate and 100 mm boric acid (pH 10.5). FFA were extracted by vortex mixing for 10 s, and phases were separated by centrifugation at 3200 rpm for 10 min. Radioactivity in 1 ml of the upper phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. MPM were lysed, and protein was quantitated by the method of Bradford. Intracellular ATP levels of Atgl−/− and WT MPM were measured in DMEM containing 0, 6, or 25 mm glucose using EnzyLightTM ATP assay (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligomycin (0.5 μm), an inhibitor of F1F0-ATP synthase, was used as an ATP depletion control (34Galluhn D. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38338-38345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Monick M.M. Powers L.S. Barrett C.W. Hinde S. Ashare A. Groskreutz D.J. Nyunoya T. Coleman M. Spitz D.R. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 7485-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Luminescence was measured on a TopCount NXT luminometer (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT) and quantitated to ATP standards. ADP/ATP ratios were determined using EnzyLightTM ADP/ATP ratio assay kit (BioAssay Systems). Acyl-CoAs were determined by on-line solid phase extraction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (36Magnes C. Suppan M. Pieber T.R. Moustafa T. Trauner M. Haemmerle G. Sinner F.M. Anal Chem. 2008; 80: 5736-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This method also allowed the separation and semiquantitative analysis of acylcarnitines. Acyl-CoAs (internal standards of 0.5 nmol/ml C17:0 CoA, 0.6 nmol/ml 13C2-acetyl-CoA, and 0.6 nmol/ml 13C3-malonyl-CoA) and acylcarnitines (internal standard of 0.5 nmol/ml C17–0 CoA) were extracted from the cell pellet using 0.5 ml of prechilled (4 °C) buffer (50% 0.1 m KH2PO4 and 50% 2-propanol). The cell suspension was homogenized on ice for 10–20 s using an ultrasonic homogenizer. Subsequently, 30 μl of saturated aqueous (NH4)2SO4 and 0.5 ml of acetonitrile were added. The homogenate was vigorously mixed and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to autosampler vials. Extracts were stored at −80 °C. Analyses were performed on an Ultimate 3000 System (Dionex, LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) consisting of an autosampler with cooled tray and a column oven with a switching unit coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). A Phenomenex Strata X 2.0 × 20-mm cartridge (Torrance, CA) and a Waters XBridge column (2.1 × 50 mm, 2.5 μm) (Milford, MA) were used for on-line solid phase extraction and as analytical column, respectively. Positive electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed by high resolution mass spectrometry (scan range 150–2000 m/z, resolution 60,000). Compound identities were confirmed using accurate mass, tandem mass spectrometry, and retention time. Peak area ratios of acylcarnitines were compared with C17:0 CoA for semiquantitative analysis. MPM of Atgl−/− and WT mice were plated in black 96-well μClear plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Solingen, Germany). After 24 h of preincubation in DMEM, 10% LPDS, and 25 mm glucose, cells were incubated in DMEM, 10% LPDS and 0, 6, or 25 mm glucose for 1 and 8 h, respectively. After washing the cells, 100 μl of fluorescein-labeled E. coli BioParticles® (VybrantTM Phagocytosis Assay, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution were added for 2 h. The suspension was then removed, and subsequently, 100 μl of trypan blue suspension was added for 1 min to quench the extracellular probe. After aspiration of trypan blue from experimental and control wells, the fluorescence was measured at 484 (excitation) and 535 nm (emission) on a Victor 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Phagocytosis was normalized to protein content in each well. To analyze phagocytosis in vivo, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of fluorescein-labeled E. coli BioParticles® (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. After 2 h, MPM were collected by flushing the peritoneal cavity with 10 ml of PBS plus 1 mm EDTA and incubated in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% LPDS for 90 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and the fluorescence was measured before and after adding trypan blue suspension to obtain total and intracellular fluorescence, respectively. Experimental readings were normalized to protein content. Yeast cells were cultured in potato dextrose broth for 48 h and autoclaved at 120 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then stored at 4 °C. Before use, the cells were sonicated for a short time and diluted to 108 cells/ml of DMEM. Atgl−/− and WT macrophages were plated on chamber slides and preincubated for 24 h in DMEM, 10% LPDS. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 8 h in DMEM, 10% LPDS media containing 0, 6, and 25 mm glucose, respectively. After incubation, yeast cells (∼108 cells/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h. Nonengulfed yeast cells were washed with PBS. One ml of 1% tannic acid solution was added for 1 min, and cells were then washed and air-dried. Cells were stained for 2 min with May-Grünwald stain freshly diluted with Giemsa buffer (1:2), washed with PBS, and dried. Cells were mounted in Vectashield medium plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Visualization of the images was performed on a TissueFAXS (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) assembled with an AxioImager.Z1 automated microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). Pictures (×63) were taken at 560 nm excitation/630 nm emission (Texas Red filter), and MPM nuclei were observed at 390 nm excitation/450 nm emission (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Statistical analyses in experiments, except for real time PCR analyses (see above), were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0. The significance was determined by Student's t test. Data with >2 groups or ≥2 of independent variables were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E. *, p < 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001. We investigated ATGL mRNA expression levels in macrophages and foam cells. Although less than in white adipose tissue, ATGL mRNA was expressed in both MPM and macrophage-derived foam cells. Foam cell formation was achieved after loading MPM with acLDL. ATGL mRNA levels in macrophages and foam cells were 11.2- and 15.5-fold increased compared with hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA (Fig. 1A). In accordance with mRNA levels, ATGL protein expression was comparable in macrophages and foam cells but markedly lower than in white adipose tissue. Concomitantly, we found less hormone-sensitive lipase protein in macrophages and foam cells compared with ATGL (Fig. 1B). ATGL mRNA was also significantly expressed in human monocyte-derived macrophages and foam cells (Fig. 1C). Human ATGL mRNA expression was markedly higher in primary cells than in THP1-derived macrophages and foam cells. TG hydrolase activity was determined in MPM isolated from WT and Atgl−/− mice. We verified the lack of ATGL in macrophages by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). TG hydrolase activity was significantly (−54%) decreased in Atgl−/− compared with WT MPM (Fig. 2B). Concomitantly, Atgl−/− MPM showed higher TG concentrations in MPM and acLDL-loaded foam cells (4.7- and 3.0-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, MPM of Atgl−/− and WT mice exhibited comparable CE hydrolase activities (Fig. 2D). Accordingly, intracellular total cholesterol, FC, and CE concentrations in MPM and foam cells of both genotypes were similar (Fig. 2E). Lipid droplets were visualized by electron microscopy in Atgl−/− and WT MPM and by fluorescence microscopy of Nile Red-stained WT and Atgl−/− MPM as well as in"
https://openalex.org/W2025976060,"There has been much interest in the chloroplast-encoded large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) as a target for engineering an increase in net CO(2) fixation in photosynthesis. Improvements in the enzyme would lead to an increase in the production of food, fiber, and renewable energy. Although the large subunit contains the active site, a family of rbcS nuclear genes encodes the Rubisco small subunits, which can also influence the carboxylation catalytic efficiency and CO(2)/O(2) specificity of the enzyme. To further define the role of the small subunit in Rubisco function, small subunits from spinach, Arabidopsis, and sunflower were assembled with algal large subunits by transformation of a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant that lacks the rbcS gene family. Foreign rbcS cDNAs were successfully expressed in Chlamydomonas by fusing them to a Chlamydomonas rbcS transit peptide sequence engineered to contain rbcS introns. Although plant Rubisco generally has greater CO(2)/O(2) specificity but a lower carboxylation V(max) than Chlamydomonas Rubisco, the hybrid enzymes have 3-11% increases in CO(2)/O(2) specificity and retain near normal V(max) values. Thus, small subunits may make a significant contribution to the overall catalytic performance of Rubisco. Despite having normal amounts of catalytically proficient Rubisco, the hybrid mutant strains display reduced levels of photosynthetic growth and lack chloroplast pyrenoids. It appears that small subunits contain the structural elements responsible for targeting Rubisco to the algal pyrenoid, which is the site where CO(2) is concentrated for optimal photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973728299,"Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a major mediator of physiological glutamate signaling involved in higher brain functions. Here, we show CaMKII involvement in pathological glutamate signaling relevant in stroke. The novel inhibitor tatCN21 was neuroprotective even when added hours after glutamate insults. By contrast, the ""traditional"" inhibitor KN93 attenuated excitotoxicity only when present during the insult. Both inhibitors efficiently blocked Ca(2+)/CaM-stimulated CaMKII activity, CaMKII interaction with NR2B and aggregation of CaMKII holoenzymes. However, only tatCN21 but not KN93 blocked the Ca(2+)-independent ""autonomous"" activity generated by Thr-286 autophosphorylation, the hallmark feature of CaMKII regulation. Mutational analysis further validated autonomous CaMKII activity as the drug target crucial for post-insult neuroprotection. Overexpression of CaMKII wild type but not the autonomy-deficient T286A mutant significantly increased glutamate-induced neuronal death. Maybe most importantly, tatCN21 also significantly reduced infarct size in a mouse stroke model (middle cerebral arterial occlusion) when injected (1 mg/kg intravenously) 1 h after onset of arterial occlusion. Together, these data demonstrate that inhibition of autonomous CaMKII activity provides a promising therapeutic avenue for post-insult neuro-protection after stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2172153608,"Background There is current interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumor-induced bone pain. Accumulated evidence shows that endogenous formaldehyde concentrations are elevated in the blood or urine of patients with breast, prostate or bladder cancer. These cancers are frequently associated with cancer pain especially after bone metastasis. It is well known that transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) participates in cancer pain. The present study aims to demonstrate that the tumor tissue-derived endogenous formaldehyde induces bone cancer pain via TRPV1 activation under tumor acidic environment. Methodology/Principal Findings Endogenous formaldehyde concentration increased significantly in the cultured breast cancer cell lines in vitro, in the bone marrow of breast MRMT-1 bone cancer pain model in rats and in tissues from breast cancer and lung cancer patients in vivo. Low concentrations (1∼5 mM) of formaldehyde induced pain responses in rat via TRPV1 and this pain response could be significantly enhanced by pH 6.0 (mimicking the acidic tumor microenvironment). Formaldehyde at low concentrations (1 mM to 100 mM) induced a concentration-dependent increase of [Ca2+]i in the freshly isolated rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and TRPV1-transfected CHO cells. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments showed that low concentration formaldehyde-elicited TRPV1 currents could be significantly potentiated by low pH (6.0). TRPV1 antagonists and formaldehyde scavengers attenuated bone cancer pain responses. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that cancer tissues directly secrete endogenous formaldehyde, and this formaldehyde at low concentration induces metastatic bone cancer pain through TRPV1 activation especially under tumor acidic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2016500227,"Proper execution of chromosome segregation relies on tight control of attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. This is monitored by the mitotic checkpoint that allows chromosome segregation only when all chromosomes are stably attached. Proper functioning of the attachment and checkpoint processes is thus important to prevent chromosomal instability. Both processes rely on the mitotic kinase Mps1.We present here two cell lines in which endogenous Mps1 has been stably replaced with a mutant kinase (Mps1-as) that is specifically inhibited by bulky PP1 analogs. Mps1 inhibition in these cell lines is highly penetrant and reversible. Timed inhibition during bipolar spindle assembly shows that Mps1 is critical for attachment error-correction and confirms its role in Aurora B regulation. We furthermore show that Mps1 has multiple controls over mitotic checkpoint activity. Mps1 inhibition precludes Mad1 localization to unattached kinetochores but also accelerates mitosis. This acceleration correlates with absence of detectable mitotic checkpoint complex after Mps1 inhibition. Finally, we show that short-term inhibition of Mps1 catalytic activity is sufficient to kill cells.Mps1 is involved in the regulation of multiple key processes that ensure correct chromosome segregation and is a promising target for inhibition in anti-cancer strategies. We report here two cell lines that allow specific and highly penetrant inhibition of Mps1 in a reproducible manner through the use of chemical genetics. Using these cell lines we confirm previously suggested roles for Mps1 activity in mitosis, present evidence for novel functions and examine cell viability after short and prolonged Mps1 inhibition. These cell lines present the best cellular model system to date for investigations into Mps1 biology and the effects of penetrance and duration of Mps1 inhibition on cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W2035191293,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the United States. Modest advances with therapeutic approaches that include oxaliplatin (L-OHP) have brought the median survival rate to 22 months, with drug resistance remaining a significant barrier. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is undergoing clinical evaluation. Although human colon carcinomas express TRAIL receptors, they can also demonstrate TRAIL resistance. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation has been implicated in resistance to TRAIL and to cytotoxic agents. We have demonstrated constitutive NF-kappaB activation in five of six human colon carcinoma cell lines; this activation is inhibited by quinacrine. Quinacrine induced apoptosis in colon carcinomas and potentiated the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL in RKO and HT29 cells and that of L-OHP in HT29 cells. Similarly, overexpression of IkappaBalpha mutant (IkappaBalphaM) or treatment with the IKK inhibitor, BMS-345541, also sensitized these cells to TRAIL and L-OHP. Importantly, 2 h of quinacrine pretreatment resulted in decreased expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1, which were determined to be transcriptional targets of NF-kappaB. Extended exposure for 24 h to quinacrine did not further sensitize these cells to TRAIL- or L-OHP-induced cell death; however, exposure caused the down-regulation of additional NF-kappaB-dependent survival factors. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of c-FLIP or Mcl-1 significantly sensitized these cells to TRAIL and L-OHP. Taken together, data demonstrate that NF-kappaB is constitutively active in colon cancer cell lines and NF-kappaB, and its downstream targets may constitute an important target for the development of therapeutic approaches against this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070909262,"Epidermal growth factors and their receptors (EGFRs) promote breast cancer cell proliferation and can drive tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these effects are incompletely understood. We previously showed that mammary tumor development in the mouse model of breast cancer MMTV-neu, a model characterized by amplification of the EGFR ErbB2 in mammary tissue, correlates with a marked up-regulation of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5). FABP5 functions to deliver ligands to and enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ), a receptor whose target genes include genes involved in cell growth and survival. We show here that in MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells, EGFR signaling directly up-regulates the expression of FABP5. The data demonstrate that treatment of these cells with the EGFR ligand heregulin-β1 signals through the ERK and the phophatidylinositol-3-kinase cascades, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. In turn, NF-κB induces the expression of FABP5 through two cognate response elements in the promoter of this gene. The observations further demonstrate that FABP5 and PPARβ/δ are critical mediators of the ability of EGFR to enhance cell proliferation, indicating that this transcriptional pathway plays a key role in EGFR-induced tumorigenesis. Additional observations indicate that the expression of FABP5 is down-regulated by the Krüppel-like factor KLF2, suggesting a tumor suppressor activity for this factor.

https://openalex.org/W2145069182,"We recently reported that the small G-protein Rhes has the properties of a SUMO-E3 ligase and mediates mutant huntingtin (mHtt) cytotoxicity. We now demonstrate that Rhes is a physiologic regulator of sumoylation, which is markedly reduced in the corpus striatum of Rhes-deleted mice. Sumoylation involves activation and transfer of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) from the thioester of E1 to the thioester of Ubc9 (E2) and final transfer to lysines on target proteins, which is enhanced by E3s. We show that E1 transfers SUMO from its thioester directly to lysine residues on Ubc9, forming isopeptide linkages. Conversely, sumoylation on E1 requires transfer of SUMO from the thioester of Ubc9. Thus, the process regarded as ""autosumoylation"" reflects intermolecular transfer between E1 and Ubc9, which we designate ""cross-sumoylation."" Rhes binds directly to both E1 and Ubc9, enhancing cross-sumoylation as well as thioester transfer from E1 to Ubc9."
https://openalex.org/W2117921160,"The two-component BvrR/BvrS system is essential for Brucella abortus virulence. It was shown previously that its dysfunction alters the expression of some major outer membrane proteins and the pattern of lipid A acylation. To determine the genes regulated by BvrR/BvrS, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis using B. abortus RNA obtained from wild type and bvrR mutant cells grown in the same conditions.A total of 127 differentially expressed genes were found: 83 were over expressed and 44 were less expressed in the bvrR mutant. Two operons, the phosphotransferase system and the maltose transport system, were down-regulated. Several genes involved in cell envelope or outer membrane biogenesis were differentially expressed: genes for outer membrane proteins (omp25a, omp25d), lipoproteins, LPS and fatty acid biosynthesis, stress response proteins, chaperones, flagellar genes, and twelve genes encoding ABC transport systems. Ten genes related with carbon metabolism (pckA and fumB among others) were up-regulated in the bvrR mutant, and denitrification genes (nirK, norC and nosZ) were also regulated. Notably, seven transcriptional regulators were affected, including VjbR, ExoR and OmpR that were less expressed in the bvrR mutant. Finally, the expression of eleven genes which have been previously related with Brucella virulence was also altered.All these data corroborate the impact of BvrR/BvrS on cell envelope modulation, confirm that this system controls the carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and suggest a cross-talk among some regulators to adjust the Brucella physiology to the shift expected to occur during the transit from the extracellular to the intracellular niche."
https://openalex.org/W2075841017,"Background Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7, a food and waterborne pathogen, can be classified into nine phylogenetically distinct lineages, as determined by single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. One lineage (clade 8) was found to be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to kidney failure and death in some cases, particularly young children. Another lineage (clade 2) differs considerably in gene content and is phylogenetically distinct from clade 8, but caused significantly fewer cases of HUS in a prior study. Little is known, however, about how these two lineages vary with regard to phenotypic traits important for disease pathogenesis and in the expression of shared virulence genes. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we quantified the level of adherence to and invasion of MAC-T bovine epithelial cells, and examined the transcriptomes of 24 EHEC O157:H7 strains with varying Shiga toxin profiles from two common lineages. Adherence to epithelial cells was >2-fold higher for EHEC O157:H7 strains belonging to clade 8 versus clade 2, while no difference in invasiveness was observed between the two lineages. Whole-genome 70-mer oligo microarrays, which probe for 6088 genes from O157:H7 Sakai, O157:H7 EDL 933, pO157, and K12 MG1655, detected significant differential expression between clades in 604 genes following co-incubation with epithelial cells for 30 min; 186 of the 604 genes had a >1.5 fold change difference. Relative to clade 2, clade 8 strains showed upregulation of major virulence genes, including 29 of the 41 locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island genes, which are critical for adherence, as well as Shiga toxin genes and pO157 plasmid-encoded virulence genes. Differences in expression of 16 genes that encode colonization factors, toxins, and regulators were confirmed by qRT-PCR, which revealed a greater magnitude of change than microarrays. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate that the EHEC O157:H7 lineage associated with HUS expresses higher levels of virulence genes and has an enhanced ability to attach to epithelial cells relative to another common lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2094290427,"Cane toads Bufo marinus were introduced to Australia as a control agent but now have a rapidly progressing invasion front and damage new habitats they enter. Predictive models that can give expansion rates as functions of energy supply and feeding ground distribution could help to maximise control efficiency but to date no study has measured rates of field energy expenditure in an amphibian. In the present study we used the accelerometry technique to generate behavioural time budgets and, through the derivation of ODBA (overall dynamic body acceleration), to obtain estimates of energetics in free ranging cane toads. This represents the first time that accelerometers have been used to not only quantify the behaviour of animals but also assign to those behaviours rates of energy expenditure. Firstly, laboratory calibrations between ODBA and metabolic rate were obtained and used to generate a common prediction equation for the subject toads (R2 = 0.74). Furthermore, acceleration data recorded during different behaviours was studied to ascertain threshold values for objectively defining behaviour categories. Importantly, while subsequent accelerometer field deployments were relatively short they agreed with previous studies on the proportion of time that cane toads locomote yet suggest that the metabolic rate of cane toads in the wild may sometimes be considerably higher than might be assumed based on data for other species."
https://openalex.org/W2073975357,"Background Endocytosis is a key regulatory step of diverse signalling pathways, including receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling. Hrs and Stam constitute the ESCRT-0 complex that controls the initial selection of ubiquitinated proteins, which will subsequently be degraded in lysosomes. It has been well established ex vivo and during Drosophila embryogenesis that Hrs promotes EGFR down regulation. We have recently isolated the first mutations of stam in flies and shown that Stam is required for air sac morphogenesis, a larval respiratory structure whose formation critically depends on finely tuned levels of FGFR activity. This suggest that Stam, putatively within the ESCRT-0 complex, modulates FGF signalling, a possibility that has not been examined in Drosophila yet. Principal Findings Here, we assessed the role of the Hrs/Stam complex in the regulation of signalling activity during Drosophila development. We show that stam and hrs are required for efficient FGFR signalling in the tracheal system, both during cell migration in the air sac primordium and during the formation of fine cytoplasmic extensions in terminal cells. We find that stam and hrs mutant cells display altered FGFR/Btl localisation, likely contributing to impaired signalling levels. Electron microscopy analyses indicate that endosome maturation is impaired at distinct steps by hrs and stam mutations. These somewhat unexpected results prompted us to further explore the function of stam and hrs in EGFR signalling. We show that while stam and hrs together downregulate EGFR signalling in the embryo, they are required for full activation of EGFR signalling during wing development. Conclusions/Significance Our study shows that the ESCRT-0 complex differentially regulates RTK signalling, either positively or negatively depending on tissues and developmental stages, further highlighting the importance of endocytosis in modulating signalling pathways during development."
https://openalex.org/W2166531529,"Background Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are nuclear receptors highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and immune cells within the gut mucosa and are implicated in modulating inflammation and immune responses. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of targeted deletion of PPAR γ in IEC on progression of experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methodology/Principal Findings In the first phase, PPAR γ flfl; Villin Cre- (VC-) and PPAR γ flfl; Villin Cre+ (VC+) mice in a mixed FVB/C57BL/6 background were challenged with 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 0, 2, or 7 days. VC+ mice express a transgenic recombinase under the control of the Villin-Cre promoter that causes an IEC-specific deletion of PPAR γ. In the second phase, we generated VC- and VC+ mice in a C57BL/6 background that were challenged with 2.5% DSS. Mice were scored on disease severity both clinically and histopathologically. Flow cytometry was used to phenotypically characterize lymphocyte and macrophage populations in blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Global gene expression analysis was profiled using Affymetrix microarrays. The IEC-specific deficiency of PPAR γ in mice with a mixed background worsened colonic inflammatory lesions, but had no effect on disease activity (DAI) or weight loss. In contrast, the IEC-specific PPAR γ null mice in C57BL/6 background exhibited more severe inflammatory lesions, DAI and weight loss in comparison to their littermates expressing PPAR γ in IEC. Global gene expression profiling revealed significantly down-regulated expression of lysosomal pathway genes and flow cytometry results demonstrated suppressed production of IL-10 by CD4+ T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of IEC-specific PPAR γ null mice. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that adequate expression of PPAR γ in IEC is required for the regulation of mucosal immune responses and prevention of experimental IBD, possibly by modulation of lysosomal and antigen presentation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2069903037,"Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder of music processing that is currently ascribed to a deficit in pitch processing. A recent study challenges this view and claims the disorder might arise as a consequence of a general spatial-processing deficit. Here, we assessed spatial processing abilities in two independent samples of individuals with congenital amusia by using line bisection tasks (Experiment 1) and a mental rotation task (Experiment 2). Both amusics and controls showed the classical spatial effects on bisection performance and on mental rotation performance, and amusics and controls did not differ from each other. These results indicate that the neurocognitive impairment of congenital amusia does not affect the processing of space."
https://openalex.org/W1965521081,"Although genetics is the most significant known determinant of human intelligence, specific gene contributions remain largely unknown. To accelerate understanding in this area, we have taken a new approach by studying the relationship between quantitative gene expression and intelligence in a cohort of 65 patients with Williams Syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a 1.5 Mb deletion on chromosome 7q11.23. We find that variation in the transcript levels of the brain gene STX1A correlates significantly with intelligence in WS patients measured by principal component analysis (PCA) of standardized WAIS-R subtests, r = 0.40 (Pearson correlation, Bonferroni corrected p-value = 0.007), accounting for 15.6% of the cognitive variation. These results suggest that syntaxin 1A, a neuronal regulator of presynaptic vesicle release, may play a role in WS and be a component of the cellular pathway determining human intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W1965063755,"Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive cancers and its incidence worldwide has been increasing at a greater rate than that of any other cancer. We previously reported that constitutively activated RFP-RET-carrying transgenic mice (RET-mice) spontaneously develop malignant melanoma. In this study, we showed that expression levels of intrinsic c-Ret, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) and Gdnf receptor alpha 1 (Gfra1) transcripts in malignant melanomas from RET-transgenic mice were significantly upregulated compared with those in benign melanocytic tumors. These results suggest that not only introduced oncogenic RET but also intrinsic c-Ret/Gdnf are involved in murine melanomagenesis in RET-mice. We then showed that c-RET and GDNF transcript expression levels in human malignant melanoma cell lines (HM3KO and MNT-1) were higher than those in primary cultured normal human epithelial melanocytes (NHEM), while GFRa1 transcript expression levels were comparable among NHEM, HM3KO and MNT-1. We next showed c-RET and GFRa1 protein expression in HM3KO cells and GDNF-mediated increased levels of their phosphorylated c-RET tyrosine kinase and signal transduction molecules (ERK and AKT) sited potentially downstream of c-RET. Taken together with the finding of augmented proliferation of HM3KO cells after GDNF stimulation, our results suggest that GDNF-mediated c-RET kinase activation is associated with the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma."

In cultured kidney cells, hypotonicity is thought to activate TRPV4 through the production of 5′,6′-EET, possibly by activating phospholipase A2 (16Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). There must be other mechanisms by which TRPV4 is activated by hypotonicity, since it maintains robust hypotonic activation when expressed in yeast, which is incapable of synthesizing polyunsaturated fatty acids such as AA and its metabolites (17Loukin S.H. Su Z. Kung C. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TRPV4 is expressed in a broad range of tissue types that have varying physiological relevance (18Nilius B.

In an attempt to further understand the structure/function relationship of TRPV4 we used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to select for non-targeted mutations that alter gating. We have previously used such a strategy to successfully uncover gating mutants in bacterial mechanosensitive channels (23Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the native yeast potassium channel Tok1 (24Loukin S.H. Vaillant B. Zhou X.L. Spalding E.P. Kung C. Saimi Y.

Neuron. 2008; 58: 362-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) used a similar strategy to isolate several diverse GOF alleles of TRPV1. Focusing on one class of mutants found in that screen, it was determined that the pore helix of TRPV1 (as well as TRPV2) plays a critical role in the gating of that channel, possibly as a gating entity itself. In the present study, only a limited number of GOF mutations in TRPV4 caused severe growth-suppressing phenotype. Examination and consideration of these mutants suggest the existence of multiple gating mechanisms in TRPV4. Error-prone PCR was used to amplify the open reading frame of rat TRPV4 (NM_023970) using standard low-fidelity Taq polymerase from a plasmid generously provided by Dr. W. Liedtke (10Liedtke W. Choe Y. Martí-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S.

Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) using standard techniques. Several random clones were sequenced and found to have on average one to two nucleotide substitutions per open-reading frame; primarily transitions, but transversions were also encountered. Approximately 106 bacterial transformants were pooled, plasmids were isolated, and retransformed into the yeast strain BY4742 derivative, BYYT (MATα, his3Δ,1 leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, tok1::KanMX4, yvc1::HIS3). Approximately 40,000 yeast transformants resulted, which were pooled and replated at ∼200 CFU/plate all on a repressive dextrose-based CMD ura− medium (28Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). This entire procedure starting from the initial PCR was repeated in duplicate to generate two independent pools of screened plasmids. Colonies were replica-plated onto plates of expressive (galactose-, raffinose-based) CMGR ura− plated, and colonies were isolated that grew well on CMD but very poorly on CMGR. Strains that grew poorly due to genomic defects were weeded out by discarding those that failed to form polyps when uracil was added back to the CMGR plate. Plasmids were isolated from the remaining strains by standard techniques and both sequenced and re-transformed into fresh BYYT yeast to verify that the phenotype is plasmid-borne. TRPV4 open-reading frames were sequenced using Big Dye sequencing reagents (Applied Biosystems) and processed at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center DNA sequence facility. Selected GOF alleles were PCR amplified using high-fidelity PfuUltra polymerase (Stratagene) and integrated into pGH19 for synthesis of cRNA (24Loukin S.H. Vaillant B. Zhou X.L. Spalding E.P. Kung C. Saimi Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4817-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). cRNA was synthesized from Xho1-linearized templates using a mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion). Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 40 nl of diluted RNA solutions. Because expression of the GOF alleles was toxic to oocytes, 1 μm ruthenium red (Sigma) was added to the ND96 incubation buffer (29Goldin A.L. Rudy B.I. Methods in Enzymology. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar) in all cases. Conductances, particularly those of wild-type-expressing oocytes, increased over the course of several days, and currents were measured after 1–5 days depending on experimental requirements. Two-electrode recording was performed using HS2A headstages and a VG-2A×100 virtual bath clamp connected to a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier interfaced through a Digidata 1440A digitizer acquired using pClamp10 software (all Axon Instruments). The base bath solution contained 66 mm KCl, 100 mm sorbitol, 1.8 mm BaCl2, and 5 mm K+-HEPES pH 7.2 (all from Sigma). 3 μm 4αPDD (Sigma) or 10 μm 5′6′-EET (Biomol) were added directly to the bath chamber. Sorbitol was omitted from the hypotonic solutions. Data were analyzed using both pClamp10 and Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS software). We have successfully expressed rat TRPV4 in yeast (17Loukin S.H. Su Z. Kung C. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In an attempt to isolate rTRPV4 mutants that interfere with channel-gating, we screened for GOF mutants that inhibit yeast growth under the assumption that hyperactive channels that could not gate properly and leak ions would be toxic. Plasmids containing mutagenized rTRPV4 open-reading frames under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (27Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) were transformed into yeast, and colonies were allowed to form under repressive conditions (dextrose plates). Colonies were isolated that failed to proliferate when replicated onto galactose plates due to the presence of the plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two independent mutageneses and screenings were conducted to assess mutagenic saturation. Bona fide toxic plasmids were rare, occurring at a frequency of less than 0.1% out of ∼20,000 colonies screened. The TRPV4 blocker ruthenium red restored growth under inducing conditions (Fig. 1A), indicating that it is excessive channel conductance and not some other facet of expression that is toxic. In the first screen, five growth-inhibiting alleles were identified. They included W733R (Fig. 1B, 6), L619P (2), L623P (3), M713I (4), and a double R151Q/D546G (1) substitutions. The R151Q/D456G mutant had a weaker growth inhibiting phenotype than the other GOF mutants (Fig. 1A), and in separate experiments it was found that R151Q alone did not inhibit growth (data not shown), making it likely that D456G is the effective mutation. In the second screen, three growth-blocking alleles were isolated, W733R, M713V (5), and M713I. The repeated isolation of W733R and M713I from the two independent screens indicates that the screen is at least near saturation. This conclusion is corroborated by the isolation of multiple aliphatic substitutions at Met-713 (Ile, Val) as well as the similar nature of L619P and L623P, indicating that not many alleles are capable of significantly blocking yeast proliferation. It is notable that 5 of 6 of these mutations occur in or near the predicted S5/S6 channel core (Fig. 1B). M713I and Val occur right at the predicted cytoplasmic end of S6, and W733R occurs 20 amino acids downstream. L619P and L623P both are predicted to cause kinks in the cytoplasmic half of the S5 helix at points that are approximately one helical turn apart (Fig. 1B). The location of these mutations strongly suggests that they directly affect the channel main intracellular gate (see “Discussion”). TRPV4 alleles were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for electrophysiological analysis. We focused on selected GOF alleles in the channel core, which had the stronger growth-inhibiting phenotypes: the S5 kink mutant L619P, M713I at the end of S6, and W733R, 20 residues downstream. For a negative control, we also expressed a M680K, a mutation engineered into the channel presumptive filter that disrupts ion permeation (30Liedtke W. Tobin D.M. Bargmann C.I. Friedman J.M. Proc.

Expression of the yeast-selected GOF alleles was toxic to oocytes as well, with the majority of the oocytes injected with ∼10 ng of L619P or M713I cRNA dying within 24 h after injection. Wild-type cRNA was also toxic, but to a much lesser extent. It was indeed TRPV4 channel activity that was responsible for this toxicity, because the addition of 1 μm ruthenium red to the oocyte incubation medium alleviated this toxicity and was added to all subsequent oocyte incubations for the sake of consistency. Oocytes injected with moderate amounts (∼1 ng) of wild-type TRPV4 cRNA and incubated from 1 to 3 days produced currents that were largely dependent upon the application of the potent agonist 4αPDD (15Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). 4αPDD activation was slow, requiring several minutes to become apparent after application of 3 μm and did not reach saturation even after 30 min. 4αPDD activation was irreversible, with removal from the bath only preventing further current increase. This stands in contrast to 4αPDD activation in TRPV4 expressed in cultured mammalian cells, where currents rapidly inactivate even when 4αPDD is maintained (32Watanabe H. Vriens J. Janssens A. Wondergem R. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Ruthenium red partially blocked the outward currents as expected (data not shown, but see Fig. 3). The non-conducting M680K channel (30Liedtke W. Tobin D.M. Bargmann C.I. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14531-14536Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) did not produce such currents, even when the cRNA was injected at a 5-fold excess (Fig. 2B). We were not able to activate oocyte-expressed wild-type TRPV4 with 5′,6′-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (data not shown) in whole oocyte two-electrode recordings, which activates TRPV4 expressed in cultured cells (12Watanabe H. Vriens J. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Hypotonicity does not further activate GOF channels. Hypotonic response from oocytes expressing high levels of wild-type (A, D), M713I (B), or L619P (C) cRNA was elicited by removal of 100 mm sorbitol from the 250 mOsm bath solutions. Responses were measured by repeated 250-ms pulses to +20 mV from −20 mV hold every 10 s. Insets in the upper right are the raw traces of the initial hypotonic response. The main figures plot the peak response occurring at the end of the +20-mV pulse during the initial hypotonic perfusion (hypo), restoration of 100 mm sorbitol (iso), and repeat of the hypotonic perfusion in the presence of 3 μm ruthenium red. In D, wild-type expressing oocytes were pre-incubated in 3 μm 4 αPDD for 1 h. The calibration bar for all the main figures is at the top, and 0-current levels are indicated by the solid horizontal line in each figure (neither applies to the insets).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, injection of ∼10-fold lesser amounts (∼100 pg) of M713I (Fig. 2C), L619P (2D), or W733R (data not shown) cRNA induced larger currents that were not further stimulated by 4αPDD application to a substantial degree. Both the GOF and wild-type channels displayed strong outward rectification (Fig. 2, bottom row). In other words, a gating mechanism that closes the channel in response to lack of agonist is defective but that which closes in response to negative voltage remains intact in these mutants. This rectification was not due to a block of inward currents by residual ruthenium red carried over from the oocyte incubation buffer as evidenced by the fact that GOF channels expressed at low (subtoxic) levels incubated without ruthenium red also rectified (data not shown). Furthermore, these channels are quite capable of conducting inward currents as evidenced by transient tail currents observed upon repolarization (e.g. see Fig. 5, below). TRPV4 is also activated by hypotonic stress (9Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 10Liedtke W. Choe Y. Martí-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), and the wild-type channel maintains this response in oocytes (33Güler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of inert osmoticum from the bath resulted in a large reversible increase in current (Fig. 3A, left, center, and inset). This response could be elicited multiple times from the same oocyte (data not shown). That this activity is due to TRPV4 is verified by the fact that it did not occur in oocytes injected with M680K cRNA (data not shown) and did not occur when ruthenium red was included with the hypotonic stimulus (Fig. 3A, right). As was the case with 4αPDD, GOF channels appear to be pre-activated with respect to hypotonic stimulus as well. Significant conductance through these channels occurs before hypotonic stimulus, does not increase during hypotonic stimulus, and is blockable by ruthenium red (Fig. 3, B and C). This provides further evidence that the defect in the GOF mutants is directly in the intracellular gate itself, as it has previously been shown that hypotonicity and 4αPDD activate channel gating through distinct pathways (16Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The currents from wild-type-expressing oocytes preincubated in 4αPDD for 1 h show an intermediate response to hypotonicity between that of untreated wild type and the GOF currents (Fig. 3D). It should be noted that the 4αPDD response did not saturate even after 1 h, and further incubations were increasingly toxic. That 4αPDD and mutation have the same general effect on hypotonic gating supports the conclusion that the GOF channel is in a state analogous to that induced by 4αPDD application. When high levels of cRNA are injected and/or longer incubation times are employed, enough channel expression occurs such that wild-type currents can be analyzed in the absence of 4αPDD or hypotonicity. During depolarization, these currents clearly show an inactivation-like behavior (Fig. 4A, left, note the longer test duration and deeper holding potentials than employed in Fig. 1). M713I (Fig. 4A, middle) and L619P (data not shown) display almost none of this inactivation behavior. Likewise, wild-type-expressing oocytes preincubated in 4αPDD have strongly reduced inactivation. The level of inactivation can be roughly quantified by measuring peak response upon depolarization to a common test from varying holds (Fig. 4B). Note that this will underestimate the true extent of inactivation in the wild-type channel because it starts to inactivate before the true peak conductance is reached. As can be seen, wild-type conductances are highly dependent on the holding potential, M713I and L619P channels have little dependence, and 4αPDD-treated wild-type channels have intermediate behavior (Fig. 4C, note a high level of variability in the 4αPDD-treated response, likely due to variability in the extent of 4αPDD saturation, see above). That the GOF channels lack inactivation suggests that it is also due to closure of the main intracellular gate as considered in the “Discussion” below. As mentioned above, GOF channels still clearly possess the ability to gate, permitting only significant outward yet little or no inward current at steady state. It has previously been reported that the rectification of TRPV4 is due to a voltage-dependent block of the predominant monovalent current by external Ca2+ ions (5Voets T. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15223-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ca2+ was replaced with Ba2+ in all experiments described here to avoid activation of the native oocyte Ca2+-dependent Cl− current (34Barish M.E. J. Physiol. 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Ba2+ removal had little effect on steady-state outward rectification, slightly increasing outward, and, at most, nominally increasing inward currents in both wild-type and GOF channels (Fig. 5A). Ba2+ does indeed partially block inward currents, as evidenced by the much larger tail currents upon repolarization in Ba2+-free conditions, e.g. compare inward tails in the presence of Ba2+ (e.g. Fig. 4A) to those in its absence (Fig. 5B). Mg2+ could substitute for Ba2+ in reducing tail current magnitude upon repolarization (data not shown), indicating a general divalent ion blockage of monovalent conductance. It should be noted that in earlier works, Ca2+-dependent rectification was generally assessed by brief ramps from neutral holds (31Voets T. Prenen J. Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33704-33710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Watanabe H. Vriens J. Janssens A. Wondergem R. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which would not reflect steady-state behavior under such conditions. Divalent block is not responsible for the steady-state rectification, however. To assess whether there was a significant change in the nature of the voltage-dependent closed state of wild type and those of the GOF mutants, activation, and deactivation kinetics were measured. Generally, two time constants were required to fit activations to peak from −80 hold to +60 mV test. The composite activation time constants were similar, being 20 ± 14 ms (weighted avg. ± std, n = 10 oocytes) for untreated wild-type, 21 ± 8 ms (n = 10) for wild-type channels pretreated with 4αPDD, 23 ± 14 ms (n = 10) for M713I and 23 ± 19 ms (n = 10) for L619P. Despite substantial oocyte-to-oocyte variance, wild-type channels activate at a similar rate to either PDD-stimulated or mutant channels upon depolarization. Conglomerate deactivation rates from +60 to −80 mV were however distinct, being 230 ± 60 ms (n = 16) for wild-type, 730 ± 260 ms (n = 12) for 4αPDD-treated wild-type, 850 ± 210 ms (n = 8) for M713I, 802 ± 316 ms (n = 21) for L619P-expressing oocytes. The majority of the increase in the wild-type rate was due to the appearance of a fast decay (65 ± 17 ms) of about half the current (wild-type deactivations generally required an extra component to fit adequately). Thus wild type, both 4αPDD treated and untreated, and GOF channels activate at nearly the same rate upon depolarization but a significant fraction of the wild-type currents deactivate more rapidly upon repolarization. In an unbiased screen for TRPV4 mutants that blocked yeast growth, we identified a limited number of alleles that encode hyperactive GOF channels. These GOF mutants are not further activated by hypotonic stimulation nor by 4αPDD application and lack voltage-dependent inactivation observed in wild-type channels. As discussed here, we conclude that hypotonic, 4αPDD, and possibly inactivation gating result from closure of the main intracellular gate. Curiously though, these GOF channels maintain robust steady-state outward rectification indicating the existence of an additional gating mechanism. Four of six isolated GOF alleles had mutations that would be predicted to directly affect the intracellular gate. Based on topological prediction and the known structure of K+ channels (3Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), M713I and Val are predicted to be at or near the bundle crossing of the closed intracellular gate. L619P and L623P would both be predicted to cause kinks in the lower half of the S5 helix that would have significant effects on this intracellular gate as well, because the S5 and S6 helices are presumably in intimate contact throughout (3Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). The location of these mutations alone is strong evidence that the specific defect is in the functioning of the intracellular gate itself. The GOFs no longer respond to either 4αPDD or hypotonicity, which have previously been shown to open the channel gate through distinct pathways (16Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). These observations further support the conclusion that the defect caused by these mutants is in intracellular gating itself as opposed to upstream events. The genetic term gain-of-function refers to the measurable phenotype, in this case ensemble conductance. In a mechanistic sense, though, gating control is lost rather than gained. Although it is possible that the open state has been hyperstabilized in the mutants, it is far more likely that the closed conformation has been destabilized based on the simple fact that mutations usually destabilize protein structure (35Tokuriki N. Tawfik D.S. Nature. 2009; 459: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). That 4αPDD could partially mimic these mutations in all respects support the conclusion that the intracellular gates are in essence in a chronically stimulated open state in the GOF mutants. Despite the conclusion that their intracellular gates are unable to stably close, the GOF channels maintain the ability to efficiently close in the face of negative membrane potential. At least three broad types of mechanisms could account for this. First is that negative voltage also closes the intracellular gate similar to lack of 4αPDD or hypotonicity, but that voltage has a much greater energetic contribution such that it can overcome any closed-state instability caused by GOF mutation. This seems unlikely. There is no detectable change in the opening rate between the mutant and wild-type channels upon depolarization and only a ∼3-fold difference in the deactivation rate. If the closed conformation of the intracellular gate was so destabilized to the extent that the absence of potent activators such as 4αPDD could not encourage distribution into it, a substantial slowing of the deactivation and/or hastening of the activation rates upon voltage steps would be expected. Furthermore, TRPV4 has at best a remnant S4 voltage sensor (18Nilius B. Watanabe H. Vriens J. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with only two charged residues at the less important cytoplasmic end of S4 (36Swartz K.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Such a sensor would not be predicted to have particularly strong energetic contributions toward gating. A second possibility is that the voltage-dependent gating indeed results from a closure of the intracellular gate, but the contact points of the voltage-closed state are very different than those of the 4αPDD/hypotonicity closed states, and the GOFs isolated here only interfere with the latter. That depolarization activation rates are not, and repolarization deactivation rates are only mildly affected by GOF mutation similarly argue against this model, and it would furthermore be very difficult to envision how both the S5-kink mutants would have such surgical effects on individual closed state stabilities. Given the problematic nature of both these models that rely on voltage-dependent closure of the intracellular gate, we conclude that the robust steady-state outward rectification that remains intact in the GOF mutants is not due to the activity of the intracellular gate, but another distinct gating process. Although this work does not provide direct evidence as to what the nature of the voltage-dependent gate might be, constraints exist. It has been proposed that rectification of TRPV4 is due to blockage by external Ca2+ ions. We indeed found that Ba2+ (and Mg2+) partially blocks inward tail currents, but these currents eventually decay even in their absence demonstrating the existence of a steady-state gating mechanism not dependent on divalent block. It is notable that rectification in previous works was often assessed by fast voltage ramps from neutral holds (31Voets T. Prenen J. Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Wissenbach U. Bödding M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33704-33710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Watanabe H. Vriens J. Janssens A. Wondergem R. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and thus the lack of rectification in the absence of divalent ions may simply have reflected increased transient inward current, but not ultimate steady-state behavior. Two other attractive candidates for the voltage dependent gating would be a filter-gating mechanism or an intrinsic or extrinsic anionic block of the inner pore. There is evidence that the filter region plays an important role in the gating of the closely related TRPV1 channel (26Myers B.R. Bohlen C.J. Julius D. Neuron. 2008; 58: 362-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Ryu S. Liu B. Yao J. Fu Q. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12797-12807Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and filter region gating underlies C-type inactivation in other cation channels (38Kiss L. LoTurco J. Korn S.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). If such a mechanism is at play here, then it is tempting to speculate that voltage is not directly controlling gating but instead the direction of the driving force (i.e. the filter collapses or by some other mechanism becomes non-conducting when the net ionic flow is inward). We have proposed such a mechanism for the outward rectification of the yeast K+ channel Tok1 (39Loukin S.H. Saimi Y. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3060-3070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Alternatively, voltage-dependent gating could result from blockage of the inner pore by residence of an anionic-blocking entity in response to a negative voltage field. This could be akin to an N-type ball-and-chain inactivation mechanism (although N-type inactivation is not directly voltage dependent) or reflect blockage by an extrinsic factor. An appealing aspect of this model is that it could neatly account for the lack of inactivation in the GOF channels, if it was presumed that inactivation was the result of a stochastic closure of the main intracellular gate (lacking in the GOF mutants) in response to inner pore evacuation of the blocking entity upon depolarization. The present work focuses on mutations near the main intracellular gate (Fig. 1). The remainder of the mutations harvested from the yeast screen as well as recently discovered GOF mutations that cause heritable diseases (20Rock M.J. Prenen J. Funari V.A. Funari T.L. Merriman B.

Further mutageneses starting with the GOF mutants isolated here may in the future lead to unequivocal identification of the remaining voltage-dependent gating.

https://openalex.org/W2124802849,"Background Ozone, a pollutant known to induce airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), increases morbidity and mortality in patients with obstructive airway diseases and asthma. We postulate oxidized lipids mediate in vivo ozone-induced AHR in murine airways. Methodology/Principal Findings Male BALB/c mice were exposed to ozone (3 or 6 ppm) or filtered air (controls) for 2 h. Precision cut lung slices (PCLS; 250 µm thickness) containing an intrapulmonary airway (∼0.01 mm2 lumen area) were prepared immediately after exposure or 16 h later. After 24 h, airways were contracted to carbachol (CCh). Log EC50 and Emax values were then calculated by measuring the airway lumen area with respect to baseline. In parallel studies, dexamethasone (2.5 mg/kg), or 1-aminobenzotriazol (ABT) (50 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneal injection to naïve mice 18 h prior to ozone exposure. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg) was administered 2 h prior. Cell counts, cytokine levels and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for lipid analysis were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from ozone exposed and control mice. Ozone acutely induced AHR to CCh. Dexamethasone or indomethacin had little effect on the ozone-induced AHR; while, ABT, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, markedly attenuated airway sensitivity. BAL fluid from ozone exposed animals, which did not contain an increase in neutrophils or interleukin (IL)-6 levels, increased airway sensitivity following in vitro incubation with a naïve PCLS. In parallel, significant increases in oxidized lipids were also identified using LC-MS with increases of 20-HETE that were decreased following ABT treatment. Conclusions/Significance These data show that ozone acutely induces AHR to CCh independent of inflammation and is insensitive to steroid treatment or cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. BAL fluid from ozone exposed mice mimicked the effects of in vivo ozone exposure that were associated with marked increases in oxidized lipids. 20-HETE plays a pivotal role in mediating acute ozone-induced AHR."
https://openalex.org/W2014306399,"Considerable efforts have been made to characterize the pathways regulating the extracellular levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide. However, none of such pathways has been so argued as the existence of a carrier-mediated transport of anandamide across the membrane. Apart from the lack of molecular evidence for such a carrier, the main reasons of this controversy lie in the methodologies currently used to study anandamide cellular uptake. Furthermore, the main evidence in favor of the existence of an ""anandamide transporter"" relies on synthetic inhibitors of this process, the selectivity of which has been questioned.We used the cytosolic binding site for anandamide on TRPV1 channels as a biosensor to detect anandamide entry into cells, and exploited nanotechnologies to study anandamide membrane transport into intact TRPV1-overexpressing HEK-293 cells. Both fluorescence and digital holographic (DH) quantitative phase microscopy were used to study TRPV1 activation. Poly-epsilon-caprolactone nanoparticles (PCL-NPs) were used to incorporate anandamide, which could thus enter the cell and activate TRPV1 channels bypassing any possible specific protein(s) involved in the uptake process. We reasoned that in the absence of such protein(s), pharmacological tools previously shown to inhibit the ""anandamide transporter"" would affect in the same way the uptake of anandamide and PCL-NP-anandamide, and hence the activation of TRPV1. However, when masked into PCL-NPs, anandamide cellular uptake became much less sensitive to these agents, although it maintained the same pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as that of ""free"" anandamide.We found here that several agents previously reported to inhibit anandamide cellular uptake lose their efficacy when anandamide is prevented from interacting directly with plasma membrane proteins, thus arguing in favor of the specificity of such agents for the putative ""anandamide transporter"", and of the existence of such mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2130880616,"Prediction of efficient oligonucleotides for RNA interference presents a serious challenge, especially for the development of genome-wide RNAi libraries which encounter difficulties and limitations due to ambiguities in the results and the requirement for significant computational resources. Here we present a fast and practical algorithm for shRNA design based on the thermodynamic parameters. In order to identify shRNA and siRNA features universally associated with high silencing efficiency, we analyzed structure-activity relationships in thousands of individual RNAi experiments from publicly available databases (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/shabalin/siRNA/si_shRNA_selector/). Using this statistical analysis, we found free energy ranges for the terminal duplex asymmetry and for fully paired duplex stability, such that shRNAs or siRNAs falling in both ranges have a high probability of being efficient. When combined, these two parameters yield a approximately 72% success rate on shRNAs from the siRecords database, with the target RNA levels reduced to below 20% of the control. Two other parameters correlate well with silencing efficiency: the stability of target RNA and the antisense strand secondary structure. Both parameters also correlate with the short RNA duplex stability; as a consequence, adding these parameters to our prediction scheme did not substantially improve classification accuracy. To test the validity of our predictions, we designed 83 shRNAs with optimal terminal asymmetry, and experimentally verified that small shifts in duplex stability strongly affected silencing efficiency. We showed that shRNAs with short fully paired stems could be successfully selected by optimizing only two parameters: terminal duplex asymmetry and duplex stability of the hypothetical cleavage product, which also relates to the specificity of mRNA target recognition. Our approach performs at the level of the best currently utilized algorithms that take into account prediction of the secondary structure of the target and antisense RNAs, but at significantly lower computational costs. Based on this study, we created the si-shRNA Selector program that predicts both highly efficient shRNAs and functional siRNAs (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/shabalin/siRNA/si_shRNA_selector/)."
https://openalex.org/W2165837768,"Gene activation is thought to occur through a series of temporally defined regulatory steps. However, this process has not been completely evaluated in single living mammalian cells.To investigate the timing and coordination of gene activation events, we tracked the recruitment of GCN5 (histone acetyltransferase), RNA polymerase II, Brd2 and Brd4 (acetyl-lysine binding proteins), in relation to a VP16-transcriptional activator, to a transcription site that can be visualized in single living cells. All accumulated rapidly with the VP16 activator as did the transcribed RNA. RNA was also detected at significantly more transcription sites in cells expressing the VP16-activator compared to a p53-activator. After alpha-amanitin pre-treatment, the VP16-activator, GCN5, and Brd2 are still recruited to the transcription site but the chromatin does not decondense.This study demonstrates that a strong activator can rapidly overcome the condensed chromatin structure of an inactive transcription site and supercede the expected requirement for regulatory events to proceed in a temporally defined order. Additionally, activator strength determines the number of cells in which transcription is induced as well as the extent of chromatin decondensation. As chromatin decondensation is significantly reduced after alpha-amanitin pre-treatment, despite the recruitment of transcriptional activation factors, this provides further evidence that transcription drives large-scale chromatin decondensation."

Large amounts of data that need to be analyzed are currently being produced due to advances in microarray technologies. Using current reverse engineering algorithms to analyze large data sets can be very computational-intensive. These emerging computational requirements can be met using parallel computing techniques. It has been shown that the Network Identification by multiple Regression (NIR) algorithm performs better than the other ready-to-use reverse engineering software. However it cannot be used with large networks with thousands of nodes - as is the case in biological networks - due to the high time and space complexity. In this work we overcome this limitation by designing and developing a parallel version of the NIR algorithm. The new implementation of the algorithm reaches a very good accuracy even for large gene networks, improving our understanding of the gene regulatory networks that is crucial for a wide range of biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2107455680,"We present results of two intensive mark-release-recapture surveys conducted during the wet and dry seasons of 2008 in the villages of Fourda and Kenieroba, Mali. The former is a small fishing village by the Niger River with a moderate to high densities of Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) throughout the year, while the latter is a large agricultural community 2 km inland that experiences strong seasonal fluctuation in An. gambiae densities. We estimate the population size of female An. gambiae in Fourda to be in less than 3,000 during the dry season. We found evidence of large population size and migration from Fourda in Kenieroba during the wet season, but very low numbers and no sign of migrants during the dry season. We suggest that malaria vector control measures aimed at adult mosquitoes might be made more efficient in this region and other seasonal riparian habitats by targeting disruption of mosquito populations by the river during the dry season. This would decrease the size of an already small population, and would be likely to delay the explosive growth in vector numbers in the larger inland villages as rainfall increases."
https://openalex.org/W2057765165,"Background Senescent cells occur in adults with cirrhotic livers independent of the etiology. Aim: Investigate the presence rate of cellular senescence and expression of cell cycle check points in livers from children with end stage disease. Methodology/Principal Findings Livers of five children aged three years or less undergoing liver transplantation due to tyrosinemia (n = 1), biliary atresia (n = 2), or fulminant hepatitis (n = 2) were analyzed for senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-βgal) activity and p16INK4a, p21cip1 and p53. All livers displayed positive cellular staining for SA-βgal in the canals of Hering and interlobular biliary ducts. In the presence of cirrhosis (3/5 cases) SA-βgal was found at the cholangioles and hepatocytes surrounding the regenerative nodules. Children with fulminant hepatic failure without cirrhosis had significant ductular transformation with intense SA-βgal activity. No SA-βgal activity was evident in the fibrous septa. Staining for p53 had a similar distribution to that observed for SA-βgal. Staining for p16INK4a and p21cip1 was positive in the explanted liver of the patient with tyrosinemia, in the hepatocytes, the canals of Hering, cholangioles and interlobular bile ducts. In the livers with fulminant hepatitis, p21cip1 staining occurred in the areas of ductular transformation and in the interlobular bile ducts. Conclusions/Significance Cellular senescence in livers of children with end stage disease is associated with damage rather than corresponding to an age dependent phenomenon. Further studies are needed to support the hypothesis that these senescence markers correlate with disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2005802222,"Background Nociception is the physiological detection of noxious stimuli. Because of its obvious importance, nociception is expected to be widespread across animal taxa and to trigger robust behaviours reliably. Nociception in invertebrates, such as crustaceans, is poorly studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Three decapod crustacean species were tested for nociceptive behaviour: Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus), and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.). Applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae caused no change in behaviour in the three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the stimulated antenna, and there was no difference in movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in P. clarkii revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of concentrated sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Conclusions/Significance Previously reported responses to extreme pH are either not consistently evoked across species or were mischaracterized as nociception. There was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH."
https://openalex.org/W2040743599,"Bicoid (Bcd) is a Drosophila morphogenetic protein responsible for patterning the anterior structures in embryos. Recent experimental studies have revealed important insights into the behavior of this morphogen gradient, making it necessary to develop a model that can recapitulate the biological features of the system, including its dynamic and scaling properties.We present a biologically realistic 2-D model of the dynamics of the Bcd gradient in Drosophila embryos. This model is based on equilibrium binding of Bcd molecules to non-specific, low affinity DNA sites throughout the Drosophila genome. It considers both the diffusion media within which the Bcd gradient is formed and the dynamic and other relevant properties of bcd mRNA from which Bcd protein is produced. Our model recapitulates key features of the Bcd protein gradient observed experimentally, including its scaling properties and the stability of its nuclear concentrations during development. Our simulation model also allows us to evaluate the effects of other biological activities on Bcd gradient formation, including the dynamic redistribution of bcd mRNA in early embryos. Our simulation results suggest that, in our model, Bcd protein diffusion is important for the formation of an exponential gradient in embryos.The 2-D model described in this report is a simple and versatile simulation procedure, providing a quantitative evaluation of the Bcd gradient system. Our results suggest an important role of Bcd binding to non-specific, low-affinity DNA sites in proper formation of the Bcd gradient in our model.

https://openalex.org/W2074948867,"Multi-polypeptide proteins such as antibodies are difficult to express in prokaryotic systems such as E. coli due to the complexity of protein folding plus secretion. Thus far, proprietary strains or fermenter cultures have been required for appreciable yields.

In this paper, we demonstrate that useful quantities of full-length IgG can be expressed and purified from the common E. coli laboratory strain HB2151 in standard shaking culture using a simple strategy of reduced inducer concentration combined with delayed induction times to modulate translation rates. Purified IgG had only marginally reduced avidity compared to mammalian derived IgG. This indicates that this technique can be used to derive antibodies of potentially equal utility as those expressed in mammalian cell culture, particularly for applications where effector functions mediated by the glycosylated residues in the Fragment Crystallizable (Fc) portion of the immunoglobulin are not required."

Gene reporter assays and ChIP experiments conducted in the breast cancer-derived MCF7 cells revealed that the ERE2 site was sufficient for p53-mediated ERalpha recruitment and transactivation of the FLT1-T promoter/reporter construct. Surprisingly, unlike the case for other p53 target promoters, p53-mediated transactivation of FLT1-T constructs or expression of the endogenous FLT1 gene, as well as binding of p53 and ER at the promoter constructs, was inducible by doxorubicin but not by 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, ER activity at FLT1-T was differentially affected by ER ligands, compared to a control TFF1/pS2 ER target promoter. The p53-related transcription factors (TFs) p73 and p63 had no effect on FLT1 transactivation.We establish a new dimension to the p53 master regulatory network where p53-mediated transcription from a (1/2) site RE can be determined by ER binding at one or more cis-acting EREs in manner that is dependent on level of ER protein, the type of ER ligand and the specific p53-inducing agent."
https://openalex.org/W2089690169,"Stability of membrane protein is crucial during protein purification and crystallization as well as in the fabrication of protein-based devices. Several recent studies have examined how various surfactants can stabilize membrane proteins out of their native membrane environment. However, there is still no single surfactant that can be universally employed for all membrane proteins. Because of the lack of knowledge on the interaction between surfactants and membrane proteins, the choice of a surfactant for a specific membrane protein remains purely empirical. Here we report that a group of short amphiphilic peptides improve the thermal stability of the multi-domain protein complex photosystem-I (PS-I) in aqueous solution and that the peptide surfactants have obvious advantages over other commonly used alkyl chain based surfactants. Of all the short peptides studied, Ac-I5K2-CONH2 (I5K2) showed the best stabilizing effect by enhancing the melting temperature of PS-I from 48.0°C to 53.0°C at concentration of 0.65 mM and extending the half life of isolated PS-I significantly. AFM experiments showed that PS-I/I5K2/Triton X-100 formed large and stable vesicles and thus provide interfacial environment mimicking that of native membranes, which may partly explain why I5K2 enhanced the thermal stability of PS-I. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic group length of IxKy had an important influence on the stabilization of PS-I. Our results showed that longer hydrophobic group was more effective in stabilizing PS-I. These simple short peptides therefore exhibit significant potential for applications in membrane protein studies."
https://openalex.org/W2132713425,"Background The epithelial cell response to stress involves the transmission of signals between contiguous cells that can be visualized as a calcium wave. In some cell types, this wave is dependent on the release of extracellular trinucleotides from injured cells. In particular, extracellular ATP has been reported to be critical for the epithelial cell response to stress and has recently been shown to be upregulated in tumors in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we identify stanniocalcin-1 (STC1), a secreted pleiotrophic protein, as a critical mediator of calcium wave propagation in monolayers of pulmonary (A549) and prostate (PC3) epithelial cells. Addition of STC1 enhanced and blocking STC1 decreased the distance traveled by an extracellular ATP-dependent calcium wave. The same effects were observed when calcium was stimulated by the addition of exogenous ATP. We uncover a positive feedback loop in which STC1 promotes the release of ATP from cells in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions/Significance The results indicated that STC1 plays an important role in the early response to mechanical injury by epithelial cells by modulating signaling of extracellular ATP. This is the first report to describe STC1 as a modulator or purinergic receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2006617228,"Background Crosstalk between integrins and FGF receptors has been implicated in FGF signaling, but the specifics of the crosstalk are unclear. We recently discovered that 1) FGF1 directly binds to integrin αvβ3, 2) the integrin-binding site and FGF receptor (FGFR) binding site are distinct, and 3) the integrin-binding-defective FGF1 mutant (R50E) is defective in inducing FGF signaling although R50E still binds to FGFR and heparin and induces transient ERK1/2 activation. Principal Findings We tested if excess R50E affect DNA synthesis and cell survival induced by WT FGF1 in BaF3 mouse pro-B cells expressing human FGFR1. R50E suppressed DNA synthesis and cell proliferation induced by WT FGF1. We tested if WT FGF1 and R50E generate integrin-FGF1-FGFR ternary complex. WT FGF1 induced ternary complex formation (integrin-FGF-FGFR1) and recruitment of SHP-2 to the complex in NIH 3T3 cells and human umbilical endothelial cells, but R50E was defective in these functions. It has been reported that sustained ERK1/2 activation is integrin-dependent and crucial to cell cycle entry upon FGF stimulation. We thus determined the time-course of ERK1/2 activation induced by WT FGF1 and R50E. We found that WT FGF1 induced sustained activation of ERK1/2, but R50E was defective in this function. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that 1) R50E is a dominant-negative mutant, 2) Ternary complex formation is involved in FGF signaling, 3) The defect of R50E to bind to integrin may be directly related to the antagonistic action of R50E. Taken together, these results suggest that R50E has potential as a therapeutic in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2156363147,"The molecular biology of the clinically silent pre-erythrocytic stages of mammalian Plasmodium spp, composed of both the sporozoite and liver stages, has remained largely uncharacterized. Improved understanding of the biological processes required for progression through the pre-erythrocytic stages could lead to the identification of novel drug and vaccine targets. To gain insights into the molecular events that occur during the pre-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium, comparative transcriptional analysis was performed on radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), wild type sporozoites (wtSPZ) and liver stage parasites collected either 24 hours (24hrLS) or 48 hours (48hrLS) after mice were infected with Plasmodium yoelii. Our results revealed 1100 Plasmodium genes that were differentially expressed in one or more constituents of the pre-erythrocytic stages relative to the mixed blood stages. Overall, the transcriptional profile of P. yoelii gradually became more similar to the mixed blood stages as pre-erythrocytic stage development progressed into the mature liver stage schizont. The transcriptional profiles of RAS and wtSPZ were found to be nearly identical. Likewise, the transcriptional profile of 24hrLS was very similar to that of the 48hrLS parasites. The largest differences in gene expression were observed when comparing wtSPZ or RAS to either of the liver stage samples. Further characterization of the differentially expressed genes identified in this study could help elucidate the biological mechanisms employed by Plasmodium during the pre-erythrocytic stages."
https://openalex.org/W1968265492,"Apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase 1 (AATYK1), a novel serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in the brain, is involved in neurite extension and apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons; however, its precise function remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the interaction of AATYK1A with Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35, a proline-directed protein kinase that is predominantly expressed in neurons. AATYK1A bound to the p35 activation subunit of Cdk5 in cultured cells and in mouse brains and colocalized with p35 on endosomes in COS-7 cells. AATYK1A was phosphorylated at Ser34 by Cdk5/p35 in vitro, in cultured neurons and in mouse brain. In PC12D cells, Ser34 phosphorylation increased after treatment with nerve growth factor and phosphorylated AATYK1A accumulated in growth cones of PC12D cells. Ser34 phosphorylation suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of AATYK1A by Src family kinases. These results suggest a possibility that AATYK1A plays a role in early to recycling endosomes and its function is regulated by phosphorylation with Cdk5 or Src-family kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2053012276,"Glutamate transporters located in the brain maintain low synaptic concentrations of the neurotransmitter by coupling its flux to that of sodium and other cations. In the binding pocket of the archeal homologue Glt(Ph), a conserved methionine residue has been implicated in the binding of the benzyl moiety of the nontransportable substrate analogue threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate. To determine whether the corresponding methionine residue of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, Met-367, fulfills a similar role, M367L, M367C, and M367S mutants were expressed in HeLa cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes to monitor radioactive transport and transport currents, respectively. The apparent affinity of the Met-367 mutants for D-aspartate and L-glutamate, but not for L-aspartate, was 10-20-fold reduced as compared with wild type. Unlike wild type, the magnitude of I(max) was different for each of the three substrates. D-glutamate, which is also a transportable substrate of EAAC1, did not elicit any detectable response with M367C and M367S but acted as a nontransportable substrate analogue in M367L. In the mutants, substrates inhibited the anion conductance as opposed to the stimulation observed with wild type. Remarkably, the apparent affinity of the blocker D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate in the mutants was similar to that of wild type EAAC1. Our results are consistent with the idea that the side chain of Met-367 fulfills a steric role in the positioning of the substrate in the binding pocket in a step subsequent to its initial binding."
https://openalex.org/W2052302545,"Background Parental consanguinity is a risk factor for congenital heart disease (CHD) worldwide, suggesting that a recessive inheritance model may contribute substantially to CHD. In Bangalore, India, uncle-niece and first cousin marriages are common, presenting the opportunity for an international study involving consanguinity mapping of structural CHD. We sought to explore the recessive model of CHD by conducting a genome-wide linkage analysis utilizing high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and enrolling 83 CHD probands born to unaffected consanguineous parents. Methodology/Principal Findings In this linkage scan involving single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, the threshold for genome-wide statistical significance was set at the standard log-of-odds (LOD) score threshold of 3.3, corresponding to 1995∶1 odds in favor of linkage. We identified a maximal single-point LOD score of 3.76 (5754∶1 odds) implicating linkage of CHD with the major allele (G) of rs1055061 on chromosome 14 in the HOMEZ gene, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor containing leucine zipper as well as zinc finger motifs. Re-sequencing of HOMEZ exons did not reveal causative mutations in Indian probands. In addition, genotyping of the linked allele (G) in 325 U.S. CHD cases revealed neither genotypic nor allele frequency differences in varied CHD cases compared to 605 non-CHD controls. Conclusions/Significance Despite the statistical power of the consanguinity mapping approach, no single gene of major effect could be convincingly identified in a clinically heterogeneous sample of Indian CHD cases born to consanguineous parents. However, we are unable to exclude the possibility that noncoding regions of HOMEZ may harbor recessive mutations leading to CHD in the Indian population. Further research involving large multinational cohorts of patients with specific subtypes of CHD is needed to attempt replication of the observed linkage peak on chromosome 14. In addition, we anticipate that a targeted re-sequencing approach may complement linkage analysis in future studies of recessive mutation detection in CHD."
https://openalex.org/W1987086068,"Apoptosis contributes to immune-mediated pancreatic beta cell destruction in type I diabetes. Exposure of beta cells to interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and activates proapoptotic networks. Here, we show that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways regulate the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), which mediates endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. Both CHOP mRNA and protein increase in beta cells treated with IL-1beta. In addition, prolonged exposure to high glucose further increases IL-1beta-triggered CHOP expression. IL-1beta also causes increased expression of C/EBP-beta and a reduction of MafA, NFATc2, and Pdx-1 expression in beta cells. Inhibition of the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways differentially attenuates CHOP expression. Knocking down CHOP by RNA interference protects beta cells from IL-1beta-induced apoptosis. These studies provide direct mechanistic links between cytokine-induced signaling pathways and CHOP-mediated apoptosis of beta cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037546208,"Background Precise regulation of the cell cycle is crucial to the growth and development of all organisms. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of the cell cycle is crucial to unraveling many complicated diseases, most notably cancer. Multiple sources of biological data are available to study the dynamic interactions among many genes that are related to the cancer cell cycle. Integrating these informative and complementary data sources can help to infer a mutually consistent gene transcriptional regulatory network with strong similarity to the underlying gene regulatory relationships in cancer cells. Results and Principal Findings We propose an integrative framework that infers gene regulatory modules from the cell cycle of cancer cells by incorporating multiple sources of biological data, including gene expression profiles, gene ontology, and molecular interaction. Among 846 human genes with putative roles in cell cycle regulation, we identified 46 transcription factors and 39 gene ontology groups. We reconstructed regulatory modules to infer the underlying regulatory relationships. Four regulatory network motifs were identified from the interaction network. The relationship between each transcription factor and predicted target gene groups was examined by training a recurrent neural network whose topology mimics the network motif(s) to which the transcription factor was assigned. Inferred network motifs related to eight well-known cell cycle genes were confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis, binding site enrichment analysis, and comparison with previously published experimental results. Conclusions We established a robust method that can accurately infer underlying relationships between a given transcription factor and its downstream target genes by integrating different layers of biological data. Our method could also be beneficial to biologists for predicting the components of regulatory modules in which any candidate gene is involved. Such predictions can then be used to design a more streamlined experimental approach for biological validation. Understanding the dynamics of these modules will shed light on the processes that occur in cancer cells resulting from errors in cell cycle regulation."

In this study, we aimed to further understand how SHP1 interacts and regulates NPM-ALK. We employed an in vitro model in which GP293 cells were transfected with various combinations of NPM-ALK (or mutants) and SHP1 (or mutants) expression vectors. We found that SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK, but not the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALKK210R mutant, or the mutant in which all three functionally important tyrosine residues (namely, Tyr338, Tyr342, and Tyr343) in the kinase activation loop (KAL) of ALK were mutated. Interestingly, whereas mutation of Tyr338 or Tyr342 did not result in any substantial change in the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding (assessed by co-immunoprecipitation), mutation of Tyr343 abrogated this interaction. Furthermore, the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding was readily detectable when each of the remaining 8 tyrosine residues known to be phosphorylated were mutated. Although the expression of SHP1 effectively reduced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK, it did not affect that of the NPM-ALKY343F mutant. In soft agar clonogenic assay, SHP1 expression significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of NPM-ALK but not that of NPM-ALKY343F. In conclusion, we identified Tyr343 of NPM-ALK as the crucial site for mediating the NPM-ALK/SHP1 interaction.

Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the oligomerization domain of the NPM portion in this fusion gene protein induces dimerization of ALK, which results in autophosphorylation and constitutive activation of the ALK tyrosine kinase (7Shiota M.

By virtue of its constitutively active tyrosine kinase, it is believed that NPM-ALK promotes tumorigenesis by aberrantly phosphorylating various tyrosine residues of a host of cellular signaling proteins, thereby deregulating a large number of cellular signaling pathways (9Amin H.M.

Frantz C. Shi X. Lai R. Blood. 2006; 108: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SHP1 is normally expressed at the highest level in hematopoietic cells and it is known to act as a negative regulator of various cell signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT pathway and that of the T-/B-cell receptor (16Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The biological importance of SHP1 is highlighted by the phenotype of the so-called “moth-eaten” mice; specifically, homozygous mutations of the SHP1 gene, which results in a complete loss of SHP1 expression, are associated with severe dysregulation of the leukocyte development and systemic autoimmunity (17Kozlowski M.

Specifically, loss of SHP1 has been demonstrated in a proportion of T-cell lymphomas, including the majority of the ALK+ALCL cases (10Zhang Q. Raghunath P.N. Vonderheid E. Odum N. Wasik M.A. Am. J.

In another study, decreased expression of SHP1 has been shown to be associated with the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (20Amin H.M. Hoshino K. Yang H. Lin Q. Lai R. Garcia-Manero G. J.

However, the molecular details underlying the physical and functional interaction between SHP-1 and NPM-ALK are incompletely understood. Because NPM-ALK is known to interact with its binding partners via the phospho-Tyr/SH2 motif (7Shiota M. Fujimoto J. Semba T. Satoh H. Yamamoto T. Mori S.

We focused our search on the 11 tyrosine residues of NPM-ALK that have been previously found to be phosphorylated (25Wang P. Wu F. Ma Y. Li L. Lai R. Young L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly, because SHP1 is known to interact with its substrates via one or both of its two SH2 domains, commonly termed N-SH2 (i.e. close to the N terminus) and C-SH2 (i.e. close to the C terminus) (26Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

After we identified the exact tyrosine residue of NPM-ALK that is important for the physical interaction between NPM-ALK and SHP1, we examined the functional importance of this physical interaction in SHP1-mediated suppression on NPM-ALK. An ALK+ALCL cell line, Karpas 299, was used.

Similarly, the single Tyr → Phe mutants of NPM-ALK (i.e. site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr138, Tyr152, Tyr156, Tyr191, Tyr419, Tyr567, Tyr644, and Tyr664) were constructed on a pcDNA3.1(+)/NPM-ALK backbone. The coding sequences of NPM-ALK and all mutants were confirmed to ensure that no artificial mutations were acquired. GP293 cells were plated in a 100-mm cell culture dish 24 h before gene transfection to obtain cell confluence of ∼70%. Gene transfection of NPM-ALK alone or in combination with SHP1 were done using TurboFectTM in vitro Transfection Reagent (Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transient transfection of Karpas 299 cells (4 × 106 cells) with 10 μg of DNA of wild-type SHP1 or different SHP1 mutants were performed using the Electro square electroporator, BTX ECM 800 (San Diego, CA) at 225 V (8.5 ms, 03 pulses). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after gene transfection. For immunoprecipitation, a standard protocol was used as previously described (30Amin H.M. Medeiros L.J. Ma Y. Feretzaki M. Das P. Leventaki V. Rassidakis G.Z. O'Connor S.L. McDonnell T.J. Lai R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5399-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using Cell Lytic Buffer M (Sigma) supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), a protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Inc., San Diego, CA), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). After incubating the lysate on ice for 30 min, it was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Two micrograms of the primary antibody was added to 500 μg of protein lysate and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Negative control samples with the primary antibody omitted were included. 50 μl of protein (A/G Plus-agarose) beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to both the test and control lysates and rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the final wash was done using cold cell lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the final wash was done using RIPA buffer. Proteins were then eluted from the beads in 20 μl of SDS protein loading buffer by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C. The complex was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, and the proteins were visualized using enzyme chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting: goat polyclonal anti-ALK, rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP1 (both were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-ALK (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), mouse anti-SHP1 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ALK (Tyr1604), anti-phosphotyrosine (both were from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). Western blot analysis is described as follows: cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular proteins were precipitated using RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), which was supplemented with 40 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Cell lysates were then electrophoresed on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween buffer for 1 h (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, the membranes were incubated with the isotype-specific secondary antibody conjugated with the horseradish peroxidase (Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by 3 washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, and the protein was detected using the chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The soft agar consisted of two layers, both of which were prepared from a stock 1.2% Bacto-agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) dissolved in distilled water and autoclaved. For the bottom layer, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the stock agar to achieve a 0.6% agar concentration. For the top layer, cell suspension (20,000 cells in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS) was mixed with the stock agar to achieve a final agar concentration of 0.3%. Cells in the agar were fed with 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS every 2 days. Colonies were stained and visualized with 0.05% crystal violet after 4 weeks of culture. The association between SHP1 and the number of colonies formed in soft agar was evaluated using Student's t test. A p value ≤ 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the binding between NPM-ALK and partners is typically dependent on the autophosphorylation and activation status of NPM-ALK. Thus, we asked if the activation status of NPM-ALK is important to the physical interaction between SHP1 and NPM-ALK. To address this question, we co-transfected GP293 cells with SHP1 and NPM-ALK or the enzymatically inactive NPM-ALKK210R mutant. As shown in Fig. 1, SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK (lane 2); it did not bind the NPM-ALKK210R mutant (lane 3). We performed similar experiments using another NPM-ALK mutant, in which all three functionally important tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop (KAL) of ALK have been mutated (labeled as FFF) (25Wang P. Wu F. Ma Y. Li L. Lai R. Young L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Tartari C.J. Gunby R.H. Coluccia A.M. Sottocornola R.

As shown in lane 4, SHP1 also did not associate with the FFF mutant. We have previously shown that mutations of one or more of the three tyrosine residues in the KAL of ALK result in a dramatic decrease in the number of phosphorylated tyrosine residues on NPM-ALK, its ability to phosphorylate substrates and its tumorigenicity (25Wang P. Wu F. Ma Y. Li L. Lai R. Young L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our previously published data showed that Tyr338 is the first tyrosine residue in the KAL to be phosphorylated and it appears to be functionally more important than Tyr342 and Tyr343 (25Wang P. Wu F. Ma Y. Li L. Lai R. Young L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). With this background, we assessed how mutation of each one of these three tyrosine residues in the KAL affects the NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding. As shown in Fig. 2, mutation of Tyr338, which was previously shown to dramatically decrease the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK and the ability of NPM-ALK to phosphorylate various downstream targets, did not result in any substantial change in the binding between NPM-ALK and SHP1 (lane 2). Similarly, a relatively strong SHP1 binding was evident with the Tyr342 mutant (lane 3). In contrast, mutation of Tyr343 resulted in a complete loss of SHP1 binding detectable by our co-immunoprecipitation experiments (lane 4). Double mutation of Tyr342 and Tyr343 also abrogated the binding (lane 5), highlighting the importance of the Tyr343 residue in mediating the NPM-ALK/SHP1 interaction. To explain why mutation of Tyr343 results in the dramatic loss of SHP1 binding, we performed peptide sequence analysis, and assessed if Tyr343 falls into any of the known consensus sequences that can be recognized by SHP1. In this regard, we found a consensus sequence, (XXpY(Y/F)K/R) (34Hampel K. Kaufhold I. Zacharias M. Böhmer F.D. Imhof D. ChemMedChem. 2006; 1: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), present in a segment spanning Tyr343 (namely ASY342Y343R). In contrast, Tyr338 of NPM-ALK was not found to fall into any specific consensus sequences recognizable by SHP1. This finding further supports that Tyr343 represents the crucial binding site between NPM-ALK and SHP1, and explains why mutation of Tyr343, but not Tyr338 or Tyr342, results in a dramatic change in the binding between NPM-ALK and SHP1. We then asked if the loss of SHP1 binding can be seen in mutations outside the KAL of ALK. Because our recent mass spectrometry studies revealed only 11 tyrosine residues (including the three in the KAL of ALK) that are phosphorylated (25Wang P. Wu F. Ma Y. Li L. Lai R. Young L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we performed site-directed mutagenesis of each of the remaining 8 tyrosine residues outside the KAL, including Tyr138, Tyr152, Tyr156, Tyr191, Tyr419, Tyr567, Tyr644, and Tyr664. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that mutations of all of these 8 tyrosine residues resulted in readily detectable binding between NPM-ALK and SHP1 (Fig. 3a), and these findings are in sharp contrast with that for the Tyr343 mutant (Fig. 2). We also examined one randomly chosen tyrosine residue of NPM-ALK that is not involved in the phosphorylation, namely Tyr67; no loss of SHP1 binding was detected (Fig. 3b). Because we identified Tyr343 of NPM-ALK as the crucial binding site for SHP1, we then asked if the SHP1-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation of NPM-ALK is dependent on their physical interaction. A dependence on the physical interaction suggests that SHP1 directly dephosphorylates NPM-ALK. On the other hand, an independence could suggest that SHP1 dephosphorylates NPM-ALK indirectly (i.e. involves another mediator). As shown in Fig. 4a, the expression of SHP1 and NPM-ALK resulted in a 50% reduction of the tyrosine phosphorylation level of NPM-ALK. This level of tyrosine dephosphorylation induced by SHP1 is similar to that seen previously (14Han Y. Amin H.M. Franko B. Frantz C. Shi X. Lai R. Blood. 2006; 108: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Han Y. Amin H.M. Frantz C. Franko B. Lee J. Lin Q. Lai R. Leukemia. 2006; 20: 1602-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, SHP1 did not result in any detectable change in the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the Tyr343 mutant (Fig. 4b). We repeated similar experiments using other NPM-ALK mutants, including (i) the Tyr644 mutant, which is known to be phosphorylated and resides outside the KAL; and (ii) the Tyr342 mutant, which is known to be phosphorylated and resides in the KAL. As shown in Fig. 4, c and d, SHP1 dephosphorylated these mutants as effectively as it did for NPM-ALK. As shown in Fig. 5, in GP293 cells co-transfected with SHP1 and NPM-ALK, SHP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NPM-ALK (lane 2). In contrast, as shown in lanes 3-5, all three SHP1 mutants (i.e. with mutations in the N-SH2 domain, the C-SH2 domains, or both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains) had reduced binding to NPM-ALK. Thus, it is evident that both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP1 are important in mediating its binding to NPM-ALK. Reciprocal experiments using anti-ALK antibody for immunoprecipitation yielded similar conclusions regarding the importance of N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP1 in mediating the interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). Using the same experimental approach, we assessed whether the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP1 is important for the SHP1/NPM-ALK binding. As shown in Fig. 6, NPM-ALK co-immunoprecipitated with the SHP1C445S mutant (lane 3), previously reported to be “phosphatase-dead” (28Yu Z. Su L. Hoglinger O. Jaramillo M.L. Banville D. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3687-3694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).FIGURE 6The SHP1/NPM-ALK binding is not dependent on the phosphatase activity of SHP1. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments using GP293 cells showed that NPM-ALK/SHP1 binding was the same between NPM-ALK/SHP1 (lane 2) and NPM-ALK/SHP1C455S (lane 3). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked if mutations of the SH2 domain of SHP1 also affect its ability to dephosphorylate NPM-ALK. To address this question, we transfected SHP1 or its double SH2 mutant into Karpas 299 cells, a SHP1-negative ALK+ALCL cell line (14Han Y. Amin H.M. Franko B. Frantz C. Shi X. Lai R. Blood. 2006; 108: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, mutations of both N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP1 resulted in a partial decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NPM-ALK, as compared with the parental SHP1 construct. This partial decrease was expected, as mutation of the SH2 domain of SHP1 did not completely abrogate the SHP1/NPM-ALK binding (Fig. 5). Using a soft agar clonogenic assay, we assessed how the physical interaction between SHP1 and NPM-ALK affects NPM-ALK-driven tumorigenicity. As shown in Fig. 8, the tumorigenicity of NPM-ALK in cells co-expressing SHP1 was significantly less than that seen in cells co-expressing an empty vector (p value = 0.0032, Student's t test). In contrast, there was no significant difference between tumorigenicity of the Y343F mutant in cells coexpressing either empty vector or SHP1 (p > 0.05, Student's t test). In normal cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation status of various proteins is tightly regulated by interaction of a host of kinases and phosphatases (36Wu C. Sun M. Liu L. Zhou G.W. Gene. 2003; 306: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). SHP1, a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase largely expressed in hematopoietic cells, is known to dephosphorylate and inhibit various proteins including cytokine receptors (38Yi T. Zhang J. Miura O.

https://openalex.org/W2062832095,"In eukaryotes, a rate-limiting step of translation initiation is recognition of the mRNA 5' m(7)GpppN cap structure by the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), a heterotrimeric complex consisting of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, along with eIF4G, and eIF4A. The eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) repress translation by disrupting eIF4F formation, thereby preventing ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. Of the three 4E-BPs, 4E-BP2 is the predominant paralog expressed in the mammalian brain and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. 4E-BP2 undergoes asparagine deamidation, solely in the brain, during early postnatal development. Deamidation spontaneously converts asparagines into a mixture of aspartates or isoaspartates, the latter of which may be destabilizing to proteins. The enzyme protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) prevents isoaspartate accumulation by catalyzing the conversion of isoaspartates to aspartates. PIMT exhibits high activity in the brain, relative to other tissues. We report here that 4E-BP2 is a substrate for PIMT. In vitro deamidated 4E-BP2 accrues isoapartyl residues and is methylated by recombinant PIMT. Using an antibody that recognizes 4E-BP2, which harbors isoaspartates at the deamidation sites, Asn(99) and Asn(102), we demonstrate that 4E-BP2 in PIMT-/- brain lysates contains isoaspartate residues. Further, we show that 4E-BP2 containing isoaspartates lacks the augmented association with raptor that is a feature of deamidated 4E-BP2."
https://openalex.org/W2095042704,"It has been hypothesized that the virulence of lab-passaged Mycobacterium tuberculosis and recombinant M. tuberculosis mutants might be reduced due to multiple in vitro passages, and that virulence might be augmented by passage of these strains through mice before quantitative virulence testing in the mouse or guinea pig aerosol models.By testing three M. tuberculosis H37Rv samples, one deletion mutant, and one recent clinical isolate for survival by the quantitative organ CFU counting method in mouse or guinea pig aerosol or intravenous infection models, we could discern no increase in bacterial fitness as a result of passaging of M. tuberculosis strains in mice prior to quantitative virulence testing in two animal models. Surface lipid expression as assessed by neutral red staining and thin-layer chromatography for PDIM analysis also failed to identify virulence correlates.These results indicate that animal passaging of M. tuberculosis strains prior to quantitative virulence testing in mouse or guinea pig models does not enhance or restore potency to strains that may have lost virulence due to in vitro passaging. It is critical to verify virulence of parental strains before genetic manipulations are undertaken and comparisons are made."
https://openalex.org/W2139022988,"Induction of gene expression is correlated with alterations in nuclear organization, including proximity to other active genes, to the nuclear cortex, and to cytologically distinct domains of the nucleus. Chromosomes are tethered to the insoluble nuclear scaffold/matrix through interaction with Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Region (SAR/MAR) binding proteins. Identification and characterization of proteins involved in establishing or maintaining chromosome-scaffold interactions is necessary to understand how the nucleus is organized and how dynamic changes in attachment are correlated with alterations in gene expression. We identified and characterized one such scaffold attachment factor, a Drosophila homolog of mammalian SAF-B. The large nuclei and chromosomes of Drosophila have allowed us to show that SAF-B inhabits distinct subnuclear compartments, forms weblike continua in nuclei of salivary glands, and interacts with discrete chromosomal loci in interphase nuclei. These interactions appear mediated either by DNA-protein interactions, or through RNA-protein interactions that can be altered during changes in gene expression programs. Extraction of soluble nuclear proteins and DNA leaves SAF-B intact, showing that this scaffold/matrix-attachment protein is a durable component of the nuclear matrix. Together, we have shown that SAF-B links the nuclear scaffold, chromosomes, and transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972041151,"Background In order to test how gravitational information would affect the choice of stable reference frame used to control posture and voluntary movement, we have analysed the forearm stabilisation during sit to stand movement under microgravity condition obtained during parabolic flights. In this study, we hypothesised that in response to the transient loss of graviceptive information, the postural adaptation might involve the use of several strategies of segmental stabilisation, depending on the subject's perceptual typology (dependence - independence with respect to the visual field). More precisely, we expected a continuum of postural strategies across subjects with 1) at one extreme the maintaining of an egocentric reference frame and 2) at the other the re-activation of childhood strategies consisting in adopting an egocentric reference frame. Methodology/Principal Findings To check this point, a forearm stabilisation task combined with a sit to stand movement was performed with eyes closed by 11 subjects during parabolic flight campaigns. Kinematic data were collected during 1-g and 0-g periods. The postural adaptation to microgravity's constraint may be described as a continuum of strategies ranging from the use of an exo- to an egocentric reference frame for segmental stabilisation. At one extremity, the subjects used systematically an exocentric frame to control each of their body segments independently, as under normogravity conditions. At the other, the segmental stabilisation strategies consist in systematically adopting an egocentric reference frame to control their forearm's stabilisation. A strong correlation between the mode of segmental stabilisation used and the perceptual typology (dependence - independence with respect to the visual field) of the subjects was reported. Conclusion The results of this study show different subjects' typologies from those that use the forearm orientation in a mainly exocentric reference frame to those that use the forearm orientation in a mainly egocentric reference frame."
