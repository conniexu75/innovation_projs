We investigated the role of the NAD(P)H oxidase Nox4 in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypertrophy, and fibronectin expression in a rat model of type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin. Phosphorothioated antisense (AS) or sense oligonucleotides for Nox4 were administered for 2 weeks with an osmotic minipump 72 h after streptozotocin treatment. Nox4 protein expression was increased in diabetic kidney cortex compared with non-diabetic controls and was down-regulated in AS-treated animals. AS oligonucleotides inhibited NADPH-dependent ROS generation in renal cortical and glomerular homogenates. ROS generation by intact isolated glomeruli from diabetic animals was increased compared with glomeruli isolated from AS-treated animals. AS treatment reduced whole kidney and glomerular hypertrophy. Moreover, the increased expression of fibronectin protein was markedly reduced in renal cortex including glomeruli of AS-treated diabetic rats. Akt/protein kinase B and ERK1/2, two protein kinases critical for cell growth and hypertrophy, were activated in diabetes, and AS treatment almost abolished their activation. In cultured mesangial cells, high glucose increased NADPH oxidase activity and fibronectin expression, effects that were prevented in cells transfected with AS oligonucleotides. These data establish a role for Nox4 as the major source of ROS in the kidneys during early stages of diabetes and establish that Nox4-derived ROS mediate renal hypertrophy and increased fibronectin expression.

Diabetes is accompanied by increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tissues including the kidney (12Ha H. Kim C. Son Y. Chung M.H. Kim K.H. Free Radic. Biol.

However, the results of treatment with antioxidants have been inconclusive (16Kuroki T. Isshiki K. King G.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 216-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although multiple pathways may result in ROS generation, recent studies indicate that a multicomponent phagocyte-like NAD(P)H oxidase is a major source of ROS in many nonphagocytic cells, including renal cells such as tubular epithelial cells and glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) (17Geiszt M. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51715-51718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 18Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under physiologic conditions, NAD(P)H oxidases have a very low constitutive activity that can be up-regulated in response to various stimuli (15Lee H.B. Yu M.R. Yang Y. Jiang Z. Ha H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 241-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Geiszt M. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51715-51718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 20Lassegue B.

For instance, it has been reported that enhanced NAD(P)H oxidase activity is associated with oxidative damage to DNA in diabetic glomeruli (23Kitada M. Koya D. Sugimoto T. Isono M. Araki S. Kashiwagi A. Haneda M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Etoh T. Inoguchi T. Kakimoto M. Sonoda N. Kobayashi K. Kuroda J. Sumimoto H. Nawata H. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These NAD(P)H oxidases are isoforms of the neutrophil oxidase, in which the catalytic subunits, termed Nox proteins, correspond to homologues of gp91phox (or Nox2), the catalytic moiety found in phagocytes (17Geiszt M. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51715-51718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 20Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this family, Nox4, which appears to share the same overall structure with gp91phox/Nox2, is abundant in the vascular system, kidney cortex, and MCs (17Geiszt M. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51715-51718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 20Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Am. J.

Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the biological role(s) of Nox4 is not well understood at present. It has been proposed that Nox4, a major source of ROS in the vasculature and the kidney, could function under pathologic conditions (20Lassegue B. Clempus R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Inoguchi T. Sonta T. Tsubouchi H. Etoh T. Kakimoto M. Sonoda N. Sato N. Sekiguchi N. Kobayashi K. Sumimoto H. Utsumi H.

Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1428-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that Nox4-derived ROS mediate angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced signaling and protein synthesis in mesangial cells (27Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Wagner B. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting its potential involvement in kidney hypertrophy under pathologic conditions. In this study, we determined whether Nox4 mediates ROS generation induced by diabetes in vivo and by high glucose in cultured cells. Antisense oligonucleotides for Nox4 were administered to a rat model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes and to cultured cells in vitro, and their effects on oxidative stress, Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation, renal hypertrophy, and fibronectin expression were investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200 and 225 g were divided into four groups of 10 rats/group. Group 2 was injected intravenously via the tail vein with 55 mg/kg body weight streptozotocin (STZ) in sodium citrate buffer (0.01 m, pH 4.5) to induce diabetes. Group 1 was injected with an equivalent amount of sodium citrate buffer alone. Rats in groups 3 and 4 were injected with STZ followed by either phosphorothioated sense or antisense (AS) oligonucleotides for Nox4 (90 ng/g body weight/day) administered subcutaneously by an ALZET osmotic pump for 14 days (ALZA, Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotides were administered 72 h after STZ injection for 14 days. Blood glucose concentration (LifeScan One Touch glucometer (Johnson & Johnson)) was monitored 24 h later and periodically thereafter. Three additional groups of control, diabetic, and diabetic rats treated with insulin were also studied. Twenty-four h after STZ injection, diabetic rats were treated daily with 4-6 units of NPH insulin supplemented with regular insulin (Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Inc., Princeton, NJ) subcutaneously. All rats had unrestricted access to food and water and were maintained in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee procedures. At day 14, all rats were euthanized, and both kidneys were removed and weighed. A slice of kidney cortex at the pole was embedded in paraffin or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for light microscopy and image analyses. In addition, cortical tissue was used for isolation of glomeruli by differential sieving as described (29Abboud H.E. Ou S.L. Velosa J.A. Shah S.V. Dousa T.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 69: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and samples of cortical tissue were frozen for biochemical analyses. NAD(P)H oxidase activity measurements were performed on freshly obtained tissue. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed near the ATG start codon of rat Nox4 (5′-AGCTCCTCCAGGACAGCGCC-3′) (27Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Wagner B. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Antisense and the corresponding sense oligonucleotides were synthesized as phosphorothioated oligonucleotides and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Advanced Nucleic Acid Core Facility, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio). Rat glomerular MCs were isolated and characterized as described (30Choudhury G.G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were used between the 15th and 30th passages. Selected experiments were performed in primary and early passaged MCs to confirm the data obtained with late passages. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotic/antifungal solution and 17% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of antisense and sense oligonucleotides for Nox4 was performed by electroporation or with Lipofectamine as described previously (27Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Wagner B. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activity was measured by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method. Kidney Cortex and Glomeruli—Homogenates from renal cortex or isolated glomeruli were prepared in 1 ml and 500 μl, respectively, of lysis buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) by using a Dounce homogenizer (100 strokes on ice). Homogenates were subjected to a low speed centrifugation at 800 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min to remove the unbroken cells and debris, and aliquots were used immediately. To start the assay, 100 μl of homogenates were added to 900 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, 5 μm lucigenin, and 100 μm NADPH. Photon emission in terms of relative light units was measured every 20 or 30 s for 10 min in a luminometer. There was no measurable activity in the absence of NADPH. A buffer blank (less than 5% of the cell signal) was subtracted from each reading. Superoxide production was expressed as relative chemiluminescence (light) units (RLU)/mg protein. Protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Cultured Mesangial Cells—NADPH oxidase activity in cells was measured as described previously (27Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCs grown in serum-free medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose were washed five times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were scraped from the plate in the same solution followed by centrifugation at 800 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer. Cell suspensions were homogenized with 100 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Aliquots of the homogenates were used immediately to measure NADPH-dependent superoxide generation as above. Measurement of superoxide anion released by isolated glomeruli was performed by detection of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction (27Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31Chen H.C. Guh J.Y. Shin S.J. Tsai J.H. Lai Y.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2000; 135: 309-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Isolated glomeruli were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red containing 80 μm cytochrome c with or without superoxide dismutase (50 μg/ml) for 6 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, glomeruli were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The optical density of the supernatant was measured by spectrophotometry at 550 nm and converted to nmol of cytochrome c reduced using the extinction coefficient ΔE550 = 21.0 × 103m-1 cm-1. The reduction of cytochrome c that was inhibitable by pretreatment with superoxide dismutase represents superoxide release. The peroxide-sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) was used to assess the generation of intracellular ROS as described previously (27Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 32Gorin Y. Kim N.H. Feliers D. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This compound is converted by intracellular esterases to 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, which is then oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF). Differential interference contrast images were obtained simultaneously using an Olympus inverted microscope with ×40 Aplanfluo objective and an Olympus fluoview confocal laser-scanning attachment. The DCF fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm of light, and its emission was detected using a 510-550-nm bandpass filter. In Vivo Experiments—Homogenates from renal cortex were prepared in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40) using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Isolated glomeruli were suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, protein in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad method. In Vitro Experiments—MCs grown to near confluence were made quiescent by serum deprivation overnight and were exposed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mmd-glucose, 25 mmd-glucose, or 5 mmd-glucose + 20 mml-glucose as osmotic control for the specified duration at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and protein was determined in the cleared supernatant using the Bio-Rad method. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with a mouse polyclonal Nox4 antibody directed against recombinant glutathione S-transferase-mouse Nox4-(299-515) (dilution 1:1,000), a rabbit polyclonal anti-gp91phox (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) (1:1,000), a rabbit polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody (Sigma) (1:2,500), or a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:4,000) and a rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody, a rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody, or a rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt1/PKBα (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) (1:1,000). The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis was performed using the NIH Image software. Light microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from the different treatment groups was used for morphometric studies. The surface area (μm2) of a minimum of 50 glomerular sections from each animal was determined in digital images using the Image-Pro Plus 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics). Glomerular surface area was measured in captured digital images by tracing around the perimeter of the glomerular capillary tuft using the polygram tool. The analysis software was calibrated to a stage micrometer. Localization of cellular fibronectin was assessed by immunoperoxidase histochemistry using polyclonal Nox4 antibodies or mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the alternatively spliced extra domain (EIIIA) (clones 3E2, Sigma and IST-9, Serotec, Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN) as described previously. Frozen cortical sections (6 μm thick) were fixed and permeabilized in acetone for 10 min and then rehydrated in PBS-0.1% BSA for 15 min. Sections were incubated with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block nonspecific peroxidase activity and 0.01% avidin, 0.001% biotin to block localization of endogenous activity before the addition of the appropriate blocking immunoglobulin for 15 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature. They were then washed three times in PBS-0.1% BSA and then incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at room temperature. Bound antibody was identified by immunoperoxidase ABC staining following the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were then dehydrated and mounted with Permount (Sigma) and viewed by bright-field microscopy. Six-μm-thick frozen sections were mounted on glass slides and then fixed in acetone. Sections were rehydrated in PBS-0.1% BSA before blocking with the appropriate IgG. Primary antibodies were added at concentrations of 10 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with primary antibodies, sections were washed three times for 5 min in PBS-0.1% BSA. Fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies were added at dilutions of 1:100 for 45 min at room temperature followed by washing in PBS-0.1% BSA. Sections were mounted with Crystal Mount (Dako) and allowed to dry before viewing with fluorescence microscopy. α-Smooth muscle actin was used as a marker for MCs within the glomerulus. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's unpaired t test. Significance was determined as probability (p) less than 0.05. Nox4 Expression—TABLE ONE displays the blood glucose levels and body and kidney weights after 2 weeks of diabetes in the different groups of rats. Untreated diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with either AS or the corresponding sense Nox4 had equivalently elevated blood glucose concentration at the end of the study period compared with the control rats. Body weight was similarly reduced in the diabetic rats treated with either sense or AS oligonucleotides. Total kidney weight and kidney weight to body weight ratio significantly increased in diabetic rats and sense Nox4-treated diabetic rats compared with non-diabetic control animals. In contrast, total kidney weight in AS Nox4-treated diabetic rats was significantly reduced compared with that observed for the diabetic or sense Nox4-treated diabetic groups (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEGlucose level, body weight, kidney weight, and kidney weight to body weight ratio after 2 weeks of diabetesGroupnBlood glucoseBody weightKidney weightKidney weight/body weightmg/dlggg/kgControl10194.9 ± 18.9302.536 ± 5.01.049 ± 0.043.771 ± 0.12Diabetes10386.5 ± 24.2238.5 ± 11.51.273 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 versus control rats.5.526 ± 0.25bp < 0.01 versus control rats.Diabetes + sense Nox410398.2 ± 19.6230.083 ± 11.21.248 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 versus control rats.5.486 ± 0.24bp < 0.01 versus control rats.Diabetes + AS Nox410398.7 ± 40.6223.462 ± 14.61.114 ± 0.04cp < 0.05 versus diabetes.4.476 ± 0.22dp < 0.01 versus diabetes.a p < 0.05 versus control rats.b p < 0.01 versus control rats.c p < 0.05 versus diabetes.d p < 0.01 versus diabetes. Open table in a new tab To test whether the oligonucleotides were effectively delivered to the kidney and to assess the effect of diabetes on Nox4 expression, we examined the protein levels of Nox4 in renal cortex from the different groups. Western blot analysis using a mouse polyclonal Nox4 antibody directed against recombinant glutathione S-transferase-mouse Nox4-(299-515) showed that a predominant 70-kDa band corresponding to Nox4 was increased in diabetic kidney cortex compared with that in control non-diabetic rats. AS Nox4 but not sense Nox4 administration reversed diabetes-induced Nox4 protein expression and significantly reduced Nox4 levels in kidney cortex from diabetic animals (Fig. 1). To confirm the specificity of action of the AS treatment toward Nox4, we also examined the protein expression of another Nox isoform, gp91phox/Nox2. The levels of gp91phox/Nox2 were also increased in diabetic animals. More importantly, administration of AS Nox4 had no effect on gp91phox/Nox2 expression (Fig. 1A). Immunoperoxidase staining showed that Nox4 protein expression is significantly increased in diabetic glomeruli. AS but not sense Nox4 administration markedly reduced diabetes-induced Nox4 protein expression (Fig. 1B). Double immunofluorescence staining revealed the colocalization of Nox4 (green) and α-smooth muscle actin (red) in the mesangial area of diabetic glomeruli (Fig. 1C). These observations demonstrate that Nox4 expression is consistent with mesangial distribution. These data indicate that mesangial expression of Nox4 is increased in diabetes and that subcutaneous administration of AS oligonucleotides effectively and specifically inhibits Nox4 NAD(P)H oxidase expression. ROS Generation—NADPH-dependent superoxide production was significantly increased in renal cortical and glomerular homogenates of diabetic animals compared with controls as measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (Fig. 2, A and B). AS Nox4 but not sense Nox4 treatment suppressed diabetes-induced NADPH oxidase activation in cortical and glomerular homogenates (Fig. 2, A and B). Preincubation of homogenates with diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of flavin-containing oxidases, completely blocked NADPH oxidase activity. In addition, superoxide dismutase (50 μg/ml) also inhibited the photoemission, thereby confirming identity of the product as superoxide (data not shown). The correlation between the inhibitions of NADPH-dependent ROS generation and the decrease in Nox4 expression following AS Nox4 administration in the diabetic rats suggest that Nox4 is the enzyme responsible for the increase in NADPH oxidase activity in diabetes. To further confirm the inhibitory effect of AS Nox4 on diabetes-induced oxidative stress in glomeruli, superoxide generation was evaluated ex vivo in isolated glomeruli incubated in the presence of cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 2C, superoxide generation by isolated glomeruli from diabetic rats was markedly increased compared with control rats. AS Nox4 treatment significantly inhibited the increase in superoxide anion production in diabetic glomeruli. Conversely, superoxide release was not affected by sense Nox4 treatment (Fig. 2C). Effects of Insulin Treatment—To determine whether the increased expression of Nox4 and ROS generation were because of the diabetic state and not because of a toxic effect of STZ, diabetic rats were treated with insulin. Tight glycemic control was achieved in the diabetic rats treated with insulin (mean plasma glucose concentrations on the last day were 102.6 mg/dl ± 3.9 in control rats, 433.5 mg/dl ± 25.8 in diabetic rats, and 103.7 mg/dl ± 32.9 in diabetic rats treated with insulin). Western blot and immunochemical analysis showed that the increased protein levels of Nox4 in diabetic rat kidneys were completely prevented in the rats treated with insulin (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, the increase in NADPH oxidase activity in cortical homogenates from diabetic animals was also prevented in the diabetic rats treated with insulin (Fig. 3C). Renal Hypertrophy—As expected, diabetic animals exhibited sig"

The structure reveals a zinc ion in the active site and suggests how the substrate adenosine is recognized. Unexpectedly, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is buried within the enzyme core, contributing to the protein fold. Although there are no reports that adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) require a cofactor, we show that IP6 is required for activity. Amino acids that coordinate IP6 in the crystal structure are conserved in some adenosine deaminases that act on transfer RNA (tRNA) (ADATs), related enzymes that edit tRNA. Indeed, IP6 is also essential for in vivo and in vitro deamination of adenosine 37 of tRNAala by ADAT1."

Here we report the structure of the full-length yeast ORP Osh4 (also known as Kes1) at 1.5–1.9 Å resolution in complexes with ergosterol, cholesterol, and 7-, 20- and 25-hydroxycholesterol. We find that a single sterol molecule binds within a hydrophobic tunnel in a manner consistent with a transport function for ORPs. The entrance is blocked by a flexible amino-terminal lid and surrounded by basic residues that are critical for Osh4 function. The structure of the open state of a lid-truncated form of Osh4 was determined at 2.5 Å resolution. Structural analysis and limited proteolysis show that sterol binding closes the lid and stabilizes a conformation favouring transport across aqueous barriers and signal transmission. The structure of Osh4 in the absence of ligand exposes potential phospholipid-binding sites that are positioned for membrane docking and sterol exchange. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model in which sterol and membrane binding promote reciprocal conformational changes that facilitate a sterol transfer and signalling cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2076032878,"Human subtelomeres are polymorphic patchworks of interchromosomal segmental duplications at the ends of chromosomes. Here we provide evidence that these patchworks arose recently through repeated translocations between chromosome ends. We assess the relative contribution of the principal mechanisms of ectopic DNA repair to the formation of subtelomeric duplications and find that non-homologous end-joining predominates. Once subtelomeric duplications arise, they are prone to homology-based sequence transfers as shown by the incongruent phylogenetic relationships of neighbouring sections. Interchromosomal recombination of subtelomeres is a potent force for recent change. Cytogenetic and sequence analyses reveal that pieces of the subtelomeric patchwork have changed location and copy number with unprecedented frequency during primate evolution. Half of the known subtelomeric sequence has formed recently, through human-specific sequence transfers and duplications. Subtelomeric dynamics result in a gene duplication rate significantly higher than the genome average and could have both advantageous and pathological consequences in human biology. More generally, our analyses suggest an evolutionary cycle between segmental polymorphisms and genome rearrangements."

https://openalex.org/W2076844987,"Quantum communication requires the transfer of quantum states, or quantum bits of information (qubits), from one place to another. From a fundamental perspective, this allows the distribution of entanglement and the demonstration of quantum non-locality over significant distances. Within the context of applications, quantum cryptography offers a provably secure way to establish a confidential key between distant partners. Photons represent the natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of telecommunications optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1,310 nm and 1,550 nm particularly suitable for distribution over long distances. However, qubits encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb and emit at wavelengths around 800 nm have been considered for the storage and processing of quantum information. Hence, future quantum information networks made of telecommunications channels and alkaline memories will require interfaces that enable qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths, while preserving quantum coherence and entanglement. Here we report a demonstration of qubit transfer between photons of wavelength 1,310 nm and 710 nm. The mechanism is a nonlinear up-conversion process, with a success probability of greater than 5 per cent. In the event of a successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1,550 nm, initially entangled with the 1,310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted. The corresponding fidelity is higher than 98 per cent."

https://openalex.org/W2023100673,"Drosophila sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are a well-studied model system for asymmetric cell division. During SOP division, the determinants Numb and Neuralized segregate into the pIIb daughter cell and establish a distinct cell fate by regulating Notch/Delta signaling. Here, we describe a Numb- and Neuralized-independent mechanism that acts redundantly in cell-fate specification. We show that trafficking of the Notch ligand Delta is different in the two daughter cells. In pIIb, Delta passes through the recycling endosome which is marked by Rab 11. In pIIa, however, the recycling endosome does not form because the centrosome fails to recruit Nuclear fallout, a Rab 11 binding partner that is essential for recycling endosome formation. Using a mammalian cell culture system, we demonstrate that recycling endosomes are essential for Delta activity. Our results suggest that cells can regulate signaling pathways and influence their developmental fate by inhibiting the formation of individual endocytic compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2095428047,"Triacylglycerol (TAG) lipases are required for mobilization of TAG stored in lipid particles. Recently, Tgl3p was identified as a major TAG lipase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Athenstaedt, K., and Daum, G. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 23317–23323). Here, we report the identification of Tgl4p and Tgl5p as additional TAG lipases of the yeast. Both polypeptides, encoded by open reading frames YKR089c/TGL4 and YOR081c/TGL5, share 30 and 26% homology, respectively, to Tgl3p. Cell fractionation experiments and microscopic inspection of strains bearing Tgl4p-GFP and Tgl5p-GFP hybrids demonstrated that both proteins are localized to lipid particles similar to Tgl3p. A 1.7-fold increased amount of TAG enriched in myristic and palmitic acids and the reduced mobilization rate of TAG from tgl4Δ in the presence of the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor cerulenin demonstrated the lipolytic function of Tgl4p in vivo. In contrast, neither the total amount of TAG nor the TAG mobilization rate after addition of cerulenin was affected in tgl5Δ cells. However, the enrichment of C26:0 esterified to TAG of tgl5Δ, an additional increase of TAG in the tgl4Δtgl5Δ double deletion mutant compared with tgl4Δ, and the impairment of TAG mobilization in the tgl4Δtgl5Δ strain in the presence of cerulenin suggested that also Tgl5p functions as a TAG lipase in vivo. Most importantly, the purified His6-tagged Tgl4p and Tgl5p hybrids exhibited TAG lipase activity demonstrating their function in vitro. In summary, our data obtained by biochemical, molecular, and cell biological analyses unambiguously identified Tgl4p and Tgl5p as novel TAG lipases of yeast lipid particles with certain enzymatic specificities."

https://openalex.org/W2065316769,"The processes leading to the birth of low-mass stars such as our Sun have been well studied, but the formation of high-mass (> 8 x Sun's mass) stars has heretofore remained poorly understood. Recent observational studies suggest that high-mass stars may form in essentially the same way as low-mass stars, namely via an accretion process, instead of via merging of several low-mass (< 8 Msun) stars. However, there is as yet no conclusive evidence. Here, we report the discovery of a flattened disk-like structure observed at submillimeter wavelengths, centered on a massive 15 Msun protostar in the Cepheus-A region. The disk, with a radius of about 330 astronomical units (AU) and a mass of 1 to 8 Msun, is detected in dust continuum as well as in molecular line emission. Its perpendicular orientation to, and spatial coincidence with the central embedded powerful bipolar radio jet, provides the best evidence yet that massive stars form via disk accretion in direct analogy to the formation of low-mass stars."

https://openalex.org/W2079107750,"Cells respond to adverse environmental conditions by synthesizing new proteins or elevating the levels of pre-existing ones that are needed to cope with the particular stress situation. We show here that Escherichia coli RNase R, a processive 3′-to5′-exoribonuclease, is dramatically increased in response to a variety of different stress conditions. Elevation of RNase R activity by as much as 10-fold was observed in response to entry into stationary phase, starvation, and cold shock, and a ∼3-fold increase was seen during growth in minimal medium compared with rich medium. The elevation in RNase R activity was associated primarily with an increase in RNase R protein. RNase R was previously implicated in quality control of rRNA and tRNA and in the decay of mRNAs with extensive secondary structure. Its dramatic increase under multiple stress conditions suggests extensive remodeling of structured RNA in response to the altered environment.

RNase R was previously implicated in quality control of rRNA and tRNA and in the decay of mRNAs with extensive secondary structure. Its dramatic increase under multiple stress conditions suggests extensive remodeling of structured RNA in response to the altered environment. The ability to sense and adapt to environmental change is critical to the survival of bacteria. Thus, upon encountering stress conditions, cells must rapidly alter their gene expression and remodel their RNA complement to deal with the changing environment. As a consequence, both new RNA transcription as well as RNA degradation must take place. However, while considerable information is available regarding changes in transcription in response to stress (reviewed in Ref. 1Takayama K. Kjelleberg S. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), very little is known about the RNA degradative machinery that comes into play under these conditions. The types of stress with which cells must contend include deprivation of nutrients, changes in temperature, and exposure to noxious agents. For each of these conditions, rapid changes in mRNA content, and hence of mRNA stability, might be expected (1Takayama K. Kjelleberg S. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, under certain circumstances, such as starvation, degradation of stable RNA, i.e. rRNA and tRNA, also occurs (reviewed in Ref. 2Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45041-45044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Stable RNAs, particularly rRNAs, account for the bulk of cellular RNA (3Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar) and represent a potential storehouse of nutrients that could be tapped to help the cell survive a starvation condition. To do this, a change in ribosome structure and/or in RNase activity must occur that would render the usually stable ribosomes sensitive to degradation. The change in RNase activity could come about either by elevation of a pre-existing RNase or by synthesis of an additional RNase in response to the stress condition. As part of an ongoing investigation of the functional role of RNases in Escherichia coli, we are examining how these enzymes respond to the imposition of a variety of stress conditions. In this paper, we focus on the processive, 3′ to 5′ exoribonuclease, RNase R (4Cheng Z-F. Zuo Y. Li Z. Rudd K.E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

Our attention was drawn to this RNase because of its ability to digest rRNA and other structured RNAs in vitro (5Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21624-21629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 6Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 17: 313-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We show here that RNase R levels increase dramatically in response to a variety of altered environmental conditions. A similar response to one of these stresses, cold shock, was recently reported (8Cairrao F. Cruz A. Mori H. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These data indicate that RNase R is novel among E. coli RNases and suggest that its action on structured RNAs may play an important role in helping cells cope with a changing environment. Materials—[3H]Poly(A) and poly(A) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and Sigma, respectively. Antibody against RNase R was prepared from purified protein (5Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21624-21629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) by Sigma-Genosys. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, used as secondary antibody, was from Promega Biotech. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions The E. coli K12 strain– CAN20— 12E (RNase I–II–D–BN–) and its derivative CAN20–12ER– (RNase I–II–D–BN–R–) have been described (4Cheng Z-F. Zuo Y. Li Z. Rudd K.E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14077-14080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These served as the RNase R+ and R– cells used in this study. Cells were grown in liquid culture in either YT (yeast extract/tryptone) or M9/glucose (0.2 or 0.4%) media. Antibiotics, when present, were at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 25 μg/ml; tetracycline, 12.5 μg/ml. Normally, cells were grown at 37 °C and were monitored by absorbance measurements at 550 nm. For experiments under various stress conditions, cells were first grown in YT or M9/glucose medium at 37 °C prior to shifting to the experimental condition. Details are presented in the legends. Media for starvation were as follows: carbon starvation, M9 without glucose; nitrogen starvation, M9/glucose lacking NH4Cl replaced with additional NaCl; phosphorus starvation, M9/glucose lacking Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4 replaced with additional NaCl and KCl and with 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Four ml of cells at ∼1 A550 (or the equivalent amount at a different absorbance value) were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.4 ml of solution containing: 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 or 500 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were prepared by sonication on ice using two 20-s pulses or five 10-s pulses, followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. Protein concentration of the extracts was determined by the method of Bradford (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using reagent purchased from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Assay of RNase R—Activity of RNase R was determined by the release of acid-soluble radioactivity from [3H]poly(A) as described previously (4Cheng Z-F. Zuo Y. Li Z. Rudd K.E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14077-14080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing: 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 180 mm or 300 mm KCl, 40 μg [3H]poly(A) (50–100 cpm/nmol), and ∼15 μg of the indicated cell extract. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated amount of time. After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, acid-soluble radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. One unit of RNase R activity converts 1 nmol of poly(A) to acid-soluble form/min. Western Immunoblotting of RNase R—To determine the amount of RNase R protein present in extracts, proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane by electroblottting. After blocking with nonfat milk (5%) in phosphate-buffered saline, RNase R was detected by incubating overnight at 4 °C with a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-RNase R serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk, 0.5% Triton X-100. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as the secondary reagent and detection was with p-coumaric acid and Luminol. Underexposed films were used for quantitation. Titration with varying amounts of purified RNase R indicated that this procedure gave a linear response up to at least 150 ng of protein. RNase R Levels during Growth—As an initial assessment of whether RNase R might be subject to regulation, we determined its activity as cells progressed from exponential phase through late stationary phase. The data presented in Fig. 1 show, in fact, that RNase R specific activity in extracts changes dramatically during cell growth. Thus, in the representative experiment shown, RNase R activity (filled triangles), which remains relatively constant during exponential phase, increases ∼6-fold as the culture approaches stationary phase and increases an additional 2-fold during an extended stationary phase. In multiple experiments, the initial increase in activity varied from 4–6-fold, whereas the increase in the second phase reproducibly was ∼2-fold. That the increase in activity is actually all due to RNase R was confirmed by the absence of any activity change in extracts prepared from an RNase R– strain (Fig. 1, empty triangles). To determine whether the increase in RNase R activity was accompanied by an elevation of RNase R protein, Western immunoblotting with RNase R antibody was carried out on extracts derived from cells at the different growth phases (Fig. 1, filled circles). Quantitation revealed a ∼3.5-fold increase (3–4-fold in multiple experiments) in the amount of RNase R protein as the culture entered stationary phase concomitant with the major increase in RNase R specific activity. In contrast, no increase in RNase R protein was seen in the RNase R– mutant strain (Fig. 1, empty circles). Interestingly, in multiple experiments, no additional increase in RNase R protein was found as the culture progressed through stationary phase, a period in which RNase R specific activity doubles (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the second phase of increase in RNase R activity may occur by a different mechanism, perhaps protein modification. Further work with RNase R purified from stationary phase cells will be necessary to clarify this point. It should be noted that in all experiments the initial increase in RNase R activity slightly exceeded the increase in RNase R protein. This was due to the fact that in extracts from all phases of growth RNase R activity is somewhat inhibited because of the presence of nucleic acids that compete with the [3H]poly(A) substrate during the assay. The inhibition in extracts from early exponential phase (∼50%) was greater than that in extracts from early stationary phase (∼25%) resulting in an apparently greater increase in RNase R activity than actually occurred. Upon correcting for this effect, the increase in RNase R protein and increase in specific activity became essentially identical. Thus, these data show that RNase R levels are strongly influenced by growth phase. Effect of Growth Rate on RNase R—Since a major reduction in growth rate accompanies the transition from exponential to stationary phase, it is possible that this slowdown in growth might be related to the observed increase in RNase R. To test this idea, cells growing rapidly in rich (YT) medium were compared with those growing more slowly in minimal (M9/glucose) medium with regard to RNase R specific activity and to levels of RNase R protein. The comparison was carried out with cells early in exponential growth to eliminate any effects due to stationary phase. As can be seen from TABLE ONE, cells growing at a slower rate in minimal medium were found to have ∼3-fold higher RNase R activity and RNase R protein compared with those growing in rich medium. Based on these data, it is clear that growth rate does affect cellular levels of RNase R and, therefore, that the slowdown in growth could be related to the initial increase in RNase R seen during the entry into stationary phase.TABLE ONEInfluence of growth rate on RNase R YT M9/glucose Doubling time (min)aRNase R specific activity and protein in YT medium were set at 1.0.

Open table in a new tab Elevation of RNase R in Response to Starvation—A more extreme stress occurs under conditions of starvation during which cells cease growth. To determine whether starvation might affect the level of RNase R over and above that already seen during growth in minimal medium, cells were initially grown in M9/glucose medium until mid-exponential phase and then transferred after washing into the same medium devoid of either carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus sources. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h under these conditions, cells were harvested and extracts assayed for RNase R activity (TABLE TWO). During the starvation period, the A550 in cultures lacking carbon or nitrogen decreased somewhat, whereas in cultures lacking phosphorus, the A550 increased slightly (see details in the legend to TABLE TWO). However, in multiple experiments, RNase R specific activity increased under each of the starvation conditions, amounting to ∼1.4-fold for carbon starvation, ∼2-fold for nitrogen starvation, and ∼4-fold in the absence of phosphorus (TABLE TWO) relative to the activity at the initiation of starvation. In RNase R– cells under these conditions, activity increased only slightly indicating that most of the increase observed in RNase R+ cells is, in fact, due to RNase R. It should be noted that nitrogen starvation of RNase R– cells led to a significant elevation of RNase activity, presumably due to an effect on another enzyme; however, that increase could not account for the much larger elevation in RNase R+ cells.TABLE TWOEffect of starvation on RNase R activity Strain RNase R specific activityaValues presented are the averages of three or four experiments.

Open table in a new tab These data demonstrate that another stress condition, in this case, starvation, leads to an elevation of RNase R activity over that observed in minimal medium. Moreover, the fact that the level of increase in RNase R activity varies with the particular starvation condition (phosphorus starvation always was significantly higher) suggests that there may be a specific response to each type of starvation. Elevation of RNase R in Response to Cold Shock—E. coli is known to respond to cold shock by increasing the synthesis of a variety of proteins that help it cope with this particular stress (10Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 11Yamanaka K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 193-202PubMed Google Scholar). In recent work (8Cairrao F. Cruz A. Mori H. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it was shown that RNase R protein was elevated ∼7-fold following transfer of cultures from 37 to 10 °C. To confirm and extend these observations to RNase R activity, cells growing at 37 °C in rich (YT) medium during early exponential phase were rapidly transferred to several lower temperatures. At various times after the temperature downshift, cells were harvested for measurement of RNase R activity and RNase R protein. The data in Fig. 2 show that upon transfer of cells to 10 °C, RNase R activity is elevated ∼10–12-fold. The increase is already apparent at 1 h and reaches a maximum at 3 h after the temperature shift. RNase R activity is maintained near the maximum level to at least 6 h. Cells cease growth under these conditions. No change in activity was observed in extracts from RNase R– cells (Fig. 2) confirming that the elevated activity is due to RNase R. Western analysis revealed that RNase R protein was elevated at 10 °C as well, to a maximum of ∼5-fold in multiple experiments (data not shown). It is not yet clear whether the ∼2-fold difference between the increase in activity and the increase in protein is meaningful. Significant, but smaller, increases in RNase R activity also were observed at 15 °C and 25 °C (data not shown). At 15 °C, the increase still was considerable, ∼8-fold; however, at 25 °C, only ∼2-fold elevation was obtained in multiple experiments during a 6 h time period. It should be noted that cells are able to grow at these latter two temperatures. These data clearly demonstrate that cold shock is an additional stress which leads to dramatic elevation of RNase R protein and activity and that the more severe the cold shock the more pronounced the effect on RNase R. Effect of Heat Shock on RNase R—In contrast to the dramatic elevation of RNase R during cold shock, the effect of heat shock was much more modest. Shifting the growth temperature from 37 to 42 °C led to little, if any, increase in RNase R specific activity. However, upon shifting to 45 °C, a reproducible elevation of ∼2-fold was observed in multiple experiments after 90 min at the elevated temperature (data not shown). No increase was observed in RNase R– cells. However, since cell growth is slowed somewhat at 45 °C compared with 42 °C, it is not yet clear whether the small elevation of RNase R at 45 °C is a specific response to the heat shock or is due to the reduction in growth rate. The data presented here demonstrate that RNase R activity in E. coli is elevated in response to a variety of altered environmental conditions. These include entry into stationary phase, minimal versus rich media, starvation for carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus, cold shock, and perhaps, heat shock. It is not yet clear whether a common physiological signal underlies the response to all of these diverse environmental stresses or whether multiple signals might be involved. One piece of evidence suggesting the possibility of multiple signals is the finding that starvation, for either carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus, elevates the level of RNase R severalfold over and above the increase already seen in minimal medium when compared with rich medium. For example, during phosphorus starvation, the overall increase in RNase R specific activity is close to 10-fold when compared with cells growing exponentially in rich media. Similar increases were observed during stationary phase and during cold shock. Thus, although further work will be necessary to unravel the details of the regulatory mechanisms that result in elevated RNase R, it is already clear that the magnitude of the increase in RNase R activity is quite dramatic and novel when compared with anything seen previously with respect to physiological regulation of RNases. In a recent study by Cairrao et al. (8Cairrao F. Cruz A. Mori H. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it was also found that RNase R protein (RNase R activity was not determined) is elevated 7–8-fold upon cold shock at 10 °C. In that work, it was suggested that the elevation of RNase R is due to stabilization of the rnr message during cold acclimatization and that subsequently the message is regulated by polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). 2The abbreviation used is: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase. However, the mechanism resulting in the initial stabilization of rnr message and the signal inducing the stabilization upon cold shock were not identified. RNase R has also been found to be regulated ∼3-fold during the cell cycle of Caulobacter crescentus (12Hong S-J. Tran Q-A. Keiler K.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this regulation also is not understood. Nevertheless, based on these observations, and those reported here, it is clear that RNase R is subject to extensive physiological control of its expression and its activity. Thus, not only do RNases affect the maturation and stability of cellular RNAs through their catalytic properties, they themselves are regulated by environmental and cellular conditions. The large increase in RNase R specific activity in response to the various stress conditions raises the question of what functional role elevated RNase R might serve in these situations. RNase R is unique among E. coli exoribonucleases in its ability to digest through extensive secondary structure by itself (4Cheng Z-F. Zuo Y. Li Z. Rudd K.E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14077-14080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 313-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is complementary to PNPase, which also digests through secondary structure as part of the degradosome (e.g. ref. 13Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Mackie G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2594-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 14Khemici V. Carpousis A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the absence of both of these exoribonucleases, E. coli cells are inviable (4Cheng Z-F. Zuo Y. Li Z. Rudd K.E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14077-14080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) implying that they are solely responsible for digesting structured RNAs. Interestingly, in a psychrotrophic bacterium, Pseudomonos syringae Lz4W, RNase R is part of the degradosome (15Purusharth R.I. Klein F. Sultana S. Jäger S. Jagannadham M.V. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Ray M.K. Klug G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14572-14578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RNase R has been shown to play a major role in degradation of REP sequences in mRNA (6Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 313-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and in quality control of rRNA (7Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and of defective tRNA (16Li Z. Reimers S. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) 3S. Chebolu, C. Kim, and M. P. Deutscher, unpublished observations. . Each of these substrates contains extensive secondary structure. Thus, based on its in vitro catalytic properties (5Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21624-21629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and its already known in vivo functions, it is most likely that elevated RNase R would be used to help degrade structured RNAs under stress conditions. It has been suggested that RNase R plays a role in maturation of tmRNA during cold shock (8Cairrao F. Cruz A. Mori H. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, we consider this unlikely as the processive nature of RNase R makes it ill-suited to function as a maturation RNase. Moreover, in Caulobacter, its action on mature and precursor forms of tmRNA is degradative, and it is not used for maturation (12Hong S-J. Tran Q-A. Keiler K.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fact, RNase R has not yet been shown to participate in the maturation of any RNA molecule. Rather, all its known functions are in degrading RNAs (6Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 313-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Li Z. Reimers S. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Considering this information, and the fact that rRNA, the major cellular RNA, is known to be degraded during stationary phase and starvation (2Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45041-45044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we speculate that elevated RNase R is needed for this process. Perhaps, during cold shock, a significant portion of newly made ribosomes are misassembled, and RNase R is required for their destruction as well, akin to its known role in rRNA quality control (7Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as PNPase also is known to participate in rRNA quality control (7Cheng Z-F. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6388-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is interesting that this enzyme also is elevated during cold shock (17Zangrossi S. Briani F. Ghisotti D. Regonesi M.E. Totora P. Deho G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1470-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Mathy N. Jarriage A.C. Robert-Le Meur M. Portier C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3848-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Beran R.K. Simons R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whether PNPase is similarly elevated in stationary phase and during starvation is to our knowledge not known. It would be of interest to examine this point. Based on the information presented here, RNase R appears to be an important stress protein, and consequently, RNA degradation may be an important component of the stress response. Examination of the mechanism of its regulation during stress and of the consequences of its absence under stress conditions should greatly increase our understanding of the stress response and of the importance of RNA turnover for this process. We thank Dr. Chaitanya Jain and members of the laboratory for helpful discussions and comments."

This devastation can be prevented by the nonpathogenic biocontrol agent A. radiobacter K84, which prevents disease by production of the ""Trojan horse"" toxin agrocin 84, which is specifically imported into tumorgenic A. tumefaciens strains to cause cell death. We demonstrate that this biocontrol agent targets A. tumefaciens leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), an essential enzyme for cell viability, while the agent itself survives by having a second, self-protective copy of the synthetase. In principle, this strategy from nature could be applied to other crop diseases by direct intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2080877775,"Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from pre-existing ones, occurs through dynamic functions of the endothelial cells (EC), including migration, which is essential to achieve an organized formation of the vessel sprout. We demonstrated previously that an aspirin-triggered lipoxin analog, 15-epi-16-(para-fluoro)-phenoxy-lipoxin A4 (ATL-1), inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced EC migration. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ATL-1 in the actin cytoskeleton reorganization of EC stimulated with VEGF. Pretreatment of EC with ATL-1 caused a reduction in VEGF-induced stress fibers and therefore reduced the intracellular content of filamentous actin. A concomitant impairment in stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK2/p38) phosphorylation suggests that ATL inhibition of VEGF-stimulated actin polymerization involves the SAPK2/p38 pathway. Moreover, ATL-1 treatment inhibited focal adhesion clustering due to inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and the subsequent association of FAK with the actin cytoskeleton. This final event, which ultimately allows cell migration, was reverted by an LX receptor antagonist, but not by a cys-LT1R antagonist, indicating an effect via the G-protein-linked LXA4 receptor. Together our results provide evidence that ATL-1 inhibits EC migration via the concerted inhibition of actin polymerization and proper assembly of focal adhesions, supporting a role for these novel lipid mediators as angiogenesis modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2079595036,"The stability of mRNA was investigated for the first time at the genomic scale during carbon starvation adaptation of Lactococcus lactis IL1403. In exponential phase, mRNA half-lives were correlated positively to open reading frame length. A polypurine sequence, AGGAG, was identified as a putative 5′-stabilizer and inverted repeated sequences as a 3′-destabilizer. These original findings suggested that multiple pathways of mRNA degradation should coexist: internal cleavage, endonuclease cleavage initiated at the 5′-end, and exonuclease attack at the 3′-end. During carbon starvation adaptation, mRNA stability globally increased, but specific mechanisms allowing a wide range of stabilization factors between genes and differential kinetic evolution were involved. A formal method allowing the quantification of the relative influences of transcription and degradation on the mRNA pool control was developed and applied in L. lactis. Gene expression was mostly controlled by altered transcription prior to carbon source exhaustion, while the influence of mRNA stability increased during the starvation phase. This study highlighted that stability modulation in response to adverse growth conditions can govern gene regulation to the same extent as transcription in bacteria.

This study highlighted that stability modulation in response to adverse growth conditions can govern gene regulation to the same extent as transcription in bacteria. In natural ecosystems, bacteria are often submitted to stress, and cells have naturally evolved to improve their resistance to these adverse growth conditions. The response against a particular stress involves various physiological adaptations (growth, catabolism, particular metabolism, cellular morphology) and is thus pleiotropic. Recently, the development of DNA array technology allowing the quantification of mRNAs of the entire genome has enabled the global transcriptional response to be characterized for a number of bacteria during different stress conditions. Because cellular mRNA concentration depends on the relative rates of synthesis and decay, changes in the mRNA pool can occur either by transcriptional control or by modification of the susceptibility of the mRNA to degradation. However, mRNA stability has rarely been investigated at the genomic scale. Messenger half-lives have been measured in order to identify stability determinants in only two different bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis (1Bernstein J.A. Khodursky A.B. Lin P.H.

Genome Res. 2003; 13: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no study concerning the evolution of the whole genome mRNA stability during response to environmental changes can be found in the literature. Bulk mRNA fate or particular mRNA half-life changes have been investigated (4Albertson N. Nystrom T. Kjelleberg S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2195-2199Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Albertson N.H. Nystrom T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Takayama K.

Genomics. 2004; 272: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but these data are not meaningful in the context of the overall physiological response. A more global study in Lactococcus lactis during acidic conditions was published (9Even S. Lindley N.D. Loubiere P. Cocaign-Bousquet M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but it was restricted to a particular functional category (central metabolism). Thus, although mRNA stability can potentially participate to the expression of the genome metabolic functions, the extent to which mRNA half-life regulation contributes to the regulation of gene expression has not yet been quantitatively established.L. lactis, a model bacterium for systems biology, is probably the most ingested bacteria by humans because of its widespread use in the food industry. This bacterium can adapt to various stresses (pH, osmotic, oxygen, nutrient starvation) that it encounters in the various environments in which it exists (natural ecosystems, industrial medium, digestive tract). One of the stress conditions receiving renewed interest is carbon starvation, because modifications of whole genome expression have been investigated for various Gram-positive bacteria such as L. lactis, B. subtilis, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (10Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 11Bernhardt J. Weibezahn J. Scharf C. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Redon E. Loubiere P. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, these studies have described changes in gene expression without taking into account the possible influence of mRNA stability. In this study, mRNA half-lives were measured in L. lactis during both optimal growth and progressive adaptation to carbon starvation under defined physiological growth conditions. These quantitative data for mRNA stability coupled to bioinformatics analysis have enabled stability determinants to be proposed. A formal method of metabolic control analysis was developed and used to evaluate the relative influence of mRNA degradation and transcription during the global response of this bacterium to carbon starvation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOrganism and Growth Conditions—The bacterium used throughout this study was L. lactis ssp. lactis IL1403, whose genome was entirely sequenced (13Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The strain was grown on the chemically defined CDM medium (14Otto R. Ten Brink B. Veldkamp H. Konings W.N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1983; 16: 69-74Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 700-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) complemented by glucose (55 mm) as the sole carbon source. Cultures were grown under anaerobic conditions in a 2-l fermentor (Setric Génie Industriel, Toulouse, France) at a constant temperature of 30 °C and agitation speed of 250 rpm. The pH was maintained at 6.6 by automatic addition of KOH (10 N). Bacterial growth was estimated by spectrophotometric measurement at 580 nm (1 Unity of absorbance is equivalent to 0.3 g·l-1), and glucose concentrations were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography as previously described (16Cocaign-Bousquet M. Guarrigues C. Novak L. Lindley N.D. Loubiere P. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1995; 79: 108-116Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cultures were monitored from the inoculation to 4 h after glucose exhaustion. Inoculation was realized with exponential phase cells from precultures grown in the same medium so as to obtain an initial A580 of 0.08.Determination of mRNA Half-lives—For mRNA half-life quantification, three growth conditions (exponential, deceleration, and carbon starvation phases) were studied in independent but physiologically identical cultures. At the required growth condition, transcription was arrested by rifampicin addition to a final concentration of 500 μg·ml-1. Cell samples were taken over 10 min in exponential phase or 45 min in deceleration and starvation phases. Four different time points, including the reference sample (before rifampicin addition), were analyzed simultaneously as described below (RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, hybridization, and detection). At least three independent time courses were analyzed for each condition. mRNA half-lives (t½) were calculated from the degradation rate constant (k) corresponding to the slope of a semi-logarithmic plot of mRNA amount as a function of time with the relation t½ = ln2/k. Raw data of mRNA half-lives were filtered with a minimum regression coefficient of 0.7 and a limit of precision in the repetitions corresponding to the mean value of standard deviation (40% in the exponential phase and 60% in the deceleration and starvation phases). The complete lists of half-lives calculated during the three phases are available at biopuce.insa-toulouse.fr/supdata/rna-decay-2005/.RNA Extraction—A volume of culture corresponding to 6 mg (dry weight) of cells was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Before cell lysis, each sample was centrifuged (4 °C, 5 min, 8000 rpm), washed with 1 ml of TE buffer (Tris-HCl 10 mm, pH8, EDTA 1 mm) and resuspended in 500 μl of TE buffer. Cells were disrupted at 4 °C (3 cycles of 1 min interspaced by 3-min cooling periods) on a minibead beater (Biospec Products) with glass beads (0.6 g), 50 μl of SDS (10%), and 500 μl of phenol (pH 4.7). After centrifugation to eliminate cell debris and phenol (4 °C, 25 min, 13,000 rpm), half of the aqueous phase containing RNA was extracted with a RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen), including the DNase I treatment described in the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified at 260 and 280 nm, and RNA quality was controlled on electrophoresis-agarose gel in denaturing conditions.cDNA Preparation—For cDNA synthesis, 10 or 15 μg of total RNA was mixed with 1 μl of random hexamer primers (500 ng·μl-1; Sigma Genosys), 1 μl of Eurogentec L. lactis open reading frame-specific primers (500 ng·μl-1), and sterile water to a final volume of 24 μl. The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 5 min and then immediately cooled to 4 °C. Reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 42°C in a total volume of 50 μl, with SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (300 units; Invitrogen), dithiothreitol (10 mm; Invitrogen), dATP, dGTP, dTTP (0.3 mm each), and [α-33P]dCTP (50 μCi; Amersham Biosciences) and 5× first strand buffer (1×; Invitrogen). After 1 h, SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (100 units) and dCTP (0.1 mm) were added and the reaction performed for one more hour at 42 °C. Reaction was stopped by heating (15 min at 70 °C), and the remaining RNA was hydrolyzed by RNase H (2 units, 20 min, 37 °C; Invitrogen). Before hybridization, labeled cDNA was purified on Microspin G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Hybridization and Detection—L. lactis IL1403-specific PCR products were spotted in duplicate on positively charged nylon membranes (4 deposits/spot; Plateforme Génomique, Toulouse). A single PCR/open reading frame (ORF) 2The abbreviations used are:ORFopen reading frameUTRuntranslated region was designed by Eurogentec. PCRs covered ∼71% of each ORF length (mean length 535 bp and final concentration between 40 and 180 μg·ml-1). 2053 ORFs of the 2310 identified on the genome were effectively available. Prior to hybridization, membranes were washed for 5 min in 50 ml of 2× SSPE (SSPE 1× is 0.18 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and prehybridized for 3 h at 68°C in 5 ml of hybridization buffer (5× SSPE, 2% SDS, 1× Denhardt's reagent). Labeled cDNA was heated for 10 min at 95 °C and immediately cooled at 4 °C for 5 min. Membrane hybridization was carried out for 15 h at 68 °C with 5 ml of hybridization buffer containing labeled and denatured cDNA. Membranes were then washed three times in 50 ml of washing solution (0.5× SSPE, 0.2% SDS) for 5 min at room temperature and three times in 50 ml of preheated washing solution for 20 min at 68 °C. Dried membranes were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 3 days and scanned with a phosphofluoroimager (Storm 860; Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization signals were quantified and assigned to gene names with the Bioplot software (developed by S. Sokol in Plateforme Génomique, Toulouse). After background removal, spots with intensities below the detection limit, defined as the mean intensity of “empty” spots, were removed.mRNA Concentration Calculation—mRNA concentrations were used both to analyze the stability determinants of mRNA half-lives and to quantify the influence of stability control on gene expression. The three growth conditions (exponential, deceleration, and carbon starvation phases) were previously characterized from the transcriptional viewpoint (12Redon E. Loubiere P. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but values were recalculated to obtain mRNA concentrations rather than abundances. Raw data were standardized by the all spots' mean intensity of the exponential phase and corrected by total RNA concentration in each growth condition (11.7 ± 1.3, 7.6 ± 0.8, and 8.2 ± 1.4 g (100 g dried cells-1) in exponential, deceleration, and starvation phases respectively).RESULTSStability Determinants in Exponential Growth—mRNA stability was examined with DNA arrays during the exponential growth of L. lactis on glucose CDM medium, and 817 different mRNA half-lives were quantified simultaneously. mRNA half-lives of genes adhE, ccpA, and tpi were confirmed with Northern blot analysis (data not shown) and previous data obtained with fluorescent labeling (17Fontaine L. Even S. Soucaille P. Lindley N.D. Cocaign-Bousquet M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Though the large majority of half-lives (90%) ranged from 1.4 to 10 min, data were scattered between 1.4 and 74 min, (Fig. 1A), and the mean half-life was affected by a strong standard deviation (5.8 ± 5.6, TABLE ONE). To better understand this half-life disparity, correlations between mRNA half-lives and various transcript features were investigated. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was considered statistically significant when associated p values obtained by Student's t test were lower than 10-3. An inverse relationship between log-transformed mRNA half-life and ORF length (p = 2·10-4, r = -0.13) was observed. Neither study of particular messenger stability (18Belasco J.G. Nilsson G. von Gabain A. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1986; 46: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Regnier P. Arraiano C.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) nor genome-wide analysis of mRNA half-life (1Bernstein J.A. Khodursky A.B. Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) had allowed such a relationship to be established with other organisms, so this may be specific to L. lactis. Transcript degradation rate is generally considered to be limited by endonucleolytic cleavage of the messenger (20DiMari J.F. Bechhofer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

This step is achieved in E. coli by RNase E that preferentially cleaves single-stranded A+U-rich regions (23McDowall K.J. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10790-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in L. lactis no significant correlation was observed between mRNA half-lives and A+U content in ORFs. Most of the discrete stability determinants previously identified have been located in 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) (18Belasco J.G. Nilsson G. von Gabain A. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1986; 46: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Condon C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Nierlich D.P.

The UTRs, not formally identified in L. lactis because its genome was not entirely annotated, were defined by 100-bp non-ORF overlapping upstream and downstream sequences in agreement with the 84- and 79-bp mean length of E. coli 5′- and 3′-UTRs (1Bernstein J.A. Khodursky A.B. Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). To identify stabilizing or destabilizing determinants in these presumed UTRs, an RSA-tools interface was used with a background model (26van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J. J. Mol.

For the genes of the fourth quartile (stable messengers, t½ >6.7 min), an over-representation in the 5′-region of the purine-rich sequence AGGAG was highlighted and postulated to confer mRNA stability. Similarly, over-representation of two inverted repeated sequences, CTGTCAGTA and TACTGACAG, was observed in downstream sequences of first quartile genes (unstable messengers, t½ <2.8 min), suggesting a destabilizing effect for this feature.TABLE ONEmRNA half-life determination during carbon starvation adaptation of L. lactisExponential phaseDeceleration phaseStarvation phaseMean half-time (min)5.8 ± 5.617.6 ± 13.019.4 ± 10.0Median half-time (min)4.214.417.3 Open table in a new tab Because intracellular mRNA concentrations depend on the degradation rate, a comparison of messenger half-lives with their respective concentrations was carried out. mRNA concentrations of 2032 genes were quantified during exponential phase of L. lactis from the data of Redon et al. (12Redon E. Loubiere P. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” A significant inverse relationship between messenger half-lives and their respective concentrations (p = 3·10-4, r = -0.13) was obtained after log transformation, indicating that L. lactis genes with highest expression were less stable. This finding was surprising because highly expressed messengers were usually considered to be stable (24Nierlich D.P. Murakawa G.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 153-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, such an inverse correlation has already been observed in E. coli by whole genome analysis (1Bernstein J.A. Khodursky A.B. Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), suggesting that mRNA half-lives are not general predictors of messenger expression.Despite the fact that mRNA stability has often been suggested to be involved in cellular physiology, relationship between gene function and mRNA half-life has only rarely been formally demonstrated. Thus, mRNA half-life data were stratified using the functional classification described by Bolotin et al. (13Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), and a one-way analysis of variance led us to identify significant differences in mean half-lives (p <10-4) between metabolic functional categories. To evaluate the relative independence of the different functional categories, multiple Student's t tests were carried out (TABLE TWO). This approach revealed that seven functional categories (amino acid biosynthesis; cell envelope; cellular processes; fatty acid and phospholipid; purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides and nucleotides metabolism; regulatory functions; transport and binding proteins) exhibited significantly lower half-lives. Inversely, translation and the category named “other” (i.e. essentially phage- and prophage-related function genes) presented significantly higher half-lives.TABLE TWOMean mRNA half-life by functional categories during exponential growth of L. lactisFunctional categoryaFunctional categories defined by Bolotin et al.

Open table in a new tab Stability and Carbon Starvation Adaptation—The fate of whole genome messengers was investigated in L. lactis during progressive carbon starvation. As for previous experiments (12Redon E. Loubiere P. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the growth was exponential during the first 5 h of culture and stationary phase was reached when glucose was exhausted at 6 h of culture. Between 5 and 6 h of fermentation, growth rate decelerated with the progressive decrease of glucose concentration from a threshold level of 14 mm until zero. The mRNA stability was investigated at the genomic scale in transitional and stationary phases, and 452 and 579 messenger half-lives were measured, respectively (Fig. 1A). mRNA concentrations were also determined in each phase from the data of Redon et al. (12Redon E. Loubiere P. Cocaign-Bousquet M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), showing a general decreasing profile except for a minority of genes (1.6%). No correlation was found between the half-lives of mRNA observed in exponential phase and those measured in deceleration or starvation phases, suggesting that different mechanisms were controlling stability in the last two phases. Unlike in the exponential phase, no link between mRNA half-lives and functional categories was observed in either deceleration or starvation phases. In the deceleration phase, mRNA half-lives did not exhibit any significant correlation with ORF length or mRNA concentrations, and no predominant pattern was identified in 5′- or 3′-regions whatever the level of stability concerned. However, the stability pattern differed significantly during the starvation phase, because mRNA half-lives were found to be positively correlated to mRNA concentrations (log-transformed data, p = 2·10-11, r = 0.28). It should be noticed that the relationship between expression levels and mRNA half-lives was inverted compared with that seen in the exponential phase. Furthermore, the relationship described for the exponential phase cells between the highest messenger half-lives and the significant over-representation of the polypurine sequence AGGAG in upstream sequences (5′-region) was restored.An important increase of median half-lives in the deceleration and starvation phases (14.4 and 17.3 min, respectively) compared with exponential phase values was observed (TABLE ONE), indicating that mRNAs were globally stabilized in response to carbon starvation. Efficient and sensitive sensors should be involved in this mRNA decay phenomena, because the stabilization occurred before glucose exhaustion ([glucose] <14 mm). Stabilization factors, expressed as a ratio of half-lives, were calculated for each mRNA between the exponential and the deceleration phases and between the deceleration and stationary phases. As shown in Fig. 1B, the statistical partition of these ratios differed, and median ratio between exponential and deceleration phases was much higher than between deceleration and stationary phases (3.9 and 1.1, respectively). Taking into account the precision in stabilization factor determination, it was estimated that 92% of transcripts were stabilized during deceleration phase in comparison to exponential phase. The evolution of mRNA half-lives was more contrasted between deceleration and starvation phases, because 37% of messengers were further stabilized while 28% were destabilized. To get a more precise insight into this stabilization, features controlling stabilization factors were investigated. Stabilization factors were not linked to ORF length or base composition or functional categories. However, a significant negative correlation was observed between deceleration/exponential stabilization factors and exponential half-lives (p = 5·10-6, r = -0.29), indicating that the unstable messengers in exponential phase were those most stabilized during the transition phase, and inversely. This preferential stabilization of the most unstable messengers was confirmed between deceleration and starvation phases (p = 1·10-12, r = -0.52).mRNA Pool Regulation Analysis—Changes in mRNA concentrations in the cells can be achieved by changes in transcriptional and/or degradation rates. To quantify the relative importance of the two modes of regulation during carbon starvation adaptation, the approach developed by ter Kuile and Westerhoff (27ter Kuile B.H. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and adapted by Even et al. (28Even S. Lindley N.D. Cocaign-Bousquet M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1935-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used. At steady state, mRNA concentration can be expressed as a function of transcription rate VT and degradation constant rate k (VT = k·[mRNA] with k = ln2/t½). Dilution rate of the messengers due to cellular growth was neglected because generation time was in general significantly lower than the mRNA half-lives. Assuming that VT and k were independent, degradation (ρD) and transcription (ρT) regulation coefficients were defined as shown in Equation 1. ρD=−dlnkdln[mRNA], ρT=dlnVTdln[mRNA], ρD+ρT=1(Eq. 1) The degradation regulation coefficient ρD was calculated as the opposite slope of the double logarithmic plot of degradation rate k versus mRNA concentration between exponential and deceleration phases and between deceleration and starvation phases. Between exponential and deceleration phases 92% of genes exhibited low ρD values (ρD <0), indicating that mRNA concentrations were not controlled by degradation but mostly by transcription (Fig. 2). Between deceleration and starvation phases, the influence of the two modes of regulation was more balanced (Fig. 2). Indeed, mRNA concentration was still controlled at the transcriptional level for 51% of genes (ρD <0), whereas 25% of genes were controlled by degradation (ρD >1) and 24% presented a shared control (0 <ρD <1), indicating that mRNA stability plays a significant, if not overriding, effect on modulating the adaptation of this bacterium to carbon starvation.FIGURE 2Frequency of genes exhibiting regulation coefficient ρD inferior to 0 (transcriptional control), between 0 and 1 (shared control), and superior to 1 (degradation control) between exponential and deceleration phases (dotted column) and between deceleration and starvation phases (hatched column) during carbon starvation adaptation of L. lactis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONmRNA Degradation Mechanisms—This study provided the first characterization of whole genome mRNA decay in L. lactis and more generally in a lactic acid bacterium.

In response to severe growth conditions, the synthesis of many chaperones is up-regulated to cope with potentially harmful consequences of cellular stress such as protein unfolding and aggregation.

The high degree of sequence homology suggests that, despite their diverse functions, Hsp100/Clp proteins employ a common, ATP-dependent mechanism to exert their biological roles, for which the disruption of non-covalent interactions appears to be central (8.Dougan D.A. Mogk A. Zeth K. Turgay K. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among the Hsp100/Clp chaperones involved in cellular protein disaggregation, Hsp104 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its bacterial homologue ClpB are best understood on the molecular level. Like other members of the Hsp100/Clp family, both proteins assemble into ring-shaped hexamers. Several studies have shown that disaggregation is a complex process requiring the assistance of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE in bacteria and Ssa1/Ydj1, Sis1 in the yeast system (5.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 6.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed to describe the action of Hsp104/ClpB in substrate resolubilization. According to the “molecular crowbar” hypothesis, the flexible linker arms located at the perimeter of the Hsp104/ClpB oligomer serve as binding sites for aggregated polypeptides. In response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, a conformational change in these arms could provide the mechanical force necessary to disrupt protein aggregates (9.Ben Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10.Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 175-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). More recent findings favor an unfolding/threading mechanism similar to that observed for the protease-associated Hsp100 proteins ClpA and ClpX (12.Hoskins J.R. Pak M. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In this model, a single polypeptide chain is extracted from an aggregate by translocation through the central channel of Hsp104/ClpB (14.Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29139-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15.Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cell. 2004; 119: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These two mechanisms, however, are not mutually exclusive. In this case, multiple binding sites for polypeptide substrates may exist, e.g. in the linker and at the entrance and exit of the central channel. Hsp104 and ClpB contain two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), the sequences of which are highly conserved among Hsp100/Clp proteins (16.Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although mutational analyses have shown that both domains are essential for chaperone activity (17.Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 18.Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17615-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), their respective roles in disaggregation are rather ill defined. In the case of the yeast chaperone, NBD1 was shown to be highly active under steady-state conditions, whereas NBD2 is a weak ATPase and seems to have more of a regulatory function by promoting the nucleotide-dependent hexamerization of the chaperone (20.Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21.Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the case of ClpB from Escherichia coli both NBDs seem to contribute to the steady-state ATPase to a similar extent. Also, nucleotide binding to NBD1 rather than to NBD2 was found to be important for oligomerization (19.Mogk A. Schlieker C. Strub C. Rist W. Weibezahn J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17615-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22.Barnett M.E. Zolkiewski M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11277-11283Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To what degree these differences are relevant for the mechanism of disaggregation is arguable, as recent studies indicate an intimate cross-talk between both NBDs (23.Watanabe Y.H. Takano M. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24562-24567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the interaction of an unfolded polypeptide with Hsp104. Based on these experiments, we propose a model that links ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp104 with substrate binding and release. Our results show that, with respect to polypeptide binding, Hsp104 cycles between a low affinity ADP-bound state and a high affinity, ATP-bound state. Although the latter form of Hsp104 is barely populated under conditions of steady-state hydrolysis, it accumulates in the presence of a slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue such as ATPγS or when a mutant defective in ATP hydrolysis is used. We also determined the contribution of the NBDs to substrate binding. When ATP binding to NBD1 was impaired by mutation, Hsp104 lost its ability to interact with substrates, whereas a mutant defective in nucleotide binding to NBD2 showed no such defect. Once the substrate is bound to the chaperone, it becomes kinetically trapped. Its release depends on the hydrolysis of the bound ATP, thus ensuring that the energy generated by ATP hydrolysis can be used for the remodeling of the substrate. This tight coupling between ATP binding and hydrolysis on the one side and substrate binding and release on the other side may reflect a general feature of AAA+ ATPase family members. Cloning of Hsp104 Variants and Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis of Hsp104 was performed using polymerase chain reaction with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A plasmid carrying the Hsp104 gene was used as template for mutagenesis (24.Grimminger V. Richter K. Imhof A. Buchner J. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7378-7383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The following mutations were introduced using appropriate mutagenesis primers: 1) K218T (AAG to ACC), 2) E285Q (GAA to CAG), and 3) K620T (AAA to ACC). The Hsp104TRAP variant was obtained by introducing the mutation E687Q (GAA to CAG) into the gene of the E285Q single mutant. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. After overproduction in E. coli strain BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) wild type and mutant forms of Hsp104 were purified as described previously (24.Grimminger V. Richter K. Imhof A. Buchner J. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7378-7383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All concentrations of Hsp104 are given with respect to the monomeric form. Fluorescein Labeling of α-Lactalbumin—10 mg/ml α-lactalbumin (Sigma) were labeled by adding 2.3 mm fluorescein isothiocyanate as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). The protein was purified via Sephadex G25 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 0.2 m Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, concentrated to a final concentration of 1.3 mm and carboxymethylated (see below). Preparation of Reduced, Carboxymethylated α-Lactalbumin (RCMLa)—1.3 mm α-lactalbumin was unfolded and reduced in 0.2 m Tris/HCl, 7 m guanidinium chloride, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.7, for 90 min at room temperature. Subsequently, iodoacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.1 m. After 20 min of incubation under dark room conditions, the reaction was quenched with an excess of reduced glutathione in 0.2 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The derivatized protein was purified using a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Samples containing Hsp104, fluorescein-labeled RCMLa (f-RCMLa), and nucleotides at various concentrations were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in standard buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). 80 μl of the sample were separated on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (w/v), pH 7.5. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance of f-RCMLa was monitored at 494 nm. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Complex formation between Hsp104 and RCMLa was analyzed using fluorescence anisotropy. Hsp104 and f-RCMLa at various concentrations were incubated in standard buffer at 30 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, ATP, ATPγS, or ADP was added at different concentrations. The increase in fluorescence anisotropy upon f-RCMLa binding to Hsp104 was measured in a thermostated Fluoromax-3 fluorescence spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon-Horiba, Munich, Germany) equipped with autopolarizers. Monochromators were set to 494 nm (excitation) and 515 nm (emission), respectively. Once the anisotropy signal had reached the steady-state level, release of bound f-RCMLa was monitored by following the decrease in anisotropy after addition of a 150-fold excess of unlabeled RCMLa over f-RCMLa or a 40-fold excess of ADP over ATP. ATPγS Hydrolysis—Rates of ATPγS hydrolysis were determined by incubating 5 μm Hsp104 and 30 μm RCMLa in standard buffer at 30 °C. The reaction was started by adding 2.5 mm ATPγS containing 32 nm [35S]ATPγS. Aliquots (5 μl) were taken at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 90 min, and hydrolysis was stopped with 10 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm EDTA. To determine ratios of ATPγS and released thiophosphate, reaction mixtures were separated on polyethylene terephthalate-cellulose TLC plates using 0.4 m LiCl, 1.5 m formic acid as the mobile phase. Spot intensities were quantified on a phosphor screen with a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Refolding of Denatured Luciferase—Firefly luciferase (7 μm) (Promega) was denatured for 30 min at room temperature in 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm dithioerythritol, 7 m urea. Refolding was initiated by 125-fold dilution in 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 240 μm coenzyme A, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mm luciferin, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase as described previously (25.Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As chaperones, 2.5 μm Hsp104, 1 μm Ssa1, and 1 μm Sis1 were present. Refolding kinetics at 25 °C were recorded for 120 min using a luminometer (Tecan GENios, Crailsheim, Germany). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-visible and interference optics. Rotation speed for sedimentation was 50,000, 55,000, or 60,000 rpm (Ti-60 rotor). Data scans were recorded continuously throughout the experiment using the absorption optical system at 280 nm or the Rayleigh interference optics. Alumina double sector centerpieces were used that contained buffer and protein solution (5 μm) in separate chambers. Measurements were carried out in standard buffer at 30 °C. In addition, samples contained 1 mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, or 2.5 mm ATPγS. Data analysis was performed using the ultrascan software by B. Demeler (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Dynamic Light Scattering—The diffusion coefficient of Hsp104 was determined by dynamic light scattering. Experiments were performed at a scattering angle of 90° using an AXIOS-150 apparatus (Triton-Hellas) with a 35-milliwatt diode laser operating at 658 nm. Conditions were 5–20 μm Hsp104WT, with and without 1 mm ADP in standard buffer at 20 °C. The particle distributions were obtained using Provencher's regularized Laplace inversion CONTIN algorithm for the autocorrelation function (26.Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2556) Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficient D and the sedimentation coefficient s20,w were used to calculate the molecular mass (M) of Hsp104 according to the Svedberg equation, s20,wD=m(1-v¯ρ)RTeq 1 in which v is the partial specific volume of Hsp104 (0.737 ml/g) and ρ is the density of water. Substrate Binding to Hsp104 Is Dependent on the Presence of ATP— Hsp104 was shown to support the refolding of aggregated enzymes such as luciferase in vitro (5.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar), but attempts to obtain stable chaperone ·polypeptide complexes have been futile so far. To investigate the requirements for polypeptide binding to Hsp104, we used reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLa) as a substrate. This protein is highly soluble and permanently unfolded (27.Hayer-Hartl M.K. Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28.Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and no side reactions such as folding or aggregation can compete with chaperone binding. Furthermore, RCMLa has been shown to moderately stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 (29.Cashikar A.G. Schirmer E.C. Hattendorf D.A. Glover J.R. Ramakrishnan M.S. Ware D.M. Lindquist S.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As expected, we were unable to detect binding of f-RCMLa to Hsp104 using size exclusion chromatography, irrespective of whether ATP, ADP, or no nucleotide was present. Only when the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS was used, a slight decrease in the elution time of f-RCMLa was observed (data not shown) indicating a transient interaction with the chaperone. This suggested that only the ATP state of Hsp104 is capable of polypeptide binding, similar to what has been found for other AAA+ ATPases including the bacterial Hsp104 homologue ClpB (30.Pak M.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32608-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because Hsp104 is a fast ATPase with a kcat of ∼70 min–1 (20.Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24.Grimminger V. Richter K. Imhof A. Buchner J. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7378-7383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the lifetime of the ATP state presumably is too short to detect substrate complexes in SEC analysis. We therefore constructed an Hsp104 variant that can still bind ATP (but is unable to hydrolyze it) by replacing two conserved Glu residues in the Walker B motifs of both NBDs with Gln (E285Q/E687Q) (31.Weibezahn J. Schlieker C. Bukau B. Mogk A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32608-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32.Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data summarized in TABLE ONE demonstrate that this double mutant, Hsp104TRAP, binds ADP with a slightly higher affinity than the wild type protein but displays no ATPase activity. Moreover, the structure of Hsp104 was found to be unaffected by the mutations we introduced, as assessed by far UV CD spectroscopy (see supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE ONENucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of Hsp 104WT and Hsp104TRAPE285Q/E687QWild typeKD (ATP)4 μmNDKD (ADP)16 μm50 μmkcat<0.05 min-170 min-1 Open table in a new tab When the trap mutant was incubated with f-RCMLa and ATP, we detected a substrate-specific peak (λ = 494 nm) at the position of the Hsp104 hexamer in SEC analysis, i.e. the formation of stable Hsp104TRAP ·ATP·RCMLa complexes (Fig. 1A). Apparently, the inability of the mutant to hydrolyze bound ATP traps it in a state with a high affinity for polypeptides. When ADP or no nucleotide was present during incubation, no complexes were observed, indicating that substrate binding to Hsp104TRAP is strictly ATP-dependent. SEC-HPLC has the disadvantage of being a slow non-equilibrium method, and labile complexes may irreversibly dissociate during the time course of analysis. Thus, we employed fluorescence anisotropy as an alternative probe to monitor binding of f-RCMLa to Hsp104. The anisotropy signal of a fluorophore depends on its size or more precisely on its rotational correlation time τR (33.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 291-346Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, free f-RCMLa (15 kDa) should display a smaller fluorescence anisotropy compared with the large Hsp104·f-RCMLa complex (>600 kDa). The anisotropy signal of f-RCMLa did not change when Hsp104TRAP was added without nucleotide (data not shown), supporting our finding that substrate binding is ATP-dependent. Upon addition of ATP fluorescence anisotropy strongly increased, indicating an increase in τR of f-RCMLa because of its binding to the chaperone (Fig. 1B). Again, ADP was not able to trigger complex formation. When Hsp104WT was used instead of the trap mutant, binding of RCMLa was only observed in the presence of ATPγS but not ATP (Fig. 1C), consistent with our SEC-HPLC data. We also examined whether the different substrate affinities observed in the presence of ADP and ATP are related to changes in the oligomeric state of the chaperone. In both ADP and ATP, analytical ultracentrifugation yielded sedimentation coefficients, s, of ∼16 S (Fig. 2 and TABLE TWO), in agreement with data obtained for hexameric ClpB (34.Liu Z. Tek V. Akoev V. Zolkiewski M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The integral distribution plot (Fig. 2B) shows that Hsp104 sediments as a single species. Nevertheless, an s value of ∼16 S appears to be remarkably small for a 612-kDa protein such as hexameric Hsp104. An accurate determination of the molecular weight from sedimentation velocity data also requires knowledge of the translational diffusion coefficient D. Using dynamic light scattering, we obtained a value of D = 2.5·10–7 cm2/s. In combination with s = 16 S, this yields a molecular mass of 596 kDa, demonstrating that Hsp104 is completely hexameric under the conditions of our experiments. This conclusion is supported by sedimentation equilibrium analysis of Hsp104, in which Hsp104 was found to consist of a single species of 611 kDa (see supplemental Fig. 2).TABLE TWOOligomeric state of Hsp104 in the presence of nucleotidesNucleotideHsp104WTK218TK620TE285Q/E687QATPNDNDND16.3 SATPγS16.5 S15.9 S15.5 S16.0 SADP15.5 S16.5 SND16.2 S Open table in a new tab Thus, hexamer formation alone (as in the presence of ADP) is not sufficient to trigger substrate binding. Rather an ATP-induced conformational change within the hexamer must be responsible. NBD1 Regulates the Affinity of Hsp104 for Polypeptides—As Hsp104 contains two nucleotide-binding domains, we tried to assess their roles in polypeptide binding. The mutation of two conserved lysine residues in the Walker A motifs of Hsp104, Lys218 and Lys620, strongly reduces the affinity of the affected NBD for nucleotides, 4V. Grimminger and S. Walter, unpublished results. similar to what has been found for Thermus thermophilus ClpB (35.Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consequently, the respective mutants only bind nucleotides in the wild type-like NBD but not in the mutated NBD. Fig. 3A shows that the K620T variant of Hsp104, in which only NBD1 can be occupied by nucleotide, still forms complexes with f-RCMLa in the presence of ATPγS. The K218T mutation, in contrast, results in a complete loss of polypeptide binding. These findings strongly suggest that polypeptide substrates can only bind to Hsp104 when NBD1 is occupied with ATP or ATPγS. To confirm the importance of NBD1, we employed a more stringent assay for Hsp104 function, the disaggregation of luciferase. The K218T mutant, which was unable to bind RCMLa in our anisotropy experiments, also failed to recover any luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). The K620T variant exhibited a significant although reduced disaggregation activity when compared with Hsp104WT. This demonstrates that whereas a functional NBD2 may be dispensable for substrate interaction, it is necessary for efficient disaggregation. The inability of the NBD1 mutant to resolubilize protein aggregates is readily explained by our finding that substrate interaction is crucially dependent on ATP binding to NBD1. Release of Bound Polypeptide Is Triggered by ATP Hydrolysis—After having determined the requirements for substrate binding to Hsp104, we next investigated the mode of substrate release. In principle, polypeptides could either dissociate from Hsp104 before ATP hydrolysis occurs or remain associated during the hydrolysis step. Likely, only the second pathway is productive, as current models of disaggregation suggest that the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis is used to induce a conformational change in the bound polypeptide (10.Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.H. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T. Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 36.Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To determine the fate of the bound substrate, ternary complexes between Hsp104 and f-RCMLa were formed as described above. Once fluorescence anisotropy had reached a plateau indicating steady state, we chased the complexes with either (i) a 150-fold excess of unlabeled RCMLa over f-RCMLa or with (ii) a 40-fold excess of ADP over ATP. In both cases, f-RCMLa should be released irreversibly, either because (i) Hsp104 will preferentially reassociate with unlabeled RCMLa or because (ii) excess ADP prevents the binding of ATP necessary to maintain the high affinity state of the chaperone. When experiments were carried out with hydrolytically inactive Hsp104TRAP, the anisotropy signal did not change after the addition of unlabeled RCMLa, irrespective of whether complexes had been formed with ATP or ATPγS. Apparently, the dissociation rate of f-RCMLa is very small and prevents the exchange of bound f-RCMLa with free, unlabeled substrate (Fig. 4A). A very similar result was obtained when the chase was carried out with excess ADP (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the trap mutant, Hsp104WT·ATPγS was able to release bound f-RCMLa after addition of either unlabeled RCMLa or ADP, as indicated by the decrease in the anisotropy signal (Fig. 4, filled squares). Intriguingly, the rate constant of dissociation (∼0.12 min–1) was the same for both types of chase experiments suggesting that the same molecular step triggers release. Furthermore, our observation that only hydrolytically active Hsp104 can exchange the bound substrate suggests that polypeptide release is tightly coupled with ATP hydrolysis and the concomitant transition of the chaperone into its low affinity ADP state. Under the conditions of our anisotropy experiments, Hsp104WT hydrolyzes [35S]ATPγS ∼30 times more slowly (kapp = 0.9 min–1) than ATP. This rate is ∼6 times higher than the rate of substrate release, suggesting that multiple hydrolysis events may be required. One could argue that the release of f-RCMLa from Hsp104WT·ATPγS simply reflects that these ternary complexes are more dynamic than Hsp104TRAP·ATP complexes and is not related to hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide. Because the rate of ATPγS hydrolysis is significantly larger than the rate of substrate dissociation, ATPγS becomes hydrolyzed before the polypeptide is released. Polypeptide Binding to Hsp104·ATP Reduces the Dynamics of Nucleotide Exchange—The observation that ADP is not able to trigger the dissociation of f-RCMLa from ternary Hsp104TRAP·ATP complexes (Fig. 4B) is remarkable and implies that the exchange of nucleotide in NBD1 must be very slow. Otherwise, ADP should displace ATP and induce the low affinity state of Hsp104. To investigate whether slow nucleotide exchange is a direct consequence of the bound polypeptide, we carried out order-of-addition experiments (see flow chart in Fig. 5). First, Hsp104TRAP was incubated with ATP for 10 min to generate the high affinity state. When f-RCM"

In addition to these conserved functions, we show that E2 proteins from high risk HPV types 16 and 18, which are associated with cervical cancer, can induce apoptosis. In contrast, E2 proteins from low risk HPV types 6 and 11, which are associated with benign lesions, do not cause cell death. We show that the ability to induce apoptosis is linked to the intracellular localization of the respective E2 proteins rather than to inherent properties of the proteins. Although low risk HPV E2 proteins remain strictly nuclear, high risk HPV E2 proteins are present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of expressing cells due to exportin-1 receptor (CRM1)-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. Induction of apoptosis is caused by accumulation of E2 in the cytoplasm and involves caspase 8 activation. We speculate that disruption of the E2 gene during viral genome integration in cervical carcinoma provides a means to avoid E2-induced apoptosis and allow initiation of carcinogenesis.

Human papillomaviruses are the etiologic agents of cervical cancer, and they are found associated with more than 90% of this type of cancer.

The class of high risk HPVs associated with cervical carcinoma expresses two oncogenes, E6 and E7, which transform the cells by negatively interfering with the p53 and pRB pathways (1Werness B.A. Levine A.J.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3431) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E6 and E7 proteins of low risk HPVs have been shown to be unable to induce cellular transformation in vitro (for review, see Ref. 3Munger K. Howley P.M. Virus Res. 2002; 89: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar).The HPV E2 protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. E2 proteins are transcription factors that can repress transcription of the E6 and E7 genes of the genital papillomaviruses independently of their oncogenic potential (4Thierry F. Yaniv M.

Other properties of the E2 proteins are also conserved, such as their ability to activate transcription of heterologous promoters containing at least two E2 binding sites in a specific configuration and to activate viral DNA replication in concert with the E1 helicase (13Desaintes C. Demeret C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Comparative analyses of E2 proteins of high risk and low risk HPV viruses suggested a high degree of conservation in their three-dimensional structure, compatible with their conserved functions in viral DNA replication and transcription (14Hegde R.S.

In particular, proapoptotic activity has been demonstrated for the HPV18 E2 protein (18Desaintes C. Goyat S. Garbay S. Yaniv M. Thierry F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 87-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and was shown to be an intrinsic property independent of transcription (18Desaintes C. Goyat S. Garbay S.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More recently, an interaction between E2 and mitotic chromosomes was described through direct interaction with Brd4, a bromodomain protein associated with acetylated chromatin (21You J. Croyle J.L. Nishimura A. Ozato K. Howley P.M. Cell. 2004; 117: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). E2 is also associated with the mitotic spindles via tubulin interactions, which was proposed to take part in the segregation of viral genomes during cell division (22Van Tine B.A. Dao L.D. Wu S.Y. Sonbuchner T.M. Lin B.Y. Zou N. Chiang C.M. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, we also recently described a novel interaction of high risk HPV E2 proteins with activators of the mitotic ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) which, by inhibiting the degradation of various APC/C substrates, results in a strong genomic instability (23Bellanger S. Blachon S. Mechali F. Bonne-Andrea C. Thierry F. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These additional functions of the E2 proteins are mediated by direct interactions with cellular proteins rather than through transcriptional control and were shown to be independent of other viral functions.The E2 proteins are composed of three distinct domains that can be expressed separately and retain their function (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain forms a small β-barrel dimer which binds to specific recognition sequences on the DNA (25Hegde R.S. Androphy E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A hinge domain, with no specific structure, mainly serves as a flexible linker between the two functional domains. The amino-terminal domain is composed of two sub-domains separated by a fulcrum; one contains three α-helices (at its amino-terminal end), and the other is composed of a succession of β-sheets (at its carboxyl-terminal end) (15Abbate E.A. Berger J.M. Botchan M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1981-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Antson A.A. Burns J.E. Moroz O.V. Scott D.J. Sanders C.M. Bronstein I.B. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Maitland N.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain retains functions of E2 involved in regulating transcription and replication. Above all, it has been shown to interact with cellular proteins involved in transactivation as well as with the E1 helicase that activates viral DNA replication (15Abbate E.A. Berger J.M.

Cell. 2004; 117: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Other characteristics, such as ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as induction of apoptosis (19Demeret C. Garcia-Carranca A. Thierry F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) involve this domain. The proapoptotic property of HPV18 E2 has been shown to depend on induction of the extrinsic pathway through activation of caspase 8 (19Demeret C. Garcia-Carranca A. Thierry F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of this activation is not yet understood, but it appears that E2 activates caspase 8 through direct protein-protein interaction. 5C. Demeret and F. Thierry, unpublished data. 5C. Demeret and F. Thierry, unpublished data. Induction of apoptosis has also been shown to occur with the HPV16 E2 protein, although the mechanism is not fully understood (20Webster K. Parish J. Pandya M. Stern P.L. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 87-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In the present work we sought to examine whether some of the autonomous properties of the HPV E2 proteins could differ among virus types, as was shown before for the E6 and E7 proteins. We examined whether the proapoptotic property of the HPV18 E2 protein is conserved among E2 proteins of other genital HPV subtypes. We fused GFP at the amino terminus of the HPV16, HPV11, and HPV6 E2 proteins and used recombinant adenoviruses to express them as previously described for HPV18 E2 (19Demeret C. Garcia-Carranca A. Thierry F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of the E2 proteins appeared strikingly different; the E2 proteins from low risk viruses HPV6 and HPV11 were exclusively nuclear, whereas proteins from high risk viruses were located in both the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. We show that HPV18 E2 protein actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the infected cells and that partial cytoplasmic localization of high risk E2 proteins correlates with induction of apoptosis through caspase 8 activation. In contrast E2 proteins of low risk HPVs do not induce apoptosis due to their exclusive nuclear localization. These experiments point to important differences in the biological functions of the E2 proteins from high and low risk papillomaviruses infecting the anogenital tract.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Plasmids and Recombinant Adenoviruses—E2 ORFs of wild-type HPV16, HPV6, and HPV11 viruses and the different mutants were cloned in the pEGFP-C1 expression plasmid (Clontech) as previously done for the HPV18 E2 ORF (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The E2 open reading frames of HPV6 and -11 were cloned by PCR from PCR3-E2 (a kind gift of J. Archambault) in-frame with the carboxyl terminus of GFP. Expression cassettes of the various GFP fusion proteins were introduced in place of the E1A-E1B region in replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses by a two-step procedure in bacteria as described previously (19Demeret C. Garcia-Carranca A. Thierry F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Crouzet J. Naudin L. Orsini C. Vigne E. Ferrero L. Le Roux A. Benoit P. Latta M. Torrent C.

Recombinant adenoviruses were produced and amplified in 293 cells. Viruses were subsequently purified on CsCl gradients and titrated. Adenovirus expressing the GFP alone was purchased from Quantum. Conventional PCR-based mutagenesis was used to introduce point mutations AT to RK at position 246 and 247 and an insertion of an arginine at position 250 of the amino acids sequence of the HPV18 E2 ORF as well as mutations KR to TH at position 107 and 108 and RK to AT at position 238 and 239 of the amino acid sequence of the HPV11 E2 ORF.The deleted mutant GFP-E2 del 26 was prepared by exchanging the XhoI-StuI fragment digested from the pXLGFP-E2 previously described (19Demeret C. Garcia-Carranca A. Thierry F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by an XhoI-StuI fragment prepared from a PCR amplification with a specific primer containing an XhoI site at the 5′ end, 5′-AAAACTCGAGCTAGTAAAGACATAGACAGC-3′, and a 3′ primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCACTGCACATAGAGTCATTAC-3′. The deleted mutant GFP-E2 del53 was cloned from PCR amplification from position 53 of the amino acid sequence to the end of the HPV18 E2 open reading frame, with specific primers containing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites for cloning in-frame with the carboxyl terminus of the GFP: 5′-CGAATTCCGGCATACAGACATTAAACCAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGGATCCTTACATTGTCATGTATCCC-3′ (restriction site are indicated in boldface).The putative nuclear export sequence (NES) was amplified by PCR from HPV18 E2 with specific primers containing the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites for cloning in-frame with the carboxyl terminus of the GFP nuclear localization signals (NLS) expression plasmid previously described (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The primers used were 5′-CGCGGATCCGACATAGACAGCCAAATACAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCTAGATTAAAAGAATATTGCATTTTCCC-3′.Cell Cultures, Transient Transfections, and Infections—MCF7 and HeLa cells were grown in 6- or 10-cm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. Saos-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections of HeLa cells were done by the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique, as previously described (5Demeret C. Yaniv M. Thierry F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7075-7082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with 5 or 10 μg of the GFP expression plasmids in 6-cm Petri dishes.Infections were done at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) varying from 200 to 1000 with the various recombinant adenoviruses. Cells were incubated with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum containing the adenovirus dilutions complemented with 4 μm Polybrene for Saos-2 and MCF7 cells for 1 h at 37 °C.When indicated, cells were treated with the pan caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) (40 μm, Biomol) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO, added in the medium just after infection. 24 h post-infection cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma). Inhibition of the proteasome was obtained by treating the cells with 10 μm lactacystin (Calbiochem) for 6h.For video microscopy, treated cells were transferred in a thermostatted chamber (7% CO2 at 37 °C) under the objective of the microscope, where they were maintained for 4 h. Images were captured every 5 min in phase contrast and in fluorescence using a 20× objective on an Axiovert Zeiss microscope. Images were processed by the Metamorph software and converted to Adobe Photoshop.Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells grown on cover slips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after infection or transfection and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. After rehydration, cells were permeabilized and saturated with PBS containing 2% serum and 0.1% Triton for 30 min. They were then incubated with primary antibodies anti-p53 (Santa Cruz PAB1801), anti-HPV18 E2 (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), anti-HPV16 E2 (Ab261), anti-HPV11, and 6 E2 (kind gifts from J. Archambault) for 1 h followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to Texas Red. Nuclei were stained by 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 0.15 μg/ml. Annexin labeling was done according to the manufacturer with annexin V-PE (BD Pharmingen). Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope coupled to a CCD camera and were processed by Metaview software and converted to Adobe Photoshop.In Vitro Caspase Cleavage—HeLa cells expressing GFP-E2 proteins were harvested, and cell lysates were prepared in p300 buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7·10 H2O, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa-Cruz sc-2002) was used to preclear the extracts. Immunoprecipitation was done with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science 1814460). Immune complexes were collected on protein G PLUS-agarose and washed 3 times with p300 buffer. One-tenth of the immunoprecipitate was used to perform in vitro cleavage by recombinant caspase 3 (BD Pharmingen 556472) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results were visualized by Western blot with an anti-GFP antibody.Western Blot Experiments—Cells were either resuspended directly in Laemmli sample buffer or extracted in p300 buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaPPi, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of total cells or cellular extracts were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE acrylamide gels. After overnight transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were saturated in PBS-Tween plus 10% milk, incubated with the appropriate first antibodies anti-GFP (Torrey Pines Biolab TP401), anti-caspase 8 (BD biosciences 559932), anti-actin (Sigma A2066) for 1 h, and washed with PBS-Tween. Incubations with secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase were done for 1 h followed by washing in PBS-Tween. Membranes were revealed using ECL plus Western blot detection system from Amersham Biosciences.Pulse-Chase Experiments—HeLa cells were incubated with medium deficient in methionine and cysteine and supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 30 min. Radiolabeling with Tran35S-label (0.25 mCi/ml; ICN) was done for 30 min followed by chase with complete medium for the indicated time points. Cell lysates were prepared in p300 buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10 H2O, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Immunoprecipitation of GFP-E2 proteins were done as for in vitro cleavage experiments. Proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. Gels were fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Quantification was performed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).Flow Cytometry Analyses—Cells were harvested between 24 and 48 h post-infection, washed once with PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 100% ethanol. Cells were rehydrated in PBS with 2% serum. In some cases cells were treated with 0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 40 mm citric acid for 15 min to favor extraction of low molecular weight DNA. DNA was stained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) plus 10 μg/ml RNase for 30 min and analyzed with epics XL fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Coulter). For annexin detection cells were harvested in binding buffer and labeled with annexin V-PE before analysis according to the manufacturer instructions (BD Bioscience).RESULTSComparison of High Risk and Low Risk HPV E2 Expression and E2-induced G1 Arrest in HeLa Cells—We prepared recombinant adenoviruses expressing four different amino-terminal GFP-E2 fusion proteins originating from human genital papillomaviruses of either high risk (16 and 18) or of low risk (6 and 11) types. We infected HeLa cells at comparable m.o.i. to get GFP fluorescence in virtually all the cells present on the plates. As expected, GFP was observed in the nuclei of cells infected by the four recombinant adenoviruses expressing E2; however, cytoplasmic fluorescence was also clearly visible for the high risk HPV16 and HPV18 E2 (Fig. 1A). Western blots analysis indicated that differences in the subcellular localization did not depend on differences in the levels of expression. Notably, cytoplasmic localization of high risk HPV E2 proteins was not necessarily associated with higher levels of protein expression as shown with the HPV16 E2 protein (Fig. 1B). In contrast, even when expressed to high levels, low risk HPV11 and HPV6 E2 proteins remain strictly nuclear (Fig. 1A and not shown). Because HPV18 E2 has been shown to be particularly unstable (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we compared the stability of the four E2 proteins in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1C). These experiments showed that the HPV16 and HPV18 E2 proteins exhibit a similar half-life of 50 min, which exactly matches the half-life reported previously for HPV18 E2 (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast the HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins appeared more stable, although their half-life times were only increased by 1.5-fold for HPV11 E2 (75 min) and by 2.5-fold for HPV6 E2 (125 min). We concluded from these experiments that the exclusive nuclear localization of E2 proteins of the low risk viruses did not correlate with strong stabilization of the proteins.We also checked whether all the E2 proteins were able to repress transcription of the viral oncogenes in HeLa cells, as previously reported (28Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29Dowhanick J.J. McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7791-7799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hwang E.S. Riese D.J. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that this transcriptional repression induces p53 stabilization in HeLa cells due to E6 repression, consequently inducing a strong G1 growth arrest (28Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 31Hwang E.-S. Naeger L.K. DiMaio D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 795-803PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of p53 in cells expressing E2, but not in control cells, clearly indicated that the four proteins were equally able to stabilize nuclear p53 in infected cells (Fig. 1A) and to induce G1 growth arrest (Fig. 1D). We also checked the transactivation and DNA binding properties of the four proteins and detected no significant differences (data not shown). These experiments show that the GFP fusion proteins retain biological activity of the native proteins, as reported for the HPV18 E2 (24Bellanger S. Demeret C. Goyat S. Thierry F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7244-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).High Risk HPV E2 Proteins Induce Apoptosis—Because the four GFP-E2 fusion proteins appear to maintain their biological activity, we decided to compare their proapoptotic activities by infecting HeLa cells at increasing m.o.i. with the respective recombinant adenoviruses. We previously showed that induction of apoptosis requires a threshold expression level of the HPV18 E2 protein (19Demeret C. Garcia-Carranca A. Thierry F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Indeed, apoptosis was clearly detectable in cells infected at higher m.o.i. of HPV18 and HPV16 GFP E2-expressing recombinant adenoviruses, as shown by direct microscopic observation (black arrows, Fig. 2A). Under similar conditions, cells infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins did not die, even at high m.o.i., correlating with accumulation of fluorescence in the nuclei of infected cells (Fig. 2A). The infected cells were subjected to flow cytometry, which detected the presence of sub-2N populations of up to 70% at the highest m.o.i. of HPV18 and HPV16 E2-expressing cells, in contrast to HPV6 and HPV11 E2-expressing cells, where this population remained under 10% (Fig. 2B). Accumulation of the E2 proteins in infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). These experiments indicated that the full-length HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins did not accumulate to high levels, partly due to the emergence of specific cleavage products and degradation with increasing m.o.i. (Fig. 2C). The cleavage products were inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD in vivo (Fig. 2D) and result from caspase 3 cleavages of the HPV18 and HPV16 GFP fusion proteins at cryptic sites, as shown by in vitro cleavage experiments (Fig. 2D). These cleaved products are, thus, indicators of caspase activation and apoptosis in infected cells. In contrast, full-length HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins accumulated to levels that were higher than the two other E2 proteins due to the absence of caspase cleavage (Fig. 2D) and better stability.FIGURE 2Apoptosis is induced by high risk but not low risk viruses E2 proteins. A, apoptosis in infected HeLa cells visualized by direct microscopy. HeLa cells were infected at increasing m.o.i. from 500 to 2000 plaque-forming units per cell, and images were taken 40 h after infection with an Axiovert microscope in phase contrast and fluorescence. Several dead cells are indicated by arrows. B, analyses of the sub-2N populations by flow cytometry. Cells infected in the same conditions as above were analyzed by flow cytometry, the sub-2N populations are marked in black. The sub-2N populations represented from 2 to 10% of the total population of cells infected with HPV6 and HPV11 E2 recombinant viruses at increasing m.o.i., whereas they were from 6 to 70% with HPV18 and HPV16 E2 recombinant viruses. C, Western blot (WB) analysis of the proteins expressed in the infected cells presented in panels A and B. The same quantity of cells was extracted and analyzed on SDS-PAGE, then blotted and revealed by anti GFP antibody. Stars indicate caspase 3 cleavage products of the E2 proteins at cryptic sites of the HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins. D, the addition of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD in vivo inhibits the appearance of the cleaved products (left panel). Cleavage experiments with a recombinant caspase 3 in vitro show that these products result from caspase 3 cleavage of high risk E2 proteins but not low risk E2 proteins (right panel). E, stabilization of the GFP-E2 proteins do not influence apoptotic induction. Saos cells infected at increasing m.o.i were treated with either Me2SO or the proteasome inhibitor (lactacystin (Lacta)). Inhibition of proteasome leads to stabilization of the two E2 proteins of HPV18 and HPV11 as seen by the increase of the percentage of fluorescent cells among living cells (lower graph). Levels of apoptosis, deduced from the sub-2N populations in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the same samples, are not affected (upper graph).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We checked whether stabilization of the GFP-E2 proteins of HPV18 or HPV11 would change the levels of apoptosis (Fig. 2E). Inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin induces an accumulation of the GFP-E2 proteins as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2E but did not modulate apoptosis (upper panel, Fig. 2E)."

This suggests the presence of a polylactosaminoglycan-binding receptor on macrophages. Here we show that this receptor is nucleolin, a multifunctional shuttling protein present in nucleus, cytoplasm, and on the surface of some types of cells. Nucleolin was detected at the surface of macrophages, and anti-nucleolin antibody inhibited the binding of the early apoptotic cells to macrophages. Nucleolin-transfected HEK293 cells expressed nucleolin on the cell surface and bound the early apoptotic cells but not phosphatidylserine-exposing late apoptotic cells. This binding was inhibited by anti-nucleolin antibody, by polylactosamine-containing oligosaccharides, and by anti-CD43 antibody. Deletion of the antibody binding region of nucleolin resulted in loss of the apoptotic cell-binding ability. Moreover, truncated recombinant nucleolin in solution containing this region blocked the apoptotic cell binding to macrophages, and the blocking effect was cancelled by the oligosaccharides. These results indicate that nucleolin is a macrophage receptor for apoptotic cells.

Macrophages and other phagocytes recognize and ingest apoptotic cells in tissue, preventing their lysis and subsequent release of harmful or immunogenic intracellular components. Therefore, clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is crucial in the maintenance of tissue turnover and homeostasis. Moreover, it has been suggested that the apoptotic cell-ingested phagocytes play a role in suppression or resolution of inflammation (1Ren Y. Savill J.

For intercellular adhesion molecule-3 on apoptotic cells, CD14 was suggested to be a macrophage receptor (16Devitt A. Moffatt O.D. Raykundalia C. Capra J.D. Simmons D.L. Gregory C.D. Nature. 1998; 392: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Thrombospondin is also known as a bridging protein between unidentified sites on apoptotic cells and CD36 or vitronectin receptor (αvβ3 integrin) on phagocytes (17Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that some collectins, a family of proteins of the innate immunity with C-type lectin domains, such as C1q, mannose-binding lectin, and surfactant proteins A and D facilitate engulfment of apoptotic cells by bridging apoptotic cells and phagocytes through calreticulin-CD91 complex on phagocytes, although whether or not carbohydrates on apoptotic cells are involved is uncertain (18Ogden C.A. deCathelineau A.

Involvement of carbohydrates in the recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes was suggested by inhibition studies with various carbohydrates (20Morris R.G. Hargreaves A.D. Duvall E. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 115: 426-436PubMed Google Scholar, 21Duvall E. Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Immunology. 1985; 56: 351-358PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dini L. Autuori F. Lentini A. Oliverio S.

However, little was known about carbohydrate ligands and receptor molecules involved, and how carbohydrate ligands become susceptible to the phagocytic recognition. In a series of studies, we have demonstrated that moderately oxidized cells such as oxidized erythrocytes (25Beppu M. Takahashi T. Kashiwada M. Masukawa S. Kikugawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Beppu M. Eda S. Fujimaki M. Hishiyama E. Kikugawa K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), neutrophils (27Beppu M. Yokoyama N. Motohashi M. Kikugawa K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and human T lymphocytic Jurkat cells (28Beppu M. Ando K. Saeki M. Yokoyama N. Kikugawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) are recognized by macrophages and that the ligands on the oxidized cell surface recognized by macrophages are carbohydrate chains containing sialyl residues and polylactosaminoglycans, possibly sialylpoly-N-acetyllactosaminyl chains, of membrane glycoproteins. Furthermore, we recently found that apoptotic Jurkat cells transiently undergo capping of a major membrane sialoglycoprotein CD43 at an early stage of apoptosis and are recognized and phagocytosed by macrophages through the cluster of sialyl residues and polylactosaminyl chains of the capped CD43 (29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This transient capping of CD43 and the carbohydrate-mediated recognition occurred earlier than an increase in PS exposure and the PS-mediated recognition (30Yamanaka M. Eda S. Beppu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This carbohydrate-mediated new mechanism appears to play a role in the removal of dying cells at a very early stage of apoptosis. The above findings suggested the presence on macrophages of a lectin-like receptor that recognizes polylactosaminyl saccharide chains, especially those clustered on oxidized and early apoptotic cells. To identify this receptor, the membrane proteins of THP-1 macrophages differentiated from human monocytic THP-1 cells (THP-1 monocytes) were fractionated by successive affinity chromatographies using human lactoferrin and band 3 glycoprotein of erythrocyte membrane (31Eda S. Kikugawa K. Beppu M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), both bearing sialyl residues and polylactosaminyl chains (32Matsumoto A. Yoshima H. Takasaki S. Kobata A. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8260-8273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After further fractionations, a receptor candidate protein with a relative molecular mass of 50,000 (Mr 50 kDa) was obtained, and its tentative N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined (34Eda S. Beppu M. Yokoyama N. Kikugawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further analyzed the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 50-kDa protein, and finally identified it within human nucleolin, a multifunctional shuttling protein present in nucleus, cytoplasm, and on the surface of some types of cells (35Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 37Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Here, we show that 1) nucleolin is present on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, 2) nucleolin on the surface of macrophages, and recombinant nucleolin expressed on the surface of HEK293 cells (HEK cells), work as early apoptotic cell-binding proteins with a specificity for polylactosaminoglycans, and 3) its amino acid residues 295-304 are required for its apoptotic cell-binding activity. Cells and Materials—Jurkat, THP-1, and HEK293 cells (HEK cells) were obtained from Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan, Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan, and Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan, respectively. THP-1 macrophages were obtained by treatment of THP-1 cells with phorbol myristate acetate as described previously (29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mouse macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavities of adult male BALB/c mice (resident macrophages) or the mice injected with 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate medium 4 days before (thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TG macrophages)), by lavage with Hanks' balanced salt solution. An antibody against a synthetic octapeptide corresponding to the residues 295-302 of nucleolin (i.e. residues 1-8 of the 50-kDa protein) (Fig. 1, shaded sequence A) (anti-NUC295) was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified similarly to the work previously described (34Eda S. Beppu M. Yokoyama N. Kikugawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anti-Fas mouse monoclonal antibody (clone CH-11), anti-CD43 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone DF-T1), and control rabbit IgG were purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories, DAKO, and Genzyme-Tech, respectively. Anti-rNUC284 was raised in rabbits and affinity-purified using a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with a truncated recombinant nucleolin containing residues 284-710 (rNUC284). Erythrocyte oligosaccharides were prepared as described before (29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PKH67 Green and PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kits were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human annexin V was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories. Generation of Constructs of Human Nucleolin for Mammalian Expression—A full-length cDNA encoding human nucleolin was amplified by PCR using high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from human testis cDNA library (Clontech) using Primer-1, 5′-TCCGCCGCCATCATGGTGAAGCTCGCGAAGGCAG-3′ and Primer-2, 5′-AGGAATTCAAACTTCGTCTTCTTTCCTTG-3′, and cloned into pUniBlunt/V5-His-TOPO-E (Invitrogen) to produce pUniBlunt/V5-His-TOPO-E/NUC (pUni/NUC). For a deletion mutant NUC-(Δ295-304), a cDNA lacking residues 295-304 of nucleolin (nuc-(Δ295-304)) was constructed according to the PCR-based method using pUni/NUC as template, to produce pUniBlunt/V5-His-TOPO-E/NUC(Δ295-304). After sequencing, nucleolin expression vectors (pcDNA4/HisMax-E/NUC and pcDNA4/HisMax-E/NUC(Δ295-304)) were constructed with pcDNA4/HisMax-E (Invitrogen) by recombination. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—For production of nucleolin-truncated forms containing residues 284-710 (rNUC284) and containing residues 305-710 (rNUC305) in Escherichia coli, cDNAs corresponding to residues 284-710 (rnuc284) and residues 305-710 (rnuc305) of human nucleolin, respectively, were amplified by PCR using high fidelity pfu DNA polymerase from pUni/NUC. The following oligonucleotides were used: Primer-3 (5′-ATGGCCAAACAGAAAGCAGC-3′) and Primer-2 for rnuc284, and Primer-4 (5′-ATGACGGCTTTCAATCTCTTTGT) and Primer-2 for rnuc305. Subcloning of PCR products were performed with pUniBlunt/V5-His-TOPO-E to produce pUniBlunt/V5-His-TOPO-E/NUC284 and pUniBlunt/V5-His-TOPO-E/NUC305. After sequencing, the constructs were introduced into an expression vector pBAD/Thio-E (Invitrogen) by recombination to produce pBAD/Thio-E/NUC284 and pBAD/Thio-E/NUC305. These proteins include an N-terminal thioredoxin tag and a C-terminal V5 epitope and histidine tag. For control protein, pBAD/Thio-E/Uni-CAT (Invitrogen) expressing a 42-kDa chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (rCAT) with the same tags was used. These constructs were subsequently transformed into the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen). The bacteria containing each of these constructs for rNUC284, rNUC305, and rCAT were grown, harvested, and incubated in lysis buffer (3 mm KH2PO4, 47 mm K2HPO4, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 20 μg/ml RNase, pH 7.8). Histidine-tagged proteins (rNUC284, rNUC305, and rCAT) were purified by passage over a nickel affinity column (HisTrap column, Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cell Surface Biotinylation—A suspension of THP-1 monocytes and a monolayer of THP-1 macrophages (1 × 107 cells) were washed with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS(-)) and incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotin-amide)hexanoate (Pierce) at 0 °C for 40 min with gentle agitation. Then, unreacted biotin was quenched by incubating the cells in 0.1 m monoethanolamine-HCl (pH 7) for an additional 10 min at 0 °C. As a negative control, cells were treated in the same way but without the biotinylation reagent. After washing with DPBS(-), cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10% glycerol). The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. To isolate biotinylated proteins, the supernatants (1.8 mg of protein) were applied to 1 ml of streptavidin-agarose (Vector Laboratories) equilibrated with binding buffer (0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4), and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The matrices were thoroughly washed with binding buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 6% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.015% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and immunoblotting as described before (34Eda S. Beppu M. Yokoyama N. Kikugawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proteins on immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptotic Cell Binding Assay—Apoptosis of Jurkat cells was induced by incubation of the cells (4 × 106 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum with 10 μm etoposide or 2 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody for 2 h at 37°C,the conditions under which the cells become susceptible to the carbohydrate-mediated macrophage recognition at their early stage of apoptosis (29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cells thus prepared (i.e. early apoptotic cells) were washed twice with DPBS(-) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (RPMI 1640-HEPES) at 4 × 106 cells/ml. Binding of apoptotic Jurkat cells to THP-1 macrophages or TG macrophages was assayed by co-incubating the cells for 2 h as described before (29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of recognition by HEK cells and nucleolin-transfected HEK cells, cells in minimum essential medium Eagle containing 10% fetal bovine serum were plated in 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well, in which round coverslips (15-mm diameter) precoated with 100 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin were placed. HEK cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding for nucleolin (pcDNA4/HisMax-E/NUC) or for nucleolin deletion mutant (pcDNA4/HisMax-E/NUC(Δ295-304)) using Lipofectoamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-Mem I medium (Invitrogen) a day before each experiment. Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Apoptotic Jurkat cells were applied to the monolayer of HEK cells after additional 1-h incubation to adjust the time of apoptosis to that of macrophage assays, and co-incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. After removal of unbound cells, attached cells were fixed, stained, and counted as described (29Eda S. Yamanaka M. Beppu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5967-5974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All the data are expressed as the number of bound Jurkat cells per 100 macrophages or HEK cells (cell binding) as counting more than 200 cells. In the case of binding assay using nonadherent THP-1 monocytes, early apoptotic Jurkat cells and THP-1 monocytes were labeled with 10 μm membrane-labeling fluorescent dyes PKH67 (green) and PKH26 (red), respectively, at room temperature for 5 min. The labeling was quenched by addition of RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The labeled apoptotic cells were incubated with THP-1 monocytes at a cell number ratio of 10:1 in RPMI 1640-HEPES (phenol red-free) at 37 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking. After the incubation, the binding of Jurkat cells and THP-1 macrophages was analyzed by flow cytometry. The binding index is defined as the percentage of THP-1 cells (red) having bound apoptotic cells (green). Mean values of triplicate experiments are shown with the indicated S.D. For comparison, binding of THP-1 macrophages and apoptotic Jurkat cells was similarly performed using THP-1 macrophages detached from culture substrate by incubation in Puck's EDTA solution (5 mm HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA, 5.6 mm glucose) for 10 min. Flow Cytometry—For measurement of cell-surface nucleolin, cells adherent to culture substrates (THP-1 macrophages, TG macrophages, and HEK cells) were detached by incubation in Puck's EDTA solution for 10 min. Before treatment with antibody, monocytes and macrophages in suspension were pretreated with 10 μg/ml human IgG Fc fragment to block Fc receptors. Cells in suspension were treated with 10 μg/ml of the primary antibodies (rabbit anti-NUC295 for monocytes and macrophages, and rabbit anti-rNUC284 for HEK cells), and stained by 10 μg/ml of the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probe), and immediately analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), gating for propidium iodide-unstained cells (alive cells). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Monocytes or macrophages were pretreated with 10 μg/ml human IgG Fc fragment in RPMI 1640-HEPES-3% BSA at 0 °C for 10 min. After washing with DPBS(-)at0 °C, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-NUC295 or with 10 μg/ml control IgG in RPMI 1640-HEPES-3% BSA at 0 °C for 30 min. Bound antibody was detected by treatment of the cells with 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in RPMI 1640-HEPES-3% BSA at 0 °C for 30 min. In the case of transfected HEK cells, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml anti-NUC295 or rabbit control IgG in RPMI 1640-HEPES-3% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min, and washed with DPBS(-). Bound antibodies were detected by treatment of the cells with 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probe) in RPMI 1640-HEPES-3% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing with DPBS(-) at 0 °C, the cells were resuspended in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 at 0 °C and immediately subjected to confocal fluorescence microscopy (μ Radiance, Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least triplicate experiments. The data were compared using a Student's t test, and statistical significance was determined. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. Identification of 50-kDa Protein as a Fragment of Nucleolin—The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 50-kDa protein isolated as a candidate for the macrophage receptor for oxidized cells, and for early apoptotic cells, was not identified within known proteins (34Eda S. Beppu M. Yokoyama N. Kikugawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although some fragments of the sequence were found in nucleolin. Then, we re-analyzed its N-terminal amino acid sequence and noticed some errors to be corrected. The corrected sequence was present in human nucleolin (Fig. 1, underlined residues 295-304). This suggests that the 50-kDa protein is a proteolytic fragment of nucleolin. Indeed, nucleolin is highly sensitive to proteolysis and tends to generate various sizes of fragments, including a 50-kDa fragment (38Sapp M. Richter A. Weisshart K. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F.

Human nucleolin is composed of 710 amino acids (Fig. 1) and migrates as 110 kDa in SDS-PAGE (41Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Nucleolin was originally known as a major nucleolar RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and maturation (42Jordan G. Nature. 1987; 329: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm and interacts with various RNA/DNA/protein targets (36Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that it is also expressed at the surface of some types of cells (35Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B.

Presence of Nucleolin on the Surface of Monocytes and Macrophages— We then investigated whether cell-surface nucleolin can function as a receptor for early apoptotic cells. First, expression of nucleolin on monocyte/macrophage surface was examined using anti-NUC295, an antibody against a synthetic octapeptide corresponding to the residues 295-302 of nucleolin (Fig. 1, shaded sequence A). Nucleolin was detected on the surface of monocytes and macrophages in various ways. In flow cytometric analysis, anti-NUC295 bound to these cells, producing small but distinct shifts of the fluorescence peaks as compared with cont"
https://openalex.org/W2159375255,"Transcription of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 genes is activated by HIV-1 Tat protein, which induces phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase-II by CDK9/cyclin T1. We previously showed that Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription is regulated by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). In the present study we demonstrate that Tat interacts with PP1 and that disruption of this interaction prevents induction of HIV-1 transcription. We show that PP1 interacts with Tat in part through the binding of Val36 and Phe38 of Tat to PP1 and that Tat is involved in the nuclear and subnuclear targeting of PP1. The PP1 binding mutant Tat-V36A/F38A displayed a decreased affinity for PP1 and was a poor activator of HIV-1 transcription. Surprisingly, Tat-Q35R mutant that had a higher affinity for PP1 was also a poor activator of HIV-1 transcription, because strong PP1 binding competed out binding of Tat to CDK9/cyclin T1. Our results suggest that Tat might function as a nuclear regulator of PP1 and that interaction of Tat with PP1 is critical for activation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat.

In contrast to the well defined role of protein kinases, the role of protein phosphatases in Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription is less well understood. FCP1, a CTD phosphatase that dephosphorylates Ser-2 during elongation of transcription (13Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), is inhibited by Tat and this inhibition may alleviate FCP1-mediated pausing of transcription (14Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to FCP1, PP2A and PP1 were also shown to be involved in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription. Disregulation of cellular enzymatic activity of PP2A inhibited Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription (16Ruediger R. Brewis N. Ohst K. Walter G. Virology. 1997; 238: 432-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Expression of the catalytic subunit of PP2A enhanced activation of the HIV-1 promoter by phorbol myristate acetate, whereas inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid and fostriecin prevented activation of the HIV-1 promoter (17Faulkner N.E. Lane B.R. Bock P.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2276-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, PP2A might positively regulate HIV-1 transcription. Our studies showed that PP1 is also a positive regulator of HIV-1 transcription in vitro (18Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem.

Indeed, in a previous study we showed that inhibition of nuclear PP1 potently inhibited Tat-induced transcription (20Ammosova T. Jerebtsova M. Beullens M. Voloshin Y. Ray P.E. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32189-32194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We concluded that the inhibition was because of sequestration of PP1 because the inhibition was alleviated by the co-expression of PP1 (20Ammosova T. Jerebtsova M. Beullens M. Voloshin Y. Ray P.E. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32189-32194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We recently compared contributions of PP2A and PP1 to the dephosphorylation of CDK9 and to HIV-1 transcription in vitro and in vivo and found that although PP2A dephosphorylates CDK9 in vitro, in cultured cells PP1 is likely to dephosphorylate CDK9 and contribute to the regulation of HIV-1 transcription (21Ammosova T. Washington K. Debebe Z. Brady J. Nekhai S. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PP1 belongs to the PPP family of serine-threonine protein phosphatases, which also includes PP2A, PP2B, and PP4-6 (22Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PP1 is expressed in mammalian cells as three isoforms, α, β/δ, and γ1 (γ), and PP1γ shows a strong accumulation in the nucleolus, suggesting a role in the regulation of nucleolar processes including transcription (23Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PP1 holoenzymes consist of a constant catalytic subunit and a variable regulatory subunit (R) that determines the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of the phosphatase (22Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Based on their effect on the activity of PP1, R subunits are divided into two major groups: (i) PP1 inhibitors, which block the activity of PP1 toward all substrates; and (ii) substrate specifiers, which inhibit dephosphorylation of some substrates but enhance the dephosphorylation of other substrates (24Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). One of the nuclear R-subunits of PP1 is NIPP1 (nuclear inhibitor of PP1), which inhibits the dephosphorylation of a wide range of PP1 substrates including glycogen phosphorylase a (24Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription is blocked by inhibition of the nuclear pool of PP1, and the inhibition is reversed by co-expression of PP1γ (20Ammosova T. Jerebtsova M. Beullens M. Voloshin Y.

In the present paper we show that Tat binds to PP1 in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed the interaction of Tat with PP1 using enzymatic assays. We identified the Val36 and Phe38 amino acids of Tat to mediate its binding to PP1. The V36A/F38A mutation of Tat prevented its binding to PP1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Tat-V36A/F38A was inefficient in induction of HIV-1 transcription in cultured cells, and also did not translocate PP1 to the nucleus, as we observed for wild type Tat. Our results suggest that Tat might have a yet unrecognized function as a regulator of PP1, and that interaction of Tat with PP1 is critical for activation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate transcriptional activator transactivation response protein phosphatase 2A protein phosphatase-1 nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 long terminal repeat glutathione S-transferase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine enhanced green fluorescent protein cytomegalovirus wild-type C-terminal domain HEK293T and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Transient Transfections—HEK293T cells were cultured in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected at 50% confluence with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were cultured 48 h post-transfection and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity as described below. Transfections were normalized using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye conversion assay, which has a stable end point. The MTT reactions were analyzed at a wavelength of 620 nm (Lab Systems Multiscan MS). β-Galactosidase Assay—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min at room temperature in 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA. Then, 100 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside solution (72 mm Na2PO4 pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 12 mm MgCl2, 180 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added and incubated at room temperature until a yellow color developed. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 1 m Na2C03. The 96-well plate was analyzed in a microplate reader at 414 nm (Lab Systems Multiscan MS).

Protein phosphatase activities were measured with 4 nm catalytic subunit and 0.2 nmol of phosphorylase a as a substrate for PP1 or PP2A. The phosphorylase phosphatase assay (10 min at 30 °C) was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Where indicated, prior to the phosphorylase a assay, the samples were trypsinized (0.16 mg/ml for 10 min at 30 °C) to liberate the fully active catalytic subunit of PP1. Trypsin was inhibited by the addition of 0.7 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor for 10 min at 30 °C. Analysis of PP1 inhibition by Tat peptides was carried out with Prizm (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). GST Pull Down Assay—PP1 (4 nm) was incubated with 10 μg of GST-Tat (0.5 μm) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C in 20 μl of 50 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The beads were washed with 1 ml of the glycylglycine buffer, subjected to trypsin treatment (0.16 mg/ml for 10 min at 30 °C) followed by the addition of 0.7 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor for 10 min at 30 °C. Liberated PP1 was measured by phosphorylase a phosphatase assay as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors as described above. The whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (30Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). About 100 μg of whole cell extract was supplemented with 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies. Then protein G-agarose beads preblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and suspended in TNN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) were added, and the reaction was incubated in TNN buffer at 4 °C for 2 h with rocking. The beads were precipitated and washed once with TNN buffer and once with the SDS-PAGE stacking kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The pellet was then resuspended in a 30 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and heated at 90 °C for 3 min. The proteins were resolved on SDS Tris-Tricine PAGE, 10%, to detect PP1γ, or 12%, to detect Tat, and immunoblotted with corresponding antibodies. About 10 μg of total protein was used for the input. In Vitro Interaction of Biotinylated TAR RNA, Tat, and CDK9/Cyclin T1—Biotin-TAR RNA (51 nucleotides) was purchased from Molecula Co. (molecula.com). To bind TAR RNA, streptavidin-agarose beads were washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) and incubated with TAR RNA (5 μg/reaction) or formamide-denatured TAR RNA for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the binding buffer and incubated with recombinant Tat protein (1.5 μg/reaction) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with binding buffer and then with TAK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 mm NaCl. Then 64 μg of yeast tRNA and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin were added per reaction to block the beads. Then recombinant CDK9/cyclin T1 (30 ng/reaction) was added in TAK buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Protein phosphatase PP1 was diluted in TAK buffer and added into the reaction where indicated at 0.1 unit of PP1 per reaction. Samples were incubated for 1 h on ice with occasional mixing. Then beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer, and bound proteins and RNA were eluted in 1× SDS-loading buffer. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with α-CDK9, α-Tat, or α-PP1γ antibodies. Biotin TAR RNA was detected by Ponceau S staining. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—HeLa cells were grown on slides to 50% confluence and transfected with Tat and PP1γ-EGFP or PP1α-EGFP expression vectors using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. FLAG-Tat and FLAG-Tat-V36A/F38A were stained with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) and visualized by indirect immunostaining with TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies. PP1-EGFP was visualized by green fluorescence. Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and photographed using a triple-band (red/green/blue) emission filter. PP1 Is a Critical Factor for HIV-1 Transcription—In accordance with previous data (20Ammosova T. Jerebtsova M. Beullens M. Voloshin Y. Ray P.E. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32189-32194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), showing that PP1γ is necessary for Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription in cultured cells, we found that the transient expression in HEK293T cells of a catalytically dead mutant of PP1, i.e. PP1γ-D64N, inhibited the Tat-activated transcription of the HIV-1 LTR by 3-fold (Fig. 1A, lane 4). This inhibition was similar to the inhibition obtained by expression of the PP1 inhibitor NIPP1 (Fig. 1A, lane 5). In contrast, expression of wild-type PP1γ did not inhibit Tat-dependent transcription (Fig. 1A, lane 3). To determine whether the inhibition of PP1 affected promoters other than HIV-1, we analyzed whether transient expression of PP1γ-D64N has an effect on transcription from CMV or β-actin promoters. HEK293T cells were transfected with CMV-LacZ or β-actin-LacZ (19Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) expression vectors. Expression of wild-type PP1γ stimulated transcription from the CMV promoter but inhibited transcription from the β-actin promoter (Fig. 1B, lane 2). However, the expression of PP1γ-D64N (Fig. 1B, lane 3) or the PP1 inhibitor NIPP1 (Fig. 1B, lane 4) inhibited transcription. Thus, inhibition of PP1 had a specific effect on the activation of CMV promoter but not on the β-actin promoter. Analysis of the expression of EGFP-PP1γ WT and D64N showed that both proteins were expressed to a similar level (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, Tat expression was decreased in the cells expressing NIPP1 or PP1γ-D64N (Fig. 1C, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5) in accord to the inhibitory effect of NIPP1 or PP1γ-D64N on the CMV promoter that drives the expression of Tat. Although, it is possible that the decreased level of Tat expression accounts for the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription, titration of the Tat-expressing plasmids showed either no effect on Tat transactivation in the case of untagged Tat or inverse dependence in the case of FLAG-Tat expression vector (data not shown). Thus, the amount of Tat needed for transactivation might be very small and the excess FLAG-Tat, which is more stable that untagged Tat, may be even inhibitory for HIV-1 transcription. Therefore we analyzed whether there is a direct interaction between Tat and PP1 disruption of which may be inhibitory for the HIV-1 transcription. Tat Interacts with PP1—To assess whether Tat directly binds to PP1, immobilized GST-Tat (0.5 μm) was incubated with purified PP1 (4 nm) in glycylglycine, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding of PP1 to Tat was detected by treatment of the Tat-associated PP1 with trypsin, which liberates the catalytically active part of PP1 (31Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 145-155PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, Tat-(1-72) bound about 60% of the input PP1 activity (Fig. 2A, lane 1), Tat-(1-48) bound about 35% of the input phosphatase activity, and Tat-(37-72) bound about 55% of the activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, GST alone bound only 5% of the input phosphatase activity (Fig. 2A, lane 4). The inset (Fig. 2A) shows that equal levels of different Tat constructs were used. To investigate the interaction of Tat with PP1 in vivo, FLAG-tagged Tat was expressed in HEK293T cells and then immunoprecipitated from the 100 μg of whole cellular extract with anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunoblotting analysis showed that both CDK9, which served as a positive control, and PP1 co-precipitated with Tat from the cellular extracts (Fig. 2B, lane 3). EGFP-tagged PP1γ accumulates predominantly within the nucleolus (23Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tat was also found to accumulate in the nucleolus (32Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1998; 252: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether Tat and PP1 co-localize in the nucleolus, FLAG-Tat was expressed along with PP1γ fused to EGFP in HeLa cells. Analysis by confocal microscopy showed co-localization of Tat and PP1 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, our results indicate that Tat might interact with PP1 in vitro and in vivo. Two Separate Regions of Tat Are Involved in the Interaction with PP1—To determine whether Tat has an effect on the enzymatic activity of PP1 and PP2A we used glycogen phosphorylase a as a substrate (30Washington K. Ammosova T. Beullens M. Jerebtsova M. Kumar A. Bollen M. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40442-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tat inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 but not that of PP2A (Fig. 3A). HIV-1 Tat contains a positively charged RNA-binding region (amino acids 49-57, Fig. 3B) that could interact with a number of negatively charged proteins, including PP1. Therefore, we analyzed the regions of Tat involved in the inhibition of the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1. Tat-(1-44) inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 with approximately half the efficiency of that of full-length Tat (Fig. 3C). Within this 44-amino acid N-terminal domain, Tat-(29-43) was an equally potent inhibitor as Tat-(1-44) (Fig. 3C), but Tat-(21-35) and Tat-(37-51) were much weaker inhibitors (Fig. 3C). Therefore the entire 29-43-amino acid sequence within the N-terminal activation domain of Tat appears to participate in the interaction with PP1. In addition to Tat-(1-44), Tat-(36-72) strongly inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 (Fig. 3D). This inhibition is likely to be mediated by residues 49-59, because Tat-(45-59) and Tat-(49-63) also strongly inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 (Fig. 3D). Tat-(41-55), Tat-(42-54), Tat-(52-60), and Tat-(53-67) were only about ⅓ to ½ as efficient as Tat-(45-59) in inhibiting the activity of PP1 (Fig. 3D). Therefore the entire Tat-(49-59) sequence appears to interact with PP1. Taken together, our results indicate that two sequences of Tat, 29KCCFHCQVCFITKAL43 and 49RKKRRQRRRAH59, are likely to contain PP1-interacting amino acids (shown in Fig. 3B). This conclusion is in agreement with the results from the GST precipitation assays indicating that both N- and C-terminal domains of Tat-(1-72) bind PP1. To test whether both domains of Tat inhibit PP1 by the same mechanism, we analyzed the kinetics of the inhibition of PP1 by Tat-(29-43) and Tat-(45-59). Lineweaver-Burk plots of the inhibition of PP1 by Tat-(29-43) showed noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 3E), whereas Tat-(45-59) clearly acted as a competitive inhibitor (Fig. 3F). Therefore, Tat-(29-43) probably does not bind at or near the catalytic site of PP1. In contrast, the peptide Tat-(45-59) might inhibit the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP1 by binding competitively at the active site of PP1. The polybasic sequence of Tat-(45-59) is similar to the NIPP1 193KRKRKR198 sequence that is inhibitory to PP1 but that does not bind to the RVXF binding pocket of PP1 (33Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Val36 and Phe38 Amino Acids of Tat Interact with the RVXF-binding Pocket of PP1—Nearly all regulatory subunits of PP1 contain at least one RVXF motif, which directly interacts with a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of PP1 that is remote from the catalytic site (34Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876"

Many attempts have been made to delineate the mode of binding of HlyA to membranes, but the results have proven difficult to accommodate in a single model. Artificial membranes are efficiently permeabilized (7Menestrina G. Mackman N. Holland I.B. Bhakdi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Benz R. Schmid A. Wagner W. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 887-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and initial binding studies indicated that erythrocytes (9Eberspacher B. Hugo F. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 983-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and granulocytes (10Bhakdi S. Greulich S. Muhly M. Eberspacher B. Becker H. Thiele A. Hugo F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 737-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) bound the toxin in a nonsaturable manner. In contrast, binding of HlyA to erythrocytes in a saturable manner was reported (11Bauer M.E. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) (CD11a/CD18; αLβ2 integrin), was reported to serve as the receptor for HlyA and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) (12Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J. Wang J.F. Shenker B.J. Ortlepp S. Robinson M.K. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30463-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the following observations: use of monoclonal antibodies to LFA-1 inhibited binding of HlyA and leukotoxin to cells; immobilized leukotoxin bound LFA-1; expression of LFA-1 in a cell line that normally lacked the integrin and was insensitive to the toxins rendered these cells sensitive to HlyA and leukotoxin. The authors suggested that nonspecific absorption of HlyA to various cell types might additionally occur that could obscure the receptor-mediate interaction (12Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J. Wang J.F. Shenker B.J. Ortlepp S. Robinson M.K. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30463-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Studies with another RTX toxin, the leukotoxin of Mannheimia hemolytica, indicated that binding to integrin on bovine leukocytes results in activation of the tyrosine kinase signaling cascade (13Jeyaseelan S. Kannan M.S. Briggs R.E. Thumbikat P. Maheswaran S.K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6131-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Binding of collagen to LFA-1 activates this signaling cascade and triggers the respiratory burst in human neutrophils (14Garnotel R. Monboisse J.C. Randoux A. Haye B. Borel J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27495-27503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because HlyA also stimulates the respiratory burst in these cells (15Bhakdi S. Martin E. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grimminger F. Scholz C. Bhakdi S. Seeger W. J. Biol.

Investig. 1991; 88: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a unifying concept would be that E. coli hemolysin binds to integrin LFA-1, activating the tyrosine kinase signaling cascade and triggering the respiratory burst. Binding to erythrocytes must occur via other mechanisms, however, because these cells do not express LFA-1. According to one report, glycophorin might serve as the receptor for HlyA in these cells (18Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12513-12519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such a concept contradicts the nonsaturable binding previously reported. All previous investigations on the binding of RTX toxins to cells suffered from the drawback that radioactive toxin tracers were not available for quantitative measurements of binding. Several studies employed crude culture supernatants or cell sonicates rather than purified toxin preparations, and quantification of binding inevitably relied on indirect methods. In this study, we devised a method for radioactive labeling of HlyA and conducted experiments to test the hypothesis that the toxin binds to a receptor. Our results indicate that HlyA does not interact with a receptor on granulocytes. Binding occurs in a nonspecific and nonsaturable manner, and the respiratory burst is triggered directly by pore formation, probably because of flux of extracellular Ca2+ into the cells. Expression of hlyA, Mutagenesis, and Toxin Purification—Mutants in which Lys at position 564 and/or 690 was replaced by Arg (3Stanley P. Packman L.C. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Hughes. Mutation of Ser-177 into Cys was described previously (19Schindel C. Zitzer A. Schulte B. Gerhards A. Stanley P. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The same procedure was followed starting with K564R, K690R and K564R/K690R, to form S177C/K564R, S177C/K690R, and S177C/K564R/K690R, respectively. Protein purification of hemolysin was carried out as described previously (4Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schindel C. Zitzer A. Schulte B. Gerhards A. Stanley P. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Labeling of Toxin—Mutant toxin containing Cys-177 was labeled with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) using the following protocol. Alcohol precipitation of toxin was carried out to remove dithiothreitol as described previously (19Schindel C. Zitzer A. Schulte B. Gerhards A. Stanley P. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The precipitate was dissolved in 8 m guanidine HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 μm toxin was incubated with 50 μm NEM for 1 h at ambient temperature. The reaction was stopped with 5 mm dithiothreitol (10 min), and toxin was alcohol-precipitated. After centrifugation and washing, the labeled toxin was dissolved in 8 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Before use, toxin was diluted 100-fold in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. For radioactive labeling with [3H]NEM, 500 nm toxin was incubated with 2 μm [3H]NEM (specific activity, 48.2Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) as described above. After incubation for 1 h, the reaction was completed with excess (50 μm) NEM and toxin was further treated as above. The homogeneity of the labeled toxins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 20 ng of labeled HlyA toxin were mixed with 2 μg of unlabeled toxin, and this mixture was run in two parallel SDS gels. One was stained with Coomassie, and the other cut into thin slices that were homogenized and assayed for radioactivity. Coomassie staining confirmed purity of the toxin bands, and 85% of radioactivity was recovered in the gel slice containing toxin (data not shown). Cell Assays—Human granulocytes were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy volunteers following conventional procedures. Briefly, 1 volume of 4.5% dextran (Amersham Biosciences) in isotonic salt solution, pH 7.4, was added to 5 volumes of whole blood, and cells were allowed to sediment in tilted plastic centrifugation tubes for 30 min at room temperature. The erythrocyte-depleted supernatants were transferred in 4-ml aliquots to 4 ml of Biocoll Separation Solution gradients (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) and centrifuged for 20 min at 400 × g at 20 °C. Erythrocytes contaminating the cell pellet were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Cells were then resedimented (100 × g, 10 min), washed, suspended in sterile HBSS, and kept on ice. The cell preparations contained ≤3% contaminating lymphocytes as determined with methylene blue staining and ≤4% nonviable cells as determined by staining with trypan blue. K562 cells, either nontransfected or transfected with LFA-1, were kindly provided by Dr. Y. van Kooyk (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and cultivated in a mixture of 75% RPMI, 25% Iscov's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared by hypotonic lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, followed by three washes in the same buffer. Monoclonal antibody KIM-127 (anti-CD18) was a gift from Dr. M. Robinson (Celltech Ltd.). Anti-CD11a antibodies used were TS1/22 (Perbio Science), MCA1848GA (Serotec GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany), and G43-25B (BD Biosciences). When indicated, cells were preincubated with 1 mm MnCl2 in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml Kim-127 antibodies prior to HlyA binding. Toxins used for comparison of cytolytic activity were streptolysin O (20Weller U. Muller L. Messner M. Palmer M. Valeva A. Tranum-Jensen J. Agrawal P. Biermann C. Dobereiner A. Kehoe M.A. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (21Bhakdi S. Muhly M. Korom S. Hugo F. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3512-3519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (22Valeva A. Walev I. Weis S. Boukhallouk F. Wassenaar T.M. Endres K. Fahrenholz F. Bhakdi S. Zitzer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25143-25148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hemolytic Assays—Serial dilutions of hemolysin were prepared in duplicate with HBBS. To 100 μl of diluted toxin, 100 μl of rabbit erythrocytes were added (2.5 × 108 cells/ml) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The absorbance of hemoglobin in supernatants was measured at 412 nm. The HD50 was defined as the concentration of toxin required to lyse 50% of the rabbit erythrocytes. The HD50 of mutant S177C was 30 ng/ml (300 pm), which was comparable with wild-type hemolysin. Measurement of Intracellular ATP—K562 cells (transfected or nontransfected) were treated with various concentrations of streptolysin O, α-toxin from S. aureus, V. cholerae cytolysin, or HlyA for 60 min. Cellular ATP concentrations were determined after lysing the cells with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 using a commercial ATP-bioluminescence kit (Roche Applied Science). Binding Assays—Labeled toxin (20 pm) was added to granulocytes (2 × 107 cells or as indicated), K562 cells (4 × 106 cells), or erythrocyte ghosts (109 cells) in 500 μl of HBSS, and binding was allowed to take place at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min) and washed twice, and bound toxin was expressed as the percentage of total toxin in the assay. Chemiluminescence Measurements—Production of reactive oxygen species was assayed by the luminol-amplified chemiluminescence method as described previously (23Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 granulocytes in HBSS, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, were treated with HlyA or mutant K690R in the presence of 0.2 mm luminol. Chemiluminescence was measured in a luminometer and expressed as relative light units. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Granulocytes were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) in HBSS, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, for 30 min at 37 °C. After granulocytes were washed, toxin was added at the indicated concentrations for 10 min at 37 °C. Fura-2 absorption shift was observed by scanning the excitation spectrum between 300 and 400 nm at an emission wavelength of 510 nm in a Spex-Fluoromax spectrofluorimeter. Hemolytic Activities of HlyA and Mutant Toxins and Radioactive Labeling with [3H]NEM—Replacement of Ser-177 with cysteine in HlyA did not result in a loss of hemolytic activity; 300 pm S177C caused hemolysis of ∼60% of a rabbit erythrocyte suspension containing 2.5 × 108 cells/ml. Mutant S177C/K564R, lacking the acylation site at position 564, had an ∼10-fold reduced activity (HD50 ∼ 3 nm). Hemolytically inactive mutants (HD50 > 30 nm) were S177C/K690R, lacking the fatty acid at position 690, and S177C/K564R/K690R, the nonacylated toxin. Modification of S177C with NEM did not alter the hemolytic activity of the toxin mutants S177C and S177C/K546R. Labeling of S177C (hereafter designated WT*) resulted in a tracer with a specific radioactivity of 40 mCi/mmol, corresponding to a mean incorporation of ∼0.8 mol of 3H/mol of HlyA. The other mutants, S177C/K564R, S177C/K690R, and S177C/K564R/K690R, were also labeled and designated K564R*, K690R*, and K564R/K690R*, respectively. Their specific radioactivity was comparable with that of WT*. No incorporation was obtained with cysteine-free toxins. Binding Characteristics of Radioactive Labeled Toxins—The fraction of bound WT* was determined with increasing numbers of PMNs. Fig. 1A shows that the bindability of labeled toxin was ∼40%. Similar results were obtained with erythrocyte ghosts (data not shown). When 20 pm toxin was incubated with 15 × 106 PMNs, about 15–20% of the radioactivity became cell-bound. No decrease in cellular ATP was observed, indicating that this concentration window was sublytic. Similar binding was observed with mutants that were monoacylated (K564R* and K690R*) or nonacylated (K564R/K690R*) (Fig. 1B). Thus, the lack of acylation did not affect the binding of HlyA to granulocytes. To investigate whether binding was reversible, PMNs were loaded with 20 pm radiolabeled toxin at 37 or 4 °C. After 1 h, unbound toxin was removed by washing. The cells were then incubated with fresh medium for 1 h, and release of toxin was measured in the medium. Radioactive toxin could not be demonstrated in the medium in any case (not shown), indicating that binding was irreversible for all analyzed mutants. Competition experiments were performed in which radioactively labeled WT* (20 pm) was incubated with granulocytes in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled wild-type toxin. These experiments were conducted at 4 °C, because at 37 °C the cells became permeabilized by the unlabeled HlyA and cell swelling caused unspecific increase of bound label. At low temperature, no change in the amount of bound label was found (Fig. 2A). The same findings were obtained at 37 °C using erythrocyte ghosts (Fig. 2B). In another experiment, granulocytes were incubated with 20 pm WT* at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of the nonlytic mutant K690R (Fig. 2C). Again, no competition of binding was noted despite the high concentrations of unlabeled toxin used. Role of Integrin in Mediating HlyA Activity—The above results indicated that HlyA bound in a nonspecific manner to cells. However, specific binding of HlyA to LFA-1 integrin has been proposed; therefore PMNs were preincubated with anti-integrin antibodies TS1/22, MCA1848GA, and G43-25B, and binding experiments were repeated. TS1/22 is known to be function-blocking, i.e. to block ligand binding to LFA-1 (24Van Epps D.E. Potter J. Vachula M. Smith C.W. Anderson D.C. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3207-3210PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies were applied at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and under these conditions neither a difference in binding of WT* compared with nontreated cells nor a difference in susceptibility of the cells toward the toxin was observed (data not shown). Expression of LFA-1 in K562 cells reportedly increases their susceptibility toward HlyA, and this has been taken as another argument for a receptor function (12Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J. Wang J.F. Shenker B.J. Ortlepp S. Robinson M.K. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30463-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were therefore undertaken with K562 cells lacking or expressing LFA-1. Expression of the integrin was confirmed, by flow cytometry and Western blotting, in transfected cells using specific antibodies. Expression of LFA-1 did not significantly increase binding of 20 pm WT* (Fig. 3). Activation of LFA-1 with either manganese ions, stimulating anti-CD18 antibody Kim-127 (25Stephens P. Romer J.T. Spitali M. Shock A. Ortlepp S. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or a combination of both agonists did not affect HlyA binding to LFA-1-transfected K562 cells, indicating that LFA-1 is not a receptor for HlyA. The above findings might be reconciled with the report that LFA-1 expression enhances the cytotoxicity of HlyA (12Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J. Wang J.F. Shenker B.J. Ortlepp S. Robinson M.K. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30463-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), if LFA-1 expression generally rendered cells more sensitive to pore-forming toxins. Indeed, ATP assays indicated enhanced sensitivity of LFA-1 positive cells toward other toxins. Similar enhancement of susceptibility was noted with streptolysin O, which binds to cholesterol, S. aureus α-toxin, and V. cholerae cytolysin, for which no evidence exists for an interaction with integrins (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEConcentrations of pore-forming toxins eliciting 50% ATP depletion in K562 cellsCytolytic dosis for 50% ATP depletionToxinNontransfected K562K562 transfected with LFA-1Streptolysin O6.7 nm2.6 nmS. areus α-toxin8.1 nm6.6 nmV. cholerae cytolysin50 pm24 pmHlyA6.9 nm1.9 nm Open table in a new tab Superoxide Generation by Granulocytes Induced by HlyA—Wild-type HlyA in a concentration range of 0.5 to 200 pm was applied to PMNs and production of reactive oxygen species was determined using the luminol assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, an oxidative burst was induced by HlyA in a narrow concentration range of 5 to 100 pm, with a maximum at 20 pm. At higher toxin concentrations, ATP decrease was apparent, but no oxidative burst could be observed. This accorded with the early report showing that at high concentration cells were killed before a burst could be generated (10Bhakdi S. Greulich S. Muhly M. Eberspacher B. Becker H. Thiele A. Hugo F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 737-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When cells were incubated with the nonlytic mutant K690R, no oxidative burst was observed at any toxin concentration from 1 to 2000 pm (Fig. 4B). In a further experiment, cells were preincubated with 2000 pm K690R followed by 20 pm wild-type HlyA. Despite irreversible binding of inactive toxin at this high concentration, the cells responded in a similar manner to stimulation by wild-type toxin (Fig. 4B). These findings led us to suspect that membrane permeabilization was directly responsible for triggering the oxidative burst, possibly because of Ca2+ influx into the cell. Indeed, Ca2+ influx was found to occur already at a toxin concentration of 10 pm (Fig. 4C). In contrast, no Ca2+ influx was seen with the nonlytic mutant K690R at an excess concentration of 400 pm (Fig. 4D). In a final experiment, cells were incubated with HlyA on ice in Ca2+-containing buffer for 15 min. This allowed the toxin to bind in the absence of pore formation. Following two washes in ice-cold buffer without Ca2+, cells were resuspended in buffer with or without Ca2+ at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 5A, superoxide production was observed only in cells that had been resuspended in Ca2+-containing buffer, although pore formation and ATP-depletion occurred to the same extent in cells suspended in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 5B). The mechanism of binding of RTX toxins to cells has remained an enigmatic and controversial issue to the present day. Because HlyA can efficiently permeabilize artificial protein- and glycolipid-free membranes, it is evident that a receptor need not exist (7Menestrina G. Mackman N. Holland I.B. Bhakdi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Benz R. Schmid A. Wagner W. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 887-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, low concentrations of HlyA and other RTX toxins trigger cellular events that are classically receptor-mediated, and there have been indications for a dual mechanism of binding of HlyA to nucleated cells; receptor-mediated binding has been proposed to occur at low toxin concentrations and may be responsible for triggering cellular reactions, whereas nonspecific binding of the toxin to membrane lipids may be the primary event leading to pore formation and cell death (13Jeyaseelan S. Kannan M.S. Briggs R.E. Thumbikat P. Maheswaran S.K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6131-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Bhakdi S. Martin E. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dilemma faced by all workers in the field has been the lack of a sensitive method to quantify toxin binding. It has not been possible to produce functionally active, radioiodinated tracers, 4A. Valeva, I. Walev, and S. Bhakdi, unpublished observations. and all previous investigations therefore had to employ indirect and insensitive assays for binding. These included immunological methods (12Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J. Wang J.F. Shenker B.J. Ortlepp S. Robinson M.K. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30463-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), utilization of fluorescence-labeled toxins (26Herlax V. Bakas L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), or just the assessment of cellular cytotoxicity. In general, toxin preparations of undefined purity or even crude culture supernatants or cell lysates were employed. Taken together, these drawbacks have led to some uncertainties regarding the validity of conclusions drawn in previous studies. We approached the dilemma by producing the single cysteine substitution mutant S177C, which was found to retain biological activity and to tolerate thiol-specific derivatization with NEM. Using labeled toxin we found that, independently of fatty acylation, HlyA bound to cells with similar efficacy. Our results were in basic accord with earlier data that had shown comparable binding of nonacylated HlyA to liposomes when the toxin was applied at high concentrations (6Hyland C. Vuillard L. Hughes C. Koronakis V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This conclusion was now shown to be valid also at low toxin concentrations, and the inability of excess unlabeled toxin to reduce binding of radioactive nonlytic toxin mutants essentially eliminated the possible existence of a receptor. Expression of LFA-1 had been reported to render cells more sensitive toward the action of HlyA and leukotoxin (12Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J. Wang J.F. Shenker B.J. Ortlepp S. Robinson M.K. Billings P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30463-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and we confirmed this finding. However, transfected cells expressing integrin bound HlyA similarly to cells not expressing the integrin. Furthermore, blocking integrins with antibodies did not prevent HlyA binding. Finally, cytotoxicity assays performed with three other pore-forming toxins (unrelated to HlyA and not belonging to the RTX toxin family) indicated that the enhancement in susceptibility of the cells was not specific for HlyA. Together, these findings essentially ruled out a receptor role for LFA-1 in binding of HlyA. The increased sensitivity of LFA-1-expressing cells may be the result of the altered physical properties of the cellular membranes, in particular of the structure of membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts, as LFA-1 may be targeted to such membrane microdomains and affect their structure (27Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In fact, after β-methyl-cyclodextrin pretreatment, the susceptibility of K562 cells and the LFA-1-transfected K562 cells to lysis by HlyA was similar (data not shown), indicating that altered membrane structure in the presence of LFA-1 rather than a direct interaction of the toxin with LFA-1 may account for the observed difference in cell lysis by HlyA. Thus, our data speak against the existence of an HlyA receptor on PMNs and indicate that the toxin binds nonspecifically to lipid bilayers. How irreversible binding of HlyA should occur is unclear, but one possibility is that the toxin domain near the N terminus that harbors anphipathic α-helices spontaneously inserts into the membranes. This could initially remain without consequence to bilayer integrity, poreformation requiring the additional presence of fatty acids, which might insert or cause insertion of other amino acid sequences into the bilayer. Fatty acylation at position 690 is thereby absolutely essential, whereas lack of fatty acylation at position 564 leads only to reduction of poreforming activity (3Stanley P. Packman L.C. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Of distinct interest is the fact that Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase, another member of the RTX toxins, is monoacylated at the position corresponding to Lys-690 in HlyA (28Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 348-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To summarize, all of our findings indicate that HlyA binds nonspecifically to lipid bilayers and that cellular reactions are triggered by uncontrolled fluxes of ions, particularly Ca2+, through the pores. The reactions are observed only in a narrow range of toxin concentrations, because higher doses will rapidly kill the cells. It is not excluded that other members of the RTX toxin family may bind to receptors; however, this possibility remains to be stringently examined, and the approach described here may prove useful for future studies. We thank Colin Hughes and Vassilis Koronakis for providing the plasmids carrying HlyA and Lys replacement mutants and Falk Fahrenholz for useful suggestions."

Since the late 1970s, Cuba has experienced multiple epidemics of dengue, a viral disease that now has a global distribution. GuzmAin chronicles the multi-pronged research that she and her colleagues have been conducting throughout this period in an effort to expose the virus's molecular details, as well as the biological responses it evokes in those infected with the virus. The great strides that she and her colleagues have been able to take in this research arena stem from commitments that Cuba has made to public health and education since the late 1960s.

The structural basis for P-2 or P-5 preference is known for two AGC kinases (family of protein kinases A, G, and C) in which it is mediated by a single pair of acidic residues (PEN+1 and YEM+1). We sought a general understanding of P-2 and P-5 Arg preference. The strength of Arg preference at each position was assessed in 15 kinases using a new degenerate peptide library approach.

Preference for Arg at P-2 was so critical to PAK recognition that PAK1 activity was virtually eliminated by mutating the PEN+1 or YEM+1 residues.

The term “basophilic kinase” has been used to describe kinases that preferentially phosphorylate substrates having basic residues in close proximity to the phosphorylation site (1Pinna L.A.

PKC specificity proved to be more complex and to include preference for basic residues distributed on both sides of the phosphorylation site (4O'Brian C.A. Lawrence D.S. Kaiser E.T. Weinstein I.B.

By 1990, some information on peptide specificity was available for about 20 kinases, of which the majority had evident preference for basic residues (7Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). protein kinase A PKA, PKG, and PKC family kinases calmodulin-dependent protein kinase residue at position +1 in kinase GEL motif (see supplemental Fig. S1) Ste20 kinases PAK1.H83L.H86L residue at position +1 in kinase PEN motif (see supplemental Fig. S1) residue at position +1 in kinase YEM motif (see supplemental Fig. S1) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid mitogen-activate protein kinase kinase MAPKK kinase p21-activated kinase The structural basis for the well defined basophilic preference of PKA was solved concurrently by two different approaches: mutational analysis (8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (9Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The strong preference of PKA for Arg at P-3 was assigned to a single acidic residue (Glu-127) by both approaches. We refer to this residue as GEL+1 4The acidic pair pattern (yy, yn, ny, and nn) describes whether a kinase domain has an acidic residue at PEN+1 (first yes or no) and at YEM+1 (second y or n). to provide a general nomenclature rather than kinase-specific numbering. GEL refers to the consensus sequence of a conserved motif, and the +1 refers to its position relative to the first residue in that motif (supplementary Fig. S1). The GEL+1 acidic residue is located on the hinge that connects the kinase N-lobe to the C-lobe. GEL+1 co-ordinates both with ATP and Arg at the P-3 position (10Madhavan R. Jarrett H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding in PKA has proven to be a general rule for many kinases. Additional mutational analyses have clarified and generalized the critical importance of this acidic residue in PKA as well as other kinases (11Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Muramatsu T. Asai A. Kuchino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18659-18666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This feature is so general for basophilic kinases that degenerate peptide approaches generally use Arg as P-3 as the anchor residue for peptides (13Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The strong preference of PKA for Arg P-2 was shown to be conferred by two acidic residues: PEN+1 (Glu-171) and YEM+1 (Glu-230) (8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These residues are widely separated in the linear sequence (in the catalytic loop and F-helix, respectively), but in three dimensions their side chains are close to each other in the major groove. In PKA, they cooperate in creating a negatively charged pocket. This finding has been extrapolated to the closely related PKCs to explain the observed role of Arg at the P-2 position for PKCs (14He X. Liu Y. Sharma V. Dirksen R.T. Waugh R. Sheu S.S. Min W. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain how general this will prove to be. Specifically, 1) there is major variation in Arg preference at P-2 among basophilic kinases, and 2) there is also complex variation between Ser/Thr kinases in the residues present at PEN+1 and YEM+1 (see “Results” and “Discussion”). The functional relationship between these is not clear, because there are no additional solved structures with Arg in substrate at P-2, and virtually no mutational analysis has been done of PEN+1 or YEM+1 residues. Further interest and complexity has emerged from a new finding relating to this pair of residues. The crystal structure of the AGC family kinase AKT1 shows that the P-5 Arg in a bound substrate occupies the same pocket formed by acidic residues at PEN+1 and YEM+1 (15Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, this pocket can function either for P-2 or P-5 Arg recognition. It is important to understand more generally the rules regarding basophilic kinases, their preference for Arg at positions other than P-3, and the structural basis for this preference. This is of both practical and theoretical interest. Practically, it is important to understand which basophilic kinases are most similar in specificity and therefore most likely to be confused in predicting/assigning substrates. At a theoretical level, such analysis facilitates understanding the molecular basis of peptide specificity and its evolution. We have undertaken this analysis of 15 diverse kinases from the AGC, CAMK, and STE kinase families using a new degenerate peptide library approach that objectively quantifies preference for Arg at each substrate position. Our studies demonstrate that PEN+1 and YEM+1 play a singular role in conferring strong P-2 or P-5 Arg preference in these three large kinase subfamilies. Kinases in the PAK family prove to be especially interesting in their exceptionally strong dependence on P-2 Arg recognition mediated by these two acidic residues. Peptide Synthesis and Kinases—Biotinylated single sequence peptides and degenerate peptides were synthesized as C-terminal amides on Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia) SynPhase Rink amide acrylic-grafted polypropylene solid support (loading 7.5 μmol) using conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as previously described (8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 15 catalytically active kinases were used. PKA, PKC-α, PKC-ζ, PKG, and p70S6K were purchased from Calbiochem. Pim1, MST4, PAK1, and PAK4 were purchased from ProQinase. PKD2, PDK1, CAMK II, and ASK1 were purchased from Upstate. A His6-tagged construct corresponding to residues 615-874 of human PRK1 (GenBank™ accession BC040061) was expressed in 293T cell by calcium phosphate transfection, and the corresponding protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. PKC-θ tagged at its N terminus with hexahistidine was expressed in baculovirus and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. PAK1 and PKC-θ were cloned into the Gateway system (Invitrogen) and expressed in vectors pDEST565 and pDEST26, respectively. Purification using nickel affinity chromatography was performed after expression. For all the proteins purified by us, SDS-PAGE and Silver (or Coomassie Blue) staining were carried out to verify the purity. Western Blot—The phosphorylation status of the activation loop of PAK1 mutants was checked by Western blot using specific anti-phospho T423 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Purified kinases in 1× SDS sample buffer were run in 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blotted with the appropriate antibody and developed with the ECL® kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Peptides were phosphorylated by in vitro kinase assay as previously described previously (8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of γ-32P-labeled ATP (in 100 μm cold ATP) was performed in 50 μl of solution under standardized conditions. For assays involving degenerate peptides, stoichiometry of phosphorylation was kept to <10%. After reaction termination, 50 pmol of substrate was transferred to streptavidin-coated plates, and emissions counted after extensive washing. Calculations of the preference score for each position (such as P-3) are based on approaches described by Yaffe and coworkers (9Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) for analysis of phosphorylation of degenerate peptides. We extended those approaches and validated their usefulness in predicting phosphorylation both of peptides and of proteins (8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In concept, the preference score for a particular position (such as P-3) is a log 2-based score determined by comparing the magnitude of phosphorylation of the 9 degenerate peptides with Arg at that position with average phosphorylation of all 45 degenerate peptides. Details of computation are as follows. 1) cpm values for each of the 45 peptides were converted to log 2 cpm. 2) For each set of 9 peptides that shared an Arg at a position the mean of the log 2 cpm values was determined (meanP-7, meanP-6,... meanP+3). 3) The preference score for Arg at a particular position was computed as the mean of its contribution in each of the 9 sets; therefore for the P-3 position it is the mean of the values: (log 2 cpmP-3/P-7 peptide - meanP-7), (log 2 cpmP-3/P-6 peptide - meanP-6),... (log 2 cpmP-3/P+3 peptide - meanP+3). Standard error was determined from the same nine values. Kinase buffers were customized for particular groups of kinases: 1) for PKC-ζ, PKD2, PKG, PKA, and PRK1 the buffer contained 100 mm HEPES, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2; 2) for PKC-α, PKC-δ, PKC-θ, and PDK1, the buffer contained all reagents used in #1 as well as 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml), which were added to kinase buffer immediately before the assay; 3) for CAMKII the buffer contained 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 8 μg/ml calmodulin and 1 mm dithiothreitol, which was minimally modified from Madhavan (10Madhavan R. Jarrett H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); 4) for Pim1 the buffer contained 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (11Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Muramatsu T. Asai A. Kuchino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18659-18666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); 5) for PAK1 and PAK4 the buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (12Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar); 6) for MST4 the buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, which was minimally modified (13Qian Z. Lin C. Espinosa R. LeBeau M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); 7) for ASK1 the buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate which was minimally modified (14He X. Liu Y. Sharma V. Dirksen R.T. Waugh R. Sheu S.S. Min W. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); and 8) for p70S6K the buffer contained is 20 mm MOPS, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 μm sodium vanadate, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin according to the supplier's protocol. Mutagenesis and Kinetic Parameters—All mutagenesis was carried out by following the protocol of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A148E mutation was made in PKC-θ to make a constitutively active form from which further mutants were derived. Mutants included D508A (because A is present in GRK2, whose kinase domain has 55% sequence similarity to θ over 270 residues) and E571I (because I is present in CamK IV, whose kinase domain has 54% similarity to θ over 250 residues). For PAK1, kindly provided by J. Chernoff, mutations of H83L and H86L (PAK1-LL) were first made to obtain a constitutively active kinase, and then D393A or E456I mutations were introduced. Before kinase assays to determine Km and kcat, a Western blot was done to adjust the purified kinases to equivalent concentrations. Serial 2-fold dilutions of substrate peptide from 100 μm to 0.2 μm were used, and the assays were performed at 30 °C for 10 min. Km and kcat were calculated by GraphPad Prism. Previous studies have shown that strong preference for Arg at P-2 or P-5 (usually in addition to preference for Arg at P-3) is characteristic of multiple basophilic kinases (1Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, it would be helpful to know whether P-2 and P-5 are uniquely important when one takes into account the many unstudied human kinases. We approached this question in an alternate way. We analyzed the overall pattern of basophilic preference among human Ser/Thr kinases by determining the distribution of Arg or Lys in reported mammalian Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites (supplemental Fig. S2). Our analysis of 1441 sites confirms a clear non-random distribution of basic preference. P-2 and P-5 are the only two positions (in addition to P-3) at which the abundance of Arg is clearly greater than the average Arg frequency in the human proteome. We therefore undertook analysis of the structural basis of this special pattern of basophilic preference. A degenerate peptide library approach was developed to quantitatively assess the position-specific preference of a kinase for Arg. Our “R-pair” method is based on a set of 45 degenerate peptides, each having exactly 2 fixed Arg and 1 fixed Ser (supplemental Fig. S3). The positions of the fixed Arg residues are varied systematically throughout the set so that it includes all possible combinations of two Arg from position P-7 to P+3. The remaining eight positions are synthesized with a degenerate mix of residues. Arg was chosen rather than Lys because it has been shown that the strongest preferences are generally for Arg not Lys (Refs. 8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, and 16Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S2). The approach uses pairs of Arg (rather than a single Arg per peptide) for two reasons. First, we wanted to be able to investigate whether there were strong synergistic effects of pairs of Arg. Second, the anticipated low efficiency of phosphorylation of degenerate peptides with single fixed arginines could cause problems due to low signal-to-noise ratios. Validation of this R-pair set was performed by analysis of three kinases whose peptide specificity and Arg preference has been analyzed systematically by other approaches: PKA, p70S6K, and PKC-α (Fig. 1). An assay with any particular kinase provides data on phosphorylation of the 45 R-pair peptides (supplemental Fig. S4). Of the 45 values, 9 correspond to a peptide with Arg at a particular position (such as P-3). Robust assessment of Arg preference at a position is obtained by comparing phosphorylation of those 9 peptides with the remainder of the set. The end result of this calculation is a log 2 score for each residue position that reflects the relative preference (if positive) or disfavor (if negative) for an Arg at that position compared with Arg at other positions in the peptide (Fig. 1). The results from the R-pair analysis are consistent with previous knowledge about the three kinases. PKA was discovered in the mid 1970s to have a simple and strong pattern of Arg preference at P-2 and P-3 (3Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is evident with the R-pair set. The peptide with Arg at P-2 and P-3 is uniquely well phosphorylated (supplemental Fig. S4), and the position-specific score likewise shows strong preference at P-2 and P-3 (Fig. 1). PKC is known to differ from PKA in having a more broadly distributed preference for Arg not only at P-2 and P-3 but also for Arg at C-terminal positions, especially P+2 (6House C. Wettenhall R.E. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 772-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Jarv J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This broader preference is reflected in the higher relative phosphorylation of many peptides (supplemental Fig. S4). In this context the position-specific scores (Fig. 1) are particularly helpful in distinguishing the most important Arg preferences at P-3, P-2, and P+2. Finally, p70S6K is known to have an Arg preference at P-3 and P-5 (17Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which is likewise evident both in individual peptides (supplemental Fig. S4) and in position-specific scores (Fig. 1). Five additional AGC kinases were then analyzed (Fig. 2). PKG, known to be similar to PKA in Arg preference, showed strong Arg preference at P-2 and P-3 and lesser preference at P-5. PRK1, PKC-θ, and PKC-ζ each share with PKC-α the three positions of strongest Arg preference: P-3, P-2, and P+2. However, the relative importance of the positions varied between these closely related kinases. For PKC-ζ and especially PKC-θ, the P-2 position was characterized by the strongest Arg preference. The especially strong preference of PKC-θ for Arg at P-2 was consistent in multiple experiments (cf. Fig. 3B) and differed from the other AGC kinases (for example PKA, PKG, and PRK) for which the strongest preference was at P-3. PDK1, whose Arg preference has not previously been studied in detail, differed from all seven other AGC kinases studied in lacking strong Arg preference at any position, including P-2 or P-3.FIGURE 3Detailed analysis of PKC-Î¸.

We were able to test this assumption for PKC, because it prefers a hydrophobic residue such as Phe or Leu at the P+1 position (8Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We created an additional test set of seven degenerate peptides all of which had a fixed Phe at the P+1 position. The peptides also had a single fixed Arg whose position varied between P-4 and P+4. Analysis of phosphorylation of this set by PKC-θ confirmed that the P-2 position was the single most important position for Arg. The next two most important were P+2 and P-3 (Fig. 3A). Thus, the relative importance of Arg placement as determined by the R-pair analysis was confirmed by the analysis using the set with Phe at P+1. We used mutational analysis to investigate whether the especially strong P-2 Arg preference of PKC-θ had the same structural basis as the P-2 Arg preference of PKA. PKC-θ residues Asp-508 (PEN+1) and Glu-571 (YEM+1) were each mutated to a residue found at the corresponding positions of closely related kinases: Asp-508 to Ala and Glu-571 to Ile. Assessment of the kinetic parameters of these mutants demonstrated that the mutations had not impaired the catalytic capacity of the kinase on a favorable substrate with basic residues at multiple positions (supplemental Fig. S5). Arg preferences of the mutant kinases were determined using the R-pair set (Fig. 3B). Wild-type protein purified from transfected mammalian cells showed the same dominant P-2 Arg preference observed with the commercial kinase preparation. The E571I mutant protein had greatly diminished preference for Arg at P-2. The D508A mutant protein also had a major decrease in preference for Arg at P-2. An additional mutant protein D544A served as a control. This residue was chosen because Asp-544 is the only other C-lobe acidic residue whose side chain is directed into the major groove. That protein showed no diminution of P-2 Arg preference. Thus the exceptional P-2 preference of PKC-θ is strongly influenced by E571 (YEM+1) and D508 (PEN+1). The foregoing PKC-θ data, taken together with the previous PKA data, suggest that strong P-2 Arg preference may always depend on cooperative function of the same pair of acidic residues in the C-lobe: PEN+1 and YEM+1. We therefore analyzed conservation of these residues among AGC kinases and the two kinase subfamilies most closely related to the AGC subfamily: CAMK and STE. It is useful to describe a kinase by a two character acidic pair pattern (yy, yn, ny, or nn) describing whether the kinase domain has an acidic residue at PEN+1 (first yes or no) and at YEM+1 (second y or n). The results (TABLE ONE) demonstrate two notable features related to this acidic pair pattern. First, the AGC, STE, and CAMK subfamilies differ in their predominant acidic pair pattern. Most of the AGC kinases have a yy pattern (i.e. acidic residues at both positions). Most of the CAMK have a yn pattern (i.e. acidic residue at PEN+1 but not at YEM+1), and most of the STE kinases have an ny pattern (i.e. acidic residue at YEM+1 but not at PEN+1). Second, within each subfamily there are 10-25% of kinases which deviate from the predominant pattern.TABLE ONETabulation of patterns of acidic residues among AGC, CAMK, and STE kinasesPattern of acidic residues in kinase domainAcidic pair patternPEN+1 residue PKA:Glu-170YEM+1 residue PKA:Glu-230Kinase family (number of kinases in family)AGC 63CAMK 83STE 48% of kinases in family with pattern indicatedP—2 and P—5-related patternyyAsp/GluAsp/Glu89419ynAsp/GluNot Asp/Glu5802nyNot Asp/GluAsp/Glu3075nnNot Asp/GluNot Asp/Glu3174P—3-related patternAsp/Glu at GEL+1 (PKA:Glu-127)98920 Open table in a new tab Our foregoing analysis included seven AGC family kinases (Figs. 1 and 2). PDK1, the only one with a yn pattern, lacked strong P-2 Arg preference. Of the six with a yy pattern, all but one had a strong P-2 Arg preference. The outlier was p70S6K, which showed a strong P-5 Arg preference instead of a P-2 Arg preference. This finding for p70S6K fits the concept that emerged from analysis of AKT1 (19Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), namely that the same pair of acidic residues can function in an alternative mode, which mediates strong preference for Arg at P-5 if a bulky hydrophobic residue changes access to that pocket (see “Discussion”).

It is also involved in some forms of apoptosis. Here we have analyzed the role of p73, a homolog of tumor suppressor p53, in regulating human caspase-1 gene transcription. The caspase-1 promoter was strongly activated by p73α and p73β primarily through a p53/p73 responsive site. Overexpression of p73 by transient transfection increased the caspase-1 mRNA level. Treatment of cells with cisplatin (which increases p73 protein level) resulted in increased caspase-1 promoter activity and its mRNA level. Blocking of p73 function by a dominant negative mutant reduced basal as well as cisplatin-induced caspase-1 promoter activity. Mutation of the p73 responsive site abolished cisplatin-induced activation of the promoter. Interferon-γ induced caspase-1 promoter activity and this was reduced by p73-directed small hairpin RNA and also by a dominant negative mutant of p73. Abrogation of the p73 responsive site partially inhibited interferon-γ-induced activation of the caspase-1 promoter. Treatment of HeLa cells with interferon-γ resulted in an increase in p73 protein as well as its activity. Mutation of the IRF-1 binding site abolished interferon-γ-induced caspase-1 promoter activity but p73-induced activation was only marginally reduced. IRF-1 cooperated with p73 and cisplatin cooperated with interferon-γ in the activation of the caspase-1 promoter. Our results show that p73 is a regulator of caspase-1 gene transcription, and is required for optimal activation of the caspase-1 promoter by interferon-γ.

The p53 family consists of three distinct genes (p53, p63, and p73), which encode proteins showing structural and functional similarities. p53 family proteins are modular molecules having three major conserved domains, an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central sequence-specific DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (1Yang A.

The p73 gene generates multiple isoforms that vary in their N and C termini. The use of the cryptic promoter generates ΔN isoforms lacking the transactivation domain present in the N terminus of the p73 protein, and alternative splicing gives rise to several isoforms with various C-terminal ends (1Yang A.

The molecular mechanism of this defective immune response is not known. p73 has the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and can transactivate some p53 targets, but the efficiency with which each of them is induced is different (7Zhu J.

Unlike p53, which is induced by a variety of DNA-damaging agents and cellular stress, p73 is induced only by a subset of agents such as γ-irradiation and cisplatin (9Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Biological responses of IFN-γ are mediated mainly by the regulation of gene expression. Binding of IFN-γ to its heterodimeric receptor induces receptor oligomerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor-associated Janus kinases Jak1 and Jak2. These in turn phosphorylate the latent cytosolic transcription factor Stat-1. The phosphorylated Stat-1 dimerizes through SH2 domains, translocates to the nucleus, and regulates gene expression by binding to IFN-γ-activated sequences (16Stark G.R. Annu. Rev.

Stat-1 activates transcription of IRF-1, which is an activator of caspase-1 gene transcription (32Tamura T. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Oishi I. Aizawa S. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Taki S. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However in Stat-1-deficient cells, introduction of IRF-1 does not restore constitutive levels of caspase-1 gene expression (22Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition to Stat-1 and IRF-1, other transcription factors are likely to be involved in regulating caspase-1 gene transcription. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that endogenous p53 activated by treatment of cells with doxorubicin can regulate human caspase-1 gene transcription, through a functional binding site present at –85 to –66 position relative to the transcriptional start site (27Gupta S. Radha V. Furukawa Y. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10585-10588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This p53 binding site is not conserved in the murine caspase-1 promoter. Here we have analyzed the role of p73 in regulating human caspase-1 gene transcription. p73α and p73β isoforms strongly activated the caspase-1 promoter. Treatment of cells with anticancer drug cisplatin resulted in increased caspase-1 promoter activity, which was inhibited by blocking p73 function. IFN-γ-induced caspase-1 promoter activity required the p73 responsive site as well as functional p73 protein for optimal response. Our results suggest that IFN-γ-induced caspase-1 gene transcription involves interdependent action of p73 and IRF-1.

The reporter plasmid pC-MT-IRF with mutated IRF-1 responsive site was made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using 5′-GGA AGG CGA AGC ATA CCC TCA GCC TCA GTC ACA CAA GAA GGG-3′ and its complementary oligonucleotide as mutagenesis primers (mutated sites are underlined). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by automated sequencing. The reporter construct pCAT-p73–2 was prepared by cloning two sets of oligonucleotides (with p73 responsive sites) in the pCAT promoter plasmid (Promega) downstream of the SV-40 promoter in PstI and BamHI sites. The sequence of the insert is CTGCAGTTACAGGCATGTGCCACCATGCCTGACTCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCAGCCAGGCATGGTGGTGCATGCCTGTAAGGATCC. The core sequence of p73/p53 responsive element is underlined in this sequence. This reporter construct was responsive to p53 as well as p73. Cells grown in 35-mm dishes or 24-well plates were transfected with pC-WT (or pC-MT-p53), pCMV.SPORT-β-gal (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) and indicated amounts of plasmids expressing various p73 isoforms or IRF-1. The total amount of plasmid in each transfection was kept constant (1 μg for a 35-mm dish and 0.4 μg for 24-well plate) by adding control plasmid. Preparation of lysates and CAT assays were carried out as described (27Gupta S. Radha V. Furukawa Y. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10585-10588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Relative CAT activities were calculated after normalizing with β-galactosidase enzyme activities. Transactivation of the Caspase-1 Promoter by p73 Isoforms—We evaluated the ability of different isoforms of p73 to regulate the activity of the caspase-1 promoter. HeLa cells were transfected with either p73α- or p73β-expressing plasmids together with wild-type caspase-1 promoter-reporter (pC-WT) or caspase-1 reporter with mutated p53-binding site (pC-MT-p53) plasmids (Fig. 1A). A large increase in CAT activity was obtained with p73α (34-fold) and p73β (43-fold) at low concentrations (8 ng) of the plasmid used (Fig. 1B). The mutant reporter plasmid pC-MT-p53, which has mutated p53 binding site showed only 1.8- and 2.3-fold increase in activity by p73α and p73β, respectively. These results suggested that p73 activates caspase-1 gene transcription primarily through the same site that is recognized by p53 (p73/p53 responsive site, Fig. 1A). The activation of the caspase-1 promoter by p73α and p73β increased with increasing concentrations of the plasmids (Fig. 1C). At low concentrations (1 ng), both these isoforms of p73 showed similar activation of the promoter (about 10-fold), but at higher concentrations (100 ng), p73β showed much more activation (Fig. 1C). p73γ and p73δ could also activate the caspase-1 promoter mainly through the p73/p53 responsive site (data not shown). Activation of the Caspase-1 Promoter by Endogenous p73—Previously, it has been shown that overexpression of a p53 mutant (p53DD) or p73 mutant (p73DD) encompassing their respective oligomerization domains blocked the function of corresponding wild-type proteins (37Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 41Zaika A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53-dependent transcriptional activation and p53-dependent apoptosis were not affected by p73DD. We determined the affect of coexpression of p53DD and p73DD on transactivation function of p73β and p73δ. As shown in Fig. 2A, p73DD completely abolished the transactivation of pC-WT reporter by p73β and p73δ, which showed over a 100-fold increase in activity when used at high levels (200 ng of plasmid). As expected, p53DD did not inhibit transactivation function of p73 isoforms. Next we examined the affect of p53DD and p73DD on cisplatin-induced transactivation of the caspase-1 promoter. Cisplatin has been shown to increase the amount of p73 protein in cells (9Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.G. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with the required plasmids and 24-h post-transfection, these cells were treated with 10 μm cisplatin for 24 h. Untreated controls were cells to which only vehicle (DMF) was added. Cisplatin treatment resulted in an increase of caspase-1 promoter activity, which was abolished by p73DD coexpression (Fig. 2B). Cisplatin-induced increases in caspase-1 promoter activity were not inhibited by p53DD. The expression of p73DD and p53DD was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). There was marked decrease in basal activity of the caspase-1 promoter in the presence of p73DD (80% reduction) as compared with control, whereas no inhibition of CAT activity was observed with p53DD coexpression (Fig. 2B). The mutant promoter (pC-MT-p53) was not activated by treatment of cells with cisplatin (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that up-regulation of caspase-1 promoter activity by cisplatin treatment was mediated by p73 through the p73/p53 responsive site. In addition, these results suggested that the basal level of caspase-1 promoter activity required p73 function. p73-dependent Expression of Caspase-1 mRNA—The level of caspase-1 mRNA was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis in response to transient overexpression of p73β and p73δ in MCF-7 cells, which have extremely low levels of endogenous caspase-1. Caspase-1 mRNA levels increased severalfold by overexpression of p73β and p73δ as compared with the control transfected cells (Fig. 3A). By using appropriate primers we found that only the α-isoform of caspase-1 was induced in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). There was no increase in the level of IRF-1 mRNA in response to overexpression of p73 isoforms (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of p73α and p73β in U2OS osteosarcoma cells also resulted in increased caspase-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A, lower panel). To analyze the effect of endogenous p73 protein on caspase-1 gene expression we carried out RT-PCR analysis after cisplatin treatment of two human tumor cells. Treatment of p53-negative K562 cells with cisplatin up-regulated the caspase-1 mRNA severalfold (Fig. 3B). In addition, treatment of K562 cells with some apoptosis-inducing agents, staurosporine and cycloheximide did not increase caspase-1 mRNA (Fig. 3B) suggesting that caspase-1 up-regulation is not a general response during apoptosis. Cisplatin treatment of HeLa cells lead to an increase in caspase-1 mRNA (Fig. 3D). RT-PCR analysis with appropriate primers revealed that both α- and β-isoforms of caspase-1 were up-regulated in HeLa cells upon cisplatin treatment whereas the γ- and δ-isoforms of caspase-1 were not detected (Fig. 3D). Cisplatin treatment increased p73 protein levels in HeLa cells and also in K562 cells (Fig. 3, C and E). The procaspase-1 protein was processed upon cisplatin treatment of HeLa cells (Fig. 3E). Our results suggested that p73 had a role in basal caspase-1 promoter activity. We hypothesized that expression of caspase-1 should be low in the cells in which endogenous p73 function is inhibited by expressing a dominant negative mutant of p73. To test this, we obtained clones of HeLa cells expressing p73DD or mp73DD (L371P mutant of p73DD) by transfection followed by selection in G418 for 15 days. Their expression was confirmed by probing the immunoblot with T7 tag antibody (Fig. 3F). The L371P mutant of p73DD has been shown to be functionally inactive (37Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Indeed, p73DD-expressing cells showed reduced expression of procaspase-1 compared with cells expressing mp73DD (Fig. 3F).

https://openalex.org/W2090590635,"The Ure2 protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has prion properties. In vitro and at neutral pH, soluble Ure2p spontaneously forms long, straight, insoluble protein fibrils. Two models have been proposed to account for the assembly of Ure2p into protein fibrils. The “amyloid backbone” model postulates that a segment ranging from 40 to 70 amino acids in the flexible N-terminal domain from different Ure2p molecules forms a parallel superpleated β-structure running along the fibrils (Kajava, A. V., Baxa, U., Wickner, R. B., and Steven, A. C. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 7885-7890). The second model hypothesizes that assembly of full-length Ure2p is driven by limited conformational rearrangements and non-native inter- and/or intramolecular interactions between Ure2p monomers (Bousset, L., Thomson, N. H., Radford, S. E., and Melki, R. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 2903-2911). Here, we performed a cysteine scan on residues located in the N- and C-terminal parts of Ure2p to determine whether these domains interact. Amino acid sequences centered around residue 6 in the N-terminal domain of Ure2p and residue 137 in the C-terminal moiety interacted at least transiently via intramolecular interactions. We documented the assembly properties of a Ure2p variant in which a disulfide bond was established between the N- and C-terminal domains and showed that it possesses assembly properties indistinguishable from those of wild-type Ure2p. We probed the structure of Ure2pC6C137 within the fibrils and demonstrate that the polypeptide is in a conformation similar to that of its soluble assembly-competent state. Our results constitute the first structural characterization of the N-terminal domain of Ure2p in both its soluble assembly-competent and fibrillar forms. Our data indicate that the flexibility of the N-terminal domain and conformational changes within this domain are essential for fibril formation and provide new insight into the conformational rearrangements that lead to the assembly of Ure2p into fibrils and the propagation of the [URE3] phenotype in yeast.

Bakers' yeast cells exhibiting the non-mendelian genetic element [URE3] (1Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 519-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show altered negative regulation of nitrogen metabolism (2Mitchell A.P. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2758-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Courchesne W.E. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Coschigano P.M. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The [URE3] phenotype is due to the prion properties of the Ure2 protein (5Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to other proteins with prion properties from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ure2p is a two-domain protein. The physical boundary between the two domains is residue 94 (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, rich in asparagine, glutamine, serine, and threonine residues (62% of the total residues), is crucial for prion propagation and is therefore referred to as the prion domain (7Masison D.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1995; 270: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The compactly folded, mainly α-helical (8Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the soluble form of natural dimeric Ure2p, the prion domain is believed to be poorly structured (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

We have shown recently, however, that it certainly contains some elements of secondary structure (14Bousset L. Redeker V. Decottignies P. Dubois S. Le Marechal P. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A number of studies suggest a potential interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of Ure2p. Indeed, evidences for an interaction between regions 1-63 and 152-354 were found using the two-hybrid test (15Fernandez-Bellot E. Guillemet E. Baudin-Baillieu A. Gaumer S. Komar A.A. Cullin C. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Region 151-158 was later described as inhibiting prion propagation (16Maddelein M.L. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4516-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Finally, an increased rate of [URE3] occurrence was described for a Ure2p variant (termed hM 1,2,3) when amino acid substitutions in region 10-17 and the region centered around residue 127 were associated (17Fernandez-Bellot E. Guillemet E. Cullin C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3215-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The observations made using the two-hybrid system do not allow distinguishing between inter- or intramolecular interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of Ure2p. The finding that region 151-158 has prion-inhibiting properties, together with the fact that the N-terminal domain is strictly required for prion propagation, suggests that regions within the C-terminal domain of Ure2p interact with the N-terminal domain. As a consequence, the protein remains in a state that has low aggregation propensity. Conversely, the prion-promoting activity of region 221-227 also suggests an interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of Ure2p (16Maddelein M.L. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4516-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the protein has high aggregation propensity. Last, the simplest explanation for the observation that, when associated, amino acid substitutions in the N- and C-terminal domains of Ure2p increase the rate of [URE3] occurrence is that these substitutions favor a state that has high aggregation propensity, possibly by impairing the interaction between the two domains. To determine whether the N- and C-terminal moieties of Ure2p interact, we performed a cysteine scan. A number of Ure2p variants in which Gly, Ser, Arg, and Phe residues located in the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein were replaced with cysteine residues were generated. Several such Ure2p variants were soluble. To determine whether the N- and C-terminal domains interact, Ure2p variants with cysteine residues in the N- and C-terminal domains were generated. The combination of Cys6 and Cys137 was interesting. Using this variant, we show here that the N-terminal domain of Ure2p interacts with its C-terminal moiety at least transiently via intramolecular interactions. We document the assembly properties of a Ure2p variant in which a bond was established between Cys6 and Cys137 disulfide and show that it possesses assembly properties indistinguishable from those of wild-type Ure2p. Finally, we probe the structure of Ure2pC6C137 within the fibrils and demonstrate that the polypeptide is in a conformation similar to that of its soluble state. These results strengthen the model we proposed for Ure2p assembly in which Ure2p fibrils obtained under physiologically relevant conditions are built of native-like units in a manner reminiscent of the assembly of other biological polymers (18Bousset L.

A number of Ure2p variants in which Gly, Ser, and Phe residues located in the N- and C-terminal parts of Ure2p were replaced with cysteine residues were generated.

Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), the pET-URE2FX expression vector (14Bousset L. Redeker V.

Ure2pC6C137 and Ure2pFXC6C137, in which the TTT codon encoding Phe137 was replaced with a TGT codon encoding a cysteine residue, were generated in the same manner using the pET-URE2C6 and pET-URE2FXC6 expression vectors, respectively, and primers 5′-CTAAGTGAACTTGGATGTCATTATAACACAATC-3′ and 5′-GATTGTGTTATAATGACATCCAAGTTCACTTAG-3′. Covalent Modification of Ure2pC6 and Cross-linking of Soluble and Fibrillar Ure2pC6 and Ure2pC6C137—Ure2pFXC6 (50 μm) in buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 55 μm DTT was incubated with 150 μm 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 2 h at 4 °C to allow the formation of a thioether bond between the sulfhydryl group of Ure2pC6 and the probe. The acetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (ADAN)-Ure2pC6 complex was separated from unreacted dye using a NAP-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B. Cross-linking of the soluble forms of Ure2pC6 and Ure2pC6C137 was achieved using two experimental conditions. After dialysis, the proteins were either incubated for 12 h at 4 °C in buffer B or incubated for 120 min at room temperature in buffer B containing 3 mm H2O2. Ure2pC6 and Ure2pC6C137 were assembled into fibrils in buffer A. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in buffer B and subjected to the treatments described above. Assembly of Ure2p into Fibrils—The assembly of soluble full-length wild-type Ure2p, Ure2pFX, Ure2pC6, Ure2pFXC6, Ure2pC6C137, and Ure2pFXC6C137 in buffer A was monitored by thioflavin T binding (20McParland V.J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) using a Quantamaster QM-4/2000 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Lawrenceville, NJ). Ure2p fibrils were also examined following negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate on carbon-coated grids (200 mesh) in a Philips EM410 electron microscope. Proteolytic Treatments of Soluble and Fibrillar Ure2p—Cleavage of Ure2pFX, Ure2pFXC6, and Ure2pFXC6C137 in buffer A by the restriction protease factor Xa (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Complete cleavage was obtained in 3 h at room temperature at an enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:40. Complete tryptic digestion of Ure2pC6C137 (0.5 mg/ml) was achieved at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w). The reaction was performed at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 75 mm KCl for 5 h. The trypsin used was sequencing grade from Roche Diagnostics. All cleavage reactions were stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride together with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The samples to be used for SDS-PAGE analysis were immediately mixed (1:1 volume ratio) with denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 12% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) with or without 2% β-mercaptoethanol (depending on whether the disulfide bound needed to be maintained or not), preheated at 95 °C, and further incubated at the same temperature for 4 min. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels (14 × 15 × 0.15 cm) following the standard method described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). To sequence the proteolytic products observed on the SDS gels, the polypeptides were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's recommendations (30User Bulletin 58. 1993; (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)Google Scholar). For other purposes including quantification, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, imaged using a Sony CCD camera, and further analyzed on a Macintosh computer (Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA) using NIH Image software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) Analysis—Soluble and fibrillar Ure2p and their respective fragments were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Aldrich) was used as matrix for long polypeptides, whereas α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) was used as matrix for short peptides. Both matrices were prepared as saturated solutions in 30% acetonitrile, 70% water, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The spectra were acquired on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nitrogen laser beam (337 nm) and a delayed extraction device. Mass measurements were performed in positive and linear modes. For protein samples, the accelerating voltage was 25 kV; the grid voltage was 90%; the guide wire was 0.3%; and the delayed extraction was 750 ns. For tryptic peptides, the acceleration voltage was 20 kV; the grid voltage was 93%; the guide wire was 0.1%; and the delayed extraction was 300 ns. Mass calibration was achieved using enolase, carbonic anhydrase, cytochrome c, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-(7-38), ACTH-(18-39), ACTH-(1-17), neurotensin, [Tyr8]substance P, and des-Arg-bradykinin. To confirm the establishment of disulfide bonds, samples were analyzed and then reduced directly on the MALDI target by addition of 5mm DTT in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The latter treatment was carried out for 10-20 min at room temperature, the time necessary to obtain a dry preparation. The samples were then washed with 5 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, supplemented with 0.5 μl of matrix, and further analyzed by mass spectrometry. Protein Sequencing—N-terminal sequences were obtained by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis system (Model 120A, Applied Biosystems).

Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and highly flexible (13Pierce M.M. Baxa U. Steven A.C. Bax A. Wickner R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We recently found evidence suggesting that this important part of Ure2p is not fully unstructured (14Bousset L. Redeker V. Decottignies P. Dubois S. Le Marechal P. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N- and C-terminal moieties interact, we generated a number of Ure2p variants in which Gly, Ser, Arg, and Phe residues located in the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein were replaced with cysteine residues. In a number of cases, single mutations led the protein to misfold and aggregate. Other variants such as Ure2pC6, Ure2pC17, Ure2pC137, Ure2pC221, Ure2pC276, Ure2pC283, Ure2pC290, Ure2pC292, and Ure2pC353 were soluble. All of these variants have the same α-helical content as wild-type Ure2p and are mainly dimeric as determined by circular dichroism measurements and analytical ultracentrifugation, respectively. To determine whether the N- and C-terminal domains interact, Ure2p variants in which each cysteine residue in the N-terminal domain was combined with those in the C-terminal domain were generated. The combination of Cys6 and Cys137, the secondary structure content of which is indistinguishable from that of wild-type Ure2p (supplemental Fig. 1), was interesting. Indeed, under reducing conditions, this Ure2p variant ran as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa, as did authentic Ure2p upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, under strong oxidative conditions, Ure2pC6C137 migrated on the gels as an entirely dimeric species (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The reaction products were characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS. Under reducing conditions (Fig. 1B), a single species with a molecular mass of 40,266 ± 15 Da (calculated MH+ of 40,256 Da) was observed, whereas an additional species with a molecular mass of 80,488 ± 15 Da formed under strong oxidative conditions (Fig. 1C). Identical results were observed when the Ure2pC6 variant was treated under the same conditions (Fig. 1D, lane 2) suggesting that the dimeric form of Ure2p is the consequence of the establishment of an intermolecular disulfide bond between Ure2pC6 monomers. This was confirmed by analyzing the degradation products of the Ure2pFXC6 dimer following treatment with the site-specific protease factor Xa by both SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 1, D and E). Treatment of reduced Ure2pFXC6 (Fig. 1D, lane 3) yielded two polypeptides corresponding to Ure2p-(1-94) and Ure2p-(95-354) with apparent molecular masses of 14 and 30 kDa, respectively (measured masses of 10,497 and 29,764 Da, respectively). Treatment of cross-linked Ure2pFXC6 (Fig. 1, D, lanes 4 and 5; and E) yielded two additional species with apparent molecular masses of 50 and 23 kDa (MH+ 21,039 Da) in addition to the 30-kDa species. The 50-kDa species corresponds to Ure2p/Ure2p-(1-94), whereas the 23-kDa species corresponds to the Ure2p-(1-94) dimer. Most interesting, however, under mild oxidative conditions, an additional band with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa was observed on the gel (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The latter species was not observed when the Ure2pC6 or Ure2pC137 variant was incubated under the same experimental conditions. The lower molecular mass of the latter species indicates that the Ure2p monomer was more compact after treatment and suggests internal cross-linking. Such a species can indeed occur, as the substitution of Phe137 with Cys leads to the partial exposure of the side chain of Cys137 to the solvent (supplemental Fig. 2) according to the crystal structure of Ure2p-(95-354) (8Bousset L. Belrhali H. Janin J. Melki R. Morera S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is important here to note that Cys137 needs to be partially exposed to avoid the establishment of disulfide bonds between two Cys137 residues. The proportions of the observed species under the different experimental conditions were determined and are summarized in TABLE ONE. Treatment of the slow and fast migrating Ure2pFXC6 species after cleavage by factor Xa with β-mercaptoethanol yielded a polypeptide with the molecular mass of authentic Ure2p (Fig. 1A, lane 5), suggesting that the observed species with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa is not a truncated form of Ure2p. This is further supported by the observations that (i) no additional species with lower molecular mass were detected by MALDI-TOF-MS and (ii) sequencing of the N-terminal amino acids of the fast migrating species yielded the expected sequence for authentic Ure2p, MMNNN.TABLE ONEUre2p molecular species that form under reducing, partially, and fully oxidative conditionsExperimental conditionsUre2pC6Ure2pC6C137Reducing100% monomer100% monomerMild oxidative50 ± 2% dimer, 50 ± 2% monomer45 ± 3% dimer, 30 ± 3% monomer, 25 ± 3% monomer with intramolecular disulfide bridgeStrong oxidative100% dimer100% dimer Open table in a new tab The Ure2pC6C137 forms generated under mild oxidative conditions were characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS following tryptic digestion of the reaction products. The peptide mass fingerprints of reduced and partially oxidized Ure2pC6C137 are presented in Fig. 2. Monoprotonated ions corresponding to peptides 1-17 and 128-152 were detected in the peptide mass fingerprint of reduced Ure2pC6C137 (average MH+ of 1924.2 and 2862.3 Da, respectively) (Fig. 2A). The ion corresponding to peptide 128-152 disappeared from the peptide mass fingerprint, and that of peptide 1-17 decreased significantly upon incubation of Ure2pC6C137 under mild oxidative conditions, whereas the ion corresponding to peptide 1-17 cross-linked through a disulfide bond ((1-17)-S-S-(1-17)) and the ion corresponding to peptide 1-17 cross-linked to peptide 128-152 ((1-17)-S-S-(128-152)) (MH+ of 3846.4 and 4784.5 Da, respectively) were detected (Fig. 2B). To document the specificity of the interaction between the regions centered around residues 6 and 137, the behavior of the Cys17/Cys137 and Cys6/Cys283 combinations were examined. No species with a lower molecular mass were obtained under strong or weak oxidative conditions for either variant. Instead, dimeric forms were generated (data not shown). This suggests that the range of conformations that the N-terminal domain of Ure2p can adopt is limited and that the interaction of the regions centered around residues 6 and 137 is stringent. Based on these observations, we conclude that the N-terminal domain of Ure2p is flexible, as it establishes intermolecular interactions with the N termini from other Ure2p molecules. Most important, however, we also conclude that it establishes at least transient, but specific intramolecular interactions with the C-terminal moiety of the polypeptide chain. Assembly Properties of Ure2pC6 in Its Reduced and Oxidized Forms—The ability of the Ure2pC6 variant to assemble into fibrils under reducing and oxidative conditions was next examined by thioflavin T binding and negative stain electron microscopy. The assembly kinetics of Ure2pC6 under reducing conditions and wild-type Ure2p were very similar (Fig. 3A). Although the assembly of wild-type Ure2p was unaffected by the strong oxidative conditions used in this study, that of Ure2pC6 was totally inhibited (Fig. 3A). Fibrils assembled from wild-type Ure2p and Ure2pC6 under reducing conditions were indistinguishable on negative stain electron micrographs (Fig. 3, B and C). By contrast, oxidized Ure2pC6 remained in a soluble oligomeric form (Fig. 3D), which has been described previously (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Bousset L. Redeker V. Decottignies P. Dubois S. Le Marechal P. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under the mild oxidative conditions used, when 50% of Ure2pC6 was cross-linked, the protein assembled into fibrils (Fig. 3A) with an increased lag phase, a decreased elongation rate, and thioflavin T fluorescence intensity at steady state. Ure2p assembly is highly cooperative (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Fay N. Inoue Y. Bousset L. Taguchi H. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30199-30205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A clearly shows that the assembly kinetics of 50% oxidized Ure2pC6 (41 μm) overlapped perfectly with that of wild-type Ure2p (20 μm). To strengthen our observations, we performed an SDS-PAGE analysis of the polypeptide content of the supernatant and pellet fractions of the assembled forms of wild-type Ure2p and reduced, 50% oxidized, and 100% oxidized Ure2pC6. The data are presented in Fig. 3E. They clearly demonstrate that cross-linked Ure2pC6 neither aggregated (s4 and p4 lanes) nor assembled into fibrils (s3 and p3 lanes). To further characterize the assembly properties of dimeric Ure2pC6, the elongation rates of preformed Ure2p fibrils were measured at a constant overall Ure2p concentration with increasing proportions of dimeric Ure2pC6. Control measurements in which the concentration of wild-type Ure2p or the reduced form of Ure2pC6 varied from 0 to 20 μm were run in parallel. The data presented in Fig. 3F clearly demonstrate that dimeric Ure2pC6 did not interfere with the assembly reaction. The decreased assembly propensity of Ure2p upon establishment of intermolecular disulfide bonds may be the consequence of (i) the tightening of the Ure2p N-terminal domain in a given conformation; (ii) the reduction of its flexibility and, as a consequence, the number of conformations it can adopt; or (iii) the disruption of a potential intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein. To distinguish among these three hypothesis, a large hydrophobic group (ADAN) was attached to the reactive Cys6 residue to hinder a potential intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein, and the assembly properties of the modified Ure2pC6 variant was documented by thioflavin T binding and negative stain electron microscopy. Fig. 4A clearly demonstrates that the ability of reduced Ure2pC6 to assemble into fibrils was abolished upon modification of Cys6 by the hydrophobic ADAN group. Large amorphous aggregates formed instead (Fig. 4B), although the protein remained monomeric upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C). We conclude from these observations that hindering a potential intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the pro"

These cells may be useful for identifying transcription factors that reactivate γ-globin synthesis or screening γ-globin inducers for the treatment of sickle cell disease or β-thalassemia. Members of the human β-like globin gene family are developmentally regulated. The genes are arrayed in the order in which they are expressed during development, 5′-ϵ-Gγ-Aγ-δ-β-3′. During primitive erythropoiesis, the embryonic ϵ-globin gene is expressed in nucleated, yolk sac-derived erythroid cells. Later, during fetal definitive erythropoiesis, the tandem fetal γ-globin genes are expressed in enucleated erythroid cells of the fetal liver. Finally, the β-globin gene, and to a much lesser extent, the δ-globin gene, are expressed initially in the liver during fetal definitive erythropoiesis and ultimately in bone marrow-derived erythroid cells during adult definitive erythropoiesis. The temporally regulated expression of the β-like globin genes provides a paradigm for developmental control in mammalian cells. Transgenic mice have been instrumental to the identification of many cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors necessary for normal developmental control. The individual globin genes, including their gene-proximal regulatory sequences, are variably expressed in transgenic mice.

An improved understanding of globin gene regulation is clinically relevant since the beneficial effects of elevated fetal hemoglobin levels (HbF, α2γ2) in patients with sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia are well documented (2Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P.W. Perlmutter R.M. Varmus H. Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2001: 135-182Google Scholar). Considerable attention has been directed at identifying Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) that specifically transactivate γ-globin gene expression as a potential approach to gene therapy (3Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3571-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Asano H. Li X.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 95: 3578-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, many investigations have focused on identifying new pharmacological compounds that are capable of inducing γ-globin production (5Swank R.A. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the identification of γ-globin inducers, either proteins or drugs, has been hampered by the lack of suitable in vitro model systems for selection of activators or for screening chemical compounds. A number of in vitro models for evaluating putative γ-globin inducers have been reported. Cultures of primary adult human erythroid progenitors capitalize on the significant levels of γ-globin that are detected in these cells. Cultures of primary human burst-forming units-erythroid, either in clonogenic assays (6Constantoulakis P. Knitter G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 1989; 74: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in suspension (7Fibach E. Prasanna P. Rodgers G.P. Samid D. Blood. 1993; 82: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been used to evaluate putative γ-globin inducers. However, these assays cannot be standardized; thus, they are difficult to use for large scale screening. Although greater levels of standardization can be achieved with established erythroid cell lines, none of the human erythroleukemia lines display a normal adult pattern of globin gene expression. K562 cells, commonly used for this purpose, predominantly express γ-globin, variable levels of ϵ-globin, and no β-globin. Therefore, an increase in γ-globin gene transcription in K562 cells may be a consequence of promoting globin gene expression generally rather than via a mechanism that preferentially activates γ-globin gene expression. Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells display an adult pattern of globin gene expression; however, as noted above, mice lack a fetal globin gene. Initial attempts to develop MEL cells suitable for screening γ-globin inducers involved the generation of stably transfected cells incorporating various DNA fragments containing the human γ-globin gene, but transgenic cell lines generated in this manner failed to demonstrate proper regulation of the introduced γ-globin gene (8Skarpidi E. Vassilopoulos G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Li Q. Blood. 1998; 92: 3416-3421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, γ-globin gene expression in MEL cells containing a human β-globin locus YAC transgene was not correctly regulated (9Peterson K.R. Zitnik G. Huxley C. Lowrey C.H. Gnirke A. Leppig K.A. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11207-11211Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Vassilopoulos G. Navas P.A. Skarpidi E. Peterson K.R. Lowrey C.H. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 1999; 93: 703-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In MEL 585 cells, β-globin gene expression predominates, although some γ-globin gene product is observed, whereas in GM979 cells, γ-globin and β-globin are co-expressed. Finally, developmental stage appropriate expression of human globin genes is achieved over time in hybrids generated from MEL cells fused to human fetal liver cells (HFE-MEL hybrids) or in MEL cells fused to human lymphoblasts (11Papayannopoulou T. Brice M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Cell. 1986; 46: 469-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the degree of completion of switching is variable, and the cells eventually display the globin expression pattern of the terminal MEL cells used in the initial fusion. None of the aforementioned cell systems completely mirror adult erythropoiesis; that is, γ-globin expression is markedly higher than normal adult human physiological levels, even in those cell lines in which β-globin is the major species synthesized. Thus, these models can only be used to screen for enhancement of already existent low level γ-globin gene expression rather than to select for activation of a silent γ-globin gene. We reasoned that immortalized cells derived from the bone marrow of β-YAC transgenic mice might express exclusively β-globin since the human pattern of globin transgene synthesis was recapitulated in these mice. β-YAC bone marrow cells (BMCs) were established using an artificial proliferation signal comprised of the thrombopoietin (mpl) signaling domain fused to FKBP binding domains responsive to a chemical inducer of dimerization (CID; Refs. 12Spencer D.M.

In the presence of a CID, homodimers are generated, and the resultant growth signal maintains the BMC population indefinitely as long as the CID is present. These cells exclusively expressed human β-globin, but γ-globin expression can be reactivated by various treatments or through the presence of a hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) mutation in the Aγ-globin gene. Therefore, these CID-dependent, multipotential β-YAC BMCs provided a model system in which γ-globin protein transactivators can be selected and pharmacologic inducers of HbF can be definitively screened. Transgenic Mice—Generation of β-YAC transgenic mice was described previously (1Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

After 48 h, marrow cells were collected and cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 16% fetal calf serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT), 5% mouse interleukin-3 supplement (BD Biosciences), recombinant human interleukin-6 (100 ng/ml), and recombinant mouse stem cell factor (50 ng/ml; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After prestimulation, cells were transferred onto irradiated (1,500 centigrays) GPE+86 producer cells containing an F36V-modified FKBP12 derivative fused to the intracellular portion of the thrombopoietin receptor mpl. Two F36Vmpl vectors were used, one containing a green fluorescent protein marker downstream of an internal ribosomal entry site (17Jin L. Zeng H. Chien S. Otto K.G. Richard R.E. Emery D.W. Blau C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or a neomycin reporter expressed from a separate phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (14Jin L. Siritanaratkul N. Emery D.W.

Transductions were carried out using the same growth factors as for prestimulation with the addition of Polybrene (8 μg/ml; Sigma). After 48 h, cells were washed and cultured in the presence of AP20187 dimerizer (100 nmol/liter; Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. CID-dependent BMCs were similarly established from 248-kb –117 Greek HPFH β-YAC transgenic mice. This approach was also used to establish drug-dependent cells from transgenic murine fetal liver (day 12 post-conception). Livers were dissected from day 12 fetuses, and single cell liver suspensions were prepared as described (18Peterson K.R. Genet. Eng. 1997; 19: 235-255Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Stable Transfection of CID-dependent Wild-type β-YAC BMCs with pcDNA3.1/Hygro gg1-VP64—A 0.8-kb ApaI-HindIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) fragment was isolated from pcDNA-gg1-VP64-HA (19Graslund T.

CID-dependent cells derived from β-YAC mice (3.5 × 106) were washed in PBS and resuspended in 0.8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. During the transfection, both cells and the DNA/Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) mix were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The DNA/Lipofectamine mix was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using 4 μg of plasmid DNA in 10 μl of Lipofectamine; this mix was incubated for 45 min. Cells were added to the DNA/Lipofectamine, and the transfection mixture was incubated for 6 h at 37 °Cin 5% CO2 before adding 3 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 10 mm HEPES supplemented with CID and 0.1 ml of extra fetal bovine serum. After overnight incubation, cells were centrifuged (200 × g, room temperature) and resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with CID and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. After selection, clones were generated by limiting dilution and were screened by Southern blot hybridization analysis (data not shown).

For antibody staining, cells were washed with PBS in 15-ml conical tubes and then fixed in 1 ml of freshly prepared 5% paraformaldehyde/PBS, pH 7.2, for 1 h at 37°C. After the addition of 10 ml of PBS/0.1% BSA (PBS/BSA), cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. 10 ml of PBS/BSA were added; cells were centrifuged and washed once more in PBS/BSA. Cells were resuspended in 100 μlof PBS/BSA containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μg of primary mouse anti-human γ-globin chain antibody (Cortex catalog number CR8115M1, San Leandro, CA) diluted in PBT. 10 ml of PBS/BSA were added, and cells were centrifuged as above. This wash was repeated twice more. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBT and incubated with 100 μl of secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog number 115-095-146, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:750 in PBT at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed in the same manner as for the primary antibody. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of PBS; 5-μl aliquots were applied to slides. Control samples were prepared similarly except that the fix only control had no antibody added, and the secondary antibody control had no primary antibody added. Results were observed with a Nikon E800 microscope at ×200 magnification using an EF-4 fluorescein isothiocyanate Hyq filter set. Results were documented using a Photometrics Cool Snap ES camera and MetaMorph software. Software was set to automatically correct for nonspecific background using an image of the secondary antibody control sample. Analysis of Globin and Transcription Factor mRNA Levels Using RT-PCR—Total cDNAs were synthesized from RNA isolated from β-YAC bone marrow or fetal liver cells using an oligo(dT) primer (Promega, Madison, WI) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was combined with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) in a total volume of 11 μl and preheated at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled rapidly on ice followed by the addition of 4 μlof5× first strand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, and 1 μl of RNasin. The reaction mixture was heated to 42 °C for 2 min, at which point 1 μl of Superscript II RT was added, and the reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. The RT enzyme was heat-inactivated by incubation at 70 °C. For globin gene products, PCR was performed using the following three sets of primers in a single reaction: mouse α-globin, 5′-GATTCTGACAGACTCAGGAAGAAAC-3′ (forward), 5′-CCTTTCCAGGGCTTCAGCTCCATAT-3′ (reverse); human γ-globin, 5′-GACCGTTTTGGCAATCCATTTC-3′ (forward), 5′-TATTGCTTGCAGAATAAGCC-3′ (reverse); and human β-globin, 5′-ACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGCAACCTCA-3′ (forward), 5′-GGTTGCCCATAACAGCATCAGGAGT-3′ (reverse). Each reaction contained 5 μlof10× NH4 buffer, 2 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μl of 25 mm dNTP mix, 25 pmol of forward primers, 25 pmol of reverse primers, 2 μl of cDNA, and 1 unit of Biolase Taq polymerase (Bioline, Randolph, MA). PCR was carried out with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 7 min, 25 cycles of 1 min steps at 95, 58, and 72 °C followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All globin primers were designed to cross an exon so that RNA-templated reverse-transcribed DNA amplification products could be distinguished from gene amplification products. Similar reaction conditions were used for FGIF and NF-E4 mRNAs; primer sets were the same as used to generate the full-length cDNA clones described above. RT-PCR for gg1-VP64 mRNA was performed as described, except that the first PCR was omitted (19Graslund T. Li X. Magnenat L. Popkov M. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3707-3714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All of the PCR reactions to detect expression were semiquantitative. We have previously described a system that allows multipotential cell lines to be established from murine bone marrow. This system uses a retroviral vector to introduce a gene encoding a conditional signaling molecule into mouse BMCs followed by activation of the signaling molecule using a small molecule drug called a chemical inducer of dimerization (25Neff T. Blau C.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 2535-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A CID-activated derivative of the thrombopoietin receptor, mpl, induces transduced mouse BMCs to expand dramatically in culture. Cells generated in this manner adopt predominantly megakaryocytic features but also include multipotential progenitors capable of generating monocytes, neutrophils, and erythroid cells, but not B or T lymphoid cells, upon the addition of the appropriate growth factors (17Jin L. Zeng H. Chien S. Otto K.G. Richard R.E. Emery D.W. Blau C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Zeng H. Masuko M. Jin L. Neff T. Otto K.G. Blau C.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cultures can be maintained for longer than a year, and cell growth remains strictly dependent upon the continued presence of the CID. Our initial studies demonstrated that cells generated in this manner expressed adult mouse α-, βmaj -, and βmin-globin mRNAs that could be readily detected by RNase protection assays (data not shown). To test whether the human β-globin locus would be appropriately regulated in cells derived from the bone marrow of adult mice, we generated F36Vmpl-transduced cells from transgenic mice containing a 155-kb β-YAC. Three independent cell populations were established and assessed. RNase protection assays demonstrated that the resultant CID-dependent cells expressed human β-globin mRNA, but not human γ-globin, establishing that proper developmental control was maintained (Fig. 1A). The higher level of human β-globin relative to mouse α-globin was attributed to a significant reduction in mouse α-globin levels in the cells when compared with the β-YAC mice. A parallel decrease in mouse β-globin mRNA was also observed (data not shown). These findings also indicated a lack of environmental influence on the pattern of β-like globin gene expression, suggesting that the mechanisms regulating β-globin expression are cell-autonomous. To confirm that the pattern of globin gene expression observed in β-YAC mice is maintained in derivative cell lines, we performed two additional studies. First, we examined the pattern of globin gene expression in cells derived from transgenic mice containing a 248-kb –117 Greek HPFH β-YAC. In humans, a point mutation (G to A transversion) at position –117 relative to the mRNA start site of the Aγ-globin gene causes the Greek form of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (2Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P.W. Perlmutter R.M. Varmus H. Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2001: 135-182Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that –117 Aγm Greek HPFH β-YAC transgenic mice maintained human γ-globin expression into adult life (16Peterson K.R. Li Q. Clegg C.H. Furukawa T. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, three independent cell populations derived from the marrows of these mice expressed significant levels of γ-globin in addition to β-globin (Fig. 1A). The presence of human γ-globin chains in these cells was confirmed by fluorescent anti-γ-globin antibody staining (Fig. 1B). Although γ-globin chains were detected, no hemoglobin was formed in these multipotential cells as assessed by benzidine staining. As a second test of whether the pattern of β-like globin gene expression in β-YAC mice was reflected in the derived cells, we generated cell populations from the fetal livers of post-gestation day 12 wild-type β-YAC mice, which express significant levels of γ-globin. In three independently derived cell populations, human β-globin mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, whereas γ-globin mRNA was not expressed (data not shown). These results were consistent with either a switch from γ- to β-globin gene expression prior to or during establishment of cell culture, or alternatively, that fetal liver cells capable of extensive growth in the presence of F36Vmpl signaling are committed to the generation of erythroid progeny that express solely β-globin. Reactivating γ-globin gene expression may be beneficial for patients with sickle cell anemia. BMCs derived from β-YAC mice may be useful for screening putative γ-globin inducers. Since 5-azacytidine (5-aza), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, is a strong inducer of γ-globin gene expression (27DeSimone J. Heller P. Hall L. Zwiers D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4428-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 28Ley T.J. DeSimone J. Anagnou N.P. Keller G.H. Humphries R.K. Turner P.H. Young N.S. Keller P. Nienhuis A.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 307: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), we tested whether 5-aza could activate γ-globin transcription in wild-type β-YAC BMCs. As shown in Fig. 2A, 5-aza induced significant levels of γ-globin transcription, thereby establishing that γ-globin gene expression can be induced in these cells. However, γ-globin expression was not induced by a number of other compounds, including α-aminobutyric acid, sodium butyrate, valproic acid, or trichostatin A (data not shown). Next we tested an artificial transcription factor for its ability to induce γ-globin gene expression in wild-type β-YAC BMCs. We employed a synthetic construct, gg1-VP64, in which a zinc finger DNA binding domain, designed to target the region proximal to the –117 position of the γ-globin promoter, was linked to the VP64 transcriptional activator domain (19Graslund T. Li X. Magnenat L. Popkov M. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3707-3714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This transcription factor has been shown to interact directly with the γ-globin promoter and to up-regulate γ-globin gene expression in K562 cells (19Graslund T. Li X. Magnenat L. Popkov M. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3707-3714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A pool and five independent clones of β-YAC cells stably expressing gg1-VP64 displayed detectable levels of γ-globin mRNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). The weak induction of γ-globin observed may be due to the relatively low expression of gg1-VP64 from the CMV promoter, which is inefficient in these cells. Finally, the ability of previously identified fetal globin transcription factors to activate γ-globin gene expression was assessed. Full-length cDNAs for each factor were placed under control of a human β-globin locus LCR/β-globin gene promoter cassette in a construct previously shown to confer erythroid-specific gene expression upon linked cDNAs (20Papayannopoulou T. Priestley G.V. Rohde A. Peterson K.R. Nakamoto B. Blood. 2000; 95: 1274-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Peterson K.R. Fedosyuk H. Zelenchuk L. Nakamoto B. Yannaki E. Stamatoyannopoulus G. Ciciotte S. Peters L.L. Scott L.M. Papayannopoulou T. Genesis. 2004; 39: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). FGIF, FKLF, and gg1-VP64 under control of LCR β-globin promoter sequences reactivated γ-globin gene transcription in the wild-type CID-dependent β-YAC BMCs (Fig. 3A), whereas NF-E4 did not. Expression of all the transactivator cDNAs was detected at the RNA level in the BMCs, except for FKLF, which was not tested (Fig. 3B). The inability of NF-E4 to induce γ-globin gene expression in these cells was consistent with previous data demonstrating that it does not reactivate fetal globin synthesis in adult transgenic mice (29Zhou W. Zhao Q. Sutton R. Cumming H. Wang X. Cerruti L. Hall M. Wu R. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26227-26232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CID-dependent β-YAC cells may be useful primarily for identifying transcription factors that reactivate γ-globin gene expression, and to a lesser extent, for screening some chemical inducers of γ-globin expression for the treatment of sickle cell disease or β-thalassemia. γ-Globin transcription went from a completely repressed state to detectable mRNA levels in all instances in which expression was observed. This qualitative γ-globin “off-on” switch is unique to these cells; in other established cell lines, only a change in constitutive expression may be measured. Although γ-globin was activated by 5-azacytidine (which affects methylation) or by an HPFH mutation, treatments that affect acetylation (butyric acid, etc.) did not induce γ-globin synthesis, suggesting that these cells do not completely mirror the erythroid phenotype. Alternately, regulation of human γ-globin in mice may be fundamentally different than it is in humans, and these cell populations reveal that difference. However, gg1-VP64, FKLF, and FGIF activation, coupled with the HPFH results, clearly demonstrated that these cells offer an ideal system to clone and characterize transcriptional activators that act directly upon the γ-globin gene promoters.

We demonstrate that a lysine residue (Lys197) located on the intracellular loop between the S4 and S5 domains is necessary for the correct trafficking of hIK1 to the plasma membrane. Mutation of this residue to either alanine or methionine precluded trafficking of the channel to the membrane, whereas the charge-conserving arginine mutation had no effect on channel localization or function. Immunofluorescence localization demonstrated that the K197A mutation resulted in a channel that was primarily retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and this could not be rescued by incubation at 27 °C. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed that the K197A mutation was overexpressed compared with wild-type hIK1 and that this was due to a greatly diminished rate of channel degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the K197A mutation did not preclude multimer formation. Indeed, the K197A mutation dramatically suppressed expression of wild-type hIK1 at the cell surface. Finally, mutation of this conserved lysine in rat SK3 similarly resulted in a channel that failed to correctly traffic to the plasma membrane.

In this study, we have begun to investigate the role that the S4-S5 linker region plays in the function and trafficking of IK and SK channels. Cytoplasmic protein domains have been shown to play a role in ion channel regulation through interactions with the nearby pore region. For example, the S4-S5 region in the Shaker K+ channel is believed to be involved in the “ball-and-chain”-dependent inactivation (25Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen.

In addition, the arginine and lysine residues located juxtaposed to the pore are involved in channel gating by intracellular pH (32Schulte U. Weidemann S. Ludwig J. Ruppersberg J. Fakler B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 49-58Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We originally demonstrated that endogenously expressed hIK1 is inhibited by acidic cytoplasmic pH (6Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1271-C1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this was later confirmed in heterologously expressed hIK1 (34Pedersen K.A. Jorgensen N.K. Jensen B.S. Olesen S.P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 153-156PubMed Google Scholar). As hIK1 expresses a lysine just prior to the S5 domain at a position nearly equivalent to that of the lysine expressed just proximal to the M1 domain in the Kir channels known to be involved in pH-dependent gating, we speculated that this region was a strong candidate as a regulatory domain. The growing importance of this region in all aspects of ion channel function and traffic prompted our investigation of this region in hIK1. Here, we demonstrate that Lys197 is critical for proper trafficking of the hIK1 channel. This trafficking mutation was able to assemble into a multimeric structure and acted as a dominant-negative when paired with the wild-type channel, precluding the movement of wild-type channels to the surface. The K197A mutation was also resistant to protein degradation, thereby accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum. The homologous amino acid substitution in rat (r) SK3 (K453A) similarly resulted in loss of rSK3 channel expression at the cell surface. These results are the first to demonstrate an integral role for the S4-S5 linker in the trafficking of the IK/SK channels to the plasma membrane. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were generated for all constructs by subjecting cells to antibiotic selection (1 mg/ml G418) 48 h post-transfection. Selection was typically complete within 14 days post-transfection. Following selection, the concentration of G418 was reduced to 0.2 mg/ml. Note that clonal cell lines were not subsequently selected from this stable population of cells to avoid clonal variation. Molecular Biology—pBF plasmids containing the cDNAs for hIK1 and rSK3 were provided by Dr. J. P. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University). The channel was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted into the second extracellular loop between Gly132 and Ala133 as described previously (24Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The R189A/R191A, F190A, H192A, W193A, F194A, V195A, K197A, K197R, K197M, L198A, Y199A, and M200A mutations in the HA-hIK1 channel as well as the K453A and K453R mutations in rSK3 were produced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The hIK1 channel was also tagged with a C-terminal Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) by PCR amplification of hIK1 in pcDNA3.1(+) and then subcloned in-frame into pcDNA4/myc (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The fidelity of all constructs utilized in this study was confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer, University of Pittsburgh) and subsequent sequence alignment (NCBI BLAST) with hIK1 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF022150 (hIK1) and U69884 (rSK3)). Antibodies—Antibody HA.11 for use in immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting was obtained from Covance Inc. (Richmond, CA). Anti-c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Anti-rSK3 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Antibody against giantin was a gift from Dr. Ora Weisz (University of Pittsburgh), and the anti-calnexin primary antibody was acquired from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Secondary antibodies were obtained from the indicated sources: biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), Cy3.18-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce). Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence labeling, HEK293 stable cell lines were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips for 24 h prior to labeling. For detection of cell-surface HA-hIK1, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; 3 × 5 min), followed by goat serum (10% for 20 min). HA-hIK1 was then labeled sequentially by incubation in anti-HA monoclonal primary antibody (1:1000 dilution, 90 min), biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution, 90 min), and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:500 dilution, 90 min). Each labeling step was followed by three to five washes with 1% BSA (5 min each) to remove unbound antibody. All steps were performed at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis of the channel. Following cell-surface labeling, the cells were again washed with ice-cold PBS; fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS; permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS; and blocked with 1% BSA and 10% goat serum as described above. Intracellularly localized HA-hIK1 was then labeled sequentially with anti-HA monoclonal primary antibody (1:1000 dilution, 90 min) and Cy3.18-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution, 90 min). This approach allowed us to detect both cell-surface and intracellular HA-hIK1 in the same cells. Cells were then subjected to laser confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS NT3 laser 4 photomultiplier tube system. To ensure maximal x-y spatial resolution, sections were scanned at 1024 × 1024 pixels using sequential two-color image collection to minimize cross-talk between the channels imaged. Alternatively, the cells were subjected to standard epifluorescence using a Nikon Microphot-FXL microscope, with images captured using an Olympus 0701121-01A digital camera coupled to MagnaFire 2.0 software (Optronic, Goleta, CA). All images shown in a single figure were acquired on the same day using identical settings. The images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop and combined into a single figure, and RGB brightness/contrast was adjusted identically for all panels. Electrophysiology—All electrophysiological recordings were carried out as described previously (21Hamilton K.L. Syme C.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16690-16697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Jones H.M. Hamilton K.L. Papworth G.D. Syme C.A. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol.

During whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, the bath contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.12 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.2 mm EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH; free [Ca2+] of 200 nm). All experiments were preformed at room temperature (22 °C) using HEK293 cells plated the pervious day. Electrodes were fabricated from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL), were pulled on a vertical puller (Narishige International USA, Inc., Long Island, NY), and had a resistance of 1-4 megaohms. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) interfaced to a computer using a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Axon Instruments). Following establishment of the whole-cell configuration, voltage steps were applied using pCLAMP 8.2 software (Axon Instruments) from a holding potential of -60 mV at 250-ms pulses every 2 s from -100 to +80 mV in 20-mV increments to generate a current-voltage relationship. Current was sampled at steady state (100 ms) to evaluate current density. Current density (pA/picofarad (pF)) at 0 mV was calculated by dividing the current by the whole-cell capacitance. Immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation of HA- and Myc-tagged hIK1 constructs, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in 60-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 and 5 μg of each plasmid (total of 10 μg of DNA and 20 μl of lipid) as described previously (22Jones H.M. Hamilton K.L. Papworth G.D. Syme C.A. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15531-15540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Syme C.A.

When only a single construct was transfected (HA or Myc), the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector was included (5 μg) to maintain the plasmid and lipid at the same final concentrations in all dishes. 18-24 h post-transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were determined and normalized to achieve equivalent loading. Crude lysates were then precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated with anti-HA polyclonal antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads, followed by sequential washes with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 500, 300, and 150 mm NaCl (twice each) and supplemented with 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS). After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis as described below. Cell-surface immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (22Jones H.M. Hamilton K.L. Papworth G.D. Syme C.A. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15531-15540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in a 100-mm dish and then washed with ice-cold PBS, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and labeled with anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) for 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was removed by extensive washing with 1% BSA, followed by three washes with PBS. As described above, all steps were performed at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis of the channel and/or antibody. The cells were then lysed; protein concentrations were normalized; and the immune complexes were directly subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblotting was performed using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) as described below. In addition to the immunoprecipitation, 20 μg of protein was set aside following cell lysis for immunoblotting. In this way, we were able to confirm similar levels of protein expression in cells failing to correctly traffic HA-hIK1 to the cell surface. Immunoblot Analysis—HEK293 cells were grown to confluence, lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using Tris-buffered saline blocking solution containing 5% (w/v) milk powder, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.005% (v/v) antifoam A. Subsequently, blots were incubated with primary antibody (mouse anti-HA monoclonal (1:1000 dilution), anti-rSK3 polyclonal (1:2000 dilution), or mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal (1:2000 dilution)) in Tris-buffered saline blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000 dilution)). The blot was then extensively washed, and detection was performed using West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For the protein degradation time course, 400 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to cells plated in 35-mm culture dishes. Cells were then lysed and collected at the various time points, and the immunoblot protocol described above was followed. Proteinase K Digestion—Proteinase K digestion was performed as described previously (24Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells stably transfected with wild-type, K453A, or K453R rSK3 were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Each 60-mm dish was incubated with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) with or without 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteinase K digestion was quenched by adding ice-cold PBS containing 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mm EDTA. This treatment was followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS. Cleared lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Chemiluminescence Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the Myc- and/or HA-tagged wild-type or K197A hIK1 channel 24 h prior to the experiment. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and blocked three times with 1% BSA in PBS. The cells were then incubated with polyclonal antibody HA.11 (1:100 dilution) for 90 min at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS containing 1% BSA. The dishes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were subsequently washed 10 times with PBS containing 1% BSA and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The horseradish peroxidase-labeled proteins were detected using 5 ml of West Pico chemiluminescent substrate for 5 min. The absorbance from each dish was measure using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and data are presented as a percent of the wild-type absorbance. Chemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. 5,6-Dichloro-1-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (DCEBIO) was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. R. J. Bridges (University of Pittsburgh) as described previously (36Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 600-611PubMed Google Scholar). Both DCEBIO and clotrimazole were made as 10,000-fold stock solutions in Me2SO. Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant and is reported. The immunofluorescence and other biochemical assays were repeated at least three times to ensure the fidelity of our results.

In our initial studies, we performed an alanine scan of Arg189-Met200, comprising the distal portion of the proposed S4-S5 linker. For these experiments, single- or double-point mutations were made within the HA epitope-tagged hIK1 channel plasmid.

Previously it has been shown that the WabH enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to outer core LPS. The presence of GlcNAc instead of GlcN and the lack of UDP-GlcN in bacteria indicate that an additional enzymatic step is required. In this work we identified a new gene (wabN) in the K. pneumoniae core LPS biosynthetic cluster. Chemical and structural analysis of K. pneumoniae non-polar wabN mutants showed truncated core LPS with GlcNAc instead of GlcN. In vitro assays using LPS truncated at the level of d-galacturonic acid (GalA) and cell-free extract containing WabH and WabN together led to the incorporation of GlcN, whereas none of them alone were able to do it. This result suggests that the later enzyme (WabN) catalyzes the deacetylation of the core LPS containing the GlcNAc residue. Thus, the incorporation of the GlcN residue to core LPS in K. pneumoniae requires two distinct enzymatic steps. WabN homologues are found in Serratia marcescens and some Proteus strains that show the same disaccharide αGlcN-(1,4)-αGalA attached by an α1,3 linkage to ld-HeppII.

The core domain is usually divided into inner and outer core on the basis of sugar composition.The K. pneumoniae core LPS structure has been determined for several O-serotypes. Although the inner core is highly conserved within the Enterobacteriaceae the K. pneumoniae inner core differs from those of Escherichia coli and Salmonella by the lack of l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose I and II (ld-HeppI and -II) phosphoryl modifications and by the presence of a d-glucose (Glc) residue linked by a β1,4 bond to ld-HeppI (5Vinogradov E.

Type 1 core contains a 3-deoxyd-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residue linked by an α2,6 bond to the GlcN residue (5Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Carbohydr.

Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Piqué N. Corsaro M. Naldi T. De Castro C. Waidelich D. Merino S. Tomás J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).The genes involved in the K. pneumoniae core LPS biosynthesis are clustered in a region (wa) of the K. pneumoniae chromosome, and two different clusters have been identified to be responsible for type 1 and type 2 core biosynthesis (7Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Piqué N. Corsaro M. Naldi T. De Castro C. Waidelich D. Merino S. Tomás J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Regué M.

Furthermore the functions in both inner and outer core biosynthesis of most of the transferases encoded by the wa gene products have been elucidated (7Regué M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Piqué N.

Nevertheless the mechanism leading to the incorporation of the outer core GlcN residue remains unknown. In searching for a candidate glucosaminyltransferase the wabH gene product was characterized (12Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The WabH protein catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc into outer core LPS. This transferase activity is dependent on the presence of the outer core d-galacturonic acid (GalA) residue in the acceptor core LPS (12Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). But because GlcN instead of GlcNAc is found in the K. pneumoniae outer core either an unknown glucosaminyltransferase remains to be identified or a mechanism to deacetylate the WabH-transferred GlcNAc residue should be involved. In this work we report the identification and characterization of such a core LPS-GlcNAc deacetylase activity in K. pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens sharing the outer core disaccharide αGlcN-(1,4)-αGalA.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in TABLE ONE.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, E. coli DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment), and alkaline phosphatase were used as recommended by the suppliers.Mutant Construction—K. pneumoniae 52145 and C3 individual genes were mutated by creating in vitro in-frame deletions of each gene (15Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Each mutated gene was transferred to the chromosome by homologous recombination using the temperature-sensitive suicide plasmid pKO3 containing the counterselectable marker sacB (15Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Mutations were made in wabH and wabN. The plasmids containing the engineered in-frame deletions (pKO3ΔwabHC3, pKO3ΔwabH52145, pKO3ΔwaNHC3, and pKO3ΔwabN52145) were transformed into K. pneumoniae 52145, C3, 52145ΔwaaL, and C3ΔwaaL by electroporation. Mutants were selected based on growth in LB agar containing 10% sucrose and loss of the chloramphenicol resistance marker of vector pKO3. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the whole constructs in amplified PCR products.The 52145ΔwabN mutant was constructed by asymmetric PCR amplifications using 52145 chromosomal DNA and primers NA52145 (5′-GAAGATCTCACGCCAGCATTTAAAGAAC-3′), NB52145 (5′-CCCATCCACTAAACTTAAACAAACGTCCTCAGGCCATAC-3′), NC52145 (5′-TGTTTAAGTTTAGTGGATGGGTACCAGCGGAAATGCTAAC-3′), and ND52145 (5′-GAAGATCTTCACTATTTTGCCCAGCAC-3′). The primers include BglII sites (underlined). DNA fragments of 743 (NA52145-NB52145) and 628 (NC52145-ND52145) bp were obtained, respectively. DNA fragment NA52145-NB52145 contains from nucleotide 7457, corresponding to the third base of the 9th codon of wabN, to nucleotide 8199 inside waaQ. DNA fragment NC52145-ND52145 contains from nucleotide 5887, inside waaM, to nucleotide 6514 including the last wabN five codons. DNA fragments NA52145-NB52145 and NC52145-ND52145 were annealed at their overlapping region (double underlined letters in primers NB52145 and NC52145) and amplified by PCR as a single fragment using primers NA52145 and ND52145. The fusion product was purified, BglII-digested, ligated into BamHI-digested and phosphatase-treated pKO3 vector, electroporated into E. coli DH5α, and plated on chloramphenicol LB agar plates at 30 °C to obtain plasmid pKO3ΔwabN52145.The C3ΔwabN mutant was constructed by asymmetric PCR amplifications using C3 chromosomal DNA and primers NAC3 (5′-GAAGATCTCGCGCCAGCATTTAAAGAAC-3′), NB52145 (5′-CCCATCCACTAAACTTAAACAAACGTCCTCAGGCCATAC-3′), NCC3 (5′-TGTTTAAGTTTAGTGGATGGGTACCAGCGGAAAATTACAC-3′), and NDC3 (5′-GAAGATCTCCACTTTCTCCCGCTCAT-3′). The primers include BglII sites (underlined). DNA fragments of 745 (NAC3-NB52145) and 623 (NCC3-NDC3) bp were obtained, respectively. DNA fragment NAC3-NBC3 contains from nucleotide 7432, corresponding to the third base of the fourth codon of wabN, to nucleotide 8176 inside waaQ. DNA fragment NCC3-NDC3 contains from nucleotide 5870, inside waaJ, to nucleotide 6492 including the last wabN eight codons. DNA fragments NAC3-NB52145 and NCC3-NDC3 were annealed at their overlapping region (double underlined letters in primers NBC3 and NCC3) and amplified by PCR as a single fragment using primers NAC3 and NDC3. The fusion product was purified, BglII-digested, ligated into BamHI-digested and phosphatase-treated pKO3 vector, electroporated into E. coli DH5α, and plated on chloramphenicol LB agar plates at 30 °C to obtain plasmid pKO3ΔwabNC3.The 52145ΔwabH mutant was constructed using 52145 chromosomal DNA and primers HA52145 (5′-CGCGGATCCAGCGCGAGATTATCGAAG-3′), HB52145 (5′-CCCATCCACTAAACTTAAACAGGGTAAACCGTCAATCAC-3′), HC52145 (5′-TGTTTAAGTTAGTGGATGGGTGTCAGCAGTACCGTCAG-3′), and HD52145 (5′-CGCGGATCCTATGCGACACCGACTCAG-3′). The primers include BamHI sites (underlined). DNA fragments of 688 (HA52145-HB52145) and 715 (HC52145-HD52145) bp were obtained, respectively. DNA fragment HA52145-HB52145 contains from nucleotide 9107, inside wabG to the third base of the 10th codon of wabH, to nucleotide 9794. DNA fragment HC52145-HD52145 contains from nucleotide 11558, inside orf10, to nucleotide 10844 including the last wabH 10 codons. DNA fragments HA52145-HB52145 and HC52145-HD52145 were annealed at their overlapping region (double underlined letters in primers HB52145 and HC52145) and amplified by PCR as a single fragment using primers HA52145 and HD52145. The fusion product was purified, BamHI-digested, ligated into BamHI-digested and phosphatase-treated pKO3 vector, electroporated into E. coli DH5α, and plated on chloramphenicol LB agar plates at 30 °C to obtain plasmid pKO3ΔwabH52145. Because of the extensive identity among wabG, wabH, and orf10 between strains 52145 and C3, the above four primers and 52145 chromosomal DNA were used to construct pKO3ΔwabHC3.Plasmid Constructions for Gene Overexpression and Mutant Complementation Studies—For gene overexpression studies the wabN genes from K. pneumoniae strains 52145 and C3 and S. marcescens N28b were PCR-amplified by using specific primers pairs and transferred into plasmid pABD18-Cm. Each gene was expressed from the arabinose-inducible and glucose-repressible pABD18-Cm promoter (16Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Becwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3906) Google Scholar). Repression from the araC promoter was achieved by growth in medium containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose, and induction was obtained by adding l-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.02% (w/v). Briefly a culture was grown for 18 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and 0.4% glucose. These cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh medium (without glucose) and grown until they reached an A600 nm of about 0.2. l-A-rabinose was then added, and the cultures were grown for another 2 h. Repressed controls were maintained in glucose-containing medium.The wabH gene was PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae C3 chromosomal DNA with primers KPwaa43 (5′-CCTGCACCAGCTAGCGACTCTCA-3′) and KPwaa37 (5′-GAGGGCAGGGGTACCAGTGGGAA-3′) as a 1,613-bp fragment. The PCR product was digested with NheI and KpnI (sites underlined) and ligated to the same sites in pBAD18-Cm to make plasmid pBAD18-Cm-wabHC3 as reported previously (12Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The strain 52145 wabH homologue was PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae 51245 chromosomal DNA with primers KPwaa43 (5′-CCTGCACCAGCTAGCGACTCTCA-3′) (12Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and NRev (5′-GAGGGCAGAGGATCCAGTGGGAA-3′) as a 1,613-bp fragment. The PCR product was digested with NheI and BamHI (sites underlined) and ligated to the same sites in pBAD18-Cm to make plasmid pBAD18-Cm-wabH52145.For pBAD-18-wabN52145 construction a 2,313-bp DNA fragment containing the wabN gene was PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae 52145 chromosomal DNA with primers NA52145 and ND52145. This fragment was used as template to amplify an internal 1,649 bp with primers NFw52145 (5′-TTCGATTCTAGAGGGATCAG-3′) and ND52145. This fragment was digested with XbaI and HindIII to obtain a 1,204-bp fragment that was ligated to the same sites in pBAD18-Cm.Plasmid pBAD18-Cm-wabNC3 was constructed by PCR amplification of a 2,308-bp DNA fragment from strain C3 chromosomal DNA using primers and NAC3 and NDC3. This fragment was used as template to amplify an internal 1,644 bp with primers FN52145 and NDC3. This fragment was digested with BglII, blunt-ended, and then digested with XbaI to obtain a 1,638-bp fragment. This fragment was ligated to pBAD18-Cm, HindIII-digested, blunt-ended, and XbaI-digested.Plasmid pBAD18-Cm-wabNSm was constructed by PCR amplification of a 1,076-bp DNA fragment from plasmid pCosFGR16 (17Coderch N. Piqué N. Lindner B. Abitiu N. Merino S. Izquierdo L. Jimenez N. Tomás J.M. Holst O. Regué M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using primers NFwSm (5′-CAACTTAAGCTTCCATTTCTTC-3′) and NRevSm (5′-CAAACCAGGCTAGCAAAGTC-3′). This fragment was digested with NheI and HindIII and ligated into the same sites in pBAD18-Cm. For complementation studies each amplified wabN homologue was ligated to pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and transformed into E. coli DH5α.LPS Isolation and Electrophoresis—LPS was extracted from dry cells of K. pneumoniae grown in LB. The phenol/chloroform/light petroleum ether method (18Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) was used for strains producing rough LPS, whereas the phenol/water procedure (19Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) was used for the strains producing the O-antigen domain (smooth LPS). For screening purposes LPS was obtained after proteinase K digestion of whole cells (20Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS samples were separated by SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining as described previously (21Pradel E. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6428-6431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar).Preparation of Oligosaccharides—The LPS (20 mg) was hydrolyzed in 1% acetic acid (100 °C for 120 min), and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 30 min) and lyophilized to give lipid A (10 mg, 50% of LPS). The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in water, and lyophilized (6 mg, 30% of LPS).Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis—Partially methylated alditol acetates and methyl glycoside acetates were analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 5973N MS instrument equipped with a 6850A gas chromatograph and an RTX-5 capillary column (Restek, 30 m × 0.25-mm inner diameter; flow rate, 1 ml/min; carrier gas, helium). Acetylated methyl glycoside analysis was performed with the following temperature program: 150 °C for 5 min, 150 °C → 250 °C at 3 °C/min, 250 °C for 10 min. For partially methylated alditol acetates the temperature program was: 90 °C for 1 min, 90 °C → 140 °C at 25 °C/min, 140 °C → 200 °C at 5 °C/min, 200 °C → 280 °C at 10 °C/min, 280 °C for 10 min.Glycosyl and Lipid Analysis—LPS (1 mg) was dried over P2O5 overnight and treated with 1 m HCl/CH3OH (1 ml) at 80°C for 20 h to analyze both glycosyl and fatty acid composition. The crude reaction was extracted twice with hexane; the two extracts were pooled, dried under a stream of air, and treated with acetic anhydride (100 μl) at 100 °C for 15 min. The methanol layer was neutralized with Ag2CO3, dried, and acetylated. Both samples were injected into the gas chromatography-MS system, and acetylated fatty acid methyl esters were recovered in the hexane phase, whereas the methylglycoside derivatives were in the methanolic phase.NMR Spectroscopy—1H NMR spectra were recorded on a solution (0.5 ml) of K. pneumoniae 52145ΔwaaL (8 mg) and 52145ΔwaaL wabN (2 mg) core oligosaccharides, respectively, in D2O at 400 MHz with a Bruker DRX 400 Avance spectrometer equipped with a reverse probe in the Fourier transform mode at 303 K.Mass Spectrometry Studies—Positive and negative ions reflectron time-of-flight mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) were acquired on a Voyager DE-PRO instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 25 kV, grid voltage was 17 kV, mirror voltage ratio was 1.12, and delay time was 150 ns. Samples were irradiated at a frequency of 5 Hz by 337 nm photons from a pulsed nitrogen laser. Postsource decay was performed using an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The reflectron voltage was decreased in 10 successive 25% steps. Mass calibration was obtained with a maltooligosaccharide mixture from corn syrup (Sigma). A solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenoic acid in 20% CH3CN in water at a concentration of 25 mg/ml was used as the MALDI matrix. One microliter of matrix solution was deposited on the target followed by loading of 1 μl of the sample. The droplets were allowed to dry at room temperature. Spectra were calibrated and processed under computer control using the Applied Biosystems Data Explorer software.Methylation Analysis—A core oligosaccharide sample (1 mg) obtained from 1% AcOH hydrolysis was first reduced with NaBH4 and then methylated (23Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3171) Google Scholar). Linkage analysis was performed as follows. The methylated sample was carboxymethyl-reduced with lithium triethylborohydride (Super-Hydride, Aldrich), hydrolyzed by mild acid to cleave ketosidic linkage, reduced by means of NaBD4, then totally hydrolyzed, reduced with NaBD4, and finally acetylated as described previously (24Forsberg L.S. Ramadas Bhat U. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Preparation of Cell-free Extracts Containing Core LPS Biosynthetic Enzymes—The K. pneumoniae strains 521453ΔwabH (pBAD18-Cm-wabH52145) and 52145ΔwabN (pBAB18Cm-wabN52145) were used to overexpress the WabH and WabN proteins, respectively. Cultures of these strains and controls (52145ΔwabH and 52145ΔwabN harboring pBAD18-Cm) were grown and arabinose-induced as described above. The cells were harvested, washed once with 50 mm Tris-HEPES (pH 7.5), and then frozen until needed. To prepare lysates cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and sonicated on ice (for a total of 2 min using 10-s bursts followed by 10-s cooling periods). Unbroken cells, cell debris, and the membrane fraction were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Protein expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and protein contents of cell-free extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay as directed by the manufacturer.GlcNAc-Core LPS Deacetylase Activity of WabN—The ability of WabN to catalyze the deacetylation of GlcNAc-containing LPS was assayed by using LPS from mutant 52145ΔwabH in a reaction containing both 52145ΔwabH (pBAD18-Cm-wabH52145) and 52145ΔwabN (pBAD18-Cm-wabN52145) cell-free extracts. The assay system was based on the GlcNAc transferase assay described for WabH (12Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Assay reactions using UDP-GlcNAc as the substrate were carried out in 0.02 ml at a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 0.003 mg of 52145ΔwabH mutant LPS as the acceptor. The reaction was started by addition of 0.04 mg each of the cell-free extracts from 52145ΔwabH (pBAD18Cm-wabH52145) and 52145ΔwabN (pBAD18-Cm-wabN52145). As controls reactions containing cell-free extracts (0.04 mg) of 52145ΔwabH (pBAD18-Cm-wabH52145), 52145ΔwabH (pBAD18-Cm) and/or 52145ΔwabN (pBAD18-Cm-wabN52145) were used. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the reactions were stopped by adding 0.08 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Proteinase K diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer was then added to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml and incubated for 18 h at 55 °C. The reaction products were visualized by SDS-PAGE. When UDP-[14C]GlcNAc was used as the substrate, assay reactions were carried out in a total of 0.1 ml at a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg of 52145ΔwabH mutant LPS, and 0.2 mg of the cell-free extracts. The reactions were started by addition of 0.25 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (specific activity of 10.2 mCi/mmol; ICN Biomedicals Inc.). Assays were performed at 37 °C for 2 h and were stopped by adding 2 volumes of 0.375 m MgCl2 in 95% ethanol and cooling at –20 °C for 2 h. The LPS was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 100 μl of water. The LPS was precipitated with 2 volumes of 0.375 m MgCl2 in 95% ethanol; this step was repeated three times to eliminate the unincorporated UDP-[14C]GlcNAc. The LPS was hydrolyzed by resuspension in 100 μlof0.1 m HCl and heating to 100 °C for 48 h. The labeled residues from the hydrolyzed LPS samples were separated by TLC (Kieselgel 60, Merck) with n-butanol, methanol, 25% ammonia solution, water (5:4:2:1, v/v/v/v). The labeled residues were detected by autoradiography using as standards [14C]GlcNAc and [14C]GlcN.RESULTSIdentification of a New Core LPS Gene—In"
https://openalex.org/W1614042661,"Thermonuclear fusion is a highly efficient energy source for the stars; however, attempts to harness the process of fusion for energy production on Earth have been stymied by many difficult challenges. One of the most frustrating is the significant leakage of energy from magnetically confined plasmas, which is due to so-called anomalous transport. In their Perspective, [Krushelnick and Cowley][1] discuss recent work to understand the basis of this anomalous transport and find ways to control it. An approach that has created excitement in the fusion community involves the creation of transport barriers, that is, regions of plasma with just the right conditions to reduce turbulence that leads to energy leakage. Recently a combination of experimental and computational advances has led to increased understanding of these transport barriers in fusion plasmas, potentially bringing the use of controlled fusion as an energy source much closer.

 comments that to fully profit from the information encoded in the chimpanzee genome, we will need an equally rich depiction of chimpanzee behavior, thought, and neural function. Given the explosion of recent findings from the behavioral and cognitive sciences, a synthesis is on the horizon. Only our own casual use of the environment, which threatens the future of chimpanzees, can stand in the way of witnessing this synthesis."
