https://openalex.org/W2125121177,"Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) extends the lifespan of diverse species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In these organisms, lifespan extension is dependent on Sir2, a conserved deacetylase proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. Here we show that resveratrol shifts the physiology of middle-aged mice on a high-calorie diet towards that of mice on a standard diet and significantly increases their survival. Resveratrol produces changes associated with longer lifespan, including increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) levels, increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) activity, increased mitochondrial number, and improved motor function. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment revealed that resveratrol opposed the effects of the high-calorie diet in 144 out of 153 significantly altered pathways. These data show that improving general health in mammals using small molecules is an attainable goal, and point to new approaches for treating obesity-related disorders and diseases of ageing. You can have your cake and eat it. Fat, healthy and tipsy. Fountain of youth. These headlines and more greeted online publication of the Article 'Resveratrol improves health and survival of mice on a high-calorie diet'. What the paper does show is that consumption of resveratrol at doses achievable in humans (but not from red wine — the hundreds of bottles a day needed would have side effects) can reproduce many of the physiological effects of a low-calorie diet in mice, improving health and survival.

https://openalex.org/W1996760543,"Identifying the non-coding DNA sequences that act at a distance to regulate patterns of gene expression is not a simple matter; one useful pointer is evolutionary sequence conservation. An in vivo analysis of 167 non-coding elements in the human genome that are extremely conserved based on comparisons with pufferfish, rat and mouse genomes, has identified 75 previously unknown tissue-specific enhancers. These are active in embryos on day 11, most of them directing expression in the developing nervous system. The success of this method suggests that the further 5,500 non-coding sequences conserved between humans and pufferfish may yield another new batch of gene enhancers. Identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. One major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. In this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human–pufferfish, Takifugu (Fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved1 in human–mouse–rat. We tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. Here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. While directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. We identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all ∼3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and Fugu. The testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. These data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1983811433,"The duplication of entire genomes has long been recognized as having great potential for evolutionary novelties, but the mechanisms underlying their resolution through gene loss are poorly understood. Here we show that in the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia, a ciliate, most of the nearly 40,000 genes arose through at least three successive whole-genome duplications. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the most recent duplication coincides with an explosion of speciation events that gave rise to the P. aurelia complex of 15 sibling species. We observed that gene loss occurs over a long timescale, not as an initial massive event. Genes from the same metabolic pathway or protein complex have common patterns of gene loss, and highly expressed genes are over-retained after all duplications. The conclusion of this analysis is that many genes are maintained after whole-genome duplication not because of functional innovation but because of gene dosage constraints. Whole-genome duplications are a powerful evolutionary force, and much interest is focused on what happens to genes duplicated in these events. The genome of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia has now been sequenced, and its nearly 40,000 genes (it's a very 'gene rich' genome) show evidence of at least three whole-genome duplications. As the gene order is particularly well conserved in Paramecium, it is possible to identify genes that duplicated at each event, providing a complete picture of gene loss at different time points after duplications. A study of the duplicated genes in Paramecium tetraurelia suggests that after whole-genome duplication events, many duplicated genes are not able to immediately functionally diverge, because dosage constraints act on them. These dosage constraints also prevent loss of many duplicated genes after whole genome duplications."

https://openalex.org/W2078611261,"Many types of bacteria produce extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs). Some are secreted polymers and show only limited association with the cell surface, whereas others are firmly attached to the cell surface and form a discrete structural layer, the capsule, which envelopes the cell and allows the bacteria to evade or counteract the host immune system. EPSs have critical roles in bacterial colonization of surfaces, such as epithelia and medical implants; in addition some EPSs have important industrial and biomedical applications in their own right. Here we describe the 2.26 A resolution structure of the 340 kDa octamer of Wza, an integral outer membrane lipoprotein, which is essential for group 1 capsule export in Escherichia coli. The transmembrane region is a novel alpha-helical barrel. The bulk of the Wza structure is located in the periplasm and comprises three novel domains forming a large central cavity. Wza is open to the extracellular environment but closed to the periplasm. We propose a route and mechanism for translocation of the capsular polysaccharide. This work may provide insight into the export of other large polar molecules such as DNA and proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2009080781,"Oxidative stress may be an important determinant of the severity of acute pancreatitis. One-electron reduction of oxidants generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) via redox cycling, whereas two-electron detoxification, e.g. by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, does not. The actions of menadione on ROS production and cell fate were compared with those of a non-cycling analogue (2,4-dimethoxy-2-methylnaphthalene (DMN)) using real-time confocal microscopy of isolated perfused murine pancreatic acinar cells. Menadione generated ROS with a concomitant decrease of NAD(P)H, consistent with redox cycling. The elevation of ROS was prevented by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine but not by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium. DMN produced no change in reactive oxygen species per se but significantly potentiated menadione-induced effects, probably via enhancement of one-electron reduction, since DMN was found to inhibit NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase detoxification. Menadione caused apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells that was significantly potentiated by DMN, whereas DMN alone had no effect. Furthermore, bile acid (taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate)-induced caspase activation was also greatly increased by DMN, whereas DMN had no effect per se. These results suggest that acute generation of ROS by menadione occurs via redox cycling, the net effect of which is induction of apoptotic pancreatic acinar cell death. Two-electron detoxifying enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, which are elevated in pancreatitis, may provide protection against excessive ROS and exert an important role in determining acinar cell fate."

https://openalex.org/W2080821333,"Membrane and secretory proteins can be co-translationally inserted into or translocated across the membrane. This process is dependent on signal sequence recognition on the ribosome by the signal recognition particle (SRP), which results in targeting of the ribosome-nascent-chain complex to the protein-conducting channel at the membrane. Here we present an ensemble of structures at subnanometre resolution, revealing the signal sequence both at the ribosomal tunnel exit and in the bacterial and eukaryotic ribosome-SRP complexes. Molecular details of signal sequence interaction in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic complexes were obtained by fitting high-resolution molecular models. The signal sequence is presented at the ribosomal tunnel exit in an exposed position ready for accommodation in the hydrophobic groove of the rearranged SRP54 M domain. Upon ribosome binding, the SRP54 NG domain also undergoes a conformational rearrangement, priming it for the subsequent docking reaction with the NG domain of the SRP receptor. These findings provide the structural basis for improving our understanding of the early steps of co-translational protein sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2028583641,"PUF proteins control gene expression by binding to the 3′-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs and triggering mRNA decay or translational repression. Here we focus on the mechanism of PUF-mediated regulation. The yeast PUF protein, Mpt5p, regulates HO mRNA and stimulates removal of its poly(A) tail (i.e. deadenylation). Mpt5p repression in vivo is dependent on POP2, a component of the cytoplasmic Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex that deadenylates mRNAs. In this study, we elucidate the individual roles of the Ccr4p and Pop2p deadenylases in Mpt5p-regulated deadenylation. Both in vivo and in vitro, Pop2p and Ccr4p proteins are required for Mpt5p-regulated deadenylation of HO. However, the requirements for the two proteins differ dramatically: the enzymatic activity of Ccr4p is essential, whereas that of Pop2p is dispensable. We conclude that Pop2p is a bridge through which the PUF protein recruits the Ccr4p enzyme to the target mRNA, thereby stimulating deadenylation. Our data suggest that PUF proteins may enhance mRNA degradation and repress expression by both deadenylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms, using the same Pop2p bridge to recruit a multifunctional Pop2p complex to the mRNA.

Regulation of mRNA stability, translation, and localization ensure that a given mRNA produces the right amount of protein at the proper time and place.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Mpt5p is a member of one such family of regulatory proteins, the so-called PUF proteins (8Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). These proteins promote deadenylation, decay, and translational repression. Mpt5p binds to the 3′-UTR of multiple target mRNAs (9Olivas W. Parker R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 10Seay D. Hook B. Evans K. Wickens M.

In particular, Mpt5p binds a regulatory element in the 3′-UTR of HO mRNA and causes rapid deadenylation and decay of that mRNA (12Tadauchi T. Matsumoto K. Herskowitz I. Irie K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The HO endonuclease is tightly controlled at multiple levels to prevent inappropriate mating-type switching and aberrant double-stranded DNA breaks (14Haber J. Annu Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 561-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The Mpt5p repressor contributes to that regulation; in its absence, aberrant switching occurs at high frequency (12Tadauchi T. Matsumoto K. Herskowitz I. Irie K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, using a genetic assay, we showed that repression by Mpt5p requires the POP2 gene and that PUF proteins, including Mpt5p, bind directly to Pop2p (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Pop2p is a subunit of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase complex, the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex (15Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R.

Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), thus providing a direct link between PUF proteins and the deadenylation machinery. Two of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex subunits, Pop2p and Ccr4p, bear sequence similarity to nucleases, and both proteins have been reported to possess deadenylase activity in vitro (17Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L.

However, Ccr4p is thought to be the predominant deadenylase in yeast, at least under standard growth conditions (17Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The finding that Pop2p was critical for PUF-mediated regulation of HO mRNA suggested that it might act as a deadenylase on that mRNA (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar); it is controversial whether it contributes general deadenylase activity in vivo (15Tucker M.

The individual roles of the Pop2p and Ccr4p deadenylases in regulated mRNA decay are not understood. We sought to determine which deadenylase was responsible for PUF-stimulated deadenylation and to delineate the roles of Pop2p and Ccr4p. Our data suggest that Pop2p acts as a bridge through which the PUF protein recruits the Ccr4p enzyme to the mRNA. Additional data suggest that PUF proteins may repress expression by deadenylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms, using the same Pop2p bridge. Strains and Plasmids—The wild-type BY4742 yeast strain and isogenic strains with gene-specific deletions of POP2, CCR4, PAN2, CAF120, CAF130, NOT3, and NOT4 were obtained from Open Biosystems. These deletion strains were created by PCR-mediated gene modification using the kanamycin/G418 resistance marker. The MPT5-TAP strain (Open Biosystems) was created in the S288C strain background by integrating a C-terminal TAP tag onto the coding sequence of MPT5 using PCR-mediated gene modification with a HIS3 marker. POP2 and CCR4 expression plasmids were created in the high copy vector pACG1-NT and contained N-terminal His6 and T7 epitope tags that could be cleaved off using TEV protease. The ADH1 promoter and 3′-UTR were used for expression, and the plasmids carried the Zeocin resistance marker. The active site mutant POP2 contains two missense mutations, S188A/E190A, described by Thore et al. (20Thore S. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The active site mutant CCR4 contains missense mutation E556A described by Chen et al. (18Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both mutants were created by QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. High Resolution Northern Blotting—RNA was extracted from samples using the hot acidic phenol method. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 ul of TENS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS) and extracted with 500 μl of 1:1 phenol pH 4.6:chloroform by incubating at 70 °C for 5 min followed by vigorous vortexing for 2 min. RNA was then extracted a second time with chloroform, precipitated, and resuspended in sterile water. The decay of HO mRNA poly(A) tails was analyzed over the indicated time course following addition of the transcriptional inhibitor thiolutin (gift from Pfizer) at 20 μg/ml as previously described (24Duttagupta R. Vasudevan S. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2623-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After RNA isolation, 10 μg of each total RNA sample was cleaved with ribonuclease H (Promega) and an antisense HO oligonucleotide (5′-GGACAGCATCAAACTGTAAGATTCCGCCAC-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies). When indicated, oligo(dT)15 was added to the ribonuclease H reactions. The RNA was then analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide-urea-denaturing PAGE and transferred to nylon membranes using 1× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus. Blots were probed with an antisense HO 3′-UTR probe or an antisense SCR1 probe. The blots were imaged using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described by Goldstrohm et al. (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), using the MPT5-TAP strain with plasmids expressing the indicated T7 epitope-tagged POP2 or CCR4 proteins. PUF Repression Growth Assays—Mpt5p-mediated repression assays were performed using the reporter gene construct YCp33 HO promoter-HIS3-HO 3′-UTR and YEp181 MPT5, described by Goldstrohm et al. (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), in either wild-type BY4742 or pop2 strains. Wild-type or catalytically inactive mutant POP2 were expressed from vector pACG1-NT. Colonies from each test strain were isolated and grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C, and the indicated number of cells was plated on minimal medium with or without histidine in the presence of 300 μg/ml of Zeocin (Invivogen). The His3p competitive inhibitor 3-aminotriazole was added to medium lacking histidine at a concentration of 1 mm to increase stringency of the growth assay. Purification of Deadenylase Complexes—Wild-type or catalytically inactive mutant Pop2p or Ccr4p complexes were purified from pop2 or ccr4 deletion strains as indicated in Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S1. Conditions identical to the TAP-POP2 purification (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) were used except that the target proteins had a T7 affinity tag at the N terminus with a TEV protease site to allow elution of the isolated complexes. All steps were done on ice or at 4 °C. Cell extracts were prepared from 1-liter cultures grown to OD660 nm of 1.5 in YPAD with 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invivogen). Cells were washed and lysed by glass bead bashing for 15 min in 1 packed cell volume of TNEMN150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl) containing Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was then centrifuged 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was removed and incubated with T7 monoclonal antibodies covalently linked to agarose beads (Novagen) for 4 h. Beads were washed four times with 150 bed volumes of TNEMN150 and then one time with 150 bed volumes of deadenylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) (25Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted from beads in 1 bed volume of deadenylation buffer using 8 units of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) for 12 h at 4 °C. Purified complexes were evaluated by silver staining and by deadenylation assays. In Vitro Deadenylation Assays—Deadenylation reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume in deadenylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and 10 μm nonspecific competitor RNA (synthetic oligoribonucleotide with sequence 5′-UCUAAUCGGGGUACAAUUAUAUAAUAUA-3′). HO substrate RNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) with sequence 5′-AGUUUAAAAAGUUGUAUGUAAUAAAAGUA14-3′ was radioactively labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) at the 5′-end and added to the reactions at a final concentration of 10 nm. Recombinant purified GST-Mpt5p RBD (250 nm) was added to reactions where indicated. Purified Pop2p or Ccr4p complexes (10 ng each) were added to their respective reactions. In initial experiments, we carefully titrated these complexes to measure their deadenylase activity (supplemental Fig. S1), and then balanced the amount and activity used in the final experiments shown in Fig. 4. CCR4 and POP2 Are Required for Deadenylation of HO mRNA in Vivo—Mpt5p stimulates deadenylation of HO mRNA in vivo and in vitro (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the contributions of Pop2p and Ccr4p to PUF-stimulated deadenylation. We first analyzed the length of poly(A) on endogenous HO mRNA in wild-type cells and in strains with deletions of genes encoding subunits of Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex. We focused initially on a comparison of wild-type, pop2, and ccr4 deletion strains. We used thiolutin to inhibit transcription and then collected samples over a time course to observe the degradation of the poly(A) tails. Total RNA was extracted from each sample and cleaved with ribonuclease H and a specific antisense oligonucleotide to produce a short HO 3′-end fragment. To measure the poly(A) length of this 3′-fragment, we performed high resolution polyacrylamide electrophoresis and Northern blotting. The noncoding SCR1 RNA served as a loading control. In wild-type cells, HO poly(A) tails displayed a broad distribution of poly(A) lengths, from 5 to 80 nucleotides (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–7). The long HO poly(A) tails were removed rapidly; the oligo-adenylated (A5–15) form disappeared more slowly, most likely via the well established deadenylation-dependent decapping pathway (21Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In pop2 cells, the distribution of poly(A) ranged form 20 to 60 nucleotides; poly(A) lengths below 20 nucleotides were not detected (Fig. 1A, lanes 8–14). Over the time course, the longer tails were shortened to 20–40 adenosines (lane 14) and the mRNA disappeared slowly, without further deadenylation (see below). In addition to this effect on steady-state mRNA distribution, the apparent rate of removal of the poly(A) tail was slower in pop2 cells (compare lanes 2–4 with lanes 9–11). In ccr4 cells, HO mRNA possessed long 60–80-nucleotide poly(A) tails (Fig. 1A, lanes 15–21). Very slow deadenylation was detected, likely catalyzed by the Pan2p-Pan3p complex (15Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In both pop2 and ccr4 mutants, HO mRNA slowly disappeared without complete deadenylation, consistent with previously observed deadenylation-independent decay of other mRNAs in pop2 and ccr4 cells (15Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 19Daugeron M.C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We conclude that both Pop2p and Ccr4p are required for deadenylation of HO mRNA in vivo but that their roles differ. Ccr4p is required for initial deadenylation. Ccr4p is unable to remove HO poly(A) tails in the range of 5 to 20 nucleotides in the absence of Pop2p. Pop2p facilitates deadenylation from 20 to 60 nucleotides and is most critical for removal of shorter poly(A)5–20 tails. Deletion of Other Deadenylase Complex Components Does Not Affect HO Poly(A) Tails—To determine whether other mRNA decay factors were required for deadenylation of HO mRNA, we analyzed steady-state mRNA from a series of mutant strains, each lacking various turnover-related components. The same high resolution Northern blotting method as above was used to determine HO poly(A) tail lengths accurately (Fig. 1B). Deletion of CCR4 again caused a complete block in deadenylation (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus 3). Mutants lacking Pan2p, the catalytic subunit of the Pan2p-Pan3p deadenylase complex, showed little effect on HO poly(A) tail lengths; a slight increase in the length of the longest poly(A) tails was observed (Fig. 1B, lane 4) and is consistent with a role for the Pan2p-Pan3p complex in initial poly(A) tail trimming (26Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Deletions of components of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex, including Caf120p, Caf130p, Not3p, and Not4p, had no apparent effect on HO poly(A) tail length (lanes 5–8). Defects in other Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex components were not tested because those mutants were inviable. We conclude that the Pan2p deadenylase has very little effect on removal of HO poly(A) tails and that at least four proteins in the described Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex are not necessary for HO mRNA deadenylation. Deletions of these same genes also did not disrupt repression by Mpt5p in vivo (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). POP2 Protein, but Not Its Enzymatic Activity, Is Required for HO Deadenylation in Vivo—The dependence of deadenylation and repression on Pop2p suggested that its deadenylase activity might be essential for PUF action. To test this idea, we determined whether Pop2p enzymatic activity was required for PUF-stimulated deadenylation in vivo. We analyzed HO poly(A) tails in pop2 cells carrying a wild-type copy (POP2) or mutant form of POP2 (POP2 mt) on an episome (Fig. 2A). The mutation in POP2 comprised two missense substitutions (S188A/E190A) that inactivate its deadenylase activity in vitro (20Thore S. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HO mRNA in these strains was compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and to a pop2 mutant containing an empty vector (lane 3). pop2 mutant cells displayed the expected deadenylation defects, accumulating mRNAs with tails between 20 and 60 nucleotides in length (lane 3). The wild-type POP2 gene restored deadenylation fully (lane 4). The missense mutant form of POP2 also yielded a wild-type HO poly(A) pattern (lane 5). Both wild-type and mutant Pop2p were expressed at the same level (data not shown). To determine whether the mutant form of Pop2p still associated with Mpt5p, we determined whether Pop2p co-immunoprecipitated with Mpt5p (Fig. 2B). Both mutant and wild-type forms of Pop2p interact with Mpt5p in yeast extracts (Fig. 2B). We conclude that the POP2 protein is important for normal deadenylation of HO mRNA in vivo but its enzymatic activity is not. Ccr4p Deadenylase Activity Is Crucial for HO Deadenylation in Vivo—To determine whether Ccr4p nuclease activity is required for deadenylation of HO mRNA, we introduced a wild-type or mutant CCR4 gene on an episome into ccr4 mutant cells and again assayed the length of poly(A) on HO mRNA (Fig. 2C). CCR4 deletion mutants exhibited a severe defect in deadenylation that was not rescued by empty vector (Fig. 2C, lane 2 versus 3). The wild-type distribution of poly(A) lengths was restored by episomal CCR4 (lane 4). A missense mutation in CCR4 gene (CCR4 mt), bearing a single amino acid substitution (E556A) that inactivates Ccr4p nuclease activity (18Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), completely abrogated the rescue of activity (lane 5). Both wild-type and mutant Ccr4p were expressed at nearly the same levels (data not shown) and co-immunoprecipitated with Mpt5p (Fig. 2D). We conclude that Ccr4p is the main deadenylase responsible for HO mRNA deadenylation in vivo. Mpt5p Repression Is Not Affected by Pop2p Active Site Mutations—To determine whether the enzymatic activity of Pop2p was required for PUF repression, we used a HIS3 reporter gene containing the HO 3′-UTR (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mpt5p binds to the HO 3′-UTR and specifically represses the HIS3-HO mRNA, which can be assayed on medium lacking histidine and containing 3-aminotriazole, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3-encoded protein (Fig. 3). When Mpt5p is overexpressed in wild-type cells, the reporter mRNA is repressed and the cells no longer grow on medium lacking histidine (Fig. 3, WT strain). In pop2 mutant cells, Mpt5p-mediated repression was restored by either the wild-type Pop2p or the catalytically inactive Pop2p mutant (Fig. 3, pop2 strain). Thus, we conclude that whereas POP2 protein is necessary, its deadenylase activity is not. Because deletion of CCR4 has only a modest effect on Mpt5p repression (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that deadenylation may not be the only mechanism involved in Mpt5p-mediated repression of the reporter mRNA (see “Discussion”). Pop2p Deadenylase Activity Is Not Required for PUF-stimulated Deadenylation in Vitro—To further examine the requirements for POP2 and CCR4 proteins, we exploited the in vitro system we recently developed that recapitulates PUF-mediated deadenylation (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this assay, deadenylation of synthetic RNAs containing a PUF binding site is catalyzed by Pop2p complexes purified from yeast, mixed with purified recombinant Mpt5p. We used this assay to determine whether the enzymatic activity of Pop2p was required for PUF-stimulated deadenylation. Either wild-type or mutant POP2 genes, with T7 epitope tags, were introduced into pop2 cells. The mutant Pop2p carried the two missense substitutions (S188A/E190A) that disrupt its enzyme activity (20Thore S. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Suck D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The POP2 proteins, with associated factors, were purified from yeast and assayed for deadenylation using HO 3′-UTR RNA substrates with 14 adenosines at their 3′-end. We titrated the amount and activity of these Pop2p complexes so that deadenylase activity was minimal under the conditions used (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–5 and 9–11; supplemental Fig. 1A). Recombinant Mpt5p stimulated deadenylation by both the wild-type Pop2p and mutant Pop2p complexes and yielded a fully deadenylated product (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–8 and 12–14). Therefore, Pop2p deadenylase activity is not essential for PUF-stimulated deadenylation in vitro. We also purified Pop2p complexes from a ccr4 strain to determine whether Pop2p had any activity in the absence of Ccr4p. This Pop2p complex had no detectable deadenylase activity, even at high concentrations (Fig. 4A, lanes 15–17; supplemental Fig. S1A). Moreover, this complex, lacking Ccr4p, exhibited no deadenylation activity when mixed with Mpt5p (Fig. 4A, lanes 18–20). Thus, Mpt5p does not activate Pop2p deadenylase activity and Ccr4p is critical for the deadenylase activity of the purified Pop2p complex. Ccr4p Deadenylase Is Required for PUF-stimulated Deadenylation in Vitro—To test whether the enzymatic activity of Ccr4p was essential for PUF-stimulated deadenylation, we purified T7 epitope-tagged Ccr4p from ccr4 cells. As expected, purified wild-type Ccr4p complexes supported Mpt5p-stimulated deadenylation (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–8; supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast, purified mutant Ccr4p complexes, bearing a catalytically inactive Ccr4p subunit, were totally inactive for deadenylation (Fig. 4B, lanes 9–11; supplemental Fig. S1B) and remained inactive in the presence of Mpt5p (Fig. 4B, lanes 12–14). These data demonstrate that Ccr4p is responsible for deadenylase activity of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex and for PUF-stimulated deadenylation. Because PUF proteins directly bind the Pop2p subunit (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we tested whether Pop2p was required for Ccr4p-catalyzed deadenylation. We purified T7-tagged Ccr4p from pop2 cells and assayed its activity. Though the Ccr4p complexes from pop2 mutants and wild-type cells were equally active in nonspecific deadenylation assays (Fig. 4B, lanes 15–17; supplemental Fig. S1B), the Ccr4p complex purified from pop2 mutants did not support Mpt5p-stimulated deadenylation (Fig. 4B, lanes 18–20). This result contrasts dramatically with the ability of Ccr4p complexes to promote deadenylation when Pop2p was present (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–8). Thus Pop2p is required for PUF-stimulated deadenylation in vitro. In this report, we set out to discover how PUF proteins enhance deadenylation of target mRNAs. Mpt5p associates with the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex through a direct protein-protein interaction with the Pop2p subunit (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). By so doing, the deadenylase complex acts preferentially on those mRNAs to which Mpt5p is bound. We have shown here that Pop2p and Ccr4p are required for PUF-mediated deadenylation, both in vivo and in vitro. However, the roles of the two proteins differ dramatically. The deadenylase activity of Pop2p is dispensable for PUF repression in vivo, for deadenylation of HO mRNA in vivo, and for PUF-stimulated deadenylation in vitro. Furthermore, purified, recombinant, yeast Pop2p, which was competent for binding to Mpt5p, possessed no deadenylase activity in vitro with or without Mpt5p (not shown). From these findings, we conclude that Pop2p does not catalyze PUF-stimulated deadenylation. Although the enzyme activity of Pop2p is not required, the protein itself is essential for PUF-mediated deadenylation, both in vivo and in vitro. What role does Pop2p play? Ccr4p isolated from pop2 cells possesses nonspecific deadenylation activity, consistent with previous results (17Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, without Pop2p, Ccr4p is not stimulated by the PUF protein. We infer that Pop2p recruits the Ccr4p enzyme to the RNA. This may be achieved through a direct Pop2p-Ccr4p contact or could be indirect, through other subunits of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex (16Denis C.L. Chen J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 221-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that contacts between the PUF protein and other subunits of the Ccr4p-Pop2-Not complex are critical, because deletion of Pop2p alone is sufficient to disrupt PUF-mediated deadenylation (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We do not detect direct contacts between Mpt5p and several other subunits of the Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex. 3A. Goldstrohm and M. Wickens, unpublished data. Furthermore, deletions of other subunits of the complex do not significantly influence HO deadenylation or repression (this study and Ref. 13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The most parsimonious interpretation is that Pop2p is physically required to mediate recruitment of Ccr4p to HO mRNA by Mpt5p. Ccr4p is the enzyme responsible for PUF-stimulated deadenylation; deletion of CCR4 blocked deadenylation in vivo and in vitro, as did mutation of the Ccr4p active site. Further support for the role of Ccr4p in PUF-stimulated deadenylation comes from our previous analysis of HO poly(A) tails in a strain deleted of both PUF proteins that regulate HO (see Fig. 2b in Goldstrohm et al.; Ref. 13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). When MPT5 is deleted (along with the redundant PUF4), the poly(A) tails on HO mRNA are removed very slowly, an effect that mirrors deletion of CCR4 (see Fig. 1A). The Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex remains functional in this double PUF deletion strain, but the deadenylase is no longer efficiently recruited to the mRNA. Therefore, poly(A) removal proceeds at a slow basal rate. Our findings suggest that deadenylation is not the only way in which Mpt5p can reduce expression of mRNAs. The importance of poly(A) tails for efficient translation and mRNA stability is well documented (1Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 3Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-486Google Scholar, 4Kuhn U. Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). PUF repression correlates with enhanced deadenylation and degradation of target mRNAs in a number of biological systems (i.e. Xenopus, Drosophila, Cae-norhabditis elegans, and yeast; reviewed in Ref. 8Wickens M. Bernstein D.S. Kimble J. Parker R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 150-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Ccr4p is stringently required for deadenylation, but ccr4 mutants exhibit only a modest effect on repression by Mpt5p in reporter gene repression assays (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, pop2 mutants are impaired both in deadenylation and repression. One possible explanation for these findings is that Mpt5p may repress translation independent of deadenylation. The Drosophila PUF protein, Pumilio, which normally stimulates deadenylation of target mRNAs, can repress translation of non-adenylated mRNAs, albeit with reduced efficiency (27Chagnovich D. Lehmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11359-11364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We suggest that PUF proteins recruit multiple activities to repress target mRNAs. Because Pop2p is required for PUF repression, we suggest that it serves as a bridge to recruit the multifunctional Ccr4p-Pop2p-Not complex. The complex not only removes poly(A) tails via its Ccr4p subunit but also may elicit translational repression through other mechanisms. Dhh1p is an intriguing candidate to mediate this repression: it co-immunoprecipitates with Mpt5p and has a well established role in inhibiting translation (28Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 29Coller J.M. Tucker M. Sheth U. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Parker R.

RNA. 2001; 7: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), would further seal the fate of the target mRNA. Pop2p, Ccr4p, and their orthologs are implicated in regulated mRNA decay and repression by several 3′-UTR-binding proteins and by miRNAs (5Behm-Ansmant I. Rehwinkel J. Doerks T. Stark A. Bork P.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2010-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In these systems, the relative biochemical roles of the two deadenylases have not yet been delineated. PARN, another deadenylase, also is recruited by certain 3′-UTR-borne factors (37Chou C.F. Mulky A. Maitra S. Lin W.J. Gherzi R. Kappes J. Chen C.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3695-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Moraes K.C. Wilusz C.J. Wilusz J. RNA. 2006; 12: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The opportunity for diversity in regulated deadenylation and repression is clear. The versatility of regulatory mechanisms is echoed even within a single regulatory family, the PUF proteins. The interaction between PUF and Pop2 proteins is conserved through evolution (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Yet not all PUF proteins necessarily repress in precisely the same manner as Mpt5p. Moreover, the human Pop2p ortholog, CNOT8, which can interact with Ccr4p (39Dupressoir A. Morel A.P. Barbot W. Loireau M.P. Corbo L. Heidmann T. BMC Genomics. 2001; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), is active as a deadenylase (23Bianchin C. Mauxion F. Sentis S. Seraphin B. Corbo L. RNA. 2005; 11: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and binds to a human PUF protein (13Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, a single human PUF protein may recruit two active deadenylases, CNOT8 and human CCR4, to degrade target mRNAs. It will be of interest to determine whether the requirements for the Ccr4p deadenylase and a Pop2p protein bridge are universal among PUF proteins or are a theme with many variations.

https://openalex.org/W2093937338,"Smallpox was eradicated without an adequate understanding of how vaccination induced protection. In response to possible bioterrorism with smallpox, the UK government vaccinated approximately 300 health care workers with vaccinia virus (VACV) strain Lister. Antibody responses were analyzed using ELISA for multiple surface antigens of the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) and the intracellular mature virus (IMV), plaque reduction neutralization and a fluorescence-based flow cytometric neutralization assay. Antibody depletion experiments showed that the EEV surface protein B5 is the only target responsible for EEV neutralization in vaccinated humans, whereas multiple IMV surface proteins, including A27 and H3, are targets for IMV-neutralizing antibodies. These data suggest that it would be unwise to exclude the B5 protein from a future smallpox vaccine. Repeated vaccination provided significantly higher B5-specific and thus EEV-neutralizing antibody responses. These data provide a benchmark against which new, safer smallpox vaccines and residual immunity can be compared."
https://openalex.org/W2068535614,"Alkalinization of the external environment represents a stress situation for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Adaptation to this circumstance involves the activation of diverse response mechanisms, the components of which are still largely unknown. We show here that mutation of members of the cell integrity Pkc1/Slt2 MAPK module, as well as upstream and downstream elements of the system, confers sensitivity to alkali. Alkalinization resulted in fast and transient activation of the Slt2 MAPK, which depended on the integrity of the kinase module and was largely abolished by sorbitol. Lack of Wsc1, removal of specific extracellular and intracellular domains, or substitution of Tyr<sup>303</sup> in this putative membrane stress sensor rendered cells sensitive to alkali and considerably decreased alkali-induced Slt2 activation. In contrast, constitutive activation of Slt2 by the <i>bck1-20</i> allele increased pH tolerance in the <i>wsc1</i> mutant. DNA microarray analysis revealed that several genes encoding cell wall proteins, such as <i>GSC2</i>/<i>FKS2</i>, <i>DFG5</i>, <i>SKT5</i>, and <i>CRH1</i>, were induced, at least in part, by high pH in an Slt2-dependent manner. We observed that <i>dfg5</i>, <i>skt5</i>, and particularly <i>dfg5 skt5</i> cells were alkali-sensitive. Therefore, our results show that an alkaline environment imposes a stress condition on the yeast cell wall. We propose that the Slt2-mediated MAPK pathway plays an important role in the adaptive response to this insult and that Wsc1 participates as an essential cell-surface pH sensor. Moreover, these results provide a new example of the complexity of the response of budding yeast to the alkalinization of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2019662547,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by rapid tumor progression, high metastatic potential and profound chemoresistance. We recently reported that induction of a chemoresistant phenotype in the PDAC cell line PT45-P1 by long-term chemotherapy involves an increased interleukin 1 beta (IL1β)-dependent secretion of nitric oxide (NO) accounting for efficient caspase inhibition. In the present study, we elucidated the involvement of L1CAM, an adhesion molecule previously found in other malignancies, in this NO-dependent chemoresistance. Chemoresistant PT45-P1res cells, but not chemosensitive parental PT45-P1 cells, express high levels of L1CAM in an ILβ-dependent fashion. PT45-P1res cells subjected to short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated L1CAM knock-down exhibited reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and NO secretion, as well as a significant increase of anti-cancer drug-induced caspase activation, an effect reversed by the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine. Conversely, overexpression of L1CAM in PT45-P1 cells conferred anti-apoptotic protection to anti-cancer drug treatment. Interestingly, L1CAM ectodomain shedding, in example, by ADAM10, as reported for other L1CAM-related activities, seemed to be dispensable for anti-apoptotic protection by L1CAM. Neither the shedded L1CAM ectodomain was detected in chemoresistant L1CAM-expressing PT45-P1 cells nor did the administration of various metalloproteinase inhibitors affect L1CAM-dependent chemoresistance. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed L1CAM expression in 80% of pancreatic cancer specimens, supporting a potential role of L1CAM in the malignancy of this tumor. These findings substantiate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to chemoresistance in PDAC cells and indicate the importance of L1CAM in this scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2094170127,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as an energy sensor, being activated by metabolic stresses and regulating cellular metabolism. AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ. It had been reported that the mammalian AMPK α subunit contained an autoinhibitory domain (α1: residues 313-392) and had little kinase activity. We have found that a conserved short segment of the α subunit (α1-(313-335)), which includes a predicted α-helix, is responsible for α subunit autoinhibition. The role of the residues in this segment for autoinhibition was further investigated by systematic site-directed mutation. Several hydrophobic and charged residues, in particular Leu-328, were found to be critical for α1 autoinhibition. An autoinhibitory structural model of human AMPK α1-(1-335) was constructed and revealed that Val-298 interacts with Leu-328 through hydrophobic bonding at a distance of about 4 Å and may stabilize the autoinhibitory conformation. Further mutation analysis showed that V298G mutation significantly activated the kinase activity. Moreover, the phosphorylation level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the AMPK downstream substrate, was significantly increased in COS7 cells overexpressing AMPK α1-(1-394) with deletion of residues 313-335 (Δα394) and a V298G or L328Q mutation, and the glucose uptake was also significantly enhanced in HepG2 cells transiently transfected with Δα394, V298G, or L328Q mutants, which indicated that these AMPK α1 mutants are constitutively active in mammalian cells and that interaction between Leu-328 and Val-298 plays an important role in AMPK α autoinhibitory function. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as an energy sensor, being activated by metabolic stresses and regulating cellular metabolism. AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ. It had been reported that the mammalian AMPK α subunit contained an autoinhibitory domain (α1: residues 313-392) and had little kinase activity. We have found that a conserved short segment of the α subunit (α1-(313-335)), which includes a predicted α-helix, is responsible for α subunit autoinhibition. The role of the residues in this segment for autoinhibition was further investigated by systematic site-directed mutation. Several hydrophobic and charged residues, in particular Leu-328, were found to be critical for α1 autoinhibition. An autoinhibitory structural model of human AMPK α1-(1-335) was constructed and revealed that Val-298 interacts with Leu-328 through hydrophobic bonding at a distance of about 4 Å and may stabilize the autoinhibitory conformation. Further mutation analysis showed that V298G mutation significantly activated the kinase activity.

Therefore, AMPK has been investigated for the treatment of type II diabetes, obesity, and even cancer (12Rattan R. Giri S. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Biol.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein kinase consisting of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ (13Dyck J.R. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B.E.

Optimal kinase activity requires the formation of a heterotrimeric complex, involving AMP allosteric activation, and phosphorylation on Thr172 within the activation loop of the catalytic α subunit by an upstream kinase, AMPK kinase (AMPKK), identified as LKB1 or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CAMKKβ) (13Dyck J.R.

However, recent studies have showed that the three subunits of the SNF1 kinase heterotrimer are interdependent for association and assembly of a functional complex in vivo (33Elbing K.

The mammalian AMPK α catalytic subunit contains an N-terminal kinase domain (residues 1-312) and a C-terminal domain (residues 313-548), which includes an autoinhibitory domain (AID) and a binding domain responsible for binding the α/γ subunits (34Crute B.E.

Previous studies have identified residues 313-392 of the α1 subunit as the AID sequence and residues 313-473 of the α1 subunit as the α1 binding sequence (34Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamle J. Kemp B.E.

Alignment analysis of the AID sequence indicates that this segment is highly conserved in the AMPK subfamily of kinases. However, there is little conservation between AMPK and AMPK-related protein kinases, except for several conserved residues located in the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is located closely following the kinase domain in many AMPK-related protein kinases and required for the activation and localization of these kinases (36Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mammalian AMPK α catalytic subunits do not possess this UBA domain within the reported sequence at 313-392; instead, it plays an important role for α subunit autoinhibition. Although the AID is known to be responsible for α subunit inhibition, a more detailed autoinhibitory sequence and molecular basis for the autoinhibitory function of AMPK are unclear. Therefore, it was of interest to us to investigate which part of that domain (α1, residues 313-392) in the mammalian AMPK α catalytic subunit acts as the autoinhibitory sequence and determine how it exerts its autoinhibitory role. In this study, we identify that a conserved 23-residue sequence of the α subunit (α1, residues 313-335), including a predicted α-helix, acts as the autoinhibitory sequence in the AMPK α subunit by means of truncation, deletion, and point mutation of the α1 subunit. Hydrophobic interaction between Val-298 and Leu-328, using our hypothesized autoinhibitory structural model of α1-(1-335), was confirmed by mutation and kinase assay. The hydrophobic and charged residues in the conserved α-helix might play important roles for the autoinhibitory activity of the α subunit partly through tight packing of the α autoinhibitory domain and maintenance of the conformation interacting with the kinase domain.

For the trimer α1/β1/γ1 expression, the pETDuet-β1/α1 and pET28b-γ1 were constructed to co-transform into competent cells. The full-length genes of human AMPK α1 and γ1 were amplified and then subcloned into pET28b vectors to construct pET28b-α1 and pET28b-γ1 for expression of recombinant proteins with C-terminal polyhistidine tags, respectively. The human full-length AMPK β1 gene was cloned into the vector pETDuet-1 to form pETDuet-β1, and then the AMPK α1 subunit gene and its upstream T7 promoter were subcloned from pET28b-α1 and ligated into pETDuet-β1 to form pETDuet-β1/α1.TABLE 1Summary of recombinant plasmids, expressed proteins, and primers used for cloning Oligonucleotides for primers are displayed from 5′ to 3′, and nucleotides in boldface type indicate the restriction site.

Two strands were amplified with forward/midantisense primers and midsense/reverse primers, respectively, and then this two-strand mixture was taken as a template to amplify relative deletions using corresponding forward/reverse primers. Both midsense and midantisense primers used for deletions are listed in Table 1. All mutants of AMPK-α1-(1-394) were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit for generating the single point mutants D320A, L322Q, A323R, V324F, A325E, Y326F, H327E, L328Q, I329N, I330N, D331A, N332A, R333A, R334A, and I335N from the plasmid pGEMEX-1/AMPK-α1-(1-394). For transfection plasmids construction using plasmid pcDNA3.1, the truncations were amplified from human AMPK α1 cDNA by PCR using relevant primers containing a consensus Kozak sequence for proper translation. To facilitate detection of the truncation expression in cells, a C-terminal His tag and Myc tag were incorporated into the truncations. All recombinant plasmids containing wild-type truncations, deletions, and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli cells containing the expression plasmids containing truncations, deletions, and mutant plasmids were cultured at 37 °C until the absorbance of 600 nm reached 0.6, and then 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression at 22 °C overnight. The cells were spun down and sonicated in lysis buffer (TL for nonfusion proteins: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100). The nonfusion truncated proteins, deletions, and mutants were purified by loading the lysate supernatant onto a 20-ml HiPrep Q-Sepharose column (preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-1 m) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT. All purified proteins were stored at -70 °C. The expression and purification of the trimer α1/β1/γ1 were carried out as described previously (38Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with minor modification of α1/β1/γ1 expression, for which the recombinant plasmids pETDuet-β1/α1 and pET28b-γ1 were co-transformed into BL21 Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL. The purified complexes were dialyzed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C to remove imidazole and were stored at -70 °C until use. Recombinant CaMKKβ was expressed and purified as described previously (39Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol.

In order to determine the phosphorylation time of kinase for an activity assay and due to inactive α1-(1-394), we chose α1-(1-312) as the active form incubated in a phosphorylation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP (1.0 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP/reaction) with CaMKKβ (200 nm) at 30 °C for the indicated times, at which aliquots were removed for determination of phosphate incorporation. α1-(1-312) was fully phosphorylated by incubation with upstream kinase for 4 h (Fig. 4A). In the following experiments for the kinase activity assay, all truncations, deletions, or mutations were preincubated in the phosphorylation buffer for 4 h before the enzyme assay. After recombinant proteins were fully phosphorylated by incubation with CaMKKβ (200 nm) at 30°C for 4 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, activities of the phosphorylated α truncations or deletions or mutants were carried out under a typical assay in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 nm enzymes, 50 μm ATP (0.4 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP/reaction), 50 μm SAMS. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1% H3PO4. The reaction mixture was then transferred to P30 filter paper and washed three times with 0.1% H3PO4. Radioactivity that had been incorporated in the proteins was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Wallac Microbeta plate counter. Background radioactivity estimated from reactions conducted without enzymes was subtracted from sample radioactivities. All reactions were repeated in three independent experiments. COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection with plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent in cells that were about 80% confluent. Briefly, COS7 cells in a 6-well plate were transiently transfected with 8 μg of each DNA construct in Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (0.5 μl/μg of DNA), using a GFP vector of pEGFP-C1 to monitor transfection efficiency when required and still cultured for about 24 h, allowing for AMPK expression. Before Western blotting analysis, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed with PBS and then lysed directly by 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5.5 mm d-glucose in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For experiments, HepG2 cells were split into a 24-well plate, and the next day the cells, when grown to 70% confluence, were transiently transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid/well in Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (0.5 μl/μg DNA). A GFP vector of pEGFP-C1 was used as a control to monitor transfection efficiency. After transfection for 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS and then were incubated in either glucose-containing or glucose-free DMEM for 24 h. To determine the glucose uptake, the medium was switched to glucose-free HEPES-buffered saline (HBS buffer: 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Glucose uptake was measured by adding a 50-μl glucose mixture (1 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 0.5 μCi of 2-[3H]deoxy-d-glucose in HBS) to 450 μl of HBS followed by incubation for 3 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific glucose uptake was measured by parallel incubations in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B, which blocks transporter-mediated glucose uptake, and was subtracted from the total uptake in each assay. Uptake was terminated by quickly washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were mixed with 200 μl of cell lysis solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). A portion of the cell lysate was used in a radioactivity assay performed using a liquid scintillation counter. The above prepared samples were subjected to 8-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The quantities of the protein and phosphorylation were detected by the following primary antibodies: anti-AMPK-α antibody and anti-phospho-AMPKα-Thr-172 antibody (1:1,000 dilution), anti-phospho-ACC-Ser-79 antibody (1:1,000 dilution), anti-ACC antibody (1:1,000 dilution), anti-Myc antibody (1:2,000 dilution), and anti-β-actin antibody (1:5,000 dilution). The total protein of each sample was quantified by β-actin. The signal was detected by a chemiluminescence kit and analyzed by densitometric evaluation using an imaging system and analyzing software (Shanghai Furi Science & Technology Co.). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method. For Homology Modeling—The crystal structure of yeast AMP-activated protein kinase homologous Snf1p (Protein Data Bank code 2EUE) was used to construct the kinase domain (residues 1-280) of human AMPK α1 by utilizing the program MODELLER. The sequence identity between these two proteins is 56%, and the positive score is 71%, whereas for the autoinhibitory domain (residue 290-335), the sequence searching against the Protein Data Bank did not result in any informative alignment. Therefore, the secondary structure prediction was conducted within the server (available on the World Wide Web at www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/~www-jpred/) performed by the built in program Jpred, which suggested that this domain contained three α-helices. Then functional search found that the ubiquitin-associated domains of many kinases contain such structural features. Also, as provided by Jaleel et al. (36Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the sequence alignments between AMPKα1 and microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) were adopted to build this autoinhibitory domain. Due to the low sequence identity, after the comparative modeling by MODELLER, the CHARMM program was used to solvate this domain in a water box extending 10 Å from any atoms of the domain. Then the energy minimization was performed in about 1000 steps with the conjugate gradient method to relax the autoinhibitory domain. Following this, 10-ps molecular dynamics was carried out to further explore the conformation of the domain by constraint of the backbone atoms with a force constant of 10 Kcal/mol Å2. For Docking—As suggested in the crystal structure of protein kinase MARK/Par-1, the ubiquitin-associated domain in MARK (equivalent to the autoinhibitory domain in AMPK) is located at the back side of the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. Thus, the complex of autoinhibitory domain and kinase domain of AMPK was formed according to the coordinates of the crystal structure of MARK (Protein Data Bank code 1Y8G). To release the crash between these two domains, the CHARMM program was used again to minimize the complex with the procedure based on the program RDOCK, first by only minimizing the van der Waals interaction and keeping each domain as a rigid body and then by adding the electrostatic force to minimize the complex while the dist"
https://openalex.org/W2055295317,"Inhibition of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) mechanism in cells results in stabilization of transcripts carrying premature translation termination codons. A strategy referred to as gene identification by NMD inhibition (GINI) has been proposed to identify genes carrying nonsense mutations. Genes containing frameshift mutations in colon cancer cell line have been identified using a modified version of GINI. To increase the efficiency of identifying mutant genes using GINI, we have now further improved the strategy. In this approach, inhibition of NMD with emetine is complemented with inhibiting NMD by blocking the phosphorylation of the hUpf1 protein with caffeine. In addition, to enhance the GINI strategy, comparing mRNA level alterations produced by inhibiting transcription alone or inhibiting transcription together with NMD following caffeine pretreatment were used for the efficient identification of false positives produced as a result of stress response to NMD inhibition. To demonstrate the improved efficiency of this approach, we analysed colon cancer cell lines showing microsatellite instability. Bi-allelic inactivating mutations were found in the FXR1, SEC31L1, NCOR1, BAT3, PHF14, ZNF294, C19ORF5 genes as well as genes coding for proteins with yet unknown functions."
https://openalex.org/W2092099782,"In higher plants, sexual reproduction involves interactions between pollen and pistil. A key mechanism to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility through rejection of incompatible ('self') pollen. In Papaver rhoeas, S proteins encoded by the stigma interact with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca2+-dependent signalling network resulting in pollen tube inhibition and programmed cell death. The cytosolic phosphoprotein p26.1, which has been identified in incompatible pollen, shows rapid, self-incompatibility-induced Ca2+-dependent hyperphosphorylation in vivo. Here we show that p26.1 comprises two proteins, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, which are soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases). These proteins have classic Mg2+-dependent sPPase activity, which is inhibited by Ca2+, and unexpectedly can be phosphorylated in vitro. We show that phosphorylation inhibits sPPase activity, establishing a previously unknown mechanism for regulating eukaryotic sPPases. Reduced sPPase activity is predicted to result in the inhibition of many biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms of self-incompatibility-mediated pollen tube inhibition. We provide evidence that sPPases are required for growth and that self-incompatibility results in an increase in inorganic pyrophosphate, implying a functional role for Pr-p26.1."
https://openalex.org/W1964008466,"Intestinal epithelial cells are subject to repetitive deformation during peristalsis and villous motility, whereas the mucosa atrophies during sepsis or ileus when such stimuli are abnormal. Such repetitive deformation stimulates intestinal epithelial proliferation via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). However, the upstream mediators of these effects are unknown. We investigated whether Src and Rac1 mediate deformation-induced FAK and ERK phosphorylation and proliferation in human Caco-2 and rat IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells. Cells cultured on collagen-I were subjected to an average 10% cyclic strain at 10 cycles/min. Cyclic strain activated Rac1 and induced Rac1 translocation to cell membranes. Mechanical strain also induced rapid sustained phosphorylation of c-Src at Tyr418, Rac1 at Ser71, FAK at Tyr397 and Tyr576, and ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204. The mitogenic effect of cyclic strain was blocked by inhibition of Src (PP2 or short interfering RNA) or Rac1 (NSC23766). Src or Rac1 inhibition also prevented strain-induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr576 and ERK phosphorylation but not FAK phosphorylation at Tyr397. Reducing FAK using short interfering RNA blocked strain-induced mitogenicity and attenuated ERK phosphorylation but not Src or Rac1 phosphorylation. Src inhibition blocked strain-induced Rac1 phosphorylation, but Rac inhibition did not alter Src phosphorylation. Transfection of a two-tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient FAK mutant Y576F/Y577F prevented activation of cotransfected myc-ERK2 by cyclic strain.

We have reported previously that rhythmic mechanical strain-induced deformation activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 2The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RGM-1, rat gastric epithelial cell line; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; PP2, (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4d]pyrimidine); HA, hemagglutinin; siRNAs, short interfering RNAs; NT1, nontargeting siRNA sequence; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells (15Li W. Duzgun A. Sumpio B.E. Basson M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G75-G87Crossref Google Scholar) and tyrosine kinase signaling in rat small and large bowel mucosa in vivo (17Basson M.D. Coppola C.P. Metabolism. 2002; 51: 1525-1527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ERK appears to be required for the mitogenic effect in human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, and transfection with a dominant negative FAK construct inhibits ERK activation by strain (15Li W. Duzgun A. Sumpio B.E. Basson M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G75-G87Crossref Google Scholar). However, the upstream mediators of these effects have not been delineated. Src has been shown to be upstream of FAK in pressure-induced rat mesenteric arteries and is part of a mechanosensory protein complex linking integrins with the cytoskeleton (18Rice D.C. Dobrian A.D. Schriver S.D. Prewitt R.L. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of Rho family guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) may also modulate FAK activation in response to certain stimuli (24Barry S.T.

However, the involvement of the small G-protein Rac1 in mechanosensing and signaling in response to repetitive deformation is not as well understood.

Physiol. 2005; 202: 536-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but it may not be universally true. Different cell types and different physical forces may be associated with different force-activated signal pathways. For instance, Rac is actually inhibited in response to equibiaxial stretch or tensile strain in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (31Putnam A.J. Cunningham J.J. Pillemer B.B. Mooney D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C627-C639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Katsumi A. Milanini J. Kiosses W.B. del Pozo M.A. Kaunas R. Chien S. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although Rac1 activation has not been investigated in the gut in response to strain, application of repetitive mechanical strain to a rat gastric epithelial cell line (RGM-1) at lower strain parameters has been reported not to influence Rac1 protein levels except in cells migrating at the edge of circular wounds in which Rac1 immunoreactivity may be decreased (35Osada T. Watanabe S. Tanaka H. Hirose M. Miyazaki A. Sato N. Gut. 1999; 45: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, Rac1 involvement in regulating the FAK and ERK activation that mediates the mitogenic effects of repetitive mechanical strain in intestinal epithelium is not well understood. We therefore sought to determine what upstream mediators might be responsible for such FAK and ERK activation. In particular, we sought to determine whether strain activation of Src and the small G-protein Rac1 mediates strain-induced FAK and ERK activation and cell proliferation in human (Caco-2) and rat (IEC-6) intestinal epithelial cells. We used the Flexercell apparatus (Flexcell, McKeesport, PA) to rhythmically deform Caco-2 and IEC-6 cell monolayers cultured on collagen-coated flexible-bottomed wells at an average 10% repetitive deformation at 10 cycles/min (7Basson M.D. Li G.D. Hong F. Han O. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 168: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), similar in magnitude and frequency to the irregular repetitive deformation that the mucosa experiences in vivo (36Moore R.

Pathol. 1991; 23: 569-577PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized time-dependent site-specific FAK phosphorylation and Rac1 and Src activation in response to repetitive deformation in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in order to begin tracing a mechanotransduced pathway that links these signals into a mitogenic cascade. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Oligofectamine, Lipofectamine, and Plus Reagent were obtained from Invitrogen.

The pCMV-HA-tagged vector was obtained from Clontech. The HA-tagged FAK wild type and HA-tagged FAK mutant changed codons for phosphoacceptor Tyr576–Tyr577 to Phe576–Phe577 were generous gifts from Dr. Steven K. Hanks (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). The wild type myc-ERK2 expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. Christopher Marshall (Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). Double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting human forms of FAK and control nontargeting siRNA 1 (NT1 siRNA) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The sequences targeted by siRNA were selected using Dharmacon Smartdesign® as follows: human FAK1, NNGCAUGUGGCCUGCUAUGGA; human FAK2, UUUGGCGGUUGCAAUUAAATT; human Src1, NNCUCGGCUCAUUGAAGACAA; and human Src2, NNUGGCCUACUACUCCAAACA. We used two different sequences targeted to FAK and Src for our initial studies of the effects of siRNA on FAK or Src protein. Because these two sequences yielded similar results, we then performed subsequent studies of the effects of FAK or Src reduction on strain-associated mitogenicity and signaling using an siRNA pool derived by combining the two FAK- or Src-targeted sequences. Cell Culture—The Caco-2BBE intestinal epithelial cell line used for this study was a subclone of the original Caco-2 cell line that was selected for its ability to differentiate in culture as indicated by formation of an apical brush border and expression of brush border enzymes (39Peterson M.D. Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 461-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 8% CO2 in DMEM with 25 mm d-glucose, 4 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 3.7 g/liter NaHCO3 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). IEC-6 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 unit/ml insulin and 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Inhibitors—PP2, a potent and selective inhibitor of the Src family tyrosine was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and NSC23766, a specific inhibitor of Rac activation was dissolved in sterile distilled water. All inhibitors were aliquoted and stored at –20 °C and were diluted immediately prior to use in cell culture medium. Cells were treated with PP2 (10 μm) or an equivalent amount of Me2SO (vehicle control) for 45 min or NSC23766 (50 μm) or cell culture medium (vehicle control) for 60 min prior to exposure to repetitive cyclic strain. FAK, Src, or NT1 siRNAs were dissolved in 1× siRNA buffer (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) at 40 μm. All siRNAs were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Application of Cyclic Strain—The cells were subjected to repetitive deformation using the Flexercell Strain Unit (FX-3000; Flexercell), as described previously (10Zhang J. Li W. Sanders M.A. Sumpio B.E. Panja A. Basson M.D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 926-928PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Caco-2 cells were plated on elastomer membranes coated with type I collagen Flex I 6-well culture plates (Flexcell International Corp, Hillsborough, NC) and were exposed to continuous cycles of strain/relaxation generated by a cyclic vacuum produced by a computer-driven system (Flexcell 3000; Flexcell International Corp.). Caco-2 cells were subjected to a 20-kilo-pascal vacuum at 10 cycles/min, with a stretch/relaxation ratio of 1:1 (3.0-s deformation alternating with 3.0 s in neutral conformation), creating an average 10% strain for the indicated times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The vacuum applies negative pressure that stretches the membranes to a known percentage elongation. We have previously demonstrated that strain is transmitted to adherent cells cultured on the upper surface of the membrane, which experience similar elongation (7Basson M.D. Li G.D. Hong F. Han O.

Cell Res. 1996; 225: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 6-well plates were maintained in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 during the application of repetitive strain. Similar plates containing control cultures were kept in the same incubator but were not subjected to strain regimens. Proliferation Studies—Proliferation was assessed by two different methods. In some studies, we counted cells directly after trypsinization with an automated cell counter. In other studies, we used a crystal violet absorption assay, demonstrated to correlate linearly with cell number over the range of cell numbers studied. Direct Cell Counting—Caco-2 cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/well on type I collagen Flex I 6-well culture plates for 24 h. Subconfluent (30–40% confluent) cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then switched back to normal growth medium with 10% FBS. At this point, cells from one 6-well plate were trypsinized and counted to provide a time 0 measurement. The remaining cells were then cultured for 24 h under either static conditions or conditions of repetitive strain before trypsinization and cell counting. Cell number was determined by counting each of the 6 wells independently (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK). Data from each experiment were analyzed with six observations in each group. Crystal Violet Staining—Caco-2 or IEC-6 cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/well on precoated type I collagen Flex I 6-well culture plates for 24 h. Subconfluent (30–40%) cells were serum-starved for 24 h (Caco-2 cells) or for 6 h (IEC-6 cells), and a single 6-well plate was reserved for a time 0 measurement, and the remaining serum-starved cells were switched back to normal growth medium with 10% FBS under static or repetitive strain conditions for 24 h before staining with crystal violet. Cell proliferation was assessed by a colorimetric assay using crystal violet (Sigma), a cytochemical stain that binds to chromatin, as described elsewhere (40Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 418-419PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal violet staining was carried out as described previously (41Kaeffer B. Benard C. Blottiere H.M. Cherbut C. Cell Biol. Int. 1997; 21: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, viable cells were rinsed in warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in absolute ethanol/glacial acetic acid (3:1, v/v) for 10 min at room temperature and left to air dry (eventually stored at 4 °C, wrapped in aluminum foil). The cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (w/v) for 10 min at room temperature. Excess dye was removed by decantation and two subsequent washings with distilled water. The dye was extracted in 10% acetic acid (v/v), and absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Ramsey, MN). Data from each experiment were analyzed with six observations in each group. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured as described previously (10Zhang J. Li W. Sanders M.A. Sumpio B.E. Panja A. Basson M.D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 926-928PubMed Google Scholar), grown to confluence, and changed to serum-free media for 24 h. After treatment, cells were lysed on ice in modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid analysis (BCA assay; Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded per well on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes Hybond™-ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoblots were probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) with a Kodak Image Station 440CF PhosphorImager (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, Rochester, NY). Rac1 Translocation Assays—The Rac1 translocation assay was performed as described previously (42Li S. Chen B.P. Azuma N. Hu Y.L. Wu S.Z. Sumpio B.E. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The static control cells or cells exposed to cyclic strain were scraped into a lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cell lysates were sonicated at 20% duty cycles 10 times to disrupt the cell membranes and release cytosolic proteins (Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT). The lysates were ultracentrifuged at 105 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the “cytosolic fraction.” The resulting pellet “membrane fraction” was washed twice with PBS and resuspended in the above lysis buffer. The pellet was sonicated at 20% duty cycles 10 times, incubated 30 min on ice, and then stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method as above. An equal amount of cell lysates (5–10 μg protein) of cytosolic and membrane fractions was loaded per well on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody to assess the amounts of Rac1 in each fraction. The blots were also probed with Rho-GDI and E-cadherin as protein loading controls for cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively. Rac1 GTPase Activity Assays—Rac1 activity was assessed by pulldown assay as described previously with slight modifications (38Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence and were serum-starved for 24 h before unstimulated cells at time 0 were compared with cells stimulated by cyclic strain for 2, 5, and 15 min. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. Extracts were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 rpm at 4 °C), and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA method as above. Active Rac1 levels were determined by GST-PBD (glutathione S-transferase-conjugated p21 binding domain) of p21-activated kinase 1 pulldown assays. The cell lysates were incubated with PAK-PBD beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in Laemmli buffer resolved electrophoretically, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (Pierce). Fifteen to 20 μg of cell lysates were used for Western blots for total Rac1 or β-actin antibodies. Transfection with siRNA—For these studies, cells were plated on type I collagen Flex I 6-well culture plates at 30–40% confluence 1 day before transfection. siRNAs were combined with Plus reagent in Opti-MEM as described previously for plasmid DNA transfection (43Thamilselvan V. Basson M.D. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 8-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Oligofectamine in Opti-MEM was used for transfection at 10 μg/ml according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final siRNA concentration was 100 nm unless otherwise indicated. After 6–8 h of transfection, 0.5 volume of DMEM containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS was added to the cells, and transfection was continued for 48 h. The cells were serum-starved overnight prior to signal studies. For proliferation studies, cells were transfected for 24 h followed by 24 h with and without cyclic strain. The effectiveness of the siRNA transfection was verified in each study by parallel transfections in which the cells were then lysed at the conclusion of the study, and the resulting lysates were immunoblotted for the target protein of interest. FAK-ERK Cotransfection Studies—Caco-2 cells were transfected as described previously with slight modifications (44Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38040-38047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To compare the effect of transfection with wild type FAK or FAK mutant Phe576–Phe577 on ERK2 activity, cells at 70–80% confluence were cotransfected with 4.8 μg of HA-tagged FAK-wild type or HA-tagged FAK mutant Phe576–Phe577 DNA and 1.2 μg of DNA of Myc-tagged ERK2 expression vector prior to study. Thus, cells in each well received a total of 1.0 μg of DNA with FAK and ERK constructs at a 4:1 ratio. The DNA was mixed with 60 μl of Plus reagent in 1 ml of Opti-MEM for 15 min, and then Lipofectamine (30.0 μl in 1 ml of Opti-MEM) was added. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, diluted with 6.0 ml of Opti-MEM, and added at 1.0 ml per well to cells for 6 h. Cells were rinsed twice with Opti-MEM prior to addition of the transfection mixture. Following transfection, cells were incubated with normal medium for 20–24 h and then incubated with medium containing no FBS for an additional 18–24 h prior to exposure to cyclic strain. 20–25% of cells are transfected using this procedure (45Yu C.F. Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G952-G966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myc Tag Monoclonal Antibody 9E10 Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously with slight modifications (44Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38040-38047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, Caco-2 cells cotransfected with FAK and ERK were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and protein was measured by BCA as above. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose was preblocked with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at"
https://openalex.org/W2082775188,"β-Barrel-shaped channels of the Omp85 family are involved in the translocation or assembly of proteins of bacterial, mitochondrial, and plastidic outer membranes. We have compared these proteins to understand the evolutionary development of the translocators. We have demonstrated that the proteins from proteobacteria and mitochondria have a pore diameter that is at least five times smaller than found for the Omp85 in cyanobacteria and plastids. This finding can explain why Omp85 from cyanobacteria (but not the homologous protein from proteobacteria) was remodeled to become the protein translocation pore after endosymbiosis. Further, the pore-forming region of the Omp85 proteins is restricted to the C terminus. Based on a phylogenetic analysis we have shown that the pore-forming domain displays a different evolutionary relationship than the N-terminal domain. In line with this, the affinity of the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal region of the Omp85 from plastids and cyanobacteria differs, even though the N-terminal domain is involved in gating of the pore in both groups. We have further shown that the N-terminal domain of nOmp85 takes part in homo-oligomerization. Thereby, the differences in the phylogeny of the two domains are explained by different functional constraints acting on the regions. The pore-forming domain, however, is further divided into two functional regions, where the distal C terminus itself forms a dimeric pore. Based on functional and phylogenetic analysis, we suggest an evolutionary scenario that explains the origin of the contemporary translocon. β-Barrel-shaped channels of the Omp85 family are involved in the translocation or assembly of proteins of bacterial, mitochondrial, and plastidic outer membranes.

Polypeptide transport and assembly of proteins into or across the outer membrane of endosymbiotic organelles or Gram-negative bacteria depend on β-barrel-shaped channels (1Voulhoux R. Tommassen J.

The PTBs are partitioned into two functional categories, namely in translocation of precursor proteins across the membrane and in the assembly of outer membrane proteins (3Schleiff E. Soll J. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, comparison between chloroplastic, mitochondrial, and bacterial Omp85 protein sequences revealed a high similarity of these PTBs (14Gentle I. Gabriel K. Beech P. Waller R. Lithgow T. J.

Recently, it was demonstrated that the C-terminal portion of both a bacterial and plastidic member of the PTBs forms the pore, whereas the N-terminal portion takes part in the recognition of substrates or complex assembly (Fig. 1A) (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This observation raised two important questions: (i) what is the functional and phylogenetic relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic PTBs and (ii) which evolutionary scenario may have led to the divergency resulting in proteins with different functions? Here, we present a detailed analysis of the domain assembly of PTBs, the electrophysiological characterization of the pore-forming region, and a phylogenetic analysis of functional domains and of the full sequences from eukaryotic and prokaryotic members of the Omp85 family. Based on our results, we propose an evolutionary scenario that explains the possible origin of the PTB Omp85 family. General—The generation of cDNA constructs encoding for regions of nOmp85 or psToc75 (Fig. 1A), their expression, purification, and subsequent antibody production has been described elsewhere (18Ertel F.

Cloning of YaeT and Sam50—The open reading frame coding for Drosophila melanogaster Sam50 was amplified from cDNA derived from Schneider cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL-1963) and cloned (BamHI-SmaI) into a derivative of the pQE80 vector (Qiagen) for recombinant expression in E. coli. The protein was subsequently expressed and purified as described for psToc75 and nOmp85 (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding the full-length YaeT was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of E. coli (XL1-Blue). The C-terminal truncated version of YaeT was produced by amplification of the DNA fragment corresponding to YaeT starting with the amino acid 473. Both DNA fragments were subsequently cloned into a derivative of the pRSET6d vector (Invitrogen) using the BamHI cloning site, placing the coding sequence under the control of the T7 promoter. The proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells were lysed by sonication, and inclusion bodies were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 revolutions/min. Inclusion bodies were washed with detergent-containing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% lauryl-(dimethyl)-amineoxide) and subsequently with a buffer without detergent (20 mm Tris, pH8.0, 100 mm NaCl).

The reaction was quenched after 30 min (4 °C) by the addition of 25 mm glycine or 20 mm dithiothreitol. Cross-linking products were immunodecorated with antibodies. Electrophysiological Measurements—Measurements were performed as described previously (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol.

To analyze the subconductances, the current distribution, at an indicated holding potential, was analyzed for a single channel, considering a time period of at least 2 s. The resulting distribution was analyzed by least square fits to one, two, three, or four gaussians for a nonfiltered (shown) or low pass-filtered data set (not shown).

The pellet was resuspended and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis.

PCC7120, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Pisum sativum as bait. The relevance of the BLAST result was confirmed by a reciprocal BLAST analysis. Sequences were aligned with the program MAFFT, version 5.664 (27Katoh K. Misawa K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (9696) Google Scholar). The resulting multiple sequence alignment of the Omp85 proteins contains 2399 sites. From this alignment, we extracted three subalignments, e.g. the 160-amino-acid C-terminal region (distal C terminus), the 350-amino-acid C-terminal region (C terminus), and the remaining N-terminal region (N terminus), with corresponding sequence lengths of 767, 1269, and 1130 aa, respectively. For each alignment, including the full alignment, the IQPNNI program (28Whelan S. Goldman N. Mol. Biol.

Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (25493) Google Scholar). That is, for each alignment, we sampled 1,000,000 trees according to a Markov chain. After a burn-in of 300,000 trees, we sampled every 100th iteration to ensure independence of successive trees. These 7,000 trees were used to build a consensus tree to obtain support values of the branches by means of posterior probabilities. Omp85 from Nostoc sp. PCC7120 Forms Oligomeric Complexes in Vitro and in Vivo—In Nostoc sp. PCC7120, three open reading frames encode for Omp85 PTBs. The ubiquitous Omp85 protein with 90 kDa is encoded by alr2269 (16Inoue K. Potter D. Plant J. 2004; 39: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Moslavac S. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Soll J.

Microbiol. 2004; 155: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we named the protein nOmp85 (n stands for Nostoc). The remaining reading frames encode two proteins with a molecular weight below 85 kDa and a yet unknown function. Similar to the observations for the proteobacterial Omp85 protein (11Wu T. Malinverni J. Ruiz N. Kim S. Silhavy T.J. Kahne D. Cell. 2005; 121: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 23Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J.

In line with this, a homodimerization of the N-terminal region was reported (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We subsequently investigated whether purified nOmp85 forms oligomeric complexes in vitro after reconstitution into artificial membranes. The addition of (chemical) cross-linker to the reconstituted protein revealed two cross-link products (Fig. 1C, lane 2, white and gray triangles), suggesting the presence of at least homotrimeric complexes. Interestingly, analyzing the pore-forming C terminus (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, nOmp85-C) by the same approach, only one stabilized assembly was obtained under any conditions tested. The cross-link product had a molecular weight that we expected for the dimeric complex (Fig. 1C, lane 4). The distal C-terminal sequence of nOmp85 (Fig. 1A, distal (D)) contains conserved regions and contributes the last eight membrane-inserted β-strands (6Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Moslavac S. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Soll J. Von Haeseler A. Schleiff E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain, however, facilitates the transport of sucrose or NaCl (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Analyzing the potential for complex formation of the distal C-terminal domain by cross-linking revealed a 60-kDa cross-linking product (Fig. 1C, lane 8), suggesting a tetrameric ensemble of the 15-kDa domain. This observation, on the one hand, confirms that the cross-linking time and cross-linker concentration was sufficient to stabilize assemblies larger than dimeric structures, an observation important for the interpretation of the results for nOmp85-C. On the other hand, this result suggests an oligomeric structure of the distal C terminus, which is expected, because the nOmp85-D transports large molecules (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which cannot be explained by a pore formed by 8-transmembrane β-strands (31Arora A. Abildgaard F. Bushweller J.H. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These results suggest that nOmp85 indeed forms larger complexes in native membranes, and this complex formation depends on the N-terminal domain. As far as we know, other protein components are not required for complex formation. However, it cannot be excluded that other proteins are involved in vivo to enhance the kinetics of the assembly or to stabilize the final complex. To further explore the influence of the N-terminal domain on oligomerization, the heterologous expressed N terminus (nOmp85-N) was added to liposomes containing nOmp85-C. Subsequent cross-linking experiments revealed products (Fig. 1C, lane 2 versus 6) not obtained while cross-linking nOmp85-C (Fig. 1C, lane 4)or nOmp85-N only (not shown). To confirm the complex formation between N- and C-terminal domains, liposomes containing nOmp85-C were incubated with the N-terminal construct, solubilized, and subjected to blue native-PAGE. Again, nOmp85-C and nOmp85-N co-migrated in a complex with an apparent molecular mass of 270 kDa (Fig. 1D, top). In the absence of the N-terminal domain, a migration of nOmp85-C at ∼100 kDa was observed (Fig. 1D, bottom), which agrees with a dimeric ensemble. To further support the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains, an analysis by in vitro binding of nOmp85-N to proteoliposomes carrying nOmp85-C (Fig. 1E, top) followed. A strong interaction of the N terminus to these liposomes (Fig. 1E, lanes 4–6) but not to “empty” liposomes (lane 2) was observed. Therefore, the N-terminal portion of nOmp85 has an affinity for the C-terminal portion of the protein. Thus, the formation of the homotrimeric structure of nOmp85 requires the interaction of the pore (C terminus) and the N terminus. Finally, the interaction of the N-terminal domain of PTB Toc75, located in chloroplasts, to its C-terminal portion was investigated. Strikingly, no interaction between these two domains was observed by blue native-PAGE, cross-linking (not shown) or liposome titration (Fig. 1E, bottom). Thus, the N-terminal domain of Toc75 has a drastically reduced affinity to its C terminus. This observation is surprising, because it was suggested that Omp85 from Nostoc sp. PCC7120 and Toc75 is homologous and traceable back to a common ancestor (17Moslavac S. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Soll J. Von Haeseler A. Schleiff E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Channel Properties of nOmp85—The results obtained so far suggest an influence of the N terminus on the complex formation of the PTB. To explore an influence of the interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains on channel properties, the electrophysiological activity of the C-terminal pore-forming domain (nOmp85-C) was analyzed both in the absence and presence of nOmp85-N. The pore-forming region of the Nostoc PTB exhibits no subconductance states, and the current is very stable both in the open and closed state (Fig. 2A, left). At 100 mV, the open state has a current of ∼57 pA. After the addition of nOmp85-N, the current trace of nOmp85-C becomes very active (Fig. 2B, left). This activation is specific, because the addition of similar amounts of nOmp85-N to membranes containing psToc75-C did not alter the current profile (not shown). Therefore, the observed activity reflects the influence of the N terminus on the pore properties. Similarly active current traces were obtained for the full-length protein (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the electrophysiological results corroborate the tight interaction of the N- and C-terminal portions as shown (Fig. 1). In-depth analysis of the current distribution of nOmp85-C after the addition of nOmp85-N reveals three prominent opened states at 31, 42, and 58 pA (Fig. 2B, right), irrespective of whether non-filtered (Fig. 2B, right) or low pass-filtered data (not shown) were analyzed. The open state with a current of 58 pA is rather broad and does not contribute substantially to the observed distribution, even though this was the only current obtained for nOmp85-C (Fig. 2A, right). The detailed analysis of the full-length protein nOmp85 also revealed three open states and exhibits a similar distribution as in Fig. 2B. The voltage-current relationship (Fig. 3B) of the open states of nOmp85 is linear. The conductances are calculated as 640, 520, and 430 pS, where the main conductance (520 pS) corresponds to the value previously reported for nOmp85, where one open state was assumed (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the largest conductance (640 pS) was the state observed for nOmp85-C, suggesting that the other conductances of nOmp85 (520 and 430 pS) are induced by conformational changes due to the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains. The ability of the distal C terminus of nOmp85 and psToc75 (Fig. 1, construct D) to transport sucrose or NaCl has been previously reported (18Ertel F. Mirus O. Bredemeier R. Moslavac S. Becker T. Schleiff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28281-28289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To support this observation, the electrophysiological properties of the distal C terminus were examined. The distal C-terminal portion of nOmp85 containing eight β-strands showed a reverse potential of 39 mV, suggesting a cationic selectivity (nOmp85-D) (Fig. 3C) and a main conductance of ∼470 pS (not shown). This conductance can be explained by a pore formed from two distal C-terminal monomers, because the conductance of the entire C-terminal portion or the full-length protein containing 16 β-strands is in a similar range (Table 1) (18Ertel F.

https://openalex.org/W2030751354,"Recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 initiates an intracellular signaling pathway leading to the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Although LPS-induced activation of NF-κB is critical to the induction of an efficient immune response, excessive or prolonged signaling from TLR4 can be harmful to the host. Therefore, the NF-κB signal transduction pathway demands tight regulation. In the present study, we describe the human protein Listeria INDuced (LIND) as a novel A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB activation (ABIN) that is related to ABIN-1 and -2 and, therefore, is further referred to as ABIN-3. Similar to the other ABINs, ABIN-3 binds to A20 and inhibits NF-κB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. However, unlike the other ABINs, constitutive expression of ABIN-3 could not be detected in different human cells. Treatment of human monocytic cells with LPS strongly induced ABIN-3 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting a role for ABIN-3 in the LPS/TLR4 pathway. Indeed, ABIN-3 overexpression was found to inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to LPS/TLR4 at a level downstream of TRAF6 and upstream of IKKβ. NF-κB inhibition was mediated by the ABIN-homology domain 2 and was independent of A20 binding. Moreover, in vivo adenoviral gene transfer of ABIN-3 in mice reduced LPS-induced NF-κB activity in the liver, thereby partially protecting mice against LPS/d-(+)-galactosamine-inducedmortality. Taken together, these results implicate ABIN-3 as a novel negative feedback regulator of LPS-induced NF-κB activation.

Janeway Jr., C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an integral cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria and one of the most potent stimulators in innate immunity, is recognized by the TLR4-MD2 receptor complex (2Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). In the past years, much progress has been made in understanding the intracellular signaling cascades that are initiated when LPS stimulates TLR4 (reviewed in Refs. 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar and 4Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Golenbock D.T. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Ligation of the TLR4-MD2 complex by LPS initially results in the recruitment of myeloid differentiation factor (MyD)88 and MyD88-adaptor like (Mal), also called TIRAP, to the receptor cytoplasmic domain. MyD88 then facilitates recruitment of the serine/threonine kinases IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and -4, thus enabling IRAK4 to phosphorylate IRAK1. The latter subsequently dissociates from the receptor complex and associates with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6, constituting a cytoplasmic signaling complex. Upon ubiquitination, TRAF6 activates transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1, which in turn activates the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex that consists of the regulatory subunit IKKγ (also known as NEMO) and the kinases IKKα and IKKβ. The latter eventually phosphorylates the inhibitory IκB proteins, resulting in their ubiquitination and degradation. This allows the transcription factor NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, which contribute to mounting an inflammatory response. Apart from this MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, TLR4 also initiates a MyD88-independent signaling pathway that is mediated by the adaptor proteins Toll/IL-1 receptor domain domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF; also known as TICAM-1) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (also known as TICAM-2). Although the TRIF/TRIF-related adaptor molecule pathway may contribute to delayed NF-κB activation, it is mainly responsible for interferon regulatory factor 3 transcription factor activation via IKKϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1. Although the LPS-induced inflammatory response is indispensable for controlling the growth of pathogenic microorganisms (5O'Neill L.A. Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 206-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), excessive cytokine production can be harmful to the host and may even contribute to a life-threatening condition termed septic shock (6Danner R.L. Elin R.J. Hosseini J.M. Wesley R.A. Reilly J.M. Parillo J.E. Chest. 1991; 99: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition, TLR4-initiated signaling pathways have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. For instance, activation of TLR4 has been shown to contribute to experimental models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, asthma, and atherosclerosis (7Kerfoot S.M. Long E.M. Hickey M.J. Andonegui G. Lapointe B.M. Zanardo R.C. Bonder C. James W.G. Robbins S.M. Kubes P. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7070-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Eisenbarth S.C. Piggott D.A. Huleatt J.W.

Res. 2004; 95: e96-e97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This universal and inherently dangerous role of TLR4 in inflammation emphasizes the need for tight regulation of TLR4-initiated signaling pathways. As such, it is not surprising that the host acquired several proteins that can hold LPS-induced NF-κB activation in check (reviewed in Ref. 10Liew F.Y. Xu D. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). One of these negative feedback regulators is the zinc finger protein A20. This protein was originally identified as an inhibitor of TNF-induced NF-κB activation, because mice with a functional deletion of the A20 gene die prematurely due to unrestrained TNF-induced inflammation (11Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). However, the observation that mice doubly deficient in both A20 and TNF (or TNF receptor-1) developed spontaneous inflammation, similar to mice deficient in A20 alone, suggested that A20 also has a negative role in LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Indeed, A20-deficient macrophages show a prolonged NF-κB response to LPS, and reconstitution experiments with these cells in mice showed that A20 is required for preventing endotoxic shock, pointing to A20 as an important down-regulator of pro-inflammatory signals initiated by LPS (12Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T. Tsui C. Hurley P. Chien M. Chai S. Hitotsumatsu O. McNally E. Pickart C. Ma A. Nat.

In the present study, we identify Listeria INDuced (LIND), a protein that is induced in human mononuclear phagocytes by Listeria infection (13Staege H. Brauchlin A. Schoedon G. Schaffner A. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as a novel LPS-inducible A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB activation. As LIND was found to share sequence as well as functional homology with two previously identified A20-binding inhibitors of NF-κB, ABIN-1, and ABIN-2 (14Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W.

Interestingly, ABIN-3 expression was inducible by LPS in the monocytic cell line THP-1 as well as in primary human monocytes. Moreover, because ABIN-3 could inhibit LPS-induced activation of NF-κB in vitro as well as in vivo, our results identify ABIN-3 as a novel player in the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB activation in response to LPS.

The murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinant human TNF and recombinant murine IL-1β were produced in Escherichia coli in our laboratory and were purified to at least 99% homogeneity. TNF had a specific biological activity of 2.3 × 107 IU/mg of purified protein, as determined with the international standard code 87/650 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK). IL-1β had a specific activity of 3.65 × 108 IU/mg of purified protein, as determined with the international standard code 93/668. LPS from Salmonella abortus equi was obtained from Sigma. Cloning of ABIN-3—TBLASTN searches with the region of homology between ABIN-1 and ABIN-2 were conducted using the NCBI online service, in the non-redundant and expressed sequence tag data base. A “full insert sequence” of a clone of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (accession number AK024815) was identified as a potential homologue. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed on HeLa mRNA, using the SMART RACE kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo alto, CA) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Primers for first round and nested PCR were 5′-cgttccttttccttctcctcccgctgca-3′ and 5′-ctctgcctctgatgcggatccttctccc-3′, respectively. Full-length cDNA was amplified using forward (5′-ggagatctgcggccgctatggcacattttgtacaagg-3′) and reverse (5′-gagatctctacggatggactttctttactgagg-3′) primers. The open reading frame of ABIN-3 was cloned in-frame with an N-terminal E tag into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. The cloned fragment was sequenced on both strands with a cycle sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Deletion mutants were generated by PCR and cloned in pCAGGS using the following primers: 5′-tgcgaacaaggaaaagatcaagtgttcattttccgagg-3′ and 5′-gaaaatgaacacttgatcttttccttgttcgcaagag-3′ for ABIN-3 ΔAHD1 and 5′-gaacagaaatggaagttcttaatcaagagaaagaggagc-3′ and 5′-tctttctcttgattaagaacttccatttctgttctcatc-3′ for ABIN-3 ΔAHD2. Plasmids and Adenoviruses—Plasmids coding for GFP and FLAG-tagged A20 have been described previously (16Heyninck K. Denecker G. De Valck D. Fiers W. Beyaert R.

Tschopp (Institute of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Switzerland) (19Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1986; 44: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), encoding the luciferase (Luc) gene driven by a minimal NF-κB-responsive promoter, was a gift from Dr. A. Israël (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The plasmid pUT651, encoding β-galactosidase, was supplied by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). For the production of a recombinant ABIN-3 adenovirus, the ABIN-3 cDNA, N-terminally fused to an E tag, was cloned into the pACpLpA.CMV shuttle vector and cotransfected with the rescue plasmid pJM17 (which encodes the adenovirus dl309 genome, lacking E1 and E3 functions) into HEK293 cells using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (22McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Recombinant plaques were isolated and expression of ABIN-3 from the ubiquitously active cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was confirmed by Western blotting. Control viruses without transgene (AdRR5) or expressing the β-galactosidase gene (AdLacZ) were generated with the same pJM17 adenoviral backbone vector. A virus expressing an NF-κB luciferase reporter gene (AdNFκBLuc) (23Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray Jr., P.B. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F.

High titer virus stocks were prepared in HEK293 cells and purified by single CsCl banding. Titers were determined by plaque assay in HEK293 cells and calculated as plaque forming units (pfu) per milliliter of virus stock. Isolation and Culture of Primary Monocytes—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from fresh blood samples of healthy donors drawn on citrate/phosphate/dextrose (Etablissement Français du Sang, Paris, France). Blood was diluted 1:2 in RPMI 1640 Glutamax medium (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) and centrifuged over Ficoll (MSL, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) for 20 min at 15 °C and 600 × g. Human monocytes were selected from PBMCs by adherence. PBMCs were plated at 6 × 106 cells/ml and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 air incubator in a humidified atmosphere. Non-adherent cells were removed; adherent cells were washed with RPMI and cultured in RPMI supplemented with antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin) and 0.2% normal human serum (BioWhittaker). Monocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS from S. abortus equi (Alexis, San Diego, CA). Transfection, Coimmunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—2 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected with a total of 5 μg of DNA per plate using the DNA calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, as described (24O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed with a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), and immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-trisacryl beads (Pierce). Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and again twice with lysis buffer. Binding proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Detection of co-precipitating and transfected proteins was achieved with a monoclonal anti-E tag (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-FLAG tag (Sigma) antibody, each of which was coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was revealed with a Renaissance-enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reporter Gene Assays for NF-κB—2 × 105 HEK293T cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by DNA calcium phosphate coprecipitation with a total of 1 μg of DNA. The DNA mixture comprised 100 ng of pUT651, 100 ng of pNFconluc, and 800 ng of specific expression plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Another 24 h later, cells were left untreated or were stimulated with TNF (1000 IU/ml), IL-1β (40 ng/ml), or TPA (200 ng/ml) for 6 h. For RAW264.7 cells, 5 × 105 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 250 ng of an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid and 100 ng of a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, together with 250 ng of specific expression plasmids. After 6 h, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 3 h. In all of the above cases, cells were lysed after stimulation in 200 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-cyclohexaminediaminetetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). After addition of substrate buffer to a final concentration of 470 μm luciferin, 270 μm coenzyme A, and 530 μm ATP, luciferase (Luc) activity was measured in a Topcount microplate scintillation reader (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) or the Galactostar reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems). Luc values were normalized for β-galactosidase values to correct for differences in transfection efficiency (plotted as Luc/β-galactosidase). To determine NF-κB activation induced by overexpression of specific signaling proteins, 4 × 104 HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with 20 ng of pUT651, 20 ng of pNFconluc, and a total of 160 ng of specific expression plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and analyzed as described above. For in vivo NF-κB analysis by luciferase reporter gene assay, mice were infected with a total of 5 × 109 pfu adenoviruses, comprising 25% AdNFκBLuc, 25% AdLacZ, and 50% AdRR5 or AdABIN-3. Three days after infection, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 ng of LPS or vehicle. After 4 h, mice were killed, liver homogenates were made, and NF-κB promoter activity was determined by measuring luciferase (Luc) activity in tissue extracts as described above. Luc values were normalized for β-galactosidase values to correct for differences in infection efficiency (plotted as Luc/β-galactosidase). IL-8 Determination—IL-8 levels in cell supernatants were determined via specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ABIN-3 mRNA and Protein Expression Analysis—For multiple tissue RT-PCR, a human “Rapid Scan cDNA panel” was purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). PCR was performed with gene-specific primers (5′-actggacgccgcggaaagat-3′ and 5′-tggcggaagctggtcaagag-3′) that amplify a 691-bp fragment of the ABIN-3 open reading frame. For RT-PCR on THP-1 monocytes, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes and allowed to grow for 48 h. At the end of this period the cells were either left untreated or stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or TNF (1000 IU/ml). TotalRNAofTHP-1cellswasisolated by the guanidium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and first strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR on PBMC, total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II RNase H (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA samples were amplified by PCR with gene-specific primers (5′-ggagatctgcggccgctatggcacattttgtacaagg-3′ and 5′-ggagatctctacggatggactttctttactgagg-3′) that amplify the complete open reading frame of ABIN-3. As a control for cDNA integrity, either RT-PCR for a β-actin fragment was performed using 5′-gaactttgggggatgctcgc-3′ and 5′-tggtgggcatgggtcagaag-3′ primers, or RT-PCR for GAPDH was performed using 5′-tgaaggtcggagtcaacggatttggt-3′ and 5′-catgtgggccatgaggtccaccac-3′ primers. For ABIN-3 protein expression analysis in THP-1 monocytes, 7 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm Petri dishes and were either left untreated or stimulated with LPS (1μg/ml) or TNF (1000 IU/ml) for various time periods. Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal ABIN-3 antibody raised against an ABIN-3-specific peptide (NH2-CDVQHKANGLSSVKKVHP-COOH) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For real-time quantitative PCR, total RNA of PBMC was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II RNase H (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression levels of ABIN-3 and GAPDH were determined by real-time quantitative PCR, using a LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). Forward and reverse primers for human ABIN-3 were, respectively, 5′-caaaggaaaaggaacattac-3′ and 5′-tgctgtagctcctctttctc-3′. Primers for GAPDH were the RT2 PCR primer set from SuperArray (Frederick, MD). The cDNA copy number of each gene was determined using a six-point standard curve. Standard curves were run with each set of samples, the correlation coefficients (r2) for the standard curves being >0.98. All results were normalized with respect to the expression of GAPDH. To confirm the specificity of the PCR products, the melting profile of each sample was determined using the LightCycler, and by heating the samples from 60 °C to 95 °C at a linear rate of 0.10 °C/s while measuring the fluorescence emitted. Analysis of the melting curve demonstrated that each pair of primers amplified a single product. In all cases, the PCR products were checked for size by agarose gel separation and ethidium bromide staining to confirm that a single product of the predicted size was amplified. For ABIN-3, each run consisted of an initial denaturation time of 5 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 8 s, 56 °C for 8 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. For GAPDH, the run consisted of 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 25 s. Animal Treatment Protocols—Female C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfield, Germany). All animals were maintained under standard specific pathogen-free conditions and received humane care in concordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and with the legal requirements in Belgium. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee. For adenovirus infection, mice were intravenously injected with a total of 5 × 109 pfu of virus diluted in pyrogen-free phosphate-buffered saline. In preliminary experiments, we found that adenoviral transgene expression in the liver is maximal 3 days after infection. Therefore, mice were challenged with LPS/GalN 3 days after infection. In the LPS/GalN-induced model of acute lethal hepatitis, mice were injected intraperitoneal with 200 ng of LPS in combination with 20 mg of GalN (Sigma), corresponding to the LD100 determined in preliminary studies. Statistics—All data represent at least three independent experiments and are expressed as mean values ± S.D. Survival curve was compared using a log rank χ2 test, and the level of probability was noted (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and *** p < 0.0001). Identification of LIND as an ABIN—The protein sequences of the A20-binding inhibitors of NF-κB ABIN-1 and ABIN-2 show significant homology over a region of ∼70 amino acids. It is in this region that the previously described ABIN homology domain 1 (AHD1) and AHD2 are located (26Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Using this homologous region in BLAST searches, we identified LIND, a protein that is induced in human mononuclear phagocytes infected with Listeria (13Staege H. Brauchlin A. Schoedon G. Schaffner A. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as a potential ABIN protein. Comparison of the full-length protein sequence of LIND with the sequences of ABIN-1 and ABIN-2 revealed that LIND was much more homologous to ABIN-1 than to ABIN-2. Besides the AHD1 and AHD2 regions of homology, LIND and ABIN-1 also share a third region of strong homology, indicated as AHD3, which is not present in ABIN-2 (Fig. 1). Because of this strong sequence homology with ABIN-1 and ABIN-2, we will henceforth refer to LIND as ABIN-3 (=TNIP3). To test if ABIN-3, besides sequence homology, also shows functional homology with ABIN-1 and ABIN-2, we investigated whether ABIN-3 could interact with the zinc finger protein A20. Therefore, expression plasmids for E-tagged ABIN-3 and FLAG-tagged A20 were cotransfected in HEK293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG tag antibody. Immunoblotting with anti-E tag revealed that ABIN-3 indeed coimmunoprecipitated with A20, indicating that both proteins can associate with each other in mammalian cells (Fig. 2A). In addition to interacting with A20, ABIN-1 and ABIN-2 are also characterized by the ability to inhibit the activation of NF-κB in response to TNF, IL-1β, and TPA (14Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Van Huffel S. Delaei F. Heyninck K. De Valck D. Beyaert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30216-30223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test if ABIN-3 shares this NF-κB inhibiting activity, we coexpressed ABIN-3 with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene in HEK293T cells. The effects of the NF-κB inhibitor A20 and the irrelevant protein GFP were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. ABIN-3 was indeed able to inhibit NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression induced by TNF, IL-1β, or TPA (Fig. 2B). Taken together, this strong sequence and functional homology with ABIN-1 and ABIN-2 identifies LIND as a novel A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB activation, named ABIN-3. ABIN-3 Is an LPS-inducible Protein—Tissue distribution of ABIN-3 mRNA was investigated by PCR amplification of a cDNA panel containing first strand cDNA samples from 24 different human tissues. No ABIN-3 mRNA could be detected in heart, salivary gland, adrenal gland, pancreas, ovary, or fetal brain. High levels of ABIN-3 mRNA were detected in most of the other tissues, except for kidney and bone marrow, both of which showed only a low expression level of ABIN-3 mRNA (Fig. 3A). We subsequently analyzed ABIN-3 mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from various human cell lines such as THP-1, HEK293, and HepG2. Constitutive expression of ABIN-3 mRNA could not be detected in any of the cell lines (data not shown). However, a clear induction of ABIN-3 mRNA could be observed in THP-1 monocytes after stimulation for 3 h with LPS ("
https://openalex.org/W2073571981,"Based on solid-phase binding assays with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection, previous investigators suggested that intracellular carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) interacts at high affinity with the C-terminal (Ct) domains of SLC4 bicarbonate-transport proteins, expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, to form functional HCO3- metabolons. Here we re-evaluated this protein-protein interaction using two solid-phase binding assays. We first compared the ability of the Ct domain of three SLC4 transporters, SLC4-A1 (AE1), SLC4-A4 (NBCe1), and SLC4-A8 (NDCBE), to bind immobilized CA II, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection. We found that when expressed as GST fusion proteins, all three bind to CA II (Kd 300-600 nm) better than does pure GST. However, we detected no binding of pure SLC4-Ct peptides to immobilized CA II. Second, we reversed assay orientation by immobilizing the SLC4-Ct fusion proteins or peptides. We found that more CA II binds to GST than to any of the three GST-SLC4-Ct fusion proteins. Furthermore, we detected no binding of CA II to any of the immobilized pure SLC4-Ct peptides. Finally, we used surface plasmon resonance to detect possible rapid interactions between CA II and the pure peptides. Although we detected acetazolamide binding to immobilized CA II and specific antibodies binding to immobilized SLC4-Ct peptides, we detected no binding of CA II to immobilized SLC4-Ct or vice versa. Thus, although an HCO3 metabolon may exist, CA II cannot bind directly to pure SLC4-Ct peptides and can bind to GST-SLC4-Ct fusion proteins only when the CA II is immobilized and the fusion protein is soluble, and not vice versa.

The transport of acid and base equivalents across cell membranes is important for virtually all cells and, in addition, is critical for the physiology of certain epithelia. One of the most important families of acid-base transporters is the solute carrier 4 (SLC4) 2The abbreviations used are: SLC, solute carrier; AE, anion exchanger; NBCe1, electrogenic Na/ HCO3- cotransporter; NDCBE, Na+-driven Cl- HCO3- exchanger; NBCn1, electroneutral Na/ HCO3- cotransporter; pHi, intracellular pH; TM, transmembrane; Ct, C-terminal; CA, carbonic anhydrase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PPS, PreScission protease cleavage site; PP, PreScission Protease; DTT, dithiothreitol; APB, acidic phosphate buffer; rIB, reducing incubation buffer; IB, incubation buffer; RU, response units; ACZ, acetazolamide; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; EP, EDTA/surfactant P20; NHE, Na-H exchanger; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. family of HCO3- (or, perhaps in some cases, CO32-) transport proteins. In humans, this family is composed of 10 members, among which are the proteins that perform Na+-independent Cl- HCO3- exchange (e.g. AEs 1-3), Na+-coupled anion exchange (e.g. NDCBE), and electroneutral (e.g. NBCn1) and electrogenic (e.g. NBCe1 and NBCe2) Na/HCO3 cotransport (1Romero M.F. Fulton C.M. Boron W.F. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These proteins are important for the regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) and play crucial roles in the epithelial absorption of HCO3- (e.g. in the renal proximal tubule) and secretion of HCO3- (e.g. in the pancreatic duct). All SLC4 proteins are hypothesized to share a similar topology in the cell membrane, i.e. these proteins have relatively long cytoplasmic N-terminal domains composed of a few hundred to several hundred residues, followed by 10-14 transmembrane (TM) domains (connected by endo- and exofacial loops), and end with relatively short cytoplasmic C-terminal (Ct) domains composed of ∼30 to ∼90 residues. Although the Ct domain comprises a small percentage of the size of the protein, this domain in some cases (i) has PSD-95/Discs Large/ZO-1-binding motifs (2Cowan C.A. Yokoyama N. Bianchi L.M.

It has been hypothesized that this complex forms an HCO3- transport metabolon, in which CA II enhances the function of an SLC4 transporter by directly providing it with substrate (i.e. HCO3-). However, a recent study from our laboratory indicates that CA II does not increase the electrical current carried by NBCe1 (14Lu J. Daly C.M. Parker M.D. Gill H.S. Piermarini P.M. Pelletier M.F.

Physiol. 2004; 286: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Supporting evidence also includes recombinant NBCe1-Ct peptides that, under nonreducing conditions, are reported to interact with the following: (i) soluble CA II, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (10Gross E. Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Fedotoff O. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 679-685Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and (ii) an immobilized GST-CA II fusion protein, as measured by pulldown assays (11Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Gross E. Newman D. Tatishchev S. Lee I. Fedotoff O. Bondar G. Azimov R. Ngyuen M. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 55-65Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Truncation and/or mutagenesis experiments suggest that a CA II-binding motif in the SLC4-Ct domains is composed of a hydrophobic leucine residue followed by at least two acidic residues (shown in boldface) in the next four (e.g. 886LDADD in AE1). The proposed CA II-binding motif is found in the proximal portion of the Ct domain (∼10-14 residues after the last TM domain) and is conserved among most SLC4 transporters. In the Ct domains of some SLC4 members (e.g. NBCe1, NBCn1, and NDCBE), a more distal, putative CA II-binding motif also exists (see Fig. 1). However, data on the importance of this second motif are conflicting (see Refs. 11Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Gross E. Newman D. Tatishchev S. Lee I. Fedotoff O. Bondar G. Azimov R. Ngyuen M. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 55-65Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 13Loiselle F.B. Morgan P.E. Alvarez B.V. Casey J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As far as the target site on CA II is concerned, truncation and mutagenesis studies (9Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggest that the aspartate residues of the AE1-Ct (886LDADD) interact ionically with positively charged residues (His and Lys) within the first 17 amino acids of CA II. The affinity of SLC4-Ct proteins for CA II remains unclear. The initial estimates of the apparent affinity of GST-AE1-Ct for immobilized CA II were a half-maximal binding (K½) of 20 nm (7Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, a later study showed that a synthetic AE1-Ct peptide, with Cys885 replaced by Ala885, prevented binding of GST-AE1-Ct to immobilized CA II with a K½ of 100 μm (9Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and a further analysis suggested that the true affinity could be as high as 300 μm (15Reithmeier R.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The authors hypothesized that this apparent discrepancy between the K½ values of GST-AE1-Ct and pure AE1-Ct peptides occurs because (i) the pure peptide is not sufficiently well structured to interact stably with CA II, and/or (ii) GST dimerization enhances the avidity of the interaction of GST-AE1-Ct with CA II by a “two-point attachment” (8Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a soluble pure NBCe1-Ct peptide is reported to interact with soluble CA II (assayed by isothermal titration calorimetry) with a Kd of 160 nm (10Gross E. Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Fedotoff O. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 679-685Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the aforementioned pulldown assays with pure NBCe1-Ct peptides and immobilized GST-CA II are consistent with a high affinity interaction (11Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Gross E. Newman D. Tatishchev S. Lee I. Fedotoff O. Bondar G. Azimov R. Ngyuen M. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 55-65Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to extend the previous work of others by examining the binding of pure SLC4-Ct peptides (rather than GST fusion proteins) to immobilized CA II and vice versa. Our initial approach was to use the solid-phase binding assay with ELISA detection. First, we compare the ability of the Ct of three SLC4 members, SLC4-A1 (AE1), SLC4-A4 (NBCe1), and SLC4-A8 (NDCBE), to bind to immobilized CA II. When the SLC4-Ct is part of a GST fusion protein, we find that all three GST-SLC4-Ct constructs bind to immobilized CA II with a relatively high affinity, consistent with previous results on AE1 and NBCn1. However, when we work with a pure SLC4-Ct (i.e. after removing GST), we are unable to detect binding of any of the three SLC4-Ct constructs to immobilized CA II. Second, we repeat the first two sets of studies after reversing the orientation of the proteins to the more physiological one in which the SLC4-Ct is immobilized and the CA II is soluble. We find that soluble CA II fails to bind to immobilized SLC4-Ct domains, whether or not they are fused to GST. Finally, we use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect possible rapid interactions. Regardless of whether CA II or an SLC4-Ct peptide is immobilized, we detect no interaction between CA II and any of the peptides. We conclude that pure SLC4-Ct domains do not directly bind to CA II. Although we cannot rule out the existence of an HCO3 metabolon, if an interaction between CA II and SLC4-Ct domains occurs in vivo, at least one of the following must be true: 1) the intact SLC4 protein imposes a unique structure on the SLC4-Ct, enabling it to bind CA II; 2) an intermediary protein mediates the interaction; or 3) the CA II binds to another part of the SLC4 protein. The human CA II used in this study was identical to that used by our laboratory in a previous study (14Lu J. Daly C.M. Parker M.D. Gill H.S. Piermarini P.M. Pelletier M.F. Boron W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19241-19250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, we expressed a pet31F1 vector, modified to encode for human CA II (generously provided by Dr. David N. Silverman, University of Florida), in Rosetta 2 BL21 Escherichia coli (Novagen, Madison, WI), using an approach similar to that described by others (16Tanhauser S.M. Jewell D.A. Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Laipis P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To isolate and purify CA II from the E. coli, we used a p-aminomethylbenzenesulfonamide-linked agarose resin (Sigma) and followed a protocol similar to that of Whitney (17Whitney P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We further purified CA II by gel filtration chromatography (AKTA FPLC; GE Healthcare) using a Superdex 75 HR 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in FPLC buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA), pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (American Bioanalytical). This product, as well as GST and all of the SLC4-related products described later, was collected as single sharp peaks, implying that the products were homogeneous and folded. The CA II protein concentration was determined assuming a molar absorptivity at 280 nm of 5.5 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (18Elder I. Han S.F. Tu C.K. Steele H. Laipis P.J. Viola R.E. Silverman D.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 421: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We assessed CA II purity by denaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and we verified CO2 hydration activity using a colorimetric technique (19Brion L.P. Schwartz J.H. Zavilowitz B.J. Schwartz G.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we verified the identity of CA II using matrixassisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (SynPep Corp., Dublin, CA), and 5-7 cycles of Edman N-terminal sequencing (W. M. Keck Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility). Finally, we added glycerol to a concentration of 5% and divided the CA II into aliquots, which we froze on dry ice and stored at -80 °C. GST Fusion Proteins—We generated four different cDNA constructs, encoding GST, GST-AE1-Ct, GST-NBCe1-Ct, and GST-NDCBE-Ct, derived from a pGEX-5X-1 bacterial expression vector (GE Healthcare) that encodes GST from the trematode S. japonicum, followed by a factor Xa protease site (IEGR; Fig. 1, A-D) plus 15 residues (GI...in Fig. 1, A-D) that correspond to the multiple cloning site. Previous groups used this vector to generate GST-AE1-Ct and GST-AE2-Ct for use in binding assays (7Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To generate our control GST (GST-IEGRGI in Fig. 1A), we used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to mutate “CCC” (proline) in the seventh codon following GST to “TAA” (stop codon). To generate GST-AE1-Ct (Fig. 1B), we used PCR to amplify a portion of cDNA (generously provided by Dr. Seth Alper, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA) that encodes Ct residues Arg879 to Val911 of human erythrocyte AE1 and to insert 5′ and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. We digested the PCR product with BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), purified it with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated (T4 DNA ligase; New England Biolabs) the purified product into a linearized (with BamHI) pGEX-5X-1 expression vector. We then used QuikChange to delete the CCC codon (proline) to ensure that GST-AE1-Ct differed from the control GST only by containing residues corresponding to the AE1-Ct. Using the strategy described above, we generated expression vectors for GST-NBCe1-Ct (Fig. 1C, amplifying Ser951 to Cys1035 of human NBCe1-A) and GST-NDCBE-Ct (Fig. 1D, amplifying Ser966 to Thr1044 of human NDCBE). In addition, we generated a second version of GST-NDCBE-Ct in which we used QuikChange to add six histidine residues (His6) immediately after Thr1044: GST-NDCBE-Ct{His6}. Note that for any of the ligations or QuikChange mutagenesis reactions mentioned above and below, the W. M. Keck DNA Sequencing Center (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) sequenced the ligated or mutated region in both the 5′ and 3′ directions. Pure SLC4-Ct Peptides—We generated four additional cDNA constructs, derived from a pGEX-6X-1 bacterial expression vector (GE Healthcare), which is similar to pGEX-5X-1, except that a PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) cleavage site (PPS) replaced the factor Xa site. The PreScission protease (PP) enzyme is a fusion protein of human rhinovirus type 14 3C protease and GST. We generated cDNA constructs encoding GST-PPS-SLC4-Ct fusion proteins, so that treatment with PP enzyme allowed us to isolate the SLC4-Ct peptide from GST, a strategy used by others to generate pure NBCn1-Ct peptides (20Loiselle F.B. Jaschke P. Casey J.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To generate cDNA constructs for GST-PPS-AE1-Ct, GST-PPS-NBCe1-Ct, and GST-PPS-NDCBE-Ct, we used an approach similar to that described above for pGEX-5X-1 constructs, except we ligated BamHI-digested PCR products into a pGEX-6X-1 vector linearized with BamHI. Afterward, we deleted codons “CTG” (leucine), “GGA” (glycine), and “TCC” (serine) immediately after the PPS, ensuring that our SLC4-Ct peptides would contain only two non-SLC4-Ct residues (Gly and Pro, required by PP) (Fig. 1, E-G). Additionally, we used QuikChange to generate a His6 version of each GST-PPS-SLC4-Ct fusion protein, GST-PPS-SLC4-Ct{His6}. We generated the five pGEX-5X-1 and six pGEX-6X-1 fusion proteins using a technique similar to that described for CA II. Both sets of fusion proteins were isolated using GST·Bind resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol under reducing conditions (1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT); American Bioanalytical) in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) containing protease inhibitors (Complete tablets without EDTA, Roche Applied Science; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, American Bioanalytical). From this point, the pGEX-5X-1-based and pGEX-6X-1-based fusion proteins were treated differently, as described below. pGEX-5X-1 Fusion Proteins—To elute GST fusion proteins, we washed the resin with a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (American Bioanalytical), pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione (Calbiochem), and 1 mm DTT. We further purified the GST fusion proteins by gel filtration chromatography as described for CA II, using a Superdex 75 HR 16/60 column (for GST, GST-AE1-Ct, GST-NDCBE-Ct, and GST-NDCBE-Ct{His6}), or a Superdex 200 GL 10/300 column (GE Healthcare; for GST-NBCe1-Ct), equilibrated in a reducing (1 mm DTT) FPLC buffer. We assessed purity by denaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. We estimated the concentrations of the GST fusion proteins from the computed (21Gill S.C. Vonhippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) molar absorptivity at 280 nm for GST (4.1 × 104 m-1 cm-1), GST-AE1-Ct (4.2 × 104 m-1 cm-1), GST-NBCe1-Ct (4.2 × 104 m-1 cm-1), GST-NDCBE-Ct (4.9 × 104 m-1 cm-1), and GST-NDCBE-Ct{His6} (4.9 × 104 m-1 cm-1), and we verified concentrations with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). We stored the material as described for CA II. pGEX-6X-1 Pure SLC4-Ct Peptides—Instead of eluting the GST-PPS-SLC4-Ct fusion proteins, we washed the resin with a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA (American Bioanalytical). We then digested the SLC4-Ct from immobilized GST-PPS-SLC4-Ct with PP enzyme (50 units/ml; GE Healthcare) for 16-24 h at 4 °C until no intact GST-PPS-SLC4-Ct was visible by denaturing PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. After separating the resin from the PP digest (which contained the pure SLC4-Ct peptide), we further purified the pure SLC4-Ct by gel filtration chromatography as described above, using a Superdex 30 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) for AE1-Ct, AE1-Ct{His6}, NDCBE-Ct, and NDCBE-Ct{His6} or a Superdex 75 16/60 column for NBCe1-Ct and NBCe1-Ct{His6}, equilibrated in a reducing FPLC buffer. We estimated the concentrations of the SLC4-Ct peptides from the computed (21Gill S.C. Vonhippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) molar absorptivity at 280 nm for AE1-Ct peptides (1.3 × 103 m-1 cm-1), NBCe1-Ct peptides (1.3 × 103 m-1 cm-1), and NDCBE-Ct peptides (8.25 × 103 m-1 cm-1), and we verified the concentrations by amino acid analysis (W. M. Keck Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility, Yale University School of Medicine). We assessed the purity of the peptides with denaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and we verified the peptide identity by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (SynPep Corporation, Dublin, CA) and electrospray (W. M. Keck Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility) mass spectrometry and 5-7 cycles of Edman N-terminal sequencing (W. M. Keck Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility). We stored the material as described for CA II. Binding of GST-SLC4-Ct to Immobilized CA II—Our assay was very similar to those previously reported (7Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.

We immobilized 200 ng of purified CA II to the bottoms of 48 wells of a 96-well polystyrene High Bind microtiter plate (Corning Glass) in acidic phosphate buffer (APB) composed of 150 mm NaCl and 100 mm NaH2PO4 (Fisher), pH 6.0, with gentle rocking for 2 h at room temperature. To the other 48 wells, we added just the APB (without CA II) as a control. After immobilization, we washed the wells three times with a detergent-supplemented phosphate-buffered saline (TPBS) composed of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4 (Fisher), pH 7.5, and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) using an automated microtiter plate washer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and we then blocked the wells with TPBS containing 2% casein (BioFX Laboratories, Owing Mills, MD) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The following day, we washed the wells three times with TPBS and added GST and GST-SLC4-Ct (0-1000 nm) in triplicate to separate wells containing immobilized CA II or wells without CA II. The proteins were diluted in a reducing incubation buffer (rIB) containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% bovine gelatin (Sigma), 0.05% Triton X-100 (American Bioanalytical), and 1 mm DTT. The plates were incubated with gentle rocking for 20-22 h at room temperature, after which the wells were washed three times with TPBS. We detected binding of GST-SLC4-Ct to CA II using a colorimetric ELISA, in which we incubated wells for 1 h at room temperature with a polyclonal goat anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:20,000 in a nonreducing IB (i.e. rIB without DTT). To at least two wells on each plate, we replaced the anti-GST antibody with a rabbit anti-human CA II polyclonal antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) diluted 1:10,000 in IB to verify the presence of CA II. After incubation with primary antibodies, we washed the wells three times with TPBS and incubated with a peroxidase-linked horse anti-goat or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:10,000 in IB for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibodies, we washed the wells three times with TPBS and developed with a buffer containing 0.05% o-phenylenediamine (Pierce), 22 mm citric acid (Sigma), 54 mm Na2PO4, and 0.015% H2O2 (Fisher) until sufficient color developed. We terminated the color reaction by adding 1 n H2SO4 (Fisher) and quantified absorbances at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC). For each GST-SLC4-Ct fusion protein, the above triplicate experiments were repeated on at least three plates (each plate representing an n of 1). Binding of Pure SLC4-Ct Peptides to Immobilized CA II—Our approach was exactly as described above for the GST-SLC4-Ct assays, except for the following. (i) Instead of adding GST or GST-SLC4-Ct to the wells, we added a pure AE1-Ct (or NBCe1-Ct or NDCBE-Ct{His6}) peptide or its GST-SLC4-Ct counterpart. (ii) We detected binding of the SLC4-Ct and GST-SLC4-Ct to CA II using one of the following primary antibodies: (i) a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against residues Asp896 to Val911 of human erythrocyte AE1 (generously provided by Dr. Reinhart Reithmeier, University of Toronto, Canada (22Popov M. Li J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)), diluted 1:6000 in IB; (ii) a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the unique Ct (residues Ser1034 to Cys1079) of rat NBCe1-A/B “K1A” (23Bevensee M.O. Schmitt B.M. Choi I. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J.

Binding of CA II to Immobilized SLC4-Ct Domains—In a reducing APB (1 mm DTT), we immobilized (in triplicate) 200 ng of GST, GST-SLC4-Ct, or pure SLC4-Ct peptides, or just the APB, to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The plates were blocked as described above, incubated with purified CA II (0-1000 nm, diluted in rIB) with gentle rocking for 20-22 h at room temperature, and then washed three times with TPBS. CA II binding to immobilized proteins or pure peptides was detected by ELISA, incubating with the anti-human CA II primary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in IB, washing the wells, and then developing as described above. To three wells on each plate, we replaced the anti-CA II antibody with an anti-GST antibody (for immobilized GST and GST-SLC4-Ct) or an anti-SLC4-Ct antibody (for immobilized pure SLC4-Ct peptides and GST-SLC4-Ct) to verify the presence of the proteins.

To study transcriptional targets of canonical Wnt signaling, we used the conditional Cre/loxP system in mouse to ectopically activate β-catenin during central nervous system development. We show that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the embryonic mouse telencephalon results in the up-regulation of Sp5 gene, which encodes a member of the Sp1 transcription factor family. A proximal promoter of Sp5 gene is highly evolutionarily conserved and contains five TCF/LEF binding sites that mediate direct regulation of Sp5 expression by canonical Wnt signaling. We provide evidence that Sp5 works as a transcriptional repressor and has three independent repressor domains, called R1, R2, and R3, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the repression activity of R1 domain is mediated through direct interaction with a transcriptional corepressor mSin3a. Finally, our data strongly suggest that Sp5 has the same DNA binding specificity as Sp1 and represses Sp1 target genes such as p21. We conclude that Sp5 transcription factor mediates the downstream responses to Wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly repressing Sp1 target genes.

We conclude that Sp5 transcription factor mediates the downstream responses to Wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly repressing Sp1 target genes. Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays important roles in multiple developmental processes and has a profound effect on cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cell fate determination (1Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Wnt molecules are secreted glycoproteins that work as signaling molecules. Wnt molecules bind with Frizzled receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein coreceptors at the cell surface to initiate the signaling. In the absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the level of cytoplasmic β-catenin, the key mediator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, is kept low. β-Catenin is recruited to a destruction complex containing the tumor suppressors adenomatous polyposis coli, axin, casein kinase 1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, respectively, and is constitutively phosphorylated. The phosphorylated β-catenin protein is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway. Members of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family bind corepressor Groucho and repress Wnt target genes in the nucleus. The binding of Wnt molecules to the receptors and the coreceptors results in the inactivation of the kinase activity of the destruction complex. As a consequence, β-catenin protein is not phosphorylated, begins to accumulate in the cytoplasm, and is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors. The binding converts TCF/LEF into an activator that initiates the transcription of Wnt target genes, including c-myc, Axin2, and Lef1 (2He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T.

Transgenic mice, which express a stabilized form of β-catenin in neural progenitor cells, develop enlarged brains (6Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In Wnt3a mutant mice as well as in Lef1 mutant mice, the hippocampus is missing (5Lee S.M. Tole S. Grove E. McMahon A.P. Development. 2000; 127: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Galceran J. Miyashita-Lin E.M. Devaney E. Rubenstein J.L. Grosschedl R. Development. 2000; 127: 469-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reports indicate critical roles of canonical Wnt signaling in CNS development. To study targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we used the conditional Cre/loxP system in mice to ectopically activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling during CNS development. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is achieved by a deletion of exon 3 of the β-catenin gene that encodes phosphorylation sites necessary for β-catenin degradation (8Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). To activate canonical Wnt signaling during CNS development, Nes11Cre mice were crossed to Catnblox(ex3) mice. Mutant animals Nes11Cre/Catnblox(ex3) display hyperplasia in the telencephalon that resembles the phenotype of the mouse mutants in which activated β-catenin is directly coupled to the nestin enhancer (6Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). We show that the constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling results in the up-regulation of the Sp5 gene in the mouse telencephalon. The Sp5 gene encodes a member of Sp1 transcription factor family (9Harrison S.M. Houzelstein D. Dunwoodie S.L. Beddington R.S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter of the Sp5 gene is highly evolutionarily conserved and has five TCF/LEF binding sites that mediate direct regulation of Sp5 expression by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Sp5 appears to work as a transcriptional repressor at least in part by directly interacting with a corepressor mSin3a. We show that Sp5 has the same DNA binding specificity as Sp1 and represses Sp1 target genes such as p21. In conclusion, our report suggests that the Sp5 transcription factor mediates the downstream responses to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by directly repressing Sp1 target genes. Mouse Lines—Analysis of Cre-mediated recombination pattern in Nes11-Cre (10Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) was performed by mating to the ROSA26R reporter line as described previously (11Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). The ROSA26R mice (stock #003309) and Nes11-Cre mice (stock #003771) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. D6Cre transgenic mice express Cre recombinase under the control of Dach1 enhancer, which is active in the telencephalon (12van den Bout C.J. Machon O. Rosok O. Backman M. Krauss S. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mice with a conditional “floxed” allele of β-catenin, Catnblox(ex3), were kindly provided by Dr. M. M. Taketo (8Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The mouse Sp5 promoter and truncated promoters were amplified by PCR using C57BL/6J mouse genomic DNA (kindly provided by J. Forejt) as a template. PCR products were cloned to pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The resulting plasmids were digested with EcoRI (New England Bio-labs), blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Bio-labs), and cloned into SmaI-digested pGL3 basic (Promega) vector. Mouse Sp5 enhancers were amplified by PCR using primers with XbaI recognition sites. PCR products were digested by XbaI and cloned into a NheI site upstream of the minimal TK promoter cloned in the pGL3 vector. For Gal4-Sp5, the full-length mouse Sp5 cDNA was excised from pBSKX-Sp5 (kindly provided by D. Houzelstein) and cloned into a Gal4 expression plasmid. To generate Gal4 fusion constructs with individual domains of Sp5, the corresponding regions of mouse Sp5 cDNA were amplified by PCR and cloned into the Gal4 expression plasmid. To generate 6xHis-Sp5, the coding sequence of Sp5 was cloned into the procaryotic expression vector pETH2α. For Sp5-FLAG, the Sp5 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pKW-FLAG in-frame with the FLAG coding sequence located at the N terminus. For retroviral infection of neurosphere cultures, Sp5 cDNA was inserted into pNIT retroviral vector (provided by F. Gage). To generate GST fusions with a Sp5 R1 domain, the corresponding region was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET42a(+) (Novagen). For GST-Sp5R1A3P and Gal4-Sp5A3P, the R1 region was amplified by PCR using primers that contained the corresponding point mutation and cloned into pET42a(+) or Gal4 expression plasmid. All constructs were verified by sequencing. A lucifer-ase reporter plasmid containing the p21 promoter (p21-Luc) was kindly provided by E. Sancho. For p21GC-Luc, the p21-Luc plasmid was digested with PstI and BglII (-198/+12), blunted, and cloned into pGL3 basic. For p21ΔGC-Luc, a p21 promoter fragment (-2326/-197) was cut with PstI/HindIII and fused to the minimal p21 promoter (-30/+12) located in pGL3 basic. Microarray Experiment—RNA was isolated from the dissected telencephalon of E13.5 mouse embryos (Nes11-Cre/Catnblox(ex3) or Catnblox(ex3)) using an Ambion kit and subjected to hybridization on Affymetrix MOE 430A GeneChip. Neuro-spheres were cultured in neurobasal-A medium with B27 supplement (both Invitrogen) and with epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml) and basic fibroblast growth factor (8 ng/ml, both R&D Systems). Cells were passaged every 3 days. The Sp5 retrovirus was produced in a Phoenix packaging cell line (provided by G. Nollan) by transient transfection of pNIT-Sp5, and neurosphere cells were infected as described in a previous study (13Rappa G. Kunke D. Holter J. Diep D.B. Meyer J. Baum C. Fodstad O. Krauss S. Lorico A. Neuroscience. 2004; 124: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Three days after infection, selection with G418 antibiotics was started (250 μg/ml), and pools of cell clones were maintained in the selection media. RNA was isolated from three separate plates of Sp5 virus or mock infected neurospheres using an Ambion kit and used for hybridization on Affymetrix MOE 430A. Microarray data were analyzed by Affymetrix Suite 5.1 software. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Neurospheres were cultured in neurobasal-A medium with B27 supplement (both Invitrogen), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), and basic fibroblast growth factor (8 ng/ml, both R&D Systems). Cells were passaged every 3 days and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified air with 5% CO2. Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Typically, the total amount of DNA transfected per well was 300 ng and was adjusted with pUC18 when necessary. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Triplicate assays were performed to obtain standard deviations. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in 100 μlof1× passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase reporter assays were performed using Luciferase Reporter assay kit (Promega). β-Galactosidase was detected with Galacto-Star system (Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, CA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotech) with modifications. The cortical parts of D6Cre/Catnblox(ex3) brains were harvested at E18.5, homogenized in 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked at 37 °C for 15 min. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine (0.125 m) and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. Cross-linked cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing fresh protease inhibitors, pelleted, and resuspended in 2 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and lysates were sonicated on an ice water bath to produce 150–500 bp of DNA fragments. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted ten times with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors. 30 μg of sonicated chromatin was precleared with 50 μl of protein A(G)/agarose slurry (Upstate Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated either with 5 μg of antibody or with no antibody (no antibody control) overnight at 4 °C. The following antibodies were used: anti-β-catenin (E-5, sc-7963, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Lef1 (N-17, sc-8591, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Tcf4 (a gift from V. Korinek). 30 μl of protein A(G)/agarose slurry (Upstate Biotech) was added, and samples were rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing for 5 min at 4 °C twice in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1%Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), twice in high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), four times in LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate,1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), immunocomplexes were eluted twice with 100 μlof elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 15 min at room temperature. Immunoprecipitated DNA was de-cross-linked overnight at 65 °C in the presence of proteinase K (0.06 unit/μl, Roche Applied Science) and 250 mm NaCl. Samples were purified using a MinElute reaction cleanup kit (Qiagen), and 1/20th of eluate was used for PCR. PCR was performed as follows: 95 °C 2 min for 1 cycle; then 95 °C 30 s, 60 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s for 40 cycles; and finally 72 °C 5 min. The primers used were as follows: Sp5D-H_F, CCTAGAGATAACAAAGACACT; Sp5D-H_R, AGTCAGAGGAAAGATTTATGG; Sp5-2kb_F, TGGCTGCTTAATTGCCTAAAGAG; Sp5-2kb_R, CAGGGGTTTGAGTGCTGTGGA; Sp5 + 6kb_F, AACGGAAGCTGAGTGTAAATTAG; and Sp5 + 6kb_R, GTAACTAAGACAGACGCCTAAAC. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The following double-stranded oligonucleotides derived from the Sp5 promoter were used in EMSA (only the top strand is shown for simplicity): Sp5A, ATTGAAGAAACAAAGTTTGATCT; Sp5B, CACTCATCAACAAAGGAAAGCCC; Sp5C, GGATACCTCTTTGAACTGACCCC; Sp5D, CTAGAGATAACAAAGACACTTTG; Sp5E, AAGGCCCCCTTTGATCAGGAAAA; Sp5F, TTTGTGGATTCAAAGGATTTGCT; Sp5G, CCGCTATTCTTTGATGATTGGGT; and Sp5H, CGGCAAACTTCAAAGCCATAAAT. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides derived from the p21 promoter were used: I + II, GAATTCTGAGGCGGGCCCGGGCGGGGCGGTTGGAATTC; III + IV, GAATTCCGAGCGCGGGTCCCGCCTCCGAATTC; and V + VI, GAATTCGGAGGGCGGTCCCGGGCGGCGCGAATTC. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides representing consensus (wt) and multiple versions of the Sp1 binding site were used: WT, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; M1, ATTCGATCGGTTCGGGGCGAGC; M2, ATTCGATCGGGGAGGGGCGAGC; M3, ATTCGATCGGGGTGGGGCGAGC; M4, ATTCGATCGAGGCGGGGCGAGC; M5, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGAGCGAGC; SA1, GTGCGGAGGCGTGGTTAGAG; AX2, CGGGCGGCGGGGGAGGCGGGGTC; XN2, CGGCGGGGAGGTGGGGCGAGGAGAG; and BTE, AGCTTGAGAAGGAGGCGTGGCCAACGCATG. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing TCF/LEF or Sp1/Sp5 binding sites were radioactively labeled at the 5′-ends with [γ-32P]dATP using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and purified on microspin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with in vitro synthesized LEF1 (TnT Quick, Promega), bacteri-ally purified 6xHis-Sp5 (Qiagen), or Sp1 (Promega) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES at pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dIdC)) on ice for 15 min. For supershifts, 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were preincubated on ice for 10 min with 1 μg of anti-Lef antibody. Samples were analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—293T cells were plated in 10-cm dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Myc-mSin3a plasmid (2 μg, kindly provided by C. Laherty) was cotransfected with FLAG-Sp5 expression plasmid (3 μg) or empty FLAG expression plasmid (3 μg) into 293T cells. Two days after transfection, 293T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot of this whole cell lysate was boiled with 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. For immunoprecipitation, 500 ml of the whole cell lysate was incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 1× Wash buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) five times and boiled with 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were separated by 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. Myc-tagged mSin3a was detected by anti-Myc antibody (Roche Applied Science), and FLAG-tagged Sp5 was detected by anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Detection was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins/horseradish peroxidase (DakoCytomation) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemilumines-cent Substrate (Pierce). GST-pull-down Assay—Myc-tagged mSin3a was prepared by TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). GST fusion expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells (Stratagene). A single colony from the transformation was cultured in 2 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 30 ng/ml kanamycin overnight at 37 °C. The cultures were transferred to 100 ml of LB without antibiotics. The expression of the fusion construct was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 2 mm for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 ml of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, sonicated, and centrifuged to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was incubated with 200 μl of glutathione-Sepharose slurry beads (BD Bioscience) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 5 ml of Binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. GST fusion proteins bound to the beads were checked by SDS-PAGE. Beads containing normalized amounts of fusion proteins were blocked by Binding buffer containing 0.05% of Nonidet P-40 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C and resuspended in 150 μl of Binding buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μl of Myc-tagged mSin3a produced by TnT. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of Binding buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and boiled with SDS sample buffer. Myc-tagged mSin3a was detected by Western blotting using an anti-Myc antibody. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization on cryosections was carried out as described previously (14Machon O. van den Bout C.J. Backman M. Rosok O. Caubit X. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B. Krauss S. Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 951-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying mouse Sp5, Axin2, and Nkd1 cDNA were linearized with an appropriate restriction enzyme, and an antisense Riboprobe was synthesized using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Sp5 Is a Target Gene of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling—To identify target genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during CNS development, two lines of mice were interbred to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Catnblox(ex3), in which exon 3 of β-catenin gene is floxed by loxP sites (8Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), was mated to Nes11Cre, a transgenic mouse line expressing Cre recombinase under the control of nestin regulatory elements in neural progenitor cells (10Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Exon 3 of β-catenin gene encodes phosphorylation sites necessary for β-catenin degradation (15Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of exon 3 of β-catenin gene results in the expression of a stabilized form of β-catenin, which leads to the constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To map the area in which Cre recombinase is active in the Nes11Cre mice, Nes11Cre mice were crossed with a reporter mouse line, ROSA26R (R26R) (11Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). Within the telencephalon, Cre recombinase activity was detected in the neural progenitor cells of the pallium and the subpallium (Fig. 1A). To activate canonical Wnt signaling during CNS development, Nes11Cre mice were crossed to Catnblox(ex3) mice. Mutant animals Nes11Cre/Catnblox(ex3) displayed hyperplasia in the telencephalon that resembles the phenotype of the mouse mutants in which activated β-catenin is directly coupled to the nestin enhancer (6Chenn A. Walsh C.A. Science. 2002; 297: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Further, the dorso-ventral patterning in the mutant telencephalon is impaired such that genes normally expressed in the dorsal pallium expand into the ventral areas, whereas ventrally expressed genes are down-regulated (69Backman M. Machon O. Mygland L. van den Bout C.J. Zhong W. Taketo M.M. Krauss S. Dev. Biol. 2005; 279: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To identify target genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, RNA was isolated from the telencephalon at E13.5, and overall gene expression was analyzed by Affymetrix microarray. We noticed that the expression levels of several known targets of Wnt/β-catenin were up-regulated, as follows: Axin2 (3.4×), Nkd1 (9.5×), Dkk1 (5×), and Pitx2 (7×) (3Jho E.H. Zhang T. Domon C. Joo C.K. Freund J.N. Costantini F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 16Kioussi C. Briata P. Baek S.H. Rose D.W. Hamblet N.S. Herman T. Ohgi K.A. Lin C. Gleiberman A. Wang J. Brault V. Ruiz-Lozano P. Nguyen H.D. Kemler R. Glass C.K. Wynshaw-Boris A. Rosen-feld M.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 673-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 17Niida A. Hiroko T. Kasai M. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8520-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ventrally expressed genes such as Dlx2, Dlx1, Lhx6,or Mash1 were down-regulated 10.5-, 5.1-, 15.1-, and 7.2-fold, respectively. The expression of several genes was verified by in situ hybridization on coronal sections of Nes11Cre/Catnblox(ex3) mice and wild-type mice at E13.5 (Fig. 1, D–G, see also Ref. 69Backman M. Machon O. Mygland L. van den Bout C.J. Zhong W. Taketo M.M. Krauss S. Dev. Biol. 2005; 279: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that Sp5, a member of Sp1 family, was up-regulated 32-fold in the Affymetrix data, and strong gene activation was confirmed by in situ hybridization (Fig. 1, B and C). In wild-type mice, Sp5 is expressed weakly in the hippocampal primordium (Fig. 1B). In Nes11Cre/Catnblox(ex3) mice, Sp5 is strongly expressed in the pallium and the subpallium, i.e. in the area of Cre-mediated recombination (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling positively regulates Sp5. Sp5 Is a Direct Target Gene of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling—We next examined whether Sp5 is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling directly. To find important transcriptional regulatory elements, we compared the upstream sequences of Sp5 of Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, Danio rerio, and Xenopus tropicalis, because the important transcriptional regulatory elements are often evolutionarily conserved. We found three evolutionarily conserved regions containing TCF/LEF consensus sites located at positions -200 bp/+200 bp, -2.9 kbp/-2.7 kbp, and -3.9 kbp/-3.4 kbp, referred to as proximal promoter, ECR2, and ECR1, respectively. ECR2 contains two conserved TCF/LEF consensus sites named B and C. ECR1 contains one conserved TCF/LEF consensus site named A. The Sp5 proximal promoter contains five TCF/LEF consensus sites, named D, E, F, G, and H, respectively. Sites E, G, and H in the Sp5 promoter were evolutionarily conserved among all five vertebrate species. Site F was not conserved in D. rerio, and site D was conserved only between M. musculus and H. sapiens (Fig. 2A). To examine if the Sp5 promoter is responsive to Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a mouse Sp5 promoter (-1536/+200) was cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into 293T cells. Cotransfection of the promoter with Lef1 and N-terminally truncated β-catenin (β-cateninΔN), which is constitutively stabilized and able to bind with TCF/LEF transcription factors (18Gat U. DasGupta R. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Cell. 1998; 95: 605-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), stimulated reporter gene expression ∼15-fold. Conversely, cotransfection with N-terminally truncated TCF4 (dnTCF4), which does not bind to β-catenin and acts as a potent inhibitor of the β-catenin/TCF complexes (19van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurl-stone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D. Haramis A.P. Tjon-Pon-Fong M. Moerer P. van den Born M. Soete G. Pals S. Eilers M. Medema R. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), repressed the activity of the promoter construct 4.9-fold (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the Sp5 promoter is directly responsive to Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To identify functional TCF/LEF elements within the Sp5 promoter, three reporter plasmids containing different regions of the promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene were constructed (Fig. 2B). Luciferase reporter plasmids containing -206/+200, -27/+200, and -1536/+3 of the Sp5 promoter were named D1, D2, and D3, respectively. Each plasmid was cotransfected in 293T cells with β-cateninΔN/Lef1 or dnTCF4. D1 and D2 were stimulated 10-fold and 6-fold by β-cateninΔN/Lef1, respectively, and repressed 2.9-fold and 9.4-fold by dnTCF4, respectively. In contrast, D3 was not affected by either β-cateninΔN/Lef 1 or dnTCF4 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that sites F, G, and H play a critical role in mediating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and site E supports site F, G, and H to give further activation. To examine whether ECR1 and ECR2 are also responsive to Wnt/β-catenin signaling, ECR1 and ECR2 were cloned upstream of the minimal TK promoter driving luciferase reporter gene expression. Each of the constructs was cotransfected in 293T cells with β-cateninΔN/Lef1 or dnTCF4. ECR1, ECR2, and TK were stimulated 1.4-, 4.0-, and 1.8-fold by β-cateninΔN/Lef1, respectively, and repressed 2.4-, 2.3-, and 1.5-fold by dnTCF4 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that ECR2 is an additional Wnt-responsive regulatory element. To examine whether TCF/LEF binds putative A–H binding sites within the Sp5 proximal promoter, ECR1, and ECR2 (Fig. 3B), EMSA was performed. Oligonucleotides containing sites A–H were incubated with in vitro translated LEF1 and were analyzed by electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3A, all sites were bound by LEF1. The identity of the LEF1 protein in the complex was verified by supershifts using LEF1 antibody. This result suggests that TCF/LEF can bind with TCF/LEF binding sites within the Sp5 proximal promoter"

Notably, IL-13 expression at birth correlates with subsequent susceptibility to atopic disease. In order to characterize the chromatin-based mechanisms that regulate IL-13 expression in human neonatal CD4+ T cells, we analyzed patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity and epigenetic modifications within the IL-13 locus in cord blood CD4+ T cells, naive or differentiated in vitro under Th1- or Th2-polarizing conditions. In naive CD4+ T cells, hypersensitivity associated with DNA hypomethylation was limited to the distal promoter. Unexpectedly, during both Th1 and Th2 differentiation, the locus was extensively remodeled, as revealed by the formation of numerous HS sites and decreased DNA methylation. Obvious differences in chromatin architecture were limited to the proximal promoter, where strong hypersensitivity, hypomethylation, and permissive histone modifications were found selectively in Th2 cells. In addition to revealing the locations of putative cis-regulatory elements that may be required to control IL-13 expression in neonatal CD4+ T cells, our results suggest that differential IL-13 expression may depend on the acquisition of a permissive chromatin architecture at the proximal promoter in Th2 cells rather than the formation of locus-wide repressive chromatin in Th1 cells.

The cytokine IL-13 has received considerable attention in recent years because of its critical role as an effector molecule of Th2-mediated disease. IL-13 appears to be necessary and sufficient to induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway eosinophilia, epithelial cell damage, and goblet cell hyperplasia with mucus hyperproduction, key signatures of allergic inflammation in experimental asthma (1Walter D.M.

Furthermore, IL-13 instigates chronic airway alterations through its ability to induce fibrosis, parenchymal and vascular remodeling, and accumulation of macrophages in the lung (4Lee J.H.

Of note, numerous studies in humans have documented increased expression of both IL-13 and its receptors at sites of allergic inflammation (11Vercelli D. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin.

Genes Immun. 2006; 7: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).Analysis of chromatin structure has provided considerable insights into the role played by epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression throughout the Th2 cytokine cluster that includes IL-5, IL-13, and IL-4 (13Ansel K.M. Djuretic I. Tanasa B. Rao A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 607-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Although focused mostly on IL-4, studies using adult murine CD4+ T cells showed that during Th2 differentiation, the IL-13 locus acquires an open chromatin configuration characterized by increased DNase I hypersensitivity (14Agarwal S.

In contrast, the chromatin within the IL-13 locus in Th1 cells was found to be in an inaccessible state similar to that found in naive CD4+ T cells, with the exception of a single constitutive DNase I hypersensitive (HS) 2The abbreviations used are: HS, hypersensitive; CNS, conserved non-coding sequence; LCR, locus control region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IFN, interferon. 2The abbreviations used are: HS, hypersensitive; CNS, conserved non-coding sequence; LCR, locus control region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IFN, interferon. site in the IL-13/IL-4 intergenic region.

Indeed, immunological events in early life are essential determinants of Th2 allergic inflammation in adults (22Martinez F.D. Paediatr. Respir.

We show herein that the IL-13 chromatin in neonatal CD4+ T cells undergoes extensive remodeling during differentiation into a polarized T helper phenotype. Surprisingly, overall similar patterns of chromatin accessibility and methylation were observed in Th2 and Th1 populations, although IL-13 was not expressed by Th1 cells. Substantial differences in accessibility were limited to the proximal promoter, where a strong DNase I HS site and a permissive epigenetic state were generated selectively in Th2 cells. Our results suggest that the IL-13 locus in neonatal CD4+ T cells is refractory to the acquisition of a repressive chromatin structure. Control of proximal promoter accessibility may therefore be a critical determinant of IL-13 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation and Culture of CD4+ T Cells—Unidentified human umbilical cord blood samples were processed within 2-4 h of scheduled caesarian delivery. Following two density gradient centrifugations, naive (CD45RO-CD45RA+) CD4+ T cells were purified by negative selection using magnetic microbeads conjugated to antibodies against CD8, CD11b, CD16, CD19, CD36, CD56, glycophorin A, and CD45RO (Miltenyi). The cell populations thus isolated were typically >90% CD4+, >80% CD45RA+, and <10% CD45ROlow (Fig. 1A). Cells were then resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 5% heat-inactivated autologous plasma, and hIL-2 (5 ng/ml; NCI) and cultured in anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (UCHT1, 2 μg/ml; R & D)-coated plates for 4 days in the presence of Th1- or Th2-polarizing cytokines and blocking antibodies. For Th1 differentiation, hIL-12 (10 ng/ml; R&D) and anti-IL-4 (MP4-25D2, 2 μg/ml; Pharmingen) were added to the culture medium. For Th2 differentiation, hIL-4 (4 ng/ml; R&D), anti-hIL-12 (24910, 2 μg/ml; R&D), anti-hIFN-γ (25718, 2 μg/ml; R&D), and anti-hCD28 (37407, 1 μg/ml; R&D) monoclonal antibodies were added. Cells were then rested for 3-4 days in the presence of IL-12 (5 ng/ml) and anti-IL-4 (1 μg/ml) for Th1 conditions or IL-4 (2 ng/ml) and anti-IL-12 (1 μg/ml) for Th2 conditions. Cultures were maintained for 1-3 weeks following weekly stimulation cycles.Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—After lysis of the cell pellets, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Gibco) and reverse transcribed using Omniscript (Qiagen) and oligo(dT) primers (Gibco). Real time PCR was performed using predeveloped primer and probe sets for IL-13, IFN-γ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in a model 7900HT real time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Cytokine cDNA copy number was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA copy number.Intracellular Flow Cytometry—Patterns of cytokine expression in differentiated CD4+ T cells were determined by intracellular staining for IL-4, IL-13, and IFN-γ. Cells cultured for 1-3 weeks were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 4 h. Brefeldin A (20 μg/ml) was added during the last3hof stimulation. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in permeabilization buffer (PBS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15% fetal calf serum, 0.2% saponin) and then resuspended in permeabilization buffer containing anti-IL-4-PE (MP4-25D2; Pharmingen) or anti-IL-13-PE (JES10-5A2; Pharmingen) and anti-IFN-γ-fluorescein isothiocyanate (B27; Pharmingen). Following a 1-h incubation, cells were washed twice with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in PBS/paraformaldehyde (1%). Levels of cytokine expression in permeabilized cells and nonpermeabilized controls were analyzed immediately on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).DNase I HS Site Mapping—DNase I hypersensitivity was assessed using methods adapted from Elder et al. (28Elder J.T. Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Mager D. Henthorn P. Peretz M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Burch and Weintraub (29Burch J.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1983; 33: 65-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed on ice unless otherwise indicated. Freshly isolated naive or in vitro differentiated CD4+ T cells were washed once in PBS and once in a 1:1 mix of PBS and RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2). Cells were then resuspended in 100% RSB buffer at 20-40 × 106/ml. While slowly vortexing, a 10% solution of Nonidet P-40 was gradually added to the cell suspension until a final concentration of 0.23% was reached. The nuclei thus released were pelleted and washed once with RSB. DNA concentration was estimated (A260), and nuclei were resuspended in RSB buffer containing Ca2+ (100 μm) at a DNA concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Aliquots of nuclei were incubated with increasing concentrations of DNase I (5-120 units/mg DNA; Gibco) for 10 min at 37 °C. An equal amount of nuclei lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.25 m EDTA, 20 μg/ml RNase) was added to stop the reaction. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, Proteinase K (Sigma) was added (100 ng/ml, final concentration), and samples were incubated at 50 °C for 3 h with occasional mixing. Four serial phenol/chloroform extractions were then performed, followed by dialysis against two changes of TE buffer. DNA samples (15 μg each) were digested overnight at room temperature with restriction enzymes (100-200 units; New England Biolabs) and ethanol-precipitated. DNA was reconstituted in TE, electrophoresed in a 0.8-1.2% agarose gel in TBE buffer, and transferred to nylon. Target DNA was visualized by indirect end labeling with a radiolabeled probe annealing to one end of the restriction fragment. Probe templates (200-500 bp) were radiolabeled by random priming as described (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).DNA Methylation Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated from either freshly isolated or in vitro differentiated T cells as described for DNase I HS site mapping. Following digestion with EcoRI and ethanol precipitation, DNA (2 μg) was resuspended in water, bisulfite-treated as per the manufacturer's instructions (EZ DNA Methylation Kit; Zymo Research), and resuspended in nuclease-free water (Ambion). Primers were designed using Primer3 software (31Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following conversion of sequence obtained from GenBank™ (accession number AC004039). PCRs for each primer set were optimized for Mg2+ concentration and annealing temperature. DNA template (50 ng) was amplified with primers complementary to bisulfite-converted DNA sequence (see supplemental material) and Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for 40 cycles. Amplified DNA was gelpurified using spin columns (Corning-Costar) and cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). For each PCR amplification, 48 colonies were picked, transferred to 96-well plates, and lysed using the Colony Fast Screen kit (PCR Screen; Epicenter). To rule out any bias related to bisulfite conversion and PCR, the DNA samples analyzed in Fig. 7 were subjected to two bisulfite conversions, followed by two PCR amplifications and cloning events per conversion. Small aliquots (3.0 μl of a 1:10 dilution) were removed from each lysate and PCR-amplified with the M13 forward and reverse primers (1.0 pmol) using 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1× Taq buffer, and 0.05 units of platinum Taq at an annealing and extension temperature of 62.8 °C for 40 cycles. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gels to assess insert size and yield. Products were then diluted 1:2 to 1:6 with water. Cycle sequencing reactions consisted of diluted PCR product (2 μl), Big Dye 3.0 nucleotide mix (0.4 μl; ABI) and diluted (1:20) 5× sequencing buffer (1.8 μl), M13 primers (7 pmol; 0.17 μl), and water (5.6 μl). Cycle sequencing products were purified using the Agencourt bead system and an FX robot (Biomeck). Samples were run on a 3730XL DNA Analyzer (ABI), using a 36-cm capillary system. Data were assessed for initial quality using the SQPR program (32Lazo G.R. Tong J. Miller R. Hsia C. Rausch C. Kang Y. Anderson O.D. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and assembled using CONSED software (33Gordon D. Abajian C. Green P. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar). Results are presented as percentage methylation at each CpG position: ((number of protected cytosines)/(number of unprotected + number of protected cytosines) × 100). Between 25 and 45 colonies (typically above 40) from each PCR amplification provided readable sequence. Supplemental Fig. 2 shows the CpG site-by-CpG site analysis of methylation at the whole IL-13 locus in Th2 cells and demonstrates the absence of PCR and clonal bias.FIGURE 7Comparison between accessibility, sequence conservation, and DNA methylation profiles across the IL-13 locus.

A, analysis of the IL-13 5′-flanking region and transcription unit. Cord blood-derived naive CD4+ T cells were either used immediately after immunomagnetic negative selection or differentiated in vitro under Th1- or Th2-polarizing conditions for 9 days. Cells were restimulated on anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-coated plates for 24 h prior to harvesting. Nuclei were isolated and exposed to titrated DNase I. Following KpnI digestion and transfer to nylon membrane, target template was visualized by indirect end-labeling with probe A. Shown on the left is a 1-kb ladder and the size of the parent restriction fragment. Bands corresponding to HS sites are marked on the right. The asterisks indicate approximate positions of bands that may represent HS sites in the IL-13/RAD50 intergenic region; HS1 to HS3 map within this region (R. B. Webster, unpublished observations).

(34Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2224-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Essentially, cells were fixed by adding 37% formaldehyde directly to the culture media and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped by adding one-tenth volume of 1.25 m glycine and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended at 20-40 × 106 cells/ml in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Cells in a volume of 700 μlin an ice bath were sonicated (one-eighth inch tip; Misonix) at 14 watts for six 10-s pulses over a 6-min period. Cellular debris was pelleted, and chromatin preparations were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots of chromatin (2 × 106 cell equivalents) were diluted in chilled ChIP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 17.7 mm Tris (8.1), 167 mm NaCl) to a volume of 1 ml, precleared with Protein G-agarose (50 μl; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h, and incubated overnight with 10 μg of anti-acetylated H3 or H4 antibodies, anti-histone H3, or normal rabbit IgG (Upstate Biotechnology). Following a 2-h incubation with Protein G-agarose beads, the beads were washed five times with cold ChIP buffer. Antibody-chromatin complexes were eluted first with 250 μl of ChIP buffer plus 3.0% SDS and then with 250 μl of ChIP buffer plus 1.0% SDS. Fixation was reversed by incubating overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified by treating sequentially with RNase (New England Biolabs) and proteinase K (New England Biolabs). Following phenol/chloroform and a chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with 0.2 m NaCl2, 30 μg of glycogen, and EtOH (70%). DNA yield was determined using Picogreen® (Invitrogen). Enrichment for target templates was assessed using Sybr® Green real time PCR (Applied Biosystems) with 2 ng of sample DNA and a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer (see supplemental material) in a volume of 20 μl. Reactions were run, and data were collected using a model 7900HT real time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Copy number was calculated using the following formula: 10[(Ct-40)/-3.33] Results were normalized to the copy number of isotype immunoprecipitated samples to correct for differences in primer efficiency and then normalized to a RAG2-negative control copy number within each sample.Comparative Sequence Analysis—Alignments between the sequence of the human and mouse IL-13 locus were performed, and the extent of DNA sequence homology was computed using the World Wide Web-based program Genome Vista (available on the World Wide Web at pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/GenomeVista). Regions with a length of at least 50 bp, which showed at least 75% sequence identity at each segment of the alignment between successive gaps, were identified as conserved noncoding sequences (CNS).RESULTSIL-13 Chromatin Is Accessible in Neonatal Naive CD4+ T Cells—Nuclease HS sites are believed to reflect the DNA binding activity of sequence-specific trans-acting factors that induce destabilization or displacement of local nucleosomes (35Boyes J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This chromatin-modifying activity can result in the exposure of additional binding sites, potentially increasing the transcriptional competence of a promoter or the activity of a distal regulatory element (36Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 37Kang J.G. Hamiche A. Wu C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mapping of HS sites therefore identifies the locations of putative cis-regulatory elements and determines their state of accessibility to trans-acting factors at specific developmental stages.As a first step toward characterizing IL-13 regulation in neonatal T cells, we mapped the locations of DNase I HS sites across the IL-13 locus in resting human naive (CD45RA+CD45RO-) CD4+ T cells freshly isolated from umbilical cord blood (Fig. 1A). In a 24.1-kb KpnI restriction fragment spanning the IL-13 transcription unit and RAD50/IL-13 intergenic region, two HS sites were detected within the IL-13 distal promoter (HS4 and HS5; Fig. 2A, NAIVE). HS4 is just proximal to a CpG island and a conserved CGRE element (18Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42399-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas HS5 is located ∼1.2 kb upstream of the ATG. In contrast, no HS sites were detected within the proximal promoter, transcription unit, or 6.5 kb of 3′-flanking chromatin (Fig. 2, A and B, NAIVE). The IL-13 locus chromatin is therefore largely inaccessible to DNase I in neonatal naive CD4+ T cells, except for the distal promoter.Covalent modifications of chromatin constituents can also have regulatory significance. Cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides can increase the repressive nature of chromatin by providing docking sites for methyl-binding proteins, which in turn recruit complexes with histone deacetylase and histone methyltransferase activity (38Wilson C.B. Makar K.W. Shnyreva M. Fitzpatrick D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, hypomethylated regions frequently correlate with an open or permissive chromatin conformation, typically thought to result from competitive inhibition of maintenance methylation activity due to transcription factor binding during S-phase of the cell cycle, a process called passive demethylation (39Hsieh C.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the levels of CpG methylation within the IL-13 locus using genomic DNA purified from freshly isolated neonatal naive CD4+ T cells. Following bisulfite treatment, overlapping amplicons spanning ∼2.0 kb of the 5′-flanking region were cloned and sequenced. Many of the CpG dinucleotides located within this region were close to 100% methylated. In contrast, CpG dinucleotides, which co-localize with HS4 and HS5, and the proximal end of the CpG island, were found to be markedly hypomethylated (Fig. 3, Naive). The co-localization of nuclease hypersensitivity and hypomethylation at HS4 and HS5 provides strong independent support for the presence of occupied cisregulatory elements in neonatal naive CD4+ T cells.FIGURE 3DNA methylation patterns within the 5′ IL-13 flanking sequence in neonatal CD4+ T cells. DNA was purified from either freshly isolated naive CD4+ T cells (top panel, donor A) or cells differentiated in vitro under Th1 or Th2 conditions for 1-2 weeks, respectively (bottom panels). Differentiated cell populations were harvested after 3-4 days of rest (donor B) or after 24 h of activation in anti-CD3-coated plates (donor A). Purified DNA was bisulfite-converted, PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The corresponding 5′-flanking sequence and the approximate positions of constitutive (black ovals) and major Th2-specific (white oval) HS sites are depicted schematically for both the naive (top panel) and differentiated (bottom panels) populations. The transcription (TS) and translation (ATG) start sites are marked by right pointing arrows. The proximal end of the CpG island is indicated on the left. Each CpG position is represented by a vertical bar along a linear map of the 5′-flanking sequence. The percentage of methylation is indicated by a scale on the left.

https://openalex.org/W2075055313,"Phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH) degrading activity of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-derived paraoxonase-1 (PON1) was investigated, using peroxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PCOOH) as substrate and high performance thin layer chromatography for quantitative peroxide analysis. Incubation of PCOOH with PON1 resulted in decay of the latter and reciprocal buildup of oleic acid hydroperoxide (OAOOH) at rates unaffected by GSH or other reductants. A serine esterase inhibitor blocked this activity and a recombinant PON1 was devoid of it, raising the possibility that the activity represents platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), an esterase that co-purifies with PON1 from HDL. This was verified by showing that a recombinant PAF-AH recapitulates the ability of natural PON1 to hydrolyze PCOOH and release OAOOH while having essentially no effect on parental PC. Furthermore, recombinant PAF-AH and natural PON1 were shown to have similar Km values for PCOOH hydrolysis. Finally, we found that recombinant PAF-AH, but not PON1, catalyzes PLOOH hydrolysis in peroxidized low density lipoprotein. We conclude from this study that PON1 is neither a PLOOH peroxidase nor hydrolase and that the phospholipase A2-like activity previously attributed to PON1 in natural enzyme preparations was actually due to novel PLOOH hydrolytic activity of contaminating PAF-AH.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 2510-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). HDL is known to suppress atherogenic oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and PON1 has been implicated in this (3Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Bisgaier C.L. Newton R.S. Primo-Parmo S.L. La Du B.N. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Both peroxidatic and hydrolytic functions have been described for PON1, either or both of which could play a role in its antioxidant activity (2Aviram M. Hardak E. Vaya J. Mahmood S. Milo S. Hoffman A. Billicke S. Draganov D. Rosenblat M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2510-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Previous studies (6Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N.

The enzyme also inhibited monocyte chemotaxis elicited by oxidized phospholipids and lipoproteins (6Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies showed that this phospholipase A2-like activity (8Rosenberg O. Shih D.M. Aviram M. Atherioscler. Throm. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Rodrigo L. Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Hernandez A. Mackness M.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) did not arise from PON1 itself but rather from a trace contamination of another enzyme, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) (5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Like PON1, PAF-AH is a 43-kDa HDL-associated protein, but unlike PON1, it can be found in LDL as well as HDL (10Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Individuals who are homozygotic-null for this enzyme (11Stafforini D.M. Satoh K. Atkinson D.L. Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Yoshida H. Imaizumi T. Takamatsu S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Prescott S.M. J. Clin.

Acta. 2000; 1488: 102-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PAF-AH cleaves the sn-2 acetyl group from the potent inflammatory mediator PAF but unlike most phospholipases A2 does not act on phospholipids containing medium or long chain fatty acyl groups at this position. Phospholipids undergoing free radical-mediated (chain) peroxidation often become truncated at the sn-2 position, and these species can serve as PAF-AH substrates (13Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5331-5334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some oxidatively fragmented phospholipids with sufficiently short sn-2 residues can stimulate the PAF receptor, and PAF-AH inactivates these (14Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of PAF-AH is uniquely restricted by the length of the sn-2 residue (13Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5331-5334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if the ω-end contains an oxy function (formyl or carboxyl), then even relatively long fragments become good substrates, e.g. the nine carbon fragment from linoleoyl oxidation (15Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and esterified F2-isoprostanes (16Stafforini D.M. Sheller J.R. Blackwell T.S. Sapirstein A. Yull F.E. McIntyre T.M. Bonventre J.V. Prescott S.M. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4616-4623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, residue length is not the only factor involved in substrate recognition. Knowing that hydrolysis of short sn-2 fatty acyl chains previously attributed to PON1 (9Rodrigo L. Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Hernandez A. Mackness M.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was actually due to contaminating PAF-AH (5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we asked whether apparent PON1-catalyzed hydrolysis of oxygenated long chains, e.g. hydroperoxide intermediates, might also reflect PAF-AH activity. Using 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroperoxyoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PCOOH) as a substrate, we have found that recombinant PON1 exhibits no significant peroxidatic or hydrolytic activity. However, recombinant PAF-AH readily hydrolyzed PCOOH, releasing stoichiometric amounts of oleic acid hydroperoxide (OAOOH) in the process. These and related other findings suggest that the PLOOH hydrolyzing/detoxifying role often attributed to PON1 on the basis of in vitro studies with enzyme isolated from HDL (6Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) actually reflects a new activity of PAF-AH, which co-purifies with PON1 (5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Materials—DFO, EDTA, GSH, Igepal CA-630, pepstatin A, phenyl acetate, Tergitol NP-10, TPD, oleic acid, liver phosphatidylethanolamine, brain phosphatidylserine, and brain sphingomyelin were obtained from Sigma. Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) supplied the MAFP. Non-radioactive 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and used without further purification. HPLC-grade solvents were from Mallinkrodt (Paris, KY). Amersham Biosciences supplied the 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([14C]PC, ∼55 mCi/ml), which was HPLC-purified immediately before use (17Vila A. Levchenko V.V. Korytowski W. Girotti A.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12592-12605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human recombinant PAF-AH was obtained from ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA). Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was prepared from freshly isolated human plasma as described previously (18Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation and Characterization of Phospholipid and Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides—Unlabeled or radiolabeled PCOOH was generated by photodynamic action, singlet oxygen-generating AlPcS2 serving as the sensitizer (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PC or [14C]PC (2 mg/ml in chloroform) was irradiated in the presence of 5 μm AlPcS2 at 4 °C, using a 90-watt quartz-halogen lamp (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Korytowski W. Niziolek M. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 343: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After 30 min of irradiation (∼40 J/cm2 fluence), samples were dried under N2, dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, and subjected to normalphase HPLC, using a Supelcosil column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and a mobile phase containing (by volume) 51% isopropyl alcohol, 39% hexane, and 10% water (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Monitoring of effluent absorbance at 205 nm revealed a PCOOH peak that was well separated from residual PC (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PCOOH fractions were pooled, dried under argon, dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, and analyzed for phospholipid and peroxide content. Total phospholipid was determined by orthophosphate analysis (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and total peroxide by iodometric analysis (21Girotti A.W. Thomas J.P. Jordan J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 238-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a mole ratio of ∼1.0 -OOH/Pi being obtained, as expected (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Korytowski W. Niziolek M. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 343: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The PCOOH was further analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (22Kempen E.C. Yang P. Felix E. Madden T. Newman R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 297: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After incubation of PCOOH with rPAF-AH for 90 min (see below for reaction conditions), the hydrolysate was subjected to HPTLC to separate OAOOH from lyso-PC. The OAOOH zone was recovered and extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). After centrifugation to remove silica particles, the supernatant was dried under argon, dissolved in acetonitrile, and chromatographed using a Phenomenex Jupiter-300 C18 capillary column and Agilent Series-100 LC operating in gradient mode. The mobile phase consisted of water (A) and acetonitrile (B), each with 0.005% acetic acid, component B increasing from 40 to 80% in 20 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The detector was an IonSpec 7.0T mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization source operating in the negative ion mode. The total ion profile showed only two well resolved peaks (∼1:1 intensity ratio), each of which gave molecular ions of m/z 313 and 295, representing hydroperoxy oleic acid before and after loss of one H2O, respectively. Fragmentation of the selected parent ion at m/z 295 gave species that are specific for each hydroperoxide positional isomer. Two unique fragment ions were detected, m/z 185 and 155, which allowed the separated analytes to be identified as 9-hydroperoxy-10-octadecenoate and 10-hydroperoxy-8-octadecenoate. Therefore, as predicted for singlet oxygen intermediacy (23Frankel E.N. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1985; 23: 197-221Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar), the PCOOH consisted of equal amounts of PC peroxidized at either the 9- or 10-position of the sn-2 oleoyl group. Other LOOHs, including OAOOH (used as a TLC standard) and the hydroperoxides of phosphatidylethanolamine (PEOOH), phosphatidylserine (PSOOH), sphingomyelin (SMOOH), and phosphatidic acid (PAOOH), were prepared similarly to PCOOH. Stock LOOH solutions in isopropyl alcohol were stored at –20 °C until used for experiments. LDL (∼9.8 mg of protein/ml) in PBS (25 mm sodium phosphate, 125 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 0.1 mm each of EDTA and DFO at 4 °C was supplemented in total LOOH by irradiating for 30 min in the presence of 10 μm AlPcS2, using the quartz-halogen source. The iodometrically determined content of total LOOH was ∼2.3 mm or ∼0.24 μmol/mg of protein. Susceptibility of LDL PLOOHs to enzymatic lipolysis was examined immediately after peroxidation. Preparation of Natural PON1—nPON1 was prepared from HDL particles isolated from plasma of healthy human volunteers. Details of the procedure, including the use of DEAE-Sepharose 6B chromatography with gradient elution for final purification, were as described previously (5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Stock preparations of PON1 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630 (pH 8.0) were analyzed for protein content by Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Preparations were stored at 4 °C and used for experiments within 2 weeks. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PON1—A His-tagged rabbit recombinant PON1 (rPON1-G3C9), which is highly similar to the human counterpart (25Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B.G. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), was expressed in Escherichia coli, as described (26Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Yagur S. Toker L. Silman I. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Protein precipitated by treatment of a bacterial lysate with 55% (w/v) ammonium sulfate was recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.1% Tergitol (pH 8), dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against this buffer, and then against 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tergitol (pH 8) (buffer-2) for 4 h. The dialysate was passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and bound protein was recovered by washing with buffer-2 supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. Fractions containing PON1 activity were assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE, then pooled, dialyzed extensively against buffer-2, and stored at 4 °C. PON1 and PAF-AH Activity Assays with Standard Substrates—Ca2+-dependent aryl esterase activity of PON1 was determined by spectrophotometric assay (27Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 1 mm phenyl acetate and 1 mm CaCl2 in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) at 30 °C. The rate of increase of A270 was measured after the addition of PON1 in negligible volume. Background-corrected activity was determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.31 (mm)–1 cm–1, 1 unit corresponding to 1 micromole of phenyl acetate hydrolyzed per min. PAF hydrolyzing activity of PAF-AH was determined as described (28Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using [3H]acetyl-PAF and C18 cartridges for substrate-product separation. Enzyme Incubations with PCOOH and with Peroxidized LDL—A typical reaction mixture for testing lipolytic activity of nPON1 or rPON1 contained 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm DFO, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, enzyme sample, and PCOOH (75 μm, added last) in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). GSH (5 mm) or cysteine (10 mm) was included when peroxidatic activity was checked for. Reaction mixtures for assessing lipolytic activity of rPAF-AH contained 0.1 mm DFO, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, enzyme sample (∼0.05 mg of protein/ml), and PCOOH (typically 75 μm) in Chelex-treated PBS (pH 7.4). For Km and Vmax determinations on PON1 or PAF-AH, [PCOOH] was varied over the 5–500 μm range and initial rates were calculated from PCOOH decay rate constants. Where indicated, [14C]PC or [14C]PCOOH was used instead of unlabeled PCOOH. Photoperoxidized LDL (∼1 mg of protein/ml) was used as a test substrate in other experiments with rPAF-AH; Igepal CA-630 was omitted in this case. Starting volume for all reaction mixtures was typically 0.5 ml. At various time points during incubation at 37 °C, 50-μl aliquots were removed, diluted with 0.2 ml of PBS, and extracted with 0.4 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A 0.2-ml portion of the organic phase was recovered, dried under N2, and analyzed by normalphase high performance thin layer chromatography, using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:38:3:1 by volume) as the mobile phase. After chromatography, peroxide analytes were visualized by spraying the plate with TPD as described (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the overall procedure being referred to as HPTLC-TPD. When [14C]PC or [14C]PCOOH was used as a substrate, extracted lipids were chromatographed similarly and detected by means of phosphorimaging; this procedure is referred to as HPTLC-PI (29Korytowski W. Wrona M. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Statistics—The two-tailed Student's t test was used for determining the significance of perceived differences between experimental values, p ≥ 0.05 being considered statistically insignificant. Reactivity of Natural PON1 Preparations with PCOOH—The specific hydrolytic activity of freshly prepared nPON1 was found to be ∼600 units/mg of protein using phenyl acetate as substrate and ∼0.2 unit/mg of protein using PAF (Table 1), in good agreement with previous determinations (5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Teiber J.F. Draganov D.I. La Du B. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2260-2268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These assays were carried out in the absence of metal ion chelators, PON1 requiring Ca2+ for both structural stability and catalysis (1Mackness M.I. Arrol S. Durrington P.N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas PAF-AH does not (28Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when PCOOH was tested as a substrate it was necessary to prevent, or at least minimize, any non-enzymatic peroxide turnover catalyzed by redox metal ions such as iron and copper. This was especially important when a reductant like GSH was used in reaction mixtures because these metals can catalyze the one-electron reductive degradation of LOOHs to free radical species (31Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chelators DFO and EDTA were included to block any redox cycling of iron and copper, respectively (32Halliwell B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In the case of nPON1, the chelator concentrations used (10% of [CaCl2]) were sufficient to inactivate trace metal ion contaminants while not interfering with Ca2+-dependent esterase activity (results not shown).TABLE 1Comparative hydrolytic activities of nPON1, rPON1, and rPAF-AH with different substratesEnzymeSpecific activityPhenyl acetateaOne unit of activity represents 1 μmol of phenyl acetate hydrolyzed per min at 25 °C.PAFbOne unit of activity represents 1 μmol of PAF hydrolyzed per min at 37 °C.PCOOHcOne unit of activity represents 1 nmol of PCOOH hydrolyzed per min at 37 °C.units/mg proteinnPON1579 ± 410.2 ± 0.10.11 ± 0.04rPON15.0 ± 0.1 × 105NDdND, not detectable.NDdND, not detectable.rPAF-AHNDdND, not detectable.156 ± 1083 ± 12a One unit of activity represents 1 μmol of phenyl acetate hydrolyzed per min at 25 °C.b One unit of activity represents 1 μmol of PAF hydrolyzed per min at 37 °C.c One unit of activity represents 1 nmol of PCOOH hydrolyzed per min at 37 °C.d ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab In initial experiments testing nPON1 reactivity with PCOOH, we used HPTLC with TPD spraying for substrate/product analysis. Hydroperoxides oxidize TPD to its purple radical cation (Wurster's blue), which can be quantitated by densitometric scanning with appropriate measures to maximize analyte signals relative to background (19Kriska T. Girotti A.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown by the HPTLC-TPD profiles in Fig. 1A, a control without nPON1 showed no change in PCOOH band intensity over a 4 h incubation period, whereas the nPON1-containing system showed a progressive loss of PCOOH with reciprocal accumulation of a more mobile peroxide species. The latter co-migrated with authentic OAOOH. Thus, phospholipase A2-like action on the peroxidized sn-2 oleoyl moiety of PCOOH was apparent. Lyso-PC, which migrated below PCOOH and was visualized by exposing the plate to I2 vapors (not shown), accumulated concurrently with OAOOH in the PON1 system. A plot of the HPTLC-TPD data revealed that nPON1-stimulated PCOOH decay occurred with apparent first-order rate kinetics (Fig. 1B), the rate constant for the system described being ∼4.2 × 10–3 min–1. From this, we calculated a specific activity of 0.11 unit/mg of protein (Table 1). When 5 mm GSH (Fig. 1B) or 10 mm cysteine (not shown) was included in the reaction mixture, there was no significant change in the rate of PCOOH disappearance, suggesting that peroxidatic action, at least that stimulated by thiol reductants, played no significant role. Boiling a sample of nPON1 for 5 min resulted in complete loss of apparent lipolytic activity (not shown), which argues that this activity was enzymatic rather than non-enzymatic. As shown in Fig. 2A, the initial rate of PCOOH loss with increasing substrate concentration at a given nPON1 level exhibited saturation kinetics, the Km value obtained from a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data (Fig. 2A, inset) being ∼95 μm.FIGURE 2Kinetic relationships for nPON1- and rPAF-AH-stimulated PCOOH hydrolysis. Initial velocity of HPTLC-TPD-assessed PCOOH loss is plotted as a function of increasing initial [PCOOH] for reaction mixtures containing nPON1 (2.7 mg of protein/ml) (A) or rPAF-AH (25 μg of protein/ml) (B).

The phospholipase PAF-AH was considered to be a good candidate because earlier studies (5Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3937-3947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) showed that it co-purifies with conventionally prepared nPON1 and is responsible for the hydrolytic inactivation of PAF and oxidatively fragmented PAF-like phospholipids, effects that that previously been attributed to PON1 (6Watson A.D.

Myofibroblasts are characterized by de novo expression of smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA), which correlates with the extent of disease progression, although their exact role is unknown. In vitro cultured myofibroblasts from kidney of SMαA knock-out mice demonstrate significantly more prominent cell motility, proliferation, and type-I procollagen expression than those of wild-type myofibroblasts. These pro-fibrotic properties are suppressed by adenovirus-mediated SMαA re-expression, accompanied by down-regulation of focal adhesion proteins.

Tissue fibrosis, replacing functional normal parenchymal tissue, is a common feature of a variety of chronically failing organs, including interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and progressive renal disease. These are important problems in terms of both mortality and morbidity worldwide. Understanding regulatory mechanisms is necessary for investigation of therapeutic approaches to these diseases. “Myofibroblasts” appear in fibrosing tissues and characteristically show de novo expression of smooth muscle (SM) 2The abbreviations used are: SM, smooth muscle; SMαA, smooth muscle α-actin; FA, focal adhesion; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MT, Masson's trichrome; UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; HVGN, Habu-venom glomerulonephritis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; WT, wild type; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. -related proteins, including smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA) (1Tomasek J.J.

Myofibroblasts are a specific cell population that has both fibroblastic and SM-like properties, thought to be a source of inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix in diseased conditions of various organs. These properties of myofibroblasts are common regardless of the affected organs; however, origins of myofibroblasts are quite diverse: stellate cells in liver and pancreas (2McCrudden R. Iredale J.P. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 1159-1168PubMed Google Scholar, 3Menke A. Adler G. Int. J. Gastrointest.

Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: S190-S197PubMed Google Scholar), and renal interstitial fibroblasts (6Diamond J.R. van Goor H. Ding G. Engelmyer E. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 121-129PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, bone marrow-derived cells have been implicated as a substantial source of myofibroblasts in some organs (7Forbes S.J. Russo F.P. Rey V. Burra P. Rugge M. Wright N.A. Alison M.R.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition from tubular epithelial cells is also supposed as a pathway for renal interstitial myofibroblast generation (10Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). SMαA expression is the most well known characteristic and widely used marker of myofibroblasts. In vitro SMαA molecules incorporated into actin filaments have functions in contracting collagen gel (11Hinz B. Celetta G. Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) and retarding motility by increasing cell adhesion onto extracellular matrix (12Ronnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These contractile functions serve wound repair processes of skin or connective tissues by generating a closing force; however, for other visceral organs, such as lung, liver, and kidney, the role of their myogenic properties is not understood in pathological states. We have investigated the transcriptional mechanism of SMαA gene (Acta2) in renal myofibroblasts (13Kawada N. Moriyama T. Ando A. Koyama T. Hori M. Miwa T. Imai E. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2338-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Takeji M. Kawada N. Moriyama T. Nagatoya K. Oseto S. Akira S. Hori M. Imai E. Miwa T. J. Am. Soc.

Rodent unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), characterized by a diffuse and extensive emergence of renal interstitial myofibroblasts in a short period, initiated by a simple procedure (15Klahr S. Morrissey J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F861-F875Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), is a good model for studying tissue fibrosis. Using the UUO model, this study aims to elucidate the exact function of SMαA in myofibroblasts in the course of tissue fibrosis, using SMαA knockout mice and the adenoviral SMαA gene transfer method. Its unanticipated importance against progressive tissue fibrosis is reported. SMαA-/- Mice and Cultured Mesangial Cells—Wild-type (WT) and SMαA knock-out (SMαA-/-) mice were produced by mating SMαA heterozygous (SMαA+/-), 129-background mice generously provided by Dr. R. J. Schwartz (Baylor College of Medicine) (16Schildmeyer L.A. Braun R. Taffet G. Debiasi M. Burns A.E. Bradley A. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Handling and surgical manipulation of all experimental animals were carried out according to the guidelines of the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of Osaka University. Primary culture of mesangial cells was established from kidneys of these mice as described previously (17Moriyama T. Fujibayashi M. Fujiwara Y. Kaneko T. Xia C. Imai E. Kamada T. Ando A. Ueda N. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar), maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 17% FCS unless otherwise mentioned, and utilized as cultured myofibroblasts. Cell Proliferation and Migration Assay—Cell proliferation was evaluated by determining viable cell number colorimetrically, using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), generally according to the product instructions. 2 × 102 cells were seeded in each well of 96-well plates and incubated in 17% FCS-RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h, followed by 0.5% FCS incubation to stop their proliferation for 24 h. Medium was then replaced by fresh 10% FCS or 0.5% FCS RPMI 1640, and 24 h later absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Cell migration was evaluated by scrape wounding assay. Subconfluent cells on a 35-mm-diameter dish were scraped to make a straight-edged wound using a plastic tip, incubated in RPMI 1640 medium 0.5% FCS to avoid the effect of proliferation, and monitored periodically by light microscope. Mouse Models for Renal Interstitial Fibrosis and Mesangioproliferative Glomerulonephritis—As a model for progressive renal interstitial fibrosis, UUO was performed in 8-week-old male WT and SMαA-/- mice. The operation procedure was as described previously (13Kawada N. Moriyama T. Ando A. Koyama T. Hori M. Miwa T. Imai E. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2338-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital and inhalation of diethyl ether. After making a small ventral incision, the left ureter was identified and ligated. Kidney samples were harvested 2, 3, 7, or 14 days after operation (n = 5-7 each). Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis was made by Habu-snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) venom injection (Habu-venom glomerulonephritis; HVGN) as described previously (14Takeji M. Kawada N. Moriyama T. Nagatoya K. Oseto S. Akira S. Hori M. Imai E. Miwa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8-week-old male mice were hemi-nephrectomized and received an intravenous injection of lyophilized venom from Habu-snake (Wako, Japan) dissolved in saline at 1.5 mg/kg body weight. Kidney samples were harvested 7 days after injection. Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells were scraped, suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamide, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA and then homogenized. Protein concentration was measured by the Lowry method. Five μg of protein/well was electrophoresed in 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were probed with primary antibody; mouse monoclonal anti-SM α-actin antibody (clone 1A4) (DAKO), anti-β actin antibody (clone AC15) (Sigma), anti-paxillin antibody (clone 5H11) (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) antibody (clone 4.47) (Upstate Biotech., Lake Placid, NY), or rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma), goat anti-vinculin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Tyr397-phospho-FAK antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology). Antibodies were reacted with a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody, or rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin antibody (Amersham Biosciences), detected by chemiluminescence of ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and then exposed to Hyperfilm. Immunostaining and Histopathological Analysis—Cultured cells on fibronectin-coated culture slides (BD Biosciences) were fixed with an ice-cold 1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol for 20 min. Kidney tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight or for SMαA staining by methacarn (10% acetic acid and 30% chloroform in methanol) for 3 h. Tissues were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned to 2-mm thickness. Stress fiber was stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). The proportion of fibrosis area in UUO kidney section was calculated from the blue-stained area in Masson's trichrome (MT) staining using MacSCOPE software (Mitani Corp.). Proliferating cell number was counted by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells per high magnification field, stained by anti-PCNA antibody (Immunotech). Mesangial proliferation was evaluated by counting the number of mesangial cell nucleoli in periodic acid-Schiff-stained sections. Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—Ad-mSMαA was developed generally according to the method of Graham and Prevec (18Graham F.L. Prevec L. Bio/Technology. 1992; 20: 363-390PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, we first amplified murine SMαA cDNA (from bp +63 to bp +1268, fully including the translated region between bp +72 and bp +1205) using pCR-Blunt II-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) and cloned downstream of the CMV promoter region of pACCMV.pLpA shuttle vector. Next, pACCMV.pLpA with SMαA cDNA inserted and pJM17 vector (a replication-defective adenoviral genome vector with deleted E1 and mutated E3 promoter regions) were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells to induce recombination to develop CMV promoter-driven SMαA cDNA-expressing adenoviral vector. The vector was then amplified and purified, and its infectivity was measured by plaque assay. When Ad-mSMαA was transfected into SMαA-/--cultured myofibroblasts at a multiplicity of infection of 300 PFU/cell, more than 90% of cells expressed SMαA protein with no apparent cytotoxicity. Another adenoviral vector, Ad-LacZ, was a generous gift from Dr. T. Mano (Osaka University) (19Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), used as a control for nonspecific effects of adenoviral infection. To transfer genes in vitro, subconfluent mesangial cells were rinsed twice with PBS(+), incubated with serum-free medium containing adenovector for 1 h at room temperature. After removing the adenoviral medium, cells were cultured in medium with 0.5% FCS for 7 days, and then RNA and cell lysates were collected. For in vivo gene transfer when operating for UUO, adenoviral vector solution (6 × 107 PFU in 50 μl of saline/individual kidney) was injected intraparenchymally with a 30-gauge needle separately at two points while clamping the renal artery and renal vein for 3 min to minimize adenoviral vector flowing immediately out of the kidney (n = 5-6 each). RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—RNA from mouse kidneys and cultured cells was collected as described previously (14Takeji M. Kawada N. Moriyama T. Nagatoya K. Oseto S. Akira S. Hori M. Imai E. Miwa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of RNA, MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), dNTP, and random hexamer. Sequences of primers for semiquantitative PCR are indicated in Table 1A. Semiquantitative PCR was carried out with 1 μl of template cDNA, primers (10 pmol each), dNTP, and ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.) in a final volume of 20 μl. Thermal cycler conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 56-59 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with appropriate cycle numbers. To perform real-time quantitative PCR, ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) was used with 50 μl of final volume containing 5 μl of template cDNA, solution, 10 pmol primers, labeled probe, 25 μl of Platinum Quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen). PCR primer and probe sequences for real-time PCR are shown in Table 1, B and C. Thermal cycler conditions were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, followed by 1 min at 60 °C.TABLE 1Oligo DNA sequences for RT-PCR(A) Primer sequences for semiquantitative RT-PCRForwardReverseGAPDHAATGCATCCTGCACCACCAAGTAGCCATATTCATTGTCATASMαAAGATTGTCCGTGACATCAAGGTTGTGTGCTAGAGGCAGAGCSMγAAGTGTGACATTGACATCCGCTGGTGACCAAGTCTTGTGGSM1TAGCCAAGAAGCTGGTGTGGTGCTTCTGTAGGCTGTGTCGSM22αTTCTCTGCCTCAACATGGCTTCTCAGGCACCTTCACTGGSkαATGGACTTCGAGAATGAGATGGTCGTCCTGAGGAGAGAGAGCCRP1GAGCGAGTGACTTCACTAGGCAACATGGCGGAGTAGCAGGCRP2CAACATGTGTCCTCGATGCCTCCTCCACCACTTAGGTCCMyocardinTGTTAGCTGCTGTCCTCTGGTGAGCAGTTGGAATGGACCSRFACACGACCTTCAGCAAGAGGATTCACTCTTGGTGCTGTGG(B) Primer sequences for real-time quantitative RT-PCRForwardReverseGAPDHAGTATGACTCCACTCACGGCAATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATGGTSMαAATCGTCCACCGCAAATGCAAGGAACTGGAGGCGCTGProcollagen I (α2)TGCTGCTTGCAGTAACGTCGTCAACACCATCTCTGCCTCG(C) Probe sequences for real-time quantitative RT-PCRGAPDHAACGGCACAGTCAAGGCCGAGAATSMαATAAGTCCCCCCTGCTCTGCCTCTAGCProcollagen I (α2)ACTGGAGACAGAGGACCGCGTGGAC Open table in a new tab Myogenic Gene Expression in SMαA-/- Myofibroblasts—SMαA-/- mice had no leaky expression of SMαA mRNA in all checked tissues, and primary kidney cells cultured by our method demonstrated positive staining for desmin, which is regarded as one of the markers for mesangial cells (data not shown). Cultured mesangial cells show general characteristics of myofibroblasts; therefore, they were used as cultured myofibroblasts for the following experiments. Cultured myofibroblasts from SMαA-/- mouse kidney had more sparse stress fibers in cytoplasm than WT, which seemed due to lack of SMαA (Fig. 1A). SMαA-/- myofibroblasts showed complete disappearance of SMαA expression but enhancement of other SM-related gene expression, including SM γ-actin (SMγA), SM myosin heavy chain isoform 1 (SM1), and another actin isoform, skeletal muscle α-actin (SkαA) (Fig. 1B). This result suggests the existence of some compensatory mechanism for maintaining SM phenotype and cellular actin content. Cysteine-rich LIM-only protein (CRP) 1 and myocardin, SM-specific transcriptional cofactors (20Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B. Wu S.P. Dong X.R. Marx J.G. Moore M.S. Beckerle M.C.

Dev. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), were not detected in either WT or SMαA-/- myofibroblasts by RT-PCR, whereas expression of CRP2 was observed in WT myofibroblasts but was down-regulated under SMαA deficiency (Fig. 1C). Enhanced Interstitial Fibrosis and Mesangial Proliferation in Renal Disease Models of SMαA-/- Mice—There were no overt macroscopic or microscopic differences between WT and SMαA-/- kidney. Therefore, UUO, which causes artificial hydronephrosis and is the most common experimental model for renal interstitial fibrosis (15Klahr S. Morrissey J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F861-F875Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), was performed on both WT and SMαA-/- mice. For WT kidney under physiological conditions, SMαA immunostaining was only seen in VSMCs of blood vessels but was newly observed in renal interstitium on UUO day 7, indicating the emergence of myofibroblasts (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no SMαA immunostaining was seen in either physiological or UUO kidneys of SMαA-/- mice. The proportion of fibrosis area calculated from the blue-stained area of MT staining was more extensive in SMαA-/- mice than WT mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Interstitial proliferating cells estimated from proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cell count in UUO kidney on day 7 was significantly higher in SMαA-/- mice than WT mice (Fig. 2C). In fibrotic tissue, type-I collagen is the main extracellular matrix protein, composed of procollagen α1(I) and α2(I) chains processed from the products of genes Col1a1 and Col1a2. In the UUO model, expression of type-I procollagen (α2) mRNA increased with time. Type-I procollagen (α2) mRNA in SMαA-/- mouse UUO kidney on days 7 and 14 was raised to about twice the level found in WT UUO kidney (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that SMαA deficiency promotes the increase in myofibroblasts and progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. Next, we performed HVGN to see the difference in the progression of glomerulonephritis between SMαA-/- and WT mice. In HVGN, normal mesangial cells transdifferentiate into SMαA-positive myofibroblasts and exhibit prominent cell proliferation (14Takeji M. Kawada N. Moriyama T. Nagatoya K. Oseto S. Akira S. Hori M. Imai E. Miwa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Glomerular mesangial cell number was significantly more increased in SMαA-/- mice than WT mice (39.3 ± 5.0 versus 31.7 ± 5.3) (Fig. 3). Therefore, SMαA deficiency also promotes progression of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Myofibroblast Activity Is Diminished by Forced SMαA Re-expression—Both WT and SMαA-/- cultured myofibroblasts show no evidence of proliferation in 0.5% FCS RPMI medium. SMαA-/- myofibroblasts showed more vigorous proliferating activity than WT cells (153 ± 28% versus 117 ± 23%) after 10% FCS stimulation for 24 h compared with incubation without stimulation, as measured by formazan colorimetric assay. Their enhanced proliferation was blunted to a degree comparable with WT cells with forced SMαA re-expression by transfection of adenoviral vector (Ad-mSMαA), which effectively expresses murine SMαA downstream of the CMV promoter (Fig. 4A). Type-I procollagen (α2) mRNA expression was enhanced in SMαA-/- cultured myofibroblasts 2.2-fold more than in WT cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with in vivo UUO data. When SMαA was re-expressed in SMαA-/- myofibroblasts, type-I procollagen mRNA expression was reduced to a similar extent as in WT myofibroblasts. Migration is an important property of active myofibroblast. In wound scrape assay, SMαA-/- cultured myofibroblasts also demonstrated more enhanced migration than quite slow migration of WT cells in minimum (0.5%) FCS medium, used to avoid effects from cell division. Forced re-expression of SMαA in SMαA-/- myofibroblasts slowed their enhanced migration (Fig. 4C). Enhanced myofibroblast migration is related to accelerated tissue fibrosis in several organs (22Bonner J.C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 255-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 23Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) although the relation is still not shown in kidney UUO model. It seems that enhanced migration accelerates the accumulation of myofibroblasts to the inflammation site in kidney. Ad-LacZ, an adenoviral vector expressing β-galactosidase from the same CMV promoter, was used as a control for adenoviral infection. Transfection of Ad-LacZ into myofibroblasts at the same multiplicity of infection as Ad-mSMαA had no significant influence on their proliferation, type-I procollagen mRNA expression, or migration. These results indicate that expression of SMαA affects suppression of proliferation, procollagen synthesis, and migration of myofibroblasts. Down-regulation of Focal Adhesion Proteins in Myofibroblasts by SMαA Introduction—Focal adhesion (FA) cell membrane protein complex, which links intracellular cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, mediates not only motility force but also extracellular signals. FA includes FAK, which is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. FAK is involved in integrin-related and other cell surface receptor-related signal transduction and is reported to be regulated by the status of the actin cytoskeleton (24Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 25Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Compared with WT myofibroblasts, SMαA-/- cells had prominently up-regulated FA complex proteins, FAK, phosphorylated FAK at Tyr397, which is the key autophosphorylation site for its activity, paxillin, and vinculin (Fig. 5). When SMαA was forcibly re-expressed in SMαA-/- myofibroblasts, FAK, Tyr397-phosphorylated FAK, paxillin, and vinculin were clearly diminished. In these conditions, there was not a large difference in total actin proteins. These findings suggest that SMαA expression in myofibroblasts down-regulates cellular FA protein contents. In Vivo Adenoviral SMαA Gene Transfer Ameliorates Renal Fibrosis—As the above in vitro results suggested the possibility of ameliorating tissue fibrosis by forced SMαA expression, Ad-mSMαA was introduced into mouse kidney and its effect on interstitial fibrosis was examined. Intraparenchymal Ad-mSMαA injection induced SMαA expression in interstitial fibroblasts of SMαA-/- UUO kidneys as early as day 2, although WT non-injected UUO kidneys had no SMαA staining in the interstitium on the same day (Fig. 6A). SMαA expression induced by Ad-mSMαA was observed to persist until day 7 in SMαA-/- UUO kidneys (Fig. 6B). Analysis of the extent of renal disease progression for SMαA-/- UUO kidneys with forced SMαA re-expression demonstrated a significantly diminished interstitial fibrosis area and type-I procollagen mRNA expression in renal tissue to almost half the level of non-injected UUO kidneys. Also, SMαA overexpression in WT UUO kidneys ameliorated interstitial fibrosis, and type-I procollagen mRNA expression in renal tissue was reduced to about one-third of noninjected UUO kidneys (Fig. 6, D and E). Collectively, this amelioration of tissue fibrosis appears attributable to suppression of myofibroblast expansion and collagen synthesis by forced SMαA expression. Interestingly, Ad-mSMαA-transfected WT kidneys 7 days after UUO showed paradoxically less total SMαA-positive area and SMαA mRNA expression compared with both non-injected and Ad-LacZ-injected WT UUO kidneys (Fig. 6, B and C). The CMV promoter in Ad-mSMαA vector drives SMαA gene expression strongly and constitutively, whereas the proper promoter in SMαA gene shows spatiotemporally regulated gene activation. The earlier expression of SMαA forced by Ad-mSMαA was observed compared with non-transfected WT UUO kidneys (Fig. 6A) that may have suppressed expansion and pro-fibrotic activity in interstitial fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, which express SMαA and other SM-related proteins, appear in various pathological states, including connective tissue granulation, fibrotic diseases, and stroma reaction to neoplasia (1Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the role of SMαA in these conditions. In fibrotic diseases of several organs, SMαA expression of myofibroblasts is recognized as a hallmark of their emergence and an indicator of disease severity (1Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar, 26Badid C. Vincent M. Fouque D. Laville M. Desmouliere A. Renal Fail. 2001; 23: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the role of SM-related proteins in the pathogenesis of fibrosis has been poorly elucidated. The present study demonstrates that SMαA deficiency enhances the progression of kidney diseases in two models, interstitial fibrosis (UUO) and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (HVGN) (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting the role of SMαA in myofibroblast is common in both mesangial and interstitial lesions. Tissue fibrosis is ameliorated by forced expression of SMαA in renal interstitial myofibroblasts. Recently, reports have shown that contractile, plus proliferative and/or collagen-producing, properties do not coincide or are differentially exhibited in myofibroblasts under certain conditions (27Okada H. Ban S. Nagao S. Takahashi H. Suzuki H. Neilson E.G. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Grotendorst G.R. Rahmanie H. Duncan M.R. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). VSMCs, which physiologically express abundant SM contraction-related proteins including SMαA, modulate their phenotype from “contractile type” to “synthetic type” under pathological conditions such as atherosclerotic lesions (29Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10018) Google Scholar). To date, several transcription factors related to VSMC differentiation have been demonstrated to inhibit VSMC proliferation, migration, and progression of arteriosclerosis (19Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Witzenbichler B. Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Le Roux A. Branellec D. Walsh K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that the contractile properties are distinct from proliferative, migratory, and synthetic properties. In addition, SMαA promoter has a target sequence of tumor suppressor protein p53 (31Comer K.A. Dennis P.A. Armstrong L. Catino J.J. Kastan M.B. Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and SMαA gene introduction into transformed fibroblasts reduces their proliferative properties (32Okamoto-Inoue M. Kamada S. Kimura G. Taniguchi S. Cancer Lett. 1999; 142: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Taking these findings together, we propose that the SM-like phenotype and productive phenotype are mutually opposed within myofibroblasts and that SMαA per se has the function of maintaining a cell in a static state. FA complex consists of paxillin, vinculin, talin, plasma membrane integrins, and FAK and is linked to cytoplasmic actin fibers (24Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Several stimuli affecting integrin or changes in actin fiber status induce phosphorylation at several tyrosine residues of FAK, inducing active cell motility, cell cycle promotion, and protein (25Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Sundberg L.J. Galante L.M. Bill H.M. Mack C.P. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29783-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate the importance of FAK in the regulation of myofibroblast activation and collagen synthesis (34Thannickal V.J. Lee D.Y. White E.S. Cui Z. Larios J.M. Chacon R. Horowitz J.C.

Our results, decreasing of FA complex in myofibroblasts by SMαA expression, suggest the relationship between SMαA in actin stress fibers and FA. We think additional investigations about protein-protein interaction between SMαA and FA complex are necessary. Our results show no evident difference in other important receptor kinases for myofibroblast activity such as transforming growth factor β receptor type-I and platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (data not shown). In addition, Rho-GTPases are important downstream effectors of FAK on cell motility (36Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Our previous report demonstrated that inhibition of Rho-associated kinase attenuated renal interstitial fibrosis in the UUO model (37Nagatoya K. Moriyama T. Kawada N. Takeji M. Oseto S. Murozono T. Ando A. Imai E. Hori M. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 1684-1695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of this pathway in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Recent evidence has emerged indicating that actin molecules are abundant in the nucleus and perform functions in chromatin remodeling and gene activation (38Pederson T. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 140: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 39Bettinger B.T. Gilbert D.M. Amberg D.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). SMαA is reported to be a binding target of antioxidant-responsive element present in some genes (40Holderman M.T. Miller K.P. Dangott L.J. Ramos K.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although it is still unclear whether SMαA exists and has a specific function in the nucleus. This mechanism might also take part in the type of gene expression and proliferation reported here. SMαA-/- myofibroblasts interestingly demonstrated up-regulation of mRNA of other SM-related proteins and another myogenic isoform of actin, such as SMγA, SM1, and SkαA, presumably to compensate for the lack of SMαA. Similar compensatory expression systems have been reported in cardiomyocytes of cardiac α-actin knock-out mice (41Kumar A. Crawford K. Close L. Madison M. Lorenz J. Doetschman T. Pawlowski S. Duffy J. Neumann J. Robbins J. Boivin G.P. O'Toole B.A. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4406-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and in skeletal muscle of SkαA knock-out mice (42Crawford K. Flick R. Close L. Shelly D. Paul R. Bove K. Kumar A. Lessard J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5887-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), although the underlying transcriptional mechanisms have not been clarified. In addition, from the present findings expression of CRP1, CRP2, and myocardin, transcriptional co-factors for SM-specific gene expression in VSMCs (20Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B. Wu S.P. Dong X.R. Marx J.G. Moore M.S. Beckerle M.C. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), was not detected or up-regulated in SMαA-/- myofibroblasts (Fig. 1C); therefore, they do not seem responsible for the compensatory SM gene expression in these cells. These results suggest that different signaling systems from VSMCs predominate for other SM-related protein expression in myofibroblasts. The limitation in this experiment is the usage of somewhat conventional knock-out mice and an adenoviral gene transfer system. SMαA-/- mice physiologically exhibit lower blood pressure and poor responsiveness of arteries to vasoconstrictor agents (16Schildmeyer L.A. Braun R. Taffet G. Debiasi M. Burns A.E. Bradley A. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As fibrosis in the UUO kidney is triggered by vasoconstriction and a decrease in renal blood flow (15Klahr S. Morrissey J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F861-F875Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), plus is ameliorated by several blood pressure-lowering agents (43Kaneto H. Morrissey J. McCracken R. Reyes A. Klahr S. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 1637-1647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 44Ishidoya S. Morrissey J. McCracken R. Reyes A. Klahr S. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), these characteristics appear unlikely to contribute to renal fibrosis progression. It is also possible that the effect of SMαA deficiency is modulated by compensatory up-regulation of other SM-related proteins. However, this up-regulation seems not to contribute to the modulation of disease course, as SMαA gene transfer into UUO kidneys significantly ameliorated interstitial fibrosis in both WT and SMαA-/- mice. These results suggest a pivotal role for SMαA but not for other SM-related proteins. Inflammation evoked by adenovirus infection is reported as an important problem (45Liu Q. Muruve D.A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); however, there have been no reports on adenoviral vector-mediated fibrosis in mouse kidney and no apparent differences in mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor β1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 between non-injected and Ad-LacZ-injected UUO kidneys (data not shown). Of note, the present study showed that forced SMαA expression ameliorates tissue fibrosis in a kidney UUO model. However, in some pathological conditions such as contracture of skin scars, contraction force generated by SMαA plays a certain role in disease deterioration. Those may be beneficially influenced by SMαA deficiency. Appropriateness of SMαA introduction needs to be considered on an individual disease basis. In conclusion, SMαA in myofibroblasts appears to have a suppressing role in tissue fibrosis progression, demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses. These findings suggest several novel therapeutic approaches to myofibroblast-related fibrotic diseases: for example, enhancement of SMαA expression by gene transfer methods or by up-regulation of SM-related transcription factors.

Pr3 is stored as an active enzyme within the primary granules of human neutrophils, together with HNE and cathepsin G, and is released from activated cells as a free or membrane-bound protease (3Owen C.A.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Its three-dimensional structure is very similar to that of HNE, with which its sequence is 57% identical (5Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Pr3 and HNE also have extended interaction sites that greatly influence substrate binding and specificity (5Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The active sites of the two proteases are also very similar, and both preferentially accommodate small aliphatic residues in their S1 subsite 4The nomenclature used for the individual amino acid residues (e.g. P1, P2, etc.) of a substrate and corresponding residues of the enzyme subsites (e.g. S1, S2, and so on) is that of Schechter and Berger (44Schechter I.

This is why there was no substrate that discriminated between the two proteases until fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptides became available. These can be used to study the specificity on both sides of the cleavage site (8Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Hazouard E. Ferrandiere M. Jourdan M.L. Brillard-Bourdet M. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol.

However, kinetic and structural studies have shown that the substrate binding site in Pr3 is more polar, and some subsites are more restrictive than those in HNE (5Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M.

These make it a unique neutrophil protease, rather than a redundant enzyme, although the reasons for its specificity are not well understood. We have compared the electrostatic surface potentials in the substrate binding sites of Pr3 and HNE. The findings have been used to produce new Pr3 substrates with extended binding sites that could help explain the specific cleavage of biological protein substrates and identify new protein targets of pathophysiological relevance. Materials—Protease 3 (EC 3.4.21.76), human neutrophil elastase (EC 3.4.21.37), and α1-Pi were obtained from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Design and Synthesis of FRET Peptides—All Fmoc-protected amino acids were of the l-configuration and were purchased from Advanced Chemtech (Louisville, KY), Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK), and Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Abzpeptidyl-EDDnp fluorogenic substrates were prepared by solidphase synthesis with Fmoc methodology using an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Substrates were purified by semipreparative reversed-phase chromatography using a 50-min linear (0-100%) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and checked for homogeneity by analytic reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TofSpec-E, Micromass, Manchester, UK) or peptide sequencing (Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer) with the chemicals and program recommended by the manufacturer. Stock substrate solutions (2-5 mm) were prepared in 30% (v/v) N,N-dimethylformamide and diluted to 0.5 mm with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. Cys-containing substrate stock solutions were supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme Assays—Free Pr3 and HNE were measured in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 750 mm NaCl, supplemented with 0.05% Igepal CA-630 (v/v) to take into account the great propensity of these proteases to stick to plastic and glass surfaces when in dilute solution. Free Pr3 and HNE were titrated with α1-PI, the titer of which had been determined using bovine trypsin titrated with p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (24Serveau C. Moreau T. Zhou G.X. ElMoujahed A. Chao J. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A 1:1 stoichiometry was used for the HNE·inhibitor complex, whereas that for the Pr3·inhibitor complex was 1:1.3, to allow for partial α1-PI degradation via the substrate pathway. Trypsin was prepared as a 2 × 10-4 m stock solution in 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8:50, mm CaCl2, then used in the same buffer as HNE and Pr3. The hydrolysis of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates was followed by measuring the fluorescence at λex = 320 nm and λem = 420 nm in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. The system was standardized using Abz-FR-OH prepared by the total tryptic hydrolysis of an Abz-FR-pNA solution, and its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 410 nm, assuming E410nm = 8,800 m-1 for cm-1 p-nitroanilide. Concentrations of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrate were determined by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm, using E365nm = 17,300 m-1 cm-1 for EDDnp. Specificity constants (kcat/Km) were determined under first-order conditions using substrate concentrations far below the Km (maximum, 1 μm). Final Pr3 and HNE enzyme concentrations were 1-100 nm. Under these conditions, the Michaelis-Menten equation is reduced to: v = kobs·S, where kobs = Vm/Km. Integrating this equation over time gives ln(S) =-kobs·t + ln(S)0, with (S)0 and (S) being the substrate concentrations at time 0 and time t, respectively. Because Vm = kcat. (E)t, where (E)t is the final enzyme concentration, dividing kobs by (E)t gives the kcat/Km ratio. The kobs for the first-order substrate hydrolysis was calculated by fitting experimental data to the first-order equation using Enzfitter software (Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Km values were determined by measuring hydrolysis rates at five substrate concentrations from 0.5-20 μm. Chromatography and Analysis of Peptide Products—Fluorogenic substrates (5-8 μm final) were incubated with Pr3 or HNE (10-100 nm) in reaction buffer at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of absolute ethanol and incubating for 15 min on ice. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the hydrolysis products was dried under vacuum and dissolved in 200 μl of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Hydrolysis fragments were purified by reversed-phase chromatography on a C18 column (2.1 mm × 30 mm) using a P200 pump and a Spectrasystem UV3000 detector (TSP, Les Ulis, France). They were eluted at 0.3 ml/min with a linear (0-60%, v/v) gradient of acetonitrile in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. Eluted peaks were monitored at three wavelengths (220, 320, and 360 nm) simultaneously, which allowed the direct identification of EDDnp-containing peptides prior to sequencing. All cleavage sites were identified either by mass spectrometry or by N-terminal sequencing using an Applied Biosystems (Courtaboeuf, France) Procise 494 protein sequencer attached to a model 140C Micro-gradient System and a 610A Data Analysis System with the chemicals and program recommended by the manufacturer. Electrostatic Potential Calculations—The electrostatic potentials of Pr3 and HNE were calculated by the Poisson-Boltzmann method implemented in the Delphi module of Insight II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) using formal charges at pH 7.4 (arginine, lysine, N terminus, +1; glutamate, aspartate, and the C terminus, -1; and histidine, neutral), an ionic strength in the aqueous environment of 0.15 m, dielectric constants of 2 for the interior and 80 for the exterior of the protein, and a temperature of 300 K. The x-ray coordinates of HNE were extracted from the complex formed by HNE with the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor OMTKY-III (PDB ID 1PPF). The structure of Pr3 (PDB ID 1FUJ) was superimposed on that of HNE to visualize both molecules with the same orientation. The location of subsites S4 to S3′ in the active site of each protease was inferred from the position of the side chains of the corresponding P4-P3′ residues of OMT-III complexed with HNE. The solvent-accessible molecular surface was calculated and colored according to the electrostatic potential using Insight II (Accelrys Inc.). MD Simulations—The initial set of coordinates used for MD simulations were taken from the x-ray structures of Pr3 (PDB ID 1FUJ, resolution 2.2 Å) and HNE complexed with OMTKY-III (PDB ID 1PPF, resolution 1.8 Å). The complexes between enzymes and peptides were built and simulated using molecular dynamics as reported previously (25Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Gauthier F. Brandsdal B.O. Witko-Sarsat V. Reuter N. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed using version 2.5 of the NAMD program (26Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comp. Physiol. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), with version 27 of the Charmm force field (27MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B.

Chem. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11819) Google Scholar). Production runs were performed for 2000 ps once the systems had been heated up to 300 K and equilibrated for 100 ps. The MD simulations were validated using a strategy similar to that used earlier (25Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Gauthier F. Brandsdal B.O. Witko-Sarsat V. Reuter N. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The interactions between the enzymes and ligands were analyzed using Charmm to detect hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Differences in the Charge Distributions of Pr3 and HNE—Pr3 and HNE are homologous proteases that have evolved by gene duplication from a common ancestor and so are quite distinct from the main branches of the chymotrypsinogen superfamily of serine proteases (28Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar). Their sequences are 57% identical, and about half of the 61 residues that differ between the two proteases are charged residues, but only 10 are found at the same position in the whole sequences (Fig. 1A). The solvent-accessible surfaces in Pr3 and HNE show that Asp-61, Lys-99, and Arg-143 in Pr3 and Arg-217 in HNE are in the vicinity of the substrate binding site that extends from at least subsites S4 to S3′ (5Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). Both proteases also have a cluster of positively charged residues remote from the active site that could favor binding to negatively charged surfaces (Fig. 1, B and C). However this positive cluster is disrupted by negatively charged residues in Pr3 and is therefore smaller than that of HNE. Molecular dynamic simulations based on the three-dimensional structure of Pr3 show that subsites S1′ to S3′ in Pr3 are all in the vicinity of charged residues that are not present in HNE (Fig. 1). Asp-61 is close to the putative subsites S1′ and S3′ (Fig. 1B). Those have the same orientation and could influence the specificities for both P1′ and P3′ residues (5Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The residue at position 99, which is close to subsites S2 and S4, is a Lys in Pr3 and a Leu in HNE, whereas position 217 is occupied by a positively charged Arg residue in HNE and a hydrophobic Ile in Pr3 (Fig. 1, B and C). We studied the contribution of charged residues to the extended substrate binding sites in Pr3 and the importance of these charged residues for the specificity of Pr3 so as to better understand the intimate interaction of this protease with its biological target substrates and thus its particular biological function. FRET substrates with extended sequences on both sides of the cleavage site and MD simulations were used for this purpose. Prime Specificity: Contribution of Asp-61 to the Specificity of Pr3—Abz-VADCADQ-EDDnp (Table 1, substrate 2), which is cleaved at the C-A bond (29Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Moreau T. Godat E. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was used as the lead substrate. We introduced additional residues at P3′ in this substrate and measured the specificity constants kcat/Km. Positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral residues (Table 1, substrate 3-5) were all accepted at P3′ and improved the specificity constant significantly over to that of the lead substrate. This suggests that ionic interactions involving residue P3′ and Asp-61 are not essential for substrate binding but that elongation of the peptide chain helps to stabilize the substrate, thus improving catalytic efficiency. HNE did not significantly hydrolyze these elongated substrates (Table 1).TABLE 1Specificity constants kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of FRET substrates derived from the CrmA reactive loop by protease 3 and elastaseNo.SubstrateProtease 3Elastasekcat/KmKmkcat/KmmM−1·s−1mMmM−1·s−1↓1Abz-VADCAQ-EDDnpaValues are from Korkmaz et al.

Open table in a new tab Asp-61 also lies in the vicinity of the S1′ subsite and may be an important residue in the S1′ site of Pr3 (25Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Gauthier F. Brandsdal B.O. Witko-Sarsat V. Reuter N. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because there is no negatively charged residue at that position in HNE, we checked the contribution of this residue to the Pr3 P1′ specificity. Both positively charged and negatively charged residues were accepted at P1′ (Table 1, substrates 6 and 7), but the kcat/Km was about ten times greater for the substrate containing P1′-Arg. Because polar interactions can modify even distant recognition subsites (25Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Gauthier F. Brandsdal B.O. Witko-Sarsat V. Reuter N. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we checked the influence of positively and negatively charged residues at P1′ on the specificity constants using a substrate that had no other charge from P3 to P3′ and that was cleaved at the same site by both Pr3 and HNE. The P1′-Met of the monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor-derived substrate Abz-GIATFCMLMPEQ-EDDnp was replaced by either an Arg or an Asp (Table 2). A positively charged residue remained the preferred residue at position P1′ for Pr3 hydrolysis, whereas HNE had no preference at that position (Table 2, substrates 9 and 10). This emphasizes the importance of the S1′ subsite for Pr3 specificity even though an electrostatic interaction at S1′ in the Pr3 active site is not a prerequisite for substrate binding. A positively charged residue at P2′ in the monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor-derived substrate resulted in a marked decrease in the kcat/Km for Pr3 but not for HNE (Table 2, substrate 11), confirming previous indication of the importance of Pr3 Arg-143 for P2′ specificity (29Korkmaz B.

Open table in a new tab The interactions between Pr3·HNE and the same substrates were derived from MD simulations (25Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Gauthier F. Brandsdal B.O. Witko-Sarsat V. Reuter N. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); we identified and analyzed all hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and hydrophobic interactions between enzymes and substrates during the simulations. The snapshots of the complexes at the end of the MD simulations (Fig. 2) highlight the partners of the substrates when they bind to the enzymes. The lead substrate (Table 2, substrate 8, and Fig. 2, A and B) binds to Pr3 and HNE in a favorable way, similar to what we have described earlier (25Hajjar E. Korkmaz B. Gauthier F. Brandsdal B.O. Witko-Sarsat V. Reuter N. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pr3 interacted with the nonprime side of substrate 8 via strong H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions (between P5-Ile and Trp-218, between P3-Thr and Val-216 and between Lys-99 and both residues P4 and P2 of the substrate) (Fig. 2A). The durable H-bonds between P1-Cys and the backbone of both Gly-193 and Ser-195 stabilized the oxyanion hole in Pr3 and the prime side of substrate 8 binds Pr3 via strong H-bonds between P2′-Leu and Phe-41 and between the side chains of P5′-Glu and Arg-143. As shown in Fig. 2B, the interactions between substrate 8 and HNE were weaker though very similar to the ones described for Pr3; the oxyanion hole was stabilized via proper interactions at P1; H-bonds between P5-Ile and Arg-217 and between P3-Thr and Val-216 were observed at the nonprime side and between P2′-Leu and the backbone of Phe-41, P6′-Gln, and Asn-61 at the prime side. MD simulations of Pr3 bound to substrates 9 and 10 were analyzed to determine the importance of the P1′ position. The resulting interaction networks of substrates 9 and 10 with Pr3 were quite similar to that between Pr3 and substrate 8 described above, except that the interaction between the prime side (in particular P5′) of the substrate and Arg-143 was less strong (Fig. 2, C and D). The main differences were caused by the nature of the residue at P1′. When P1′ was negatively charged (substrate 10) it formed a strong H-bond (lifetime >40%) with Arg-60 of Pr3. But when P1′ was an arginine (substrate 9), there were strong interactions (H-bonds lifetime >80%) with the polar charged side chain of Asp-61 in Pr3. Because these interactions involved residues of opposite charges, they probably helped to stabilize the enzyme·substrate complexes. The network of hydrogen bonds between the residues of the catalytic triad is an indication of how well the active site was preserved in each of the complexes; the lifespans of hydrogen bonds crucial for the catalytic reaction during the MD simulations are reported in Table 3. When Pr3 was complexed with the three substrates 8-10, there were durable hydrogen bonds between the three residues of the catalytic triad, showing that the active site is not disrupted by the different residues at P1′.TABLE 3Catalytic triade hydrogen bond networksAtom nameSubstrate numberPr3HNENϵ2His-57-OγSer-19589989997109611794139299149996Oδ1Asp-102-Nδ1His-5786376991107811078134788148387Oδ2Asp-102-Nδ1His-5788077964105611079137063145664 Open table in a new tab We then modeled the complex between Pr3·HNE and substrate 11 to investigate the consequences of having a positively charged residue (Lys) at P2′. Fig. 2 (E and F) shows a snapshot of the complexes with Pr3 and HNE. There was a strong repulsion between P2′-Lys and Arg-143 of Pr3. This repulsion was probably the reason why the tail of the substrate became exposed to solvent. There was no interaction of its negatively charged residue at P5 with Arg-143. In addition, there were new H-bonds and hydrophobic contacts between the essential histidine of the active site of Pr3 and the P2, P1, and P1′ residues of the substrate. For example, the H-bond between P1-Cys and the Nϵ of His-57 was present for 98% of the simulation time. These interactions competed with the hydrogen bond network of the catalytic triad, which was consequently greatly disrupted; the calculated lifespans of the His-Ser and Ser-Asp hydrogen bonds (Table 3) during the simulations were 7% and 0%, respectively. In contrast, the interaction network between substrate 11 and HNE (Fig. 2F) was very similar to that between HNE and substrate 8, described above (Fig. 2B). The only differences were a loss of the H-bond between Asn-61 and P6′, a reduction in the hydrophobic contacts between Phe-41 and both P1′ and P2′, and unexpected hydrophobic contacts between P1′ and Gly-193 and between P4′ and Gly-39. The H-bond network in the catalytic triad of HNE was not disrupted by the presence of substrate 11 (Table 3). Nonprime Pr3 Specificity: Influence of the Lys-99/Leu and Ile-217/Arg Substitutions in Pr3 and HNE—Another critical difference between the electrostatic surfaces of Pr3 and HNE is at position 99, where Pr3 has a charged Lys residue and HNE has a Leu. We replaced the P2-Asp residue by an Arg residue in the lead Pr3 substrate Abz-VADCRDRQ-EDDnp (substrate 6). The specificity constant measured using Abz-VARCRDRQ-EDDnp (Table 4, substrate 12), was 60-times lower than that with Abz-VADCRDRQ-ED"

Surprisingly, the viral genome contains a cluster of putative sphingolipid biosynthetic genes not found in other viral genus. To address the role of these genes in viral pathogenesis, the ehv050 gene predicted to encode a serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis, was expressed and characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Sequence alignment and mutational analysis showed that the N-terminal domain of the viral protein most closely resembled the LCB2 subunit and the C-terminal domain most closely resembled the LCB1 subunit. Regardless of whether the viral protein was expressed as a single polypeptide or as two independent domains, it exhibited an unusual preference for myristoyl-CoA rather than palmitoyl-CoA. This preference was reflected by the increased presence of C16-sphingoid bases in yeast cells expressing the viral protein.

Sphingolipids are essential structural components of membranes, are enriched in lipid rafts, and have been implicated as important second messengers in many signaling processes. In addition, defects in sphingolipid metabolism are responsible for a variety of diseases. The enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) 2The abbreviations used are: SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; vSPT, EhV-86 virally encoded SPT; LCB, long chain base; PHS, phytosphingosine; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; ORF, open reading frame; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. catalyzes the rate-limiting step of sphingolipid synthesis. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the intact enzyme contains two polypeptide chains, and there is no evidence for posttranslational modification of either chain. The prokaryotic enzyme is a soluble homodimer containing two symmetric active sites (1Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes there is substantial evidence that the enzyme is an endoplasmic reticular (ER)-localized heterodimer containing a single catalytic site formed at the interface between the subunits (2Hanada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1632: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 3Hanada K. Nishijima M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 228: 163-174PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E.

It has also been shown that in addition to its ability to catalyze the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA, the eukaryotic enzyme can catalyze the condensation of serine with other acyl-CoAs (5Merrill Jr., A.H. Williams R.D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the importance of this enzyme, little is known about its structural organization and regulation. Recently, the sequence of a coccolithoviral genome, EhV-86, was reported (6Wilson W.H. Schroeder D.C. Allen M.J. Holden M.T. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. Churcher C. Hamlin N. Mungall K. Norbertczak H. Quail M.A. Price C. Rabbinowitsch E. Walker D. Craigon M. Roy D. Ghazal P. Science. 2005; 309: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This virus infects the marine algae Emiliania huxleyi, which plays a significant role in the cycling of carbon in marine environments and is responsible for large algal blooms that reflect sunlight and heat and have been proposed to influence global climate. Viral infection results in attenuation of these blooms and is believed to be important in biogeochemical cycling in the ocean as well as global climate control (7Fuhrman J.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 8Wilson W.H. Tarran G.A. Schroeder D. Cox M. Oke J. Malin G. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. 2002; 82: 369-377Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Remarkably, unlike the sequence of any other virus reported to date, EhV-86 contains a cluster of genes highly homologous to those which in other systems, from yeast to mammals, have been shown to encode enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism. These genes are coordinately expressed within 2 h of infection, suggesting that their role is to alter algal sphingolipid metabolism (9Allen M.J. Forster T. Schroeder D.C. Hall M. Roy D. Ghazal P. Wilson W.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7699-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A particularly surprising feature of the gene cluster is the presence of a single open reading frame (ORF), ehv050, which encodes what appears to be both subunits of a eukaryotic-like SPT. However, the sequence is also homologous to other α-oxoamine synthases not involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis, leaving open the possibility that this gene might encode an SPT with broad substrate specificity or a new class of α-oxoamine synthases capable of catalyzing multiple condensation reactions, including some not involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Unfortunately, the inability to experimentally manipulate the genes of the virus or the host makes it difficult to study the products of the putative sphingolipid gene cluster in the native organism. Similarly, proving that ehv050 or any other genes in the cluster are actually involved in sphingolipid synthesis or that sphingolipids are important in the viral life cycle is also not possible. To address these questions we have undertaken the characterization of the putative sphingolipid genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report that the single-chain SPT-like EhV-86 enzyme restores SPT activity and viability to yeast mutants lacking endogenous SPT. We further demonstrate that, unlike the other characterized SPT enzymes, this virally encoded enzyme displays a preference for myristoyl-CoA. We have also expressed both yeast and human SPT as single-chain fusion proteins and show that they are enzymatically active. This suggests that other multisubunit membrane-associated enzymes could be similarly expressed, thus providing a powerful tool for the study membrane proteins. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth—Yeast cells were grown according to standard procedures (10Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

SPT Protein Expression—The ehv050 ORF was PCR-amplified from EhV-86 viral DNA and cloned into the yeast vector pADH2 under the control of the ADH1 promoter for expression with an N-terminal 3 × HA tag. The N- and C-terminal domains of ehv050, tagged with 3 × HA and Myc, respectively, were cloned under the control of either the Ga110 (vLCB2) or the Gal1 (vLCB1) promoter. Briefly, a PCR fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of vSPT (codons 1–472) was generated using the forward primer, 5′-AAGGGCGGCCGCTATGTACCCATACGAT, and the reverse primer, 5′-TTCCGGATCCATGCGTTTTCTTTGACTC, cleaved with NotI and BamH1(sites underlined), and inserted between the NotI and BglII sites of pESC-LEU to generate an HA-tagged vLCB2. A PCR fragment encoding the C-terminal domain of the vSPT (codons 473–870) was generated using the forward primer, 5′-AGACCTCGAGTTTCACTCCGATGTT, and the reverse primer, 5′-AGGCCAAGCTTATGTACACGGCCGTA), cleaved with XhoI and HindIII (sites underlined), and inserted between the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pESC-URA to generate an N-terminal Myc-tagged vLCB1. For construction of GFP-vSPT, a GFP gene flanked by XbaI sites was inserted into an AvrII site introduced into the vSPT gene at codon 2. Intracellular localization was determined by fluorescence microscopy as previously described (12Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M.

The yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion was made by fusing the yeast LCB1 gene to the C terminus of the yeast LCB2 gene such that the fusion protein contained all of Lcb2p followed by all of Lcb1p except for its N-terminal methionine. The human fusion protein contained all of hLCB2 followed by hLCB1 lacking the first 48 amino acids (hLCB2-LCB1). The human protein was expressed in Ly-B cells as previously described (12Han G.

The SPT inhibitor myriocin was purchased from BIOMOL International L.P. ehv050 Encodes an Active SPT Enzyme—The EhV-86 genome contains an expressed ORF, ehv050, composed of two tandemly repeated α-oxoamine synthase domains. Alignments revealed the N- and C-terminal domains to be most closely related to the Lcb2p and Lcb1p subunits, respectively, of SPT (Fig. 1). In addition to the overall homology, the positions of critical catalytic residues in the two subunits of SPT are conserved in the two viral domains. The N-terminal domain of the viral protein contains the lysine residue present in Lcb2p that forms a Schiff's base with the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor, and the C-terminal domain contains a cysteine in a position analogous to that of the cysteine residue in Lcb1p that has been proposed to lie across the subunit interface from the lysine in Lcb2p. This cysteine is critical for enzymatic activity and when mutated in human SPTLC1 results in the neurodegenerative disease, HSAN1 (4Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R.

Although the viral protein lacks a region homologous to the N-terminal extensions of yeast and mammalian LCB1s, in which the first of their three membrane spanning domains is located, this extension is not present in other α-oxoamine synthases and is not required for enzymatic activity (12Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53707-53716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the ehv050 ORF encodes a novel single-chain SPT (vSPT). To test this hypothesis, the viral gene was expressed in yeast, and its ability to reverse the LCB requirement of SPT-deficient yeast mutants was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, expression of vSPT rescued the LCB requirement of a yeast lcb1Δ mutant. This rescue was not dependent upon yeast Lcb2p since the vSPT also rescued an lcb1Δlcb2Δ double mutant. In addition, mutation of the conserved lysine in the Lcb2p-like N-terminal domain or mutation of the conserved cysteine in the Lcb1p-like C-terminal domain resulted in loss of function (data not shown). Although expression of vSPT complemented yeast mutants lacking endogenous SPT activity, growth was generally slower and showed greater temperature dependence. In particular, vSPT did not support growth at 37 °C (Fig. 2). In vitro SPT activity measurements revealed that microsomes prepared from vSPT-rescued cells contained ∼110 as much activity as microsomes prepared from wild type yeast (Table 1). Yeast lcb1 and lcb2 mutants with reduced SPT activity are temperature-sensitive for growth (16Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutants lacking Tsc3p, which is required for optimal SPT activity in yeast, are also temperature-sensitive (11Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the inability of vSPT-rescued cells to grow at 37 °C is consistent with the requirement for higher SPT activity at elevated growth temperatures. The activity of vSPT was not further decreased in microsomes prepared from vSPT-rescued cells lacking Tsc3p, indicating that the vSPT protein is not activated by Tsc3p.TABLE 1vSPT prefers C14-CoA as substrateAcyl-CoA chain lengthSPT ActivityViral SPTYeast SPTpmol/mg/minC40.10NDC80.18NDC100.57NDC121.1037.25C1411.0091.43C167.73129.32C182.8262.42C16:11.39NDC18:15.25NDC18:21.31ND Open table in a new tab vSPT Condenses Serine with Myristoyl-CoA More Efficiently than with Palmitoyl-CoA—Although the data presented above are consistent with the interpretation that failure of the vSPT-rescued mutants to grow at a higher temperature is due to reduced LCB synthesis, they do not exclude the possibility that the LCBs generated by the vSPT are different from wild type yeast. Analysis of LCBs in the vSPT-rescued yeast revealed that there was significantly less C20-phytosphingosine (C20-PHS) and more C16-dihydrosphingosine (C16-DHS) and C16-PHS than in wild type cells (Fig. 3). The high levels of C16-LCBs are especially striking in light of the fact that the endogenous concentration of myristate is much lower than the concentration of palmitate, suggesting that the vSPT has a relative preference for C14-CoA. Indeed, when cells were grown on myristate, the relative abundance of C16-LCBs in the vSPT-rescued cells was even greater (Fig. 3). To more carefully assess the substrate preference of the vSPT, its ability to catalyze the condensation of serine with different acyl-CoAs was determined (Table 1). As predicted by the in vivo LCB profiles, C14-CoA was the preferred in vitro substrate. Thus, the vSPT is distinctly different from its yeast counterpart in substrate preference. In addition to its homology with the subunits of SPT, there is significant homology between the viral protein and other members of the α-oxoamine synthase family. The greatest homology was with 5-aminolevulinate synthase, encoded by the yeast HEM1 gene and which catalyzes the committed step of heme biosynthesis, the condensation of succinyl-CoA with glycine. However, vSPT did not complement a hem1 mutant (Fig. 4A). Moreover, vSPT was sensitive to myriocin, a sphingosine analogue that is a specific and potent inhibitor of yeast and mammalian SPT (17Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Thus, although its substrate specificity is somewhat different from previously characterized SPTs, the viral enzyme is a bona fide SPT that does not appear to have additional activities. Structural Plasticity of the vSPT Enzyme—Despite the fact that the two α-oxoamine synthase domains of the ehv050 gene are contained in a single ORF, it is possible that the protein is processed by proteolytic cleavage between the two domains into two polypeptides which then assemble into an active head-to-tail heterodimer, the structure of all previously characterized eukaryotic SPTs. To address this possibility, extracts prepared from yeast cells expressing a functional N-terminally HA-tagged vSPT were analyzed by immunoblotting. A membrane-associated protein of 96 kDa, the predicted molecular mass for the full-length protein, was easily detected; there was no evidence for the presence of a shorter protein that would have resulted from cleavage between the putative Lcb2p and Lcb1p domains (Fig. 5A). Interestingly however, the full-length protein was resolved into multiple molecular species, which were converted to a single molecular weight component upon treatment with endoglycosidase H. This is consistent with the fact that the viral protein contains several potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1) and suggested that the protein resides in the ER. The ER localization was confirmed by direct visualization of a GFP-vSPT chimera that showed a pattern of fluorescence typical of ER proteins, including the yeast GFP-Lcb1p (Fig. 5B). Active SPT could also be reconstituted by separately expressing the N- and C-terminal domains of the vSPT; coexpression of the two domains restored sufficient activity to rescue the yeast SPT-deficient mutants (Fig. 6C). In addition, the reassembled subunits yielded an enzyme with the same preference for myristoyl-CoA as the full-length protein (Fig. 6D). Thus, the separated domains can reassemble and fold into an active SPT enzyme with similar properties to the fusion protein. The data shown in Fig. 6A also suggest that it is the Lcb2p-like domain that is glycosylated since only this domain exhibited endoglycosidase H-sensitive heterogeneity. However, because mutation of the two potential glycosylation sites in the Lcb2p-like domain of the full-length protein did not abolish all glycosylation (data not shown), glycosylation of the full-length vSPT is apparently different from that of the separated domains. Analysis of the coexpressed vSPT subunits also showed that stable expression of the vSPT Lcb2p-like protein does not depend upon the presence of the vSPT Lcb1p-like protein (Fig. 6, A and B). This is in sharp contrast to the situation in both yeast and mammals where the stability of monomeric Lcb2p is strictly dependent upon the presence of Lcb1p (3Hanada K. Nishijima M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 228: 163-174PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol.

Characterization of a Yeast Single-chain SPT Provides Additional Evidence for Structural Plasticity of the SPT Enzymes—The discovery of this novel viral fusion SPT enzyme composed of two separable domains suggested that fusion of the two subunits of the yeast and other eukaryotic SPTs would yield active enzymes. To test this possibility, full-length yeast Lcb1p was fused to the C terminus of Lcb2p to create a yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion protein. Expression of this fusion protein provided sufficient SPT activity to complement the LCB-requiring phenotype of a yeast lcb1Δ lcb2Δ mutant (Fig. 7B). Unlike the vSPT, the yeast fusion protein was dependent on Tsc3p for full activity, demonstrating that like the native heterodimer the yeast fusion protein retains its interaction with Tsc3p. SPT activity assays showed that the yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion protein, which was expressed to the same extent as the individual subunits (Fig. 7A), had ∼30% as much activity as the native Lcb2p/Lcb1p heterodimer when assayed with C16-CoA as the substrate (Fig. 7C). However, with C14-CoA as the substrate the activity of the fusion protein was ∼60% that of the native enzyme, and with C12-CoA as substrate, the fusion protein and the native protein had equivalent activities. Thus, it appears that like vSPT, the yeast fusion protein has an altered substrate preference. In addition, a human hSPTLC2-SPTLC1 fusion protein was active when expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking endogenous SPT activity (Fig. 7, D and E), demonstrating that the ability to construct an active SPT chimera is a general property of this protein. The data presented thus far are consistent with the conclusion that the fusion proteins fold as monomers with single active sites formed at the interface between the two domains. However, the possibility that two full-length fusion proteins associate to form a head-to-tail homodimer, creating an enzyme with two active sites, cannot be excluded. Two lines of evidence argue that this is not the case. First, coexpression of a yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion protein containing an inactivating mutation at the lysine residue of the Lcb2p domain with a yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion protein containing an inactivating mutation at the cysteine residue of the Lcb1p domain did not rescue an lcb1Δlcb2Δ mutant (data not shown). If the active form of the enzyme were a head-to-tail homodimer, then coexpression of these mutants should have yielded a population of dimers, 50% of which contained one active site and one mutated site. Because of the robust activity of the yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion protein (40 pmol/mg/min), even this reduced level of activity should have been sufficient to restore growth. Second, if the Lcb1p domain of the yeast Lcb2-Lcb1p fusion protein were able to associate with the Lcb2p domain of a second fusion protein, then it should also be able to associate with, and thereby stabilize an Lcb2p monomer. However, the immunoblot clearly shows that there is no Lcb2p monomer stabilized in the lcb1Δ mutant expressing the fusion protein (Fig. 7A). Thus, we conclude that the active form of SPT fusion proteins is a folded monomer. Sequencing of the Coccolithovirus genome identified a putative SPT-encoding gene in which both subunits of the classical enzyme are contained in a single ORF (6Wilson W.H. Schroeder D.C. Allen M.J. Holden M.T. Parkhill J. Barrell B.G. Churcher C. Hamlin N. Mungall K. Norbertczak H. Quail M.A. Price C. Rabbinowitsch E. Walker D. Craigon M. Roy D. Ghazal P.

Read, unpublished data. and Acanthamoeba histolytica (18Hofer M. Duchene M. Exp. Parasitol. 2005; 110: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For all three single-chain proteins, the N-terminal domain most closely resembles the Lcb2p subunit of traditional SPTs, and the C-terminal domain most closely resembles the Lcb1p subunit. However, in the absence of genomic sequence from either organism it is unclear that these are the only SPTs present or how the genes that encode them are organized. In addition, since the domains of vSPT are no more homologous to those of the putative SPT from the host than they are to the individual subunits of yeast, Arabidopsis, or mammalian SPTs, the phylogenetic relationship between the viral and host SPT fusion proteins is not apparent. The unique preference of vSPT for C14-CoA suggests that during infection it might function as a serine myristoyltransferase. However, because little is known about the sphingolipid composition of E. huxleyi, it is also possible that there may be as yet unidentified substrates that are condensed with serine. Although when measured 24 h after infection, the ratio of C16: C18 LCBs was greater in infected cells than has been seen in other organisms, this increased ratio was also observed in uninfected cells. Thus, despite the relatively low homology between the viral and host enzymes, there is no evidence that this translates into an altered profile of LCBs. Resolution of the question of whether expression of vSPT and other virally encoded sphingolipid genes alter LCB or complex sphingolipid composition will require more extensive sphingolipid profiling over the entire course of EhV-86 infection. When proteins are found as multidomain “chimera,” it has been suggested that elsewhere in nature there will be examples where the individual domains are contained in separate proteins that heterodimerize (19Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M. Ng H.L. Rice D.W. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Science. 1999; 285: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of naturally occurring single-chain and heterodimeric SPTs is not entirely surprising. Structural plasticity in the α-oxoamine synthases was also suggested by studies on murine erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, a homodimeric α-oxamine synthase with significant homology to SPT, which is active in at least three circularly permutated configurations (20Cheltsov A.V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27945-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that the Lcb1p subunit of yeast and mammalian SPT can tolerate insertion of a 53-amino acid domain from yeast invertase at multiple positions without loss of activity (12Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53707-53716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results led us to consider the possibility that yeast and/or mammalian SPT, expressed as a single-chain fusion, would be active. Our results clearly demonstrate that this is the case. In addition, the yeast fusion protein localizes to the same intracellular organelle, and its maximum activity depends on the presence of Tsc3p, indicating that the single-chain protein retains many important properties of the native heterodimer. A yeast Lcb1-Lcb2p chimera also showed some activity (data not shown). Thus, an active enzyme can be formed in at least three different ways, demonstrating a high degree of flexibility in the formation of its active site. It should be pointed that although the vSPT is not proteolytically cleaved to distinct domains in yeast, we cannot exclude the possibility that this or other posttranslational modifications that could alter substrate specificity occur in the algal host. In addition, although there is no Tsc3p-like protein encoded within the viral genome, it is possible that the viral genome encodes a functional ortholog or that the host expresses such a protein. One property of the single-chain yeast protein significantly different from that of the native heterodimer was its relative preference for shorter chain acyl-CoA substrates. Unlike the native heterodimer, maximum activity was obtained with C14-CoA, and the enzyme was just as active with C12-CoA as with C16-CoA. Although the altered substrate preference of the single-chain yeast SPT is comparable with the preference of the viral enzyme, it is not clear to what extent this reflects an intrinsic property of single-chain SPTs since when the viral protein was expressed as individual domains it retained its preference for C14-CoAs. Nonetheless, altered preference and high activity of the yeast single-chain protein offers a novel approach for altering the cellular levels of the shorter LCBs and their metabolic products, including LCB-Ps and ceramides, which have been implicated in numerous signaling pathways. It is commonplace to study structure-function relationships by rearranging protein domains or swapping domains from one protein to another. In addition, expression of the heterodimeric gonadotropin hormones as single-chain chimera has allowed the folding of these hormones to be investigated in great detail (23Garcia-Campayo V. Jablonka-Shariff A. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44286-44293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that the same approach can be applied to the study of multisubunit membrane-associated proteins. Characterization and purification of such proteins has proven difficult in part because of subunit dissociation during solubilization. If, as is the case with SPT, expression of individual subunits as a single-chain chimera does not substantively alter the essential properties of the enzyme, preservation of quaternary structure should be less difficult. Finally, our results demonstrate that, as has been shown to be the case for mammalian and plant genes, expression and characterization of novel sphingolipid genes from marine organisms in appropriate yeast mutants can provide important insights into the role of these genes in their native hosts.

However, it also destroys epitope-containing peptides. Because very few peptides suffice for immune surveillance by CD8+ T cells, the productive/destructive balance is in most instances, but not always (13Yellen-Shaw A.J. Wherry E.J. Dubois G.C.

However, there is limited access to carboxypeptidase activity in the classical antigen processing pathway (2Shastri N. Schwab S. Serwold T. Annu. Rev.

This is true in the natural context of NP from two strains of influenza virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (NPPR8) and A/NT/60/68 (NPNT60), as well as in a few mutated constructs of these proteins. Among several possible explanations (14Antón L.C. Snyder H.L. Bennink J.R. Vinitsky A. Orlowski M. Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. J.

Our results show the vital role of TPPII together with trimming aminopeptidases in generating this NP147–155 epitope from several diverse protein contexts both in the presence and in the absence of lactacystin (LC)-sensitive proteasome action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Vaccinia Viruses (rVVs)—The rVVs employed in this study have been described previously; that is, those encoding full-length influenza virus NP from the PR8 and NT60 strains (14Antón L.C.

Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Bernstein K. Yewdell J.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and rVV-ENV (vPE16), which expresses ENV envelope glycoprotein gp160 from the strain IIIB of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (32Earl P.L. Hugin A.W. Moss B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2448-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these rVVs had a Western Reserve (WR) wild-type vaccinia background. In addition, a series of rVVs based on the wild-type Copenhagen strain and encoding the influenza virus NP antigenic nonamer NP147–155 in a chimeric protein context was also employed. Chimeric proteins had insertions at position 179 at the carboxyl terminus of the hepatitis B virus core or precore proteins (cytosolic HBc or secretory HBe, respectively) of the NP147–155 sequence either non-flanked or flanked on either side of the epitope by 4 aa that represent the natural flanking sequences from NPPR8 and NPNT60 (Fig. 1). The chimeric proteins cC-NP147, cC-NP147P, and cC-NP147N were based on HBc and were, thus, expressed in the cytosol, as they lacked a signal sequence. Chimeras sC-NP147, sC-NP147P, and sC-NP147N entered the secretory pathway. The negative control encodes the carrier protein HBe. Cell Lines—L cells, murine kidney fibroblasts transfected with Kd (30Eisenlohr L.C. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Bernstein K. Yewdell J.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or Dd (33Abastado J.P. Jaulin C. Schutze M.P. Langlade-Demoyen P. Plata F. Ozato K. Kourilsky P. J. Exp.

Castaño A.R. Del Val M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-h virus adsorption period at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) at a cell density of 105 cells/cm2 was followed by washes and by the indicated incubation periods. To study the effect of inhibitors, cells were treated with a 5-fold concentration for 15 min before virus adsorption, and the inhibitor was kept throughout adsorption and infection at the standard concentrations. As the negative control, cells were similarly infected with WR at a m.o.i. of 30 in the case of full-length NPs or with rVV-HBe at a m.o.i. of 30 or 90 for the chimeric constructs. As positive control, cells were infected with these viruses and pulsed during the 1-h adsorption period with 10–9 m NP147–155 peptide.Inhibitors—LC inhibits proteasomes (38Craiu A. Gaczynska M.

Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethyl ketone (AAF-cmk) is a TPPII substrate analog (7Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and was used at 110 μm. Leucinethiol (LeuSH) inhibits metallo-aminopeptidases including ERAAP (19Serwold T. González F. Kim J.

All three were from Bachem. Butabindide (Tocris) is a substrate analog that acts as a competitive inhibitor of TPPII (39Rose C. Vargas F. Facchinetti P. Bourgeat P. Bambal R.B. Bishop P.B. Chan S.M. Moore A.N. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was used from 50–400 μm, and was added again at every step and every 90–120 min (10Reits E. Neijssen J. Herberts C. Benckhuijsen W. Janssen L. Drijfhout J.W. Neefjes J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One butabindide lot showed higher potency.Polyclonal Monospecific CTL Lines; Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)—Polyclonal ENV-IIIB-monospecific CTL were generated by infection of BALB/c mice with rVV-ENV followed by weekly restimulation of splenocytes with 10–6 m G9I synthetic peptide (sequence GPGRAFVTI) and interleukin 2 as described elsewhere (40López D. Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Bergmann C. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5070-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, polyclonal NP147–155-specific CTL lines were generated from splenocytes of BALB/c mice after two intraperitoneal injections of 107 PFU of rVV-NPPR8 3 weeks apart and using 10–8 m NP147–155 peptide (sequence TYQRTRALV) for weekly restimulation. ICS assays were performed as described (41Chen W. Antón L.C. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 42Johnstone C. de León P. Medina F. Melero J.A. García-Barreno B. Del Val M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CTL lines were stimulated overnight in the presence of brefeldin A (Sigma) with infected cells or control infected cells previously pulsed for 1 h with 10–9 m NP147–155 peptide. An effector to target ratio of 0.2:1 was used, with the exception of minigene-expressing targets, where it was 10:1 to decrease sensitivity of detection. After stimulation cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8α monoclonal antibody (Proimmune), fixed, and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody to IFN-γ (BD PharMingen) during permeabilization. Events were acquired using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Background activation obtained with cells infected with negative control virus (usually 0 to 5%) was subtracted. Percent specific inhibition was calculated as % specific inhibition = (A – Ai/A – N) × 100, where A is the % CD8+ IFN-γ+/total CD8+ cells with target cells infected with rVVs, Ai is the value with rVVs plus inhibitor, and N is the value with the negative control. Mean and S.D. was calculated typically from at least two independent experiments.Western Blot—NP proteins and chimeric HBe proteins were detected in pellets of L/Kd cells infected for 2 h as for the ICS assays with rVVs. They were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and developed with rabbit anti-HBe serum (37Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Castaño A.R. Del Val M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by standard ECL procedures (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length NPs were detected using a rabbit antibody raised to the carboxyl terminal peptide C488FFGDNAEEYDN498 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Imject® maleimide-activated mcKLH from Pierce). Antibodies were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography on DE52 (Whatman). ENV was detected in rVV-ENV-infected L/Dd cells as described (43López D. Samino Y. Koszinowski U.H. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription and PCR—RNA was extracted from transfected cells with RNeasy (Qiagen), and mRNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primers with Sensiscript (Qiagen). It was then amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) using primers specific for human TPPII (forward, CAC TGC AGT TAT AGC AGC AAA AGT; reverse, TAT TTC AAG GAG GAC TGA ACA TCA) to yield a 579-bp band or for murine TPPII (reverse, CCA ACG AGC AAT ACA AAA TTC A) to give a 519-bp band and separated by agarose electrophoresis. Expression levels of the housekeeping gene encoding β-actin were tested as control (human: forward, GCA TGG AGT CCT GTG GCA TCC; reverse, GGT GTA ACG CAA CTA AGT CAT AG; mouse: forward, GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC CAA; reverse, CTC TTT GAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC).Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The antisense strand of siRNA duplexes targeting human TPPII had the published sequence (17Seifert U.

Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (Qiagen). For silencing murine TPPII, the following siRNA duplexes with two 3′ end overhang dT nucleotides were used separately or pooled: 5′-UCU UCU ACG AGU UUG GUU GdTdT-3′ (#1), 5′-AGA UAC CAC GGU UAU UUC CdTdT-3′ (#2), 5′-GAA UCU GUA AUC GAA UUG UdTdT-3′ (#3), 5′-UAG UUG ACA AGA UCA CAC UdTdT-3′ (#4) (Dharmacon). As negative controls, siRNA duplex for human ERAP1 (19Serwold T. González F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) (Qiagen) and for human TPPII was used in murine cells, and siRNA for mouse ERAAP was used for human cells (19Serwold T. González F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) using each time the same amount as of the experimental siRNA. For transfection, 293Kd, L/Dd, or L/Kd cells (3–5 × 106/sample) were resuspended in 100 μl of nucleofection reagent V, V, or T (Amaxa), respectively. From siRNA to human TPPII and from the pool of four siRNAs to mouse TPPII 3 μg of siRNA was added, whereas 6 μg of siRNA was added from each individual siRNA to murine TPPII. The three cell lines were transfected using Nucleofector II (Amaxa) programs A23, T25, or U33, respectively, between 3 and 6 days before performing the enzymatic assay or infecting with rVVs and performing the ICS assay. Occasionally, cells were transfected again at day 6 and tested 3 days later in ICS, with similar results. Efficiency of transfection was more than 95% of cells, as assessed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled or Alexa 647-labeled control siRNA (Qiagen). Percent specific inhibition was calculated with respect to control cells transfected with control siRNA as indicated.Enzyme Assays—L/Kd, L/Dd, and 293Kd cells (2–5 × 104/sample) were washed and then lysed at 4 °C in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1% Triton-X100 (5Princiotta M.F.

Measurements were taken every minute for 1 s with excitation at 370 nm and emission at 430 nm and are presented as arbitrary units. Blank reactions without lysates were subtracted, and percent inhibition was calculated with respect to control cells either untreated with inhibitors or transfected with control siRNA as indicated.RESULTSNP147–155 Epitope Processing from Full-length NP Is Susceptible to AAF-cmk in the Presence of Functional Proteasomes—We studied cytosolic TPPII as a candidate antigen processing enzyme for influenza virus NP.

M. Villasevil, L. C. Antón, and M. Del Val, unpublished results. When NP from influenza virus strain PR8 (scheme in Fig. 1) is expressed in L/Kd cells by a rVVs, the NP147–155 epitope is presented to Kd-restricted CTL. Treatment of NPPR8-expressing cells with AAF-cmk completely blocked NP147–155 presentation in an ICS assay (Fig. 2A). As a control, endogenous presentation by Dd of the proteasome-dependent human immunodeficiency virus envelope (ENV) epitope R10I (40López D. Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Bergmann C. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5070-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was not affected. The same was true for exogenous presentation of limiting amounts of the NP147–155 synthetic peptide. NPPR8 protein expression in the presence of this inhibitor was controlled by Western blot (Fig. 2E, lanes 2). These three controls were routinely included in each experiment throughout this report. Thus, an AAF-cmk-susceptible proteolytic activity is indispensable for NP epitope processing from full-length NP in the presence of a functional proteasome.FIGURE 2NP147–155 epitope processing from full-length NP is susceptible to AAF-cmk in the presence and in the absence of a fully functional proteasome. A, L/Kd cells were infected with rVV-NPPR8 at a m.o.i. of 30 for 2 h in the absence (white bars, N.I.) or presence of AAF-cmk (dark gray bars) and assayed by ICS for NP147–155 presentation. As a control, peptide-loaded WR-infected cells were used. As a further control, L/Dd cells were infected with rVV-ENV for 2 h at a m.o.i. of 10 and used for activation of the ENV-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte line.

It is composed of four isoforms and is involved in critical biological processes as well as in inflammatory diseases. The exact unique role of each p38 isoform in these processes is not understood well. To approach this question we have been developing intrinsically active variants of p38s. Recently we described a series of mutants of the human p38α, which were spontaneously active as recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli cells. We show here that some of these mutants are spontaneously active in several mammalian cells in culture. The spontaneous activity of some mutants is higher than the activity of the fully activated wild type counterpart. We further produced mutants of the other p38 isoforms and found that p38βD176A, p38γD179A, p38δD176A, and p38δF324S are spontaneously active in vivo. The active mutants are also spontaneously phosphorylated. To test whether the mutants actually fulfill downstream duties of p38 proteins, we tested their effect on activating protein 1(AP-1)-mediated transcription. Active mutants of p38α induced AP-1-driven reporter genes, as well as the c-jun and c-fos promoters. An active variant of p38γ suppressed AP-1-mediated transcription. When active variants of p38α and p38γ were co-expressed, AP-1 activity was not induced, showing that p38γ is dominant over p38α with respect to AP-1 activation. Thus, intrinsically active variants that are spontaneously active in vivo have been obtained for all p38 isoforms. These variants have disclosed different effects of each isoform on AP-1 activity.

Mammalian MAPKs are commonly divided to subfamilies that include the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), the c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), the p38s, and the big MAPKs, but more subfamilies may exist (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). Each subfamily is composed of several genes, some of which undergo alternative splicing and give rise to several different products (8Faccio L. Chen A. Fusco C. Martinotti S. Bonventre J.V.

The p38 MAPKs are strongly activated under stress conditions and therefore, together with the JNKs, are also known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs).

The linkage between SAPK activity and the etiology of these diseases is not clear. It is still not known for example whether the active MAPK is a direct cause of the disease or an indirect mere consequence. The current understanding of the roles of p38s in health and disease was established mostly through correlative observations or through knock-out and small interfering RNA experiments (25Adams R.H.

Active variants of MAPKs themselves were hitherto not used because they were not available. In the absence of these tools, it is difficult to understand the role of a given MAPK in a given cell, to reveal its role in disease, or to determine its direct substrates and target genes. In this report we describe the first series of engineered mammalian MAPKs (all isoforms of p38) that are spontaneously active in vivo and may serve as the missing tool for addressing the above questions. All of the MAPKs are activated via a unique dual phosphorylation mechanism, on a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif, located in the phosphorylation loop. Dual specificity kinases termed MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs, MEKs, or MKKs) catalyze this dual phosphorylation. MAPKKs are not highly specific and may phosphorylate all members of a subfamily or even of two families (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). The basal activity of the unphosphorylated MAP kinase proteins is very low (45Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 46Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making overexpression efforts inefficient. The main obstacle in engineering intrinsically active variants of MAPKs lies in the fact that dual phosphorylation cannot be mimicked. Also, although vast information is available with respect to the structural requirements for MAPK activation (45Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 46Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is not known how to impose these structural changes via mutagenesis (48Askari N. Diskin R. Avitzour M. Yaakov G. Livnah O. Engelberg D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 252: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We therefore took a genetic approach and were able to generate mutants of the human MAPK p38α, which were spontaneously active as recombinant proteins expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These mutants, p38αD176A, p38αF327L, and p38αF327S manifested spontaneous (i.e. in the absence of MAPKK-mediated phosphorylation) activity that reached ∼10% of the maximal activity manifested by dually phosphorylated p38α. Combining two activating mutations in the same p38α gene resulted in even more active proteins. Thus, p38αD176A+F327L and p38αD176A+F327S manifested levels of activity that were 25% of that of a fully active (MKK6-treated) p38αWT (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The active p38α mutants were found to share similar characteristics with the activated p38αWT (e.g. substrate specificity, inhibition by specific p38α inhibitors, and activation by MKK6) (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently we generated similar mutations in p38β, p38γ, and p38δ and found that the mutations rendered these isoforms spontaneously active in vitro (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The fact that the active mutants faithfully maintain many properties of the parental wild type enzyme, as tested in vitro, raises the possibility that they might be also active in vivo and perhaps become the missing tool for accurate and specific research of the biology and pathology of p38 isoforms. The goal of this study was to test this possibility, namely to check whether the p38 mutants may be active in cell cultures and disclose the specific activities of each isoform. We show that some of the mutants of all four p38 isoforms are spontaneously active in mammalian cells in culture. In fact, the spontaneous activity (i.e. in the absence of any stimulation) measured in vivo is much stronger than that measured in vitro, reaching 200–700% (depending on the cell type used) of the maximal activity manifested by the respective activated p38WT isoform. We also show that the active mutants of the different p38 isoforms have different, in some cases opposing, effects on AP-1-mediated transcription. Thus, the mutants are not only spontaneously active but also readily fulfill downstream activities that reveal cross-talk between p38 isoforms. Cell Culture and Treatment—HEK293, NIH3T3, and DHER14 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel) and were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking MKK3 and MKK6 (MKK3/6–/– cells), a gift of Prof. Roger Davis, were grown in the same medium as above, supplemented with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). UV irradiation was employed with a germicidal 254-nm UV lamp at a rate of 2 J/m2/s. Prior to UV irradiation, the entire medium was removed. Fresh medium was added immediately after treatment. The cells were then allowed to grow for 1 h and then harvested. The cells were transfected using either the Exgen500 transfection reagent (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions or using the calcium-phosphate method. All of the transfected recombinant p38 cDNAs carried an HA tag and were cloned into pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen). All of the plasmids expressing p38 (wild type or mutants) were identical except for the point mutations they possessed. A double mutant, active MKK6 (MKK6-EE), was cloned into the pBabe plasmid and included an HA tag. Unless otherwise stated, 48 h post-transfection the cells were harvested in two ways: (i) For Western blotting, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 60–250 μl of Laemmli's buffer were added. The cells were scraped using rubber policeman. (ii) For native lysis, all of the steps were performed on ice. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 313 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) and 30 min of incubation under shaking. The cells were scraped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed on ice. After a 10-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g, supernatant was collected. Antibodies and Other Reagents—The antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-p38 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-phospho-p38 from Cell Signaling; anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) from 12CA5 hybridomas and anti-HA (3F10 high affinity antibodies) from Roche. GST-fused ATF2 was purified as described (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Western Blotting—Thirty micrograms of protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation of the membrane with the appropriate antibodies, specific proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent. Immunoprecipitations and Kinase Assay for Immunoprecipitated p38—300 μg of lysate were incubated (in lysis buffer, see above) with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) bound to 1 μg of 3F10 anti-HA antibody for 2 h at 4°C in a rotating wheel. The samples were then washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.1 mm NA3VO4). The supernatants were removed, and 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg of GST-ATF2, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added. Kinase reactions were performed in a 30 °C shaker for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by placing the tubes on ice and the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli's buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min, and 30 μl of each sample were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was exposed to a phosphorimaging plate (Fuji), and the relative radioactivity was measured. To measure the levels of p38 molecules that were immunoprecipitated in each reaction, the same membrane was incubated in a blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20, 5% low fat milk), and a Western blot was performed using anti-p38 and/or anti-HA antibodies. Luciferase Assays—HEK293 cells were plated on 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well). The cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of either 6× AP-1-luc, c-fos-luc, or c-jun-luc constructs, along with either pcDNA3 empty vector, or pcDNA3 containing the specified types of p38 isoforms (wild type or mutant). In some experiments pBabe-MKK6-EE (0.2 μg) was included. Plasmid (0.1 μg) encoding Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) was also added to each transfection mixture as a control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 1 μg. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted as described (50Stanhill A. Levin V. Hendel A. Shachar I. Kazanov D. Arber N. Kaminski N. Engelberg D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DNA was digested by Turbo DNase (Ambion) and RNA (2 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science), with random hexamers as primers. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following primers: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TGGGTGTGAACCATGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTG-3′; c-jun, 5′-ATGCCCTCAACGCCTCGTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGCAGCGTGTTCTGGCTGT-3′; and c-fos, 5′-AGCTATCTCCTGAAGAGGAA-3′ and 5′-AGGCTCCCAGTGTGCTGCAT-3′.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), may also be hyperactive in vivo, we transiently expressed p38αWT and the various p38α mutants in HEK293 cells. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated or not with UV radiation. The cells were lysed 1 h later, and the various mutants were immunoprecipitated and tested in a kinase assay using GST-ATF2 as a substrate (Fig. 1A). As expected, the basal activity of p38αWT is very low, almost undetectable. Upon exposure of transfected cells to UV radiation, a strong inducer of the p38α cascade (51Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the p38αWT activity increased significantly (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Three of the mutants tested, p38αY69H, p38αA320T, and p38αW337R behaved very similarly to p38αWT (Fig. 1A). In contrast, three other mutants, p38αD176A, p38αF327L, and p38αF327S showed catalytic activity even when immunoprecipitated from nontreated cells. Most importantly, activity manifested by p38αD176A in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 1A, lane 7) was at the levels manifested by p38αWT immunoprecipitated from UV-stimulated cells. Following UV irradiation, the activity of p38αD176A, p38αF327L, and p38αF327S further increased and reached levels higher than those of activated p38αWT (Fig. 1A). The three mutants found to manifest activity in nonstimulated cells are the same mutants that showed spontaneous activity when tested in vitro as recombinant proteins purified from E. coli (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The p38α mutants that were the most active in vitro carried a combination of two mutations, D176A+F327L and D176A+F327S (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The spontaneous activity of these mutants in vitro was ∼25% of the activity manifested by MKK6-activated dually phosphorylated p38αWT (49Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When expressed in HEK293, these double mutants showed spontaneous activity that was ∼700% of that of activated p38αWT (Fig. 1A, lanes 17–20). This activity was just slightly enhanced by exposing the cells to UV radiation (Fig. 1A), suggesting that p38αD176A+F327L and p38αD176A+F327S are constitutively active proteins. These p38α mutants provide the first examples of constitutively active molecules of any mammalian MAPK. To test whether the p38α variants tested in HEK293 are active in other cell lines as well, we monitored their activity, following transient transfection, in COS (data not shown), NIH3T3 (Fig. 1B), and DHER14 (Fig. 1C) cell lines. In all cases, results were similar in principle to those obtained in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, compare A with B and C). However, some differences were observed. For example, p38αD176A showed low spontaneous activity in NIH3T3, almost similar to the basal activity of p38αWT (Fig. 1B). This was also the case for p38αF327L (Fig. 1B). p38αF327S, p38αD176A+F327S, and p38αD176A+F327S, however, manifested very high spontaneous activity equivalent to or higher than the maximal activity of p38αWT (immunoprecipitated from UV-treated cells). Very high spontaneous activity of the p38αD176A+F327S double mutant was also measured in the DHER14 transformed cell line (Fig. 1C). In this cell line p38αD176A and p38αF327S showed a very high spontaneous activity that was further elevated when cells were exposed to UV radiation. In general, it seems that the single mutants show some variability in the level of their spontaneous activity in the cell types tested, but the double mutants are very active (stronger than activated p38αWT) in all cell types. Mutants of p38β, p38γ, and p38δ Are Also Spontaneously Active in Mammalian Cells—Having identified critical sites in p38α that, when mutated, render the kinase intrinsically active, we sought for equivalent sites in other p38 isoforms. Sequence alignment of all four isoforms shows that several of the sites are conserved in other p38s. Asp176 of p38α was found to be conserved in all p38 isoforms (Fig. 2). Phe327, on the other hand, is conserved only in p38γ (Phe330), but not conserved in p38β, which contains Val in the equivalent position, nor in p38δ that harbors a Leu (Leu328). Based on this alignment we produced mutations p38βD176A, p38βV327S, p38βD176A+V327S, p38βY323S, p38γD179A, p38γF330S, p38δD176A, p38δF324S, p38δL328S, and p38δW338R. 3M. Avitzour, R. Diskin, B. Raboy, N. Askari, D. Engelberg, and O. Livnah, submitted for publication. We also mutated p38δ at Phe324, because this position is equivalent to Phe318 in the yeast Hog1 (Fig. 2). Mutating Phe318 in Hog1 to either Leu or Ser provided some of the most active Hog1 mutants (52Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2080746262,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rho-type small GTPase Cdc42 is activated by its guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24 to polarize the cell for budding and mating. A multidomain protein Bem1 interacts not only with Cdc42 but also with Cdc24 and the effectors of Cdc42, including the p21-activated kinase Ste20, to function as a scaffold for cell polarity establishment. Although Bem1 interacts with Cdc24 and Ste20 via its PB1 and the second SH3 domains (SH3b), respectively, it is unclear how Bem1 binds Cdc42. Here we show that a region comprising the SH3b and its C-terminal flanking segment termed CI (SH3b-CI) directly interacts with Cdc42. A dual-bait reverse two-hybrid approach revealed that the CI is critical to the interaction: N253D substitution in the CI abolishes the binding of the SH3b-CI to Cdc42 but not to the proline-rich region of Ste20, whereas W192K substitution in the SH3b has the opposite effect. Nevertheless, the SH3b-CI interacts with Ste20 proline-rich region and Cdc42 in a mutually exclusive manner. The N253D substitution renders cellular growth temperature-sensitive and suppresses mating. The W192K-induced mating defect is exacerbated by the N253D substitution and suppressed by increasing the dosage of Ste20 provided that the CI is intact. Intriguingly, Cdc42 can mediate an indirect interaction of the SH3b-CI to the CRIB domain of Ste20. These results suggest that the SH3b and the CI collaborate in tethering of Ste20 to Bem1 to ensure efficient mating pheromone signaling.

It becomes increasingly evident that signaling proteins assemble into a multiprotein complex to function in various aspects of cellular regulation (1Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a novel class of proteins composed of multiple protein-binding domains plays integral roles in signaling by serving as scaffolds for the assembly (2Ferrell Jr., J.E. Cimprich K.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 289-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For instance, the budding yeast Ste5 tethers the members of the MAP 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; AD, activation domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PRR, proline-rich region; CI, Cdc 42-interacting; NLS, nuclear localization signal; Ste20-N, N-terminal portion of Ste20. 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; AD, activation domain; DBD, DNA binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PRR, proline-rich region; CI, Cdc 42-interacting; NLS, nuclear localization signal; Ste20-N, N-terminal portion of Ste20. kinase cascade, namely the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11, the MAP kinase kinase Ste7, and the MAP kinases Fus1 and Kss1, as well as the βγ dimer (Ste18–Ste4) of the trimeric G-protein, thereby ensuring the efficiency and specificity of mating pheromone signal transduction (3Elion E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3967-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, several potential scaffold proteins are reported for mammalian MAP kinase cascades (4Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). A scaffold is also used in the signaling for cell polarity establishment (5Chang F. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Irazoqui J.E. Lew D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2169-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The yeast cells polarize at budding in vegetative growth and at shmoo formation in mating. These processes are controlled by the Rho-type small GTPase Cdc42. The Cdc42 is activated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24. The activated, GTP-bound form of Cdc42 interacts with its various effectors, including the p21-activated kinases Ste20 and Cla4, to transduce signals for cytoskeletal reorganization. Bem1 is a multidomain protein that lacks any catalytic domain but binds both the activator Cdc24 and the effectors Ste20 and Cla4 (7Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S.G. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), likely functioning as a scaffold for Cdc42 signaling in cell polarity establishment. Bem1 is also assumed to constitute a part of positive feedback loop to stabilize polarized localization of activated Cdc42 (12Butty A.C. Pryciak P.M. Huang L.S. Herskowitz I. Peter M. Science. 1998; 282: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Irazoqui J.E. Gladfelter A.S. Lew D.J. Nat.

We previously identified a novel modular domain termed PB1 (Phox and Bem 1) at the C terminus of Bem1 and demonstrated that it mediates a homotypic interaction with another PB1 domain occurring at the C terminus of Cdc24 (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Functional importance of this PB1-PB1 interaction was evidenced by the bem1 and cdc24 mutants defective in the interaction: they displayed temperature-sensitive growth and a mating defect (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It was also shown that Bem1 with a defective PB1 domain fails to maintain Cdc24 at the site of polarized growth (15Butty A.C. Perrinjaquet N. Petit A. Jaquenoud M. Segall J.E. Hoffman K. Zwahlen C. Peter M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to PB1-mediated association with Cdc24, we and others showed that Bem1 uses its second SH3 domain to bind the p21-activated kinases Cla4 and Ste20 (7Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The Cla4 recruited to the bud tip phosphorylates Cdc24 to induce its dissociation from Bem1, thereby serving as a negative feedback loop (8Guilli M.-P. Jaquenoud M. Shimada Y. Niederhäuser G. Wiget P. Peter M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The importance of Ste20-binding in mating was demonstrated using mutants defective in the interaction (16Winters M. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Besides the activator and effectors of Cdc42, the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 per se was repeatedly reported to bind Bem1. Many authors observed a two-hybrid interaction between Cdc42 and Bem1 (10Leeuw T. Fourest-Lievin A. Wu C. Chenevert J. Clark K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E.

An in vitro interaction was also shown between purified Cdc42 and Bem1 (7Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S.G. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7176-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Gladfelter A.S. Moskow J.J. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although Ste20 and Cla4 as well as other Cdc42 effectors such as Gic1/2 share the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain for binding to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42, Bem1 has no CRIB domain and its Cdc42-binding domain has remained to be identified. Similarly, the biological role of the interaction is totally elusive. To answer these questions, we mapped a Cdc42-binding domain of Bem1 to reveal that a region comprising the second SH3 domain (SH3b) and its C-terminal flanking region, the latter of which was termed CI (Cdc42-interacting) region, is responsible for the interaction. We isolated a separation-of-function mutant of the SH3b-CI that is specifically defective in Cdc42 binding. The mutant not only highlighted the importance of CI in Cdc42 binding but also allowed us to examine a biological role of the Bem1-Cdc42 interaction. The results indicate that the CI likely cooperates with the SH3b to recruit Ste20 to Bem1, thereby ensuring efficient mating pheromone signaling. Yeast Strains and General Yeast Methods—The yeast strains used in this study were summarized in Table 1. We used standard media and methods for the growth and manipulation of yeast cells (19Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Steams T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). For transformation, the protocol of Gietz and Schiestl (20Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 229-269Google Scholar) was adopted except for the addition of 10% Me2SO prior to the heat shock step. For gene disruption, the PCR-mediated single step method was applied using the kanMX cassette (21Güldner U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauser J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (22Ito T. Tashiro K. Muta S. Ozawa R. Chiba T. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto K. Kuhara S. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceFY1679-28CMATa ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 his3Δ20034YYF001MATa ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 bem1ΔThis studyYYF002MATα ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 bem1ΔThis studyYYF003MATa ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 bem1Δ bar1ΔThis studyYYF004MATa ura3-52 trp1Δ63 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 bem1Δ bud1ΔThis studyYYW001MATa ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 can1-100 bem1ΔThis studyPJ69-2AMATa ura3-52 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2ClontechPJ69-4AΔMATa ura3-52 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 his3Δ200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ lig4Δ23MavχMATα ura3-52 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 his3Δ200 gal4Δ gal80Δ SPAL10::URA3 LYS2::kanMX-Lexop-HIS3 GAL1::lacZ23 Open table in a new tab Dual-bait Reverse Two-hybrid Screen for bem1 Allele Defective in Cdc42 Binding—The DNA fragment encoding Bem1-(140–256) was subjected to error-prone PCR, and the products were cloned in a prey vector pGADg (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with the transformation-associated recombination technique using PJ69-4aΔ (MATa) as a host (23Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consequently, mutated Bem1 proteins were expressed as proteins fused with the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-AD). Transformants were selected on the synthetic complete medium (19Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Steams T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) lacking leucine (SC-Leu), and subsequently mated with Mavχ (MATα) cells (23Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) bearing both pGBK-Cdc42-(G12V/C188S), which expresses Cdc42 as a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-DBD) fusion, and pHLZ-Ste20-PRR, which expresses Ste20-(1–29/435–497) (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) as an LexA fusion. The diploid cells were plated onto SC-Trp-Leu-His-Ade medium supplemented with 50 mm 3-aminotriazole and 0.2% 5-fluoroorotic acid. Note that all Cdc42 two-hybrid constructs carry C188S substitution, because the geranylgeranylation at Cys-188 would inhibit nuclear translocation of the hybrid proteins, a prerequisite for the two-hybrid interactions. In Vitro Binding Assays Using Recombinant Proteins Purified from Escherichia coli—We expressed Bem1-(140–271) as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose-binding protein (MBP), Cdc42-(G12V) as a His6/T7-tagged protein, and Ste20-CRIB (amino acids 328–428) as an MBP fusion or GST fusion protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. These proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), or Amylose resins (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The affinity-purified Cdc42 was loaded with GTPγS prior to the binding assays. For an in vitro pull-down assay, GST fusion proteins were incubated with other proteins in Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Following the incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The precipitated proteins were detected by an immunoblotting procedure using an anti-GST, T7, or MBP monoclonal antibody and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) in LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). A synthetic 24-mer peptide corresponding to Ste20-(463–486) was purchased from Sigma. β-Galactosidase Assay—The yeast cells harvested from 1.0 ml of culture by centrifugation were permeabilized using Y-PER (Pierce) and resuspended in 700 μl of Z-Buffer (19Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Steams T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding 160 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (4 mg/ml) to the suspension and was stopped by adding 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. Following the centrifugal removal of cell debris, the A420 of the supernatant was measured. Mating and Pheromone Response Assay—Quantitative mating and pheromone response assays were performed as previously described (24Lamson R.E. Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, the same numbers of a- and α-type cells were combined and collected onto a nitrocellulose filter by filtration. The filter was placed on wet YPAD (19Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Steams T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar) plate at 30 °C for overnight to allow mating. The cells were washed off from the filter and plated to an appropriate medium to select diploid cells. Mating efficiency between the wild-type cells was taken as 100%. For the FUS1-lacZ reporter assay, YYF003 cells (bem1Δ bar1Δ) having an episomal copy of BEM1 or a certain bem1 allele were grown to mid-log phase in an appropriate selective medium and stimulated with 25 nm α-factor. Yeast Three-hybrid Assay—The yeast three-hybrid assay was performed using PJ69-2A cells and a pBridge vector (BD Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Mapping a Cdc42-binding Domain of Bem1—Although Bem1 was reported to bind the GTP-bound form of Cdc42, the region responsible for the interaction has remained to be identified. To address this issue, we examined various portions of Bem1 for the interaction with Cdc42-(G12V/C188S), an activated form of Cdc42, using a yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal half of Bem1 spanning amino acid residues 283–551 or Bem1-(283–551), which contains both the PX/PB2 and PB1 domains, showed a two-hybrid interaction with Cdc24 (9Ito T. Matsui Y.

In contrast, the N-terminal half or Bem1-(1–256), which contains two SH3 domains, showed a two-hybrid interaction with both Cdc42 and the proline-rich region (PRR) of Ste20 (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We further divided the N-terminal half into Bem1-(1–140) and Bem1-(140–256), which contain the first and second SH3 domains, respectively. Although the former failed to interact with Cdc42, the latter displayed a two-hybrid interaction with Cdc42 comparable to the one shown by Bem1-(1–256). The second SH3 domain (SH3b) of Bem1 was previously shown to bind the PRRs of Ste20, Cla4, and Boi1/2 (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Leeuw T. Fourest-Lievin A. Wu C. Chenevert J. Clark K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because all of these proteins were reported to bind Cdc42, it is possible that the observed two-hybrid interaction reflects an indirect binding of Bem1 to Cdc42 that is mediated by these proteins. To examine this possibility, we substituted Lys for Trp-192, a residue critical for the SH3b to recognize the Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro motifs of Ste20, Cla4, and Boi1/2 (7Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If these Cdc42-binding proteins also capable of binding the SH3b mediated the observed two-hybrid interaction of Bem1 with Cdc42, the W192K substitution would abolish the interaction. Consistent with previous observations, Bem1-(140–256/W192K) failed to bind Ste20-PRR and Boi2-PRR but still interacted with Cdc42 as efficiently as Bem1-(140–256) (Fig. 1B). It is thus unlikely that a third party protein (i.e. the targets of the SH3b) mediated the two-hybrid interaction observed between Bem1 and Cdc42. This notion was further reinforced by successful detection of the interaction in a bacterial two-hybrid system (data not shown) and by an in vitro binding assay using purified recombinant proteins (see below). The failure of the W192K substitution to abolish the Cdc42 binding also implies that the interaction of Bem1-(140–256) with Cdc42 does not involve the canonical mode of ligand recognition by SH3 domain, although Cdc42 bears a Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro sequence (amino acids 106–109). Dual-bait Reverse Two-hybrid Screen for Separation-of-function bem1 Alleles—To pinpoint the region responsible for the Cdc42 binding, we tried to subdivide Bem1-(140–256). However, all of our trials have so far failed (data not shown). Thus, we decided to isolate separation-of-function mutants that can interact with Ste20 but not with Cdc42. For this purpose, we conducted a dual-bait reverse two-hybrid screening (Fig. 2A). In this screening, we expressed Ste20-PRR and Cdc42 as fusions with LexA and Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-DBD), respectively, in Mavχ cells (Table 1). LexA-Ste20-PRR binds the lexA operator sequences embedded upstream of HIS3 reporter gene, whereas Gal4-DBD-Cdc42 binds the Gal4-binding site located upstream of URA3 reporter gene. On the other hand, we introduced random mutations into the DNA fragment encoding Bem1-(140–256) by means of error-prone PCR and cloned the products into a prey vector that expresses its insert as a fusion with the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-AD), thereby constructing a library of mutated Bem1 fused with Gal4-AD in PJ69-4AΔ cells (Table 1). The Mavχ cells (MATα) and PJ69-4AΔ cells (MATa) carrying the bait and library plasmids, respectively, were mated to form diploid cells (MATa/α), which were selected on a medium containing both 3-aminotriazole and 5-fluoroorotic acid. Because the expression of HIS3 and URA3 reporter genes confers 3-aminotriazole-resistant and 5-fluoroorotic acid-sensitive phenotypes, respectively, the diploid cell would not survive the selection unless it bears a mutated Bem1 that is capable of binding to Ste20 but not to Cdc42 (Fig. 2A). Using this screening strategy, we successfully isolated three single-point mutants encoding Bem1 that can interact with Ste20 but not with Cdc42 (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, all of these mutations occurred in the C-terminal flanking region of the SH3b but not in the SH3b per se. These results are consistent with the result of the W192K substitution described above (Fig. 1B), underscoring a critical role of the non-SH3 region in Cdc42 recognition. Thus, we designated the C-terminal flanking segment of the SH3b as the CI region. Among the identified substitutions, we selected N253D for further analysis because of its prominent effect on the interaction: it abolished the binding of Bem1-(140–256) to Cdc42-(G12V) but not to Ste20-PRR (Fig. 2C). The effect of N253D substitution was specific to the activated form of Cdc42, because Bem1-(140–256) failed to interact with Cdc42-(D57Y), an inactivated form of Cdc42, even in the presence of this substitution (Fig. 2C). To confirm the importance of this residue in the context of the full-length protein, we examined Bem1-(1–551) with and without the N253D substitution for Cdc42 binding (Fig. 2D). In contrast with the wild-type protein, the N253D mutant failed to show a two-hybrid interaction with Cdc42 but bound to Ste20-PRR and Cdc24-PB1 as efficiently as the wild-type Bem1. These results indicate that the CI is critically involved in the two-hybrid interaction between Bem1 and Cdc42. Similarly, in vivo pull-down assays using proteins with N253D mutation indicated the importance of CI in Cdc42-binding (data not shown). Direct Interaction between Bem1 and Cdc42—To examine whether the interaction described above is direct or not, we performed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins expressed in and purified from E. coli cells (Fig. 3A). We expressed Bem1-SH3b-CI and Cdc42-(G12V) as a GST fusion and a His6/T7-tagged protein, respectively. To improve the solubility, the SH3b-CI used in this assay was slightly extended toward its C terminus (amino acids 140–271) compared with the original one (amino acids 140–256) used in the two-hybrid assay. We confirmed that both forms show comparable binding to Cdc42 in the two-hybrid system (data not shown). The GST-Bem1-SH3b-CI immobilized to glutathione resin was incubated with His6/T7-Cdc42-(G12V). The proteins bound to the resin were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a filter membrane, and detected using an anti-T7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, His6/T7-Cdc42-(G12V) was coprecipitated with GST-Bem1-SH3b-CI. Importantly, the N253D substitution abolished the binding, whereas the W192K substitution did not affect the binding (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent with the results obtained by the two-hybrid system (Fig. 2). Thus, we concluded that Bem1-SH3b-CI can directly interact with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and that the CI is critically involved in this direct interaction. A Biological Role of the Bem1-Cdc42 Interaction—To reveal a biological role of the Bem1-Cdc42 interaction mediated by the SH3b-CI, we compared the phenotypes of two bem1Δ strains, one bearing an episomal copy of BEM1 and the other bearing bem1-N253D, in an FY1679 background. A temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of bem1Δ cells was comparably suppressed by the BEM1 and bem1-N253D, both of which were expressed from a centromeric vector using their own BEM1 promoter (data not shown). We also failed to find any difference in growth between the cells bearing bem1-W192K and bem1-W192K/N253D alleles (data not shown). Since the deletion of BUD1 was reported to render BEM1 essential for growth (13Irazoqui J.E. Gladfelter A.S. Lew D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we reasoned that bud1Δ background may sensitize the assay. Although the synthetic lethality was not observed in the FY1679 background, cells deleted for both BEM1 and BUD1 displayed a severe temperature-sensitive growth (Fig. 4A). As expected, bem1-W192K suppressed the phenotype less effectively than BEM1. Notably, the defective suppression by bem1-W192K was exacerbated by the N253D substitution (Fig. 4A). Further examination of other genetic backgrounds led us to find that bem1-N253D is defective in suppression of temperature-sensitive growth of W303 cells deleted for BEM1 (Fig. 4B). Many bem1 mutants are known to cause a bilateral mating defect. We thus examined mating efficiency of the bem1Δ cells bearing an episomal copy of various bem1 alleles (Fig. 4C). In this assay, we mated a- and α-type cells sharing the same bem1 allele. We prepared bem1-W192K, -N253D, and -I489A alleles, which bear a loss-of-function mutation in the SH3b, CI, and PB1, respectively. We also generated three additional bem1 alleles by combining two of these mutations. The importance of the SH3b and PB1 domains in mating was demonstrated previously (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Irazoqui J.E. Gladfelter A.S. Lew D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, both the W192K and I489A substitutions substantially inhibited the mating (Fig. 4C). We had previously used K482A substitution for the PB1, which almost completely eliminates the binding of Bem1 to Cdc24 and hence confers a severe defect in mating (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we employed the I489A substitution that causes ∼50% inhibition of the interaction (29Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), because the effect of additional mutations would be masked when combined with such a strong mutation as the K482A (see below). In contrast with the substitutions in the SH3b and PB1, the effect of the N253D substitution in the CI was rather modest, although it reproducibly suppressed mating (Fig. 4C). We thus examined the synthetic effect between the N253D and W192K or I489A substitutions. Although the N253D substitution affected the I489A-induced mating defect only modestly, it considerably exacerbated the defect caused by the W192K substitution (Fig. 4C). Thus, the CI may affect the function mediated by the SH3b but not tha"

Forebrain-specific MAO A transgenic mice were generated from MAO A knock-out (KO) mice by using the promoter of calcium-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα). The presence of human MAO A transgene and its expression were verified by PCR of genomic DNA and reverse transcription-PCR of mRNA and Western blot, respectively. Significant MAO A catalytic activity, autoradiographic labeling of 5-HT, and immunocytochemistry of MAO A were found in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus but not in the cerebellum of the forebrain transgenic mice. Also, compared with MAO A KO mice, lower levels of 5-HT, norepinephrine, and DA and higher levels of MAO A metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were found in the forebrain regions but not in the cerebellum of the transgenic mice. These results suggest that MAO A is specifically expressed in the forebrain regions of transgenic mice. This forebrain-specific differential expression resulted in abrogation of the aggressive phenotype. Furthermore, the disorganization of the somatosensory cortex barrel field structure associated with MAO A KO mice was restored and became morphologically similar to wild type. Thus, the lack of MAO A in the forebrain of MAO A KO mice may underlie their phenotypes.

These studies suggest that the changes in brain monoamines such as 5-HT, NE, and DA may be related to aggression in MAO A/B double KO mice.

They show chase/escape and anxiety-like behavior different from MAO A or B single KO, suggesting that varying monoamine levels result in a unique behavioral phenotype.

These studies suggest the neuronal developmental stage is critically important for the aggressive behavior in adulthood in both human and mice, prompting us to create a transgenic mouse that would restore the somatosensory cortex structure in the early developmental period and alleviate the aggressive behavior in the adult male mouse. To do this, we used the mouse calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) promoter to drive expression of a human MAO A transgene in MAO A KO mice. CaMKIIα is an abundant protein specifically expressed in forebrain synapses from postnatal day 1 to adult life. This promoter has been well characterized with regard to specific forebrain expression, including neocortex, striatum, and hippocampus (24Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.-Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D.

This is the first study showing that the forebrain of transgenic mice with the mouse CaMKIIα promoter/human MAO A construct in MAO A KO mice is able to modify the phenotypes observed in MAO A KO mice to a phenotype more like wild type. This study further confirms the role of MAO A itself in somatosensory cortex organization and aggressive behavior. Construction of pCaMKIIα-MAO A cDNA Vector—The 20-kb human MAO A cDNA was excised by EcoRI digestion from a pECE vector. The insert was ligated into the EcoRV site of pNN265. This vector contained a 5′ intron and a 3′ intron plus a poly(A) signal from SV40 (28Choi T. Huang M. Gorman C. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The insert containing human MAO A cDNA was digested by NotI and was ligated into the unique NotI site of pMM403 that contains the 8.6-kb CaMKIIα promoter (24Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.-Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The orientation of the insert was determined by digestion with HindIII. The linearized plasmid DNA (Fig. 1) was then microinjected into fertilized eggs from MAO A KO mice. Identification of Forebrain Transgenic Mice by PCR—The presence of MAO A cDNA in forebrain MAO A transgenic mice was shown by PCR using a pair of primers that are complementary to parts of human MAO A exon 3 (E3F, 5′-GATTACGTAGATGTTGGTGGAGC-3′; 254–276) and exon 10 (E10R 5′-GATGGCAGGCAGTGACCCATCAG-3′; 1120 to 1098). A 0.87-kb PCR product is expected when human MAO A cDNA is expressed. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles (Fig. 1B). Anchor PCR for Determination of Transgene Insertion Site—Genomic DNA isolated from the transgenic MAO A KO mouse tail was partially digested by Sau3AI enzyme to create sticky ends for ligation into the BamHI site of the pUC19 vector. The primer was designed according to the most 5′ end of mouse CaMKIIα promoter sequence in the antisense direction (5′-AGA AGG GTG CGG ACT ACA TCG-3′). The anchor primer was from pU19 flanking the BamHI site (5′-cgg ctc gta tgtt gtg tgg-3′). PCR was run under the following conditions: 94 °C 3 min; 94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 30 s, 72 °C 2 min, for 32 cycles; the last extension at 72 °C was for 10 min. The PCR product was checked by 1% agarose gel to ensure a product larger than 1 kb was present. The PCR product was cloned into TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and single colonies were isolated. Clones containing inserts were sequenced. Sequences were subjected to National Center for Biotechnology Information VecScreen and BLAT analysis using the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Bioinformatics server (mouse genome assembly Feb. 2006). Demonstration of Forebrain-specific Expression of Human MAO A Protein and RNA by Western Blot and RT-PCR—Western blot was done by using anti-human MAO A antibody. Tissue homogenates were isolated from various tissues of WT, MAO A KO, and forebrain transgenic mice, separated in a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted by 1:1,000 diluted rabbit anti-human MAO A antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, and then incubated with 1:10,000 diluted goat anti-rabbit antibody for another 30 min, and washed three times. The membrane was incubated with ECL for 1 min and exposed to x-ray film. The total RNAs were isolated from WT, MAO A KO, and forebrain transgenic mice and reverse-transcripted by random primers. The specific primers were designed from the human MAO A gene (F1, 5′-GGT GGA TCT GGT CAAGTG AG-3′; R1, 5′-CTT TGT GGC AGT CTC TGT GC-3′), mouse MAO B gene (F as F1, R, 5′-GGGAGG GAA GTA GGT TGT GT-3′) and 18 S rRNA gene as the control (F, 5′-CGCCGC TAG AGG TGAAAT TC-3′; R,5′-CGA ACC TCC GAC TTT CGT TC-3′). Amplification was carried out in a 25-μl volume by iCycler (Bio-Rad): 94 °C 3 min; 94 °C 30 s, 62 °C 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Determination of MAO A Activity in Forebrain Transgenic Mice—Adult male wild type (C3H strain), MAO A KO, and forebrain transgenic mice aged 1–4 months were used in all studies. The mice were housed individually and were allowed free access to food and water. They were housed in an air-conditioned unit with controlled temperature (20–22 °C) and humidity (50–60%). Lighting was maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights on 0600–1800). The mice were sacrificed, and their whole brains were rapidly removed and placed in a brain matrix (ASI Instruments) embedded in ice. 2-mm thick sections were cut, and samples from frontal cortex (3 per side from 3.2 to 1.2 mm), striatum (4 per side from 0.2 to –1.8 mm), hippocampus (3 per side from –1.8 to –3.8 mm), and cerebellum (4 per side from –5.8 to –7.8 mm) were punched out from the sections with a blunt 18-gauge needle. Punched samples were homogenized in 50 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, used for MAO A activity determination as described previously (17Cases O. Seif I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Müller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In some cases, mitochondria were isolated from different brain regions, and MAO A activity was determined in the mitochondria pellets. Autoradiography—The mice were sacrificed, and their brains were removed and frozen in isopentane. The brains were stored at –70 °C for no longer than 1 month before sectioning. For autoradiographic mapping, 12-μm frozen coronal sections were cut in duplicate (500 μm apart) in a cryostat at –20 °C and were thaw-mounted onto precleaned, superfrost/plus ice-cold microscope slides and dried by using anhydrous CaSO4 for 2 h at 4 °C followed by 1 week at –20 °C. For the determination of total and nonspecific binding with [3H]Ro 41-1049, adjacent sections were cut from 3.20-mm bregma, which was identified according to the mouse brain atlas of Franklin and Paxinos (29Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, New York1997Google Scholar). [3H]Ro 41-1049 was a kind gift from Dr. G. Richards at Hoffmann-La Roche. For autoradiographic visualization of MAO A-binding sites, incubations were carried out in parallel for sections from wild type, MAO A KO, and forebrain transgenic mice with 15 nm [3H]Ro 41-1049. Prior to binding, slides were thawed for 30 min at room temperature. Slides for the determination of total binding were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (1 ml for each slide), for 60 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by simultaneously treating a parallel set of slides, under identical incubation conditions with the addition of 1 μm clorgyline. The detailed procedure was published previously (30Cesura A.M. Bos M. Galva M.D. Imof R. Da Prada M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 358-366PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of MAO A binding was carried out by video-based computerized densitometry using a Xenix image analyzer. Tissue equivalents (nCi per mg of tissue) for MAO A labeling were derived from 3H microscale standard-based calibrations laid down with each film after subtraction of nonspecific binding images. Quantified measures were taken from both the left and right sides of sections from the whole of the frontal cortex (3.2 to –1.8 mm), striatum (1.7 to –1.3 mm), hippocampus (–1.3 to –3.8 mm), and cerebellum (–5.8 to –7.3 mm) in successive sections 500 μm apart. Immunocytochemistry—Animal procedures were conducted in strict compliance with approved institutional protocols and in accordance with the provisions for animal care and use described in the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC). Experiments were carried out on P7 and adult mice. The day of birth was counted as P0. Anesthetized animals were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PB). Serial sections were cut on a freezing microtome (50 μm). Alternate series of sections were used for immunostaining and Nissl (0.05% thionine in acetate buffer, pH 5.5). For immunostaining, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to 5-HT (1:5000; Sigma), the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (1:5000; Calbiochem), the mGluR5 (1:2000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), the MAO A (1:1000; this study), and MAO B (1:2000) were diluted in 0.02 m PB saline with 0.2% gelatin and 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBS+). Sections were washed in PB and incubated for 1 h in PBS+. Sections were incubated sequentially with the primary antibodies (24 h at 4 °C), PBS+ (30 min), secondary antibodies (biotinylated goat anti-rat; biotinylated swine anti-rabbit; 1:200; DAKO, Denmark) (2 h at room temperature), PBS+, streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (1:200; Amersham Biosciences) (2 h at room temperature) and reacted with a solution containing 0.02% diaminobenzidine, 0.6% nickel ammonium sulfate (Carlo Erba), and 0.003% H2O2 in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.6. All sections were mounted on TESPA-coated slides (Sigma), air-dried overnight, dehydrated, and coverslipped in DePeX/CO. For visualization, sections were sequentially incubated in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) with 10% sucrose, 0.2% cobalt chloride (10 min), phosphate-buffered sucrose, 0.007% cytochrome c, 0.002% catalase, 0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.05% diaminobenzidine in phosphate-buffered sucrose (all products from Sigma), and phosphate buffer. HPLC Determination of the Levels of NE, DA, Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid, 5-HT, and 5-Hydroxyindolacetic Acid (5-HIAA) in Forebrain Regions of Forebrain Transgenic Mice—Mice were sacrificed, and brain samples were quickly removed and immediately frozen in isopentane. Brain samples were homogenized in 100 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 2.0. The homogenates were sonicated using a Fisher sonic dismembrator (model 550) with the probe sonicator at setting 2 in 10 volumes of buffer at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The protein concentrations of the pellets were determined using the BCA kit (Pierce). The supernatant was centrifuged and stored at –70 °C until HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was described previously (18Kim J.J. Shih J.C. Chen K. Chen L. Bao S. Maren S. Anagnostaras S.G. Faneslow M.S. De Maeyer E. Seif I. Thompson R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Resident-Intruder Confrontations of Forebrain Transgenic Mice—All mice were housed individually for at least 1 week in transparent Makrolon cages measuring 29 × 13 × 13 cm. Confrontations were between mice of the same strain and of similar ages and weights. They were organized in a Latin Square arrangement, and all sessions were at least 2 days apart to prevent animal fatigue. An intruder mouse was placed in the cage of the resident mouse. The mice were allowed to interact for 10 min after the first attack. The interactions of the mice were videotaped for later analysis. The analysis procedure was described previously (31Shih J.C. Ridd M.J. Chen K. Meehan W.P. Kung M.-P. Seif I. De Mayer E. Brain Res. 1999; 835: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The following five behaviors were assessed: (i) nonsocial (absence of exploration of other mouse); (ii) investigative (subject actively investigates cage, mainly by sniffing); (iii) defensive (subject actively defends or shields itself from opponent, e.g. standing on hind legs with forearms in the air); (iv) aggressive (subject engages in physical fight with opponent, e.g. biting or kicking attack); and (v) locomotive (subject is rapidly roaming cage). Generation of Forebrain-specific MAO A Transgenic Mice from MAO A KO Mice—To produce forebrain-specific MAO A transgenic mice, a full-length human MAO A cDNA clone was ligated to the CaMKIIα promoter to confer expression in specific brain regions where the CaMKIIα promoter is normally active. The orientation of the insert was determined by digestion with HindIII. Fig. 1A illustrates the construction schema and final construct used to create the transgenic mice by microinjection of the linearized plasmid DNA into fertilized eggs of MAO A KO mice. After birth, the introduction of human MAO A was assayed by PCR and confirmed. A specific 0.87-kb PCR product was detected in genomic DNA prepared from the tails of forebrain transgenic mice but not in the wild type or in the MAO A KO mice (Fig. 1B). This confirms that we were able to successfully integrate the human MAO A cDNA into the mice genomes. Sequences derived from anchor PCR using a CaMKIIα promoter indicated insertion took place in chromosome seven (7qE3 region) and in chromosome four (4qC7 region). In each case chromosomal sequences contiguous with CaMKIIα promoter-based PCR primer corresponding to genomic sequences flanking the 5′ end of the transgenic insertion were identified by BLAT analysis for both forward and reverse CaMKIIα primers with these primer sequences aligning with chromosome 18 in the upstream promoter region of the CaMKIIα gene. The chromosome seven anchor PCR-derived sequences spanned 763 bases with 99.5% identity from 105031154 to 105031916 (same results with forward and reverse primers) and included partial overlap with an intronless olfactory receptor gene, Olfr684. Chromosome four aligned with derived anchor PCR sequences over a span of 290 bases from 106111874 to 106112163 with 99% identity. This integration site fell in to the fourth intron of the uncharacterized BC055111 gene. Forebrain-specific expression of the introduced human MAO A transgene was evaluated by reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting using anti-human MAO A antibody. Both evaluations indicated a brain region-specific expression was achieved in the transgenic mice. Fig. 1C illustrates Western blot results and RT-PCR results for the human MAO A transcript and protein, respectively. Transcript and protein are observed in specific brain regions or tissue. Frontal cortex and hippocampus both expressed MAO A, but cerebellum and liver did not. Negative controls were wild type mouse, which do not express human MAO A and the MAO A KO strain used to create this transgenic mouse strain. As expected there was no detectable human MAO A mRNA or protein present in MAO A KO mice (Fig. 1C). This line of transgenic mice was viable and fertile. They were intercrossed to obtain the needed number of animals for behavioral and biochemical studies. Healthy forebrain transgenic mice were obtained at the expected frequency and weight. No changes in overall brain structure or appearance compared with MAO A KO and wild type mice could be detected. MAO A Catalytic Activity and Autoradiography Show the Expression of MAO A Specifically in the Forebrain of Transgenic Mice—Catalytic activity of MAO A using 5-HT as substrate was measured in the whole homogenates or mitochondria of the frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of wild type, MAO A KO, and the forebrain transgenic mice (Table 1). No activity was detectable in MAO A KO mice as expected. Significant MAO A activity was detected in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus but not in the cerebellum of the transgenic mice. This suggests that MAO A is indeed expressed in the specific forebrain regions under the control of the CaMKIIα promoter. Furthermore, MAO A activity was found to be associated with the mitochondria, and this result indicates that the expressed MAO A are located on mitochondria, as is wild type for MAO. This result indicates that the human C-terminal sequence retains this targeting ability (32Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Chen K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29499-29506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) when expressed in mice. Thus, MAO A is expressed in a forebrain-specific manner, with mitochondrial localization; however, the MAO A activity is only 2–5% of the wild type. The MAO A KO mice into which the human MAO A was introduced have essentially zero MAO A activity. The low MAO A activity in these transgenic mice points toward low CaMKIIα promoter activity compared with the endogenous MAO A promoter.TABLE 1MAO A catalytic activity with 5-HT as the substrate in forebrain transgenic, MAO A KO, and wild type miceGenotypeMAO A activity (nmol/20 min/mg of protein)Frontal cortexStriatumHippocampusCerebellumWild type (n = 4)26.5 ± 0.137.2 ± 1.247.6 ± 4.839.8 ± 2.6MAO A KO (n = 5)0.3 ± 0.1**0.4 ± 0.01**0.4 ± 0.1**0.3 ± 0.1**Forebrain transgenic (n = 5)1.3 ± 0.1##++1.0 ± 0.2##++1.3 ± 0.2##++0.3 ± 0.1** Open table in a new tab Ro 41-1049 is a specific inhibitor of MAO A (Kd value in low nanomolar range), which can be used as a radioligand for MAO A. Autoradiographic visualization of MAO A-binding sites in the brain sections using [3H]Ro 41-1049 was done to assess regional specific MAO A expression in the brain of the forebrain transgenic mice compared with MAO A KO and wild type mice. Results are shown in Fig. 2. High levels of [3H]Ro 41-1049 labeling in the frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum in wild type mice was observed (and was abolished by 1 μm clorgyline; data not shown) demonstrating that [3H]Ro 41-1049 selectively labels MAO A. [3H]Ro 41-1049 labeling in MAO A KO mice was at background levels confirming the absence of MAO A as expected in MAO KO mice. On the other hand, significant levels of [3H]Ro 41-1049 labeling in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus but not in the cerebellum were observed in the forebrain transgenic mice. Taken together, these data (Table 1 and Fig. 2) suggest that MAO A was specifically expressed in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus but not in cerebellum of forebrain transgenic mice, which is consistent with the expression of CaMKIIα (17Cases O.

https://openalex.org/W2072486317,"Unr (upstream of N-ras) is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of messenger RNA stability and internal initiation of translation. We have used Unr-deficient murine embryonic stem (ES) cells to analyse Unr role in cell proliferation and response to stress. Disruption of both unr gene copies had no effect on ES cell proliferation. However, after ionizing radiation (IR), clonogenic survival of unr(-/-) ES cells was approximately 3-fold enhanced as compared to unr(+/+) cells. We further determined that IR-induced apoptosis was decreased in unr(-/-) ES cells, and that reintroduction of the unr gene in unr(-/-) cells restored normal IR-induced apoptosis. Three pro-apoptotic genes, p53, caspase-3 and Gadd45gamma, were downregulated in unr(-/-) ES cells, indicating that Unr, as other cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, regulates a complex genetic program, promoting cell death after IR. In contrast, in the human hepatoma cell line HuH7, Unr knockdown using unr-specific small interfering RNAs induced apoptosis, both in untreated and gamma-irradiated cells. Thus, our results establish that Unr acts as a positive or negative regulator of cell death, depending on the cell type. Manipulating the level of Unr may constitute a specific approach to sensitize cancer cells to anticancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2058892495,"We have previously reported the identification of a DNA repair system in Escherichia coli for the prevention of the stable incorporation of noncanonical purine dNTPs into DNA. We hypothesized that the RdgB protein is active on 2′-deoxy-N-6-hydroxylaminopurine triphosphate (dHAPTP) as well as deoxyinosine triphosphate. Here we show that RdgB protein and RdgB homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mouse, and human all possess deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity and that all four RdgB homologs have high specificity for dHAPTP and deoxyinosine triphosphate compared with the four canonical dNTPs and several other noncanonical (d)NTPs. Kinetic analysis reveals that the major source of the substrate specificity lies in changes in Km for the various substrates. The expression of these enzymes in E. coli complements defects that are caused by the incorporation of HAP and an endogenous noncanonical purine into DNA. Our data support a preemptive role for the RdgB homologs in excluding endogenous and exogenous modified purine dNTPs from incorporation into DNA.

Our data support a preemptive role for the RdgB homologs in excluding endogenous and exogenous modified purine dNTPs from incorporation into DNA. Our laboratory has shown that an Escherichia coli recA200(Ts) rdgB double mutant is inviable at the nonpermissive temperature and suggested that in the absence of RdgB a lesion develops in DNA that requires repair by a RecA-mediated event (1Clyman J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the purA gene suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of rdgB recA200(Ts) mutants (2Clyman J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1360-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purA gene encodes adenylosuccinate synthase, which catalyzes the first step in the conversion of IMP to AMP (3Zalkin H. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 561-579Google Scholar). This result suggests that RdgB may play a role in modulating nucleotide pools. The yeast homolog of RdgB has been named HAM1. Pavlov and co-workers (4Noskov V.N. Staak K. Shcherbakova P.V. Kozmin S.G. Negishi K. Ono B.C. Hayatsu H. Pavlov Y.I. Yeast. 1996; 12: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Pavlov Y.I. Soviet Genet. 1986; 22: 1099-1107Google Scholar) have reported that HAM1 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae display hypersensitivity to N-6-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) 2The abbreviations used are: HAP, N-6-hydroxylaminopurine; dHAPTP, 2′-deoxy-N-6-hydroxylaminopurine triphosphate; dITP, deoxyinosine triphosphate; XTP, xanthine triphosphate; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; Eco, E. coli; Sce, S. cerevisiae; Mmu, M. musculus; Hsa, H. sapiens. 2The abbreviations used are: HAP, N-6-hydroxylaminopurine; dHAPTP, 2′-deoxy-N-6-hydroxylaminopurine triphosphate; dITP, deoxyinosine triphosphate; XTP, xanthine triphosphate; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; Eco, E. coli; Sce, S. cerevisiae; Mmu, M. musculus; Hsa, H. sapiens. and a hypermutable phenotype upon HAP exposure. They suggested the possibility that HAM1 may be a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase and that it may play a role in detoxifying 2′-deoxy-HAP triphosphate. E. coli cells that are deficient in molybdopterin biosynthesis (moa strains) display a hypersensitive and mutagenic phenotype upon exposure to HAP (6Kozmin S.G. Pavlov Y.I. Dunn R.L. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that inactivation of the rdgB gene in a moa background resulted in increased HAP sensitivity, an increase in the level of mutagenesis, and increased recombination and SOS induction upon HAP exposure (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results support a model for the exclusion of HAP residues from DNA that includes a molybdoenzyme and RdgB protein and suggest that the repair system excludes an unknown endogenous noncanonical purine from DNA.Recent work in our laboratory has shown that endonuclease V is an important component of a repair pathway for noncanonical purines that have been incorporated into DNA (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that inactivation of the nfi gene in E. coli results in a reversal of HAP sensitivity, as well as the hyperrecombination and SOS-induced phenotypes of moa and moa rdgB strains exposed to HAP. Moreover, transduction of an nfi mutation into a moa or moa rdgB genetic background results in a further elevated level of mutagenesis. These results led us to propose that endonuclease V plays a primary role in repairing HAP lesions in DNA. We further hypothesized that the lethal lesion may be a double-strand break created by the action of a replicative polymerase traversing endonuclease V-nicked HAP-containing DNA (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A similar role for RdgB protein and endonuclease V has been proposed by Bradshaw and Kuzminov (8Bradshaw J.S. Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1711-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in the exclusion of deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) from DNA.The crystal structure of the Methanococcus jannaschii homolog of RdgB (Mj0226) has been solved using a structure-function based experimental design (9Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This study showed that the protein exists in solution as a homodimer and has an active site cleft that is ideal for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Biochemical analysis showed that the protein displays deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity and has a preference for noncanonical purine nucleoside triphosphates, with little difference in activity between deoxy- and ribonucleotides (9Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Chung J.H. Back J.H. Park Y.I. Han Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was determined that xanthine triphosphate (XTP) and dITP are, respectively, about 180- and 140-fold better substrates for Mj0226 than the best canonical nucleoside triphosphates, dGTP and GTP. The authors suggested that Mj0226 might play a primary role in cleansing purine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools. Interestingly, it was determined that Mj0226 has extremely low deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity with dHAPTP (10Chung J.H. Back J.H. Park Y.I. Han Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This result is in stark contrast to the genetic data reported by Pavlov and co-workers (4Noskov V.N. Staak K. Shcherbakova P.V. Kozmin S.G. Negishi K. Ono B.C. Hayatsu H. Pavlov Y.I. Yeast. 1996; 12: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and our laboratory (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) supporting a role for RdgB in excluding dHAPTP from replication precursor pools.Biochemical analysis of the human homolog of RdgB, ITPase, has shown that the human homolog possesses biochemical properties similar to Mj0226 (11Lin S. McLennan A.G. Ying K. Wang Z. Gu S. Jin H. Wu C. Liu W. Yuan Y. Tang R. Xie Y. Mao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18695-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This study focused on the role of ITPase in preventing accumulation of dITP in human cells. It was shown that ITPase has a 100-fold preference for dITP as a substrate compared with the best canonical purine, GTP or dGTP. Again, it was shown that there was little difference between the deoxy and ribose forms. This study also demonstrated that ITPase is substrate inhibited at high substrate concentrations, as previously documented (12Vanderheiden B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 215: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and forms a 45-kDa homodimer in solution.Biochemical analysis of the E. coli homolog, EcO197 (RdgB), has shown that it has activity similar to that of the M. jannaschii and human homologs (13Chung J.H. Park H.Y. Lee J.H. Jang Y. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 35: 403-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It too has a preference for noncanonical purine nucleoside triphosphates and shows the highest activity with XTP as a substrate, whereas dITP is the next best substrate. EcO197 was determined to have a 100-fold difference in substrate specificity for dITP and dGTP. dGTP and GTP were demonstrated to be the best canonical substrates, and EcO197 was shown to possess pyrophosphate-releasing activity with GTP as a substrate. Effects of substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations were not identified in this report (13Chung J.H. Park H.Y. Lee J.H. Jang Y. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 35: 403-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For simplicity, we will refer to the E. coli homolog as RdgB, the original designation.Because of the discrepancies between the biochemical data (10Chung J.H. Back J.H. Park Y.I. Han Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the genetic data (4Noskov V.N. Staak K. Shcherbakova P.V. Kozmin S.G. Negishi K. Ono B.C. Hayatsu H. Pavlov Y.I. Yeast. 1996; 12: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with regards to dHAPTP and the lack of a comparative analysis of the RdgB homologs, we chose to investigate the biochemical properties of the E. coli, yeast, murine, and human homologs. Here we demonstrate that all four of the homologs have similar biochemical properties. All four homologs have a preference for noncanonical purines, have deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity with dHAPTP as a substrate, and display substrate inhibition at high dITP concentrations. Kinetic analysis revealed that the major source of differences in specificity between canonical and noncanonical substrates was substrate binding. Furthermore, we provide biological evidence of a role for these proteins in the cleansing of purine pools. Overexpression of any of the four RdgB homologs in a recA200(Ts) rdgB double mutant reverses the temperature-sensitive phenotype. We also demonstrate that all four RdgB homologs complement E. coli moa rdgB double mutants with respect to HAP sensitivity. The data we present strongly suggest that the RdgB homologs have a primary role in excluding noncanonical purines from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools, including dHAPTP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESE. coli Growth Conditions—The medium used for growth was TY (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl/liter at pH 7.2). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: tetracycline hydrochloride, 20 μg/ml; kanamycin sulfate, 34 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/ml; ampicillin, 50 μg/ml. Cell growth was routinely monitored in a Genesys 10vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY) at 600 nm.E. coli Strain Construction—P1-mediated transductions were performed as described previously (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Strains containing a deletion of the purA gene (Δ purA) were constructed using a PCR-based technology developed by Link et al. (14Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) in the KL16 wild type E. coli strain. Deletions of the rdgB gene (ΔrdgB) were constructed by the method of Datsenko and Wanner (15Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). rdgB::FLP(cat-1)FLP alleles were initially constructed in BW25113 cells bearing an arabinose-inducible λ Red helper plasmid. The resulting rdgB insertional mutant was moved into the BL21(DE3) (Novagen, San Diego, CA) expression strain by P1 transduction with selection for chloramphenicol resistance. The chloramphenicol resistance gene was flanked by FLP recognition target sequences, allowing for the rdgB insertional mutants to be converted to deletion mutants with the aid of a helper plasmid bearing a temperature-sensitive replicon and a thermally inducible promotor driving FLP recombinase expression (15Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). An antibiotic-sensitive clone was isolated and designated NEB195. All of the deletion strains were verified by PCR analysis (14Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 15Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). The recA200 allele was introduced into RPC133 (1Clyman J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by cotransduction with the linked slrD300::Tn10 allele (16Csonka L.N. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 529-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C and selection for tetracycline resistance to generate a rdgB recA200(Ts) strain. moa strains were constructed by transducing the moa-250::Tn10d(Tcr) allele into W3110 and selecting for tetracycline resistance. All moa mutants were confirmed by testing for chlorate resistance (17Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). moa rdgB strains were constructed first by transducing the rdgB3::Kan (1Clyman J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4203-4210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allele into W3110 and selecting for kanamycin resistance followed by introduction of the moa-250::Tn10d(Tcr) (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) allele by P1 transduction. The moa purA rdgB nfi strain was constructed by moving the following alleles into the ΔpurA strain: nfi-1::Cat (18Guo G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 46-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rdgB3::Kan, and moa-250::Tn10d(Tcr). nfi mutant alleles were selected on the basis of chloramphenicol resistance.Measurement of HAP Cytotoxicity—Fresh overnight cultures of strains to be assayed were serially diluted and then plated on TY agar containing various concentrations of HAP. Surviving colonies were scored the next day. All of the strains tested in this assay were derivatives of E. coli W3110.Overexpression and Purification of His6-tagged RdgB Homologs—The coding region of rdgB was cloned from E. coli AB1157 cells into a pET28a vector (Novagen) with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites engineered into the 5′ start site and 3′-untranslated region of the rdgB gene, respectively, using a PCR-based cloning strategy (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.1-14.35Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae homolog, HAM1, was cloned into pET28a from BY4741 cells in a similar manner. The mouse rdgB coding sequence was amplified and cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, mRNA was extracted from NIH 3T3 cells with the Oligotex Direct mRNA extraction kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and NIH 3T3 mRNA template in a reaction primed with oligo(dT). Subsequent PCRs were performed with this cDNA template and the rdgB-specific primer pair rdgB5 (5′-CAG TAA GCT TCT TGC TTG CAA TGG CTG CGT CTT TG) and rdgB3 (5′-ACT CGA ATT CCT ACC CAT GGC GCT AGT GGT CAC CA). The amplified rdgB coding sequence was gel-purified, digested with and HindIII, and cloned into EcoRI/HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1Zeo+. The human rdgB coding sequence was also amplified and cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, mRNA was extracted from RIG cells with the Oligotex Direct mRNA extraction kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and RIG mRNA template in a reaction primed with oligo(dT). Subsequent PCRs were performed with this cDNA template and the human rdgB-specific primer pair HrdgB5 (5′-CAG TAA GCT TGA TCA CCA TGG CGG CCT CAT T) and HrdgB3 (5′-ACT CGA ATT CAG CTG CAG AAG TCA AGC TGC CAA ACT). The amplified human rdgB coding sequence was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned into EcoRI/HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1Zeo+. The mouse and human rdgB genes were then cloned into pET28a using a PCR-based cloning strategy as described above. The sequences of the E. coli, yeast, mouse, and human rdgB genes in pET28a were determined by DNA sequencing and corresponded to those of the wild type genes. The pET28a-rdgB plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and cultured at 37 °C in the presence of antibiotic to an A600 equal to about 0.6, and recombinant RdgB was overexpressed by isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside induction (Sigma). After 4 h of induction at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pelleted cells were stored at –80 °C. Recombinant yeast, mouse, and human homologs were expressed in a similar manner in NEB195 cells (BL21 (DE3) ΔrdgB). Mammalian rdgB encoding plasmids were cotransformed with pRARE (Novagen). Analysis of cell lysate on an SDS-PAGE gel showed major bands with apparent molecular masses consistent with the predicted molecular masses of 23.9 kDa, 23.7 kDa, and 23.2 kDa for the His6-tagged recombinant yeast, mouse, and human proteins, respectively. Pelleted cells were suspended in 10 mm imidazole, 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl buffer at pH 7.4 (Buffer A) and lysed by sonication in five 1-min intervals using a Vibra-Cell sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) set at 40% amplitude. The cell lysates were stirred at 4 °C for 1 h, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. His-tagged RdgB homologs were purified from the soluble fraction of these cells on a Ni2+-containing HiTrap® affinity column from GE Healthcare. Supernatant was loaded onto the Ni2+-charged column at a rate of 3 ml/min and washed with ∼10 ml of Buffer A. Recombinant protein was eluted in 1-ml fractions with Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.1-14.35Google Scholar), and a major band displaying the expected molecular weight was observed for each homolog. Fractions showing the highest degree of purity were selected for dialysis. RdgB and HAM1 proteins were dialyzed (1:500 (v/v)) against 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm CHES, pH 9.5 (Buffer B) overnight. Mammalian homologs were dialyzed against the same buffer containing 1 mm DTT in a similar manner. Yeast, mouse, and human homologs were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm). The elutions were performed with Buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl. The eluants were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and fractions displaying the highest degree of purity were pooled and dialyzed (1:250 (v/v)) overnight in appropriate buffer. Protein concentration was assayed by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) and calibrated with a bovine serum albumin standard. Enzyme preparations were stored in Buffer B and glycerol (1:1 (v/v)) at –20 °C. The final enzyme preparations are displayed on SDS-PAGE in Fig. 1.Analysis of Deoxyribonucleoside Triphosphate Pyrophosphohydrolase Activity of RdgB Homologs—Kinetic analysis was performed with a coupled enzyme assay similar to the protocol described by Bhatnagar et al. (21Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Millipore H2O purified with an Easy Pure UV/UF water system from Barnstead-Thermolyne (Dubuque, IA) was used throughout assay and to prepare all solutions. dATP, dCTP, dTTP, dGTP, GTP, and dITP were purchased from Sigma. All other modified nucleoside triphosphates were purchased from TriLink (San Diego, Ca). The reaction mixture contains, in 0.3 ml: 25 mm CHES, pH 9.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20–2500 μm dNTP, 0.5 unit of yeast pyrophosphatase, and 0.05–5 pmol of enzyme. 50 pmol of recombinant Eco RdgB was used for the substrate specificity reactions. The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, the enzyme was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 10 or sometimes 20 min with dGTP. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 n perchloric acid and 50 μl of an aqueous suspension of Norit A (20% packed volume). The suspension was mixed and centrifuged. An aliquot of the supernatant was removed, spin-filtered (Spin-X high pressure liquid chromatography; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and used for the determination of inorganic orthophosphate by the method of Ames and Dubin (22Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a Genesys 10vis spectrophotometer. Kinetic parameters were determined using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm as calculated by the Enzyme Kinetics module of Sigma Plot software.NMR Spectroscopy—We used NMR spectroscopy to characterize dHAPTP dissolved in water. The data were collected on a 400-MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer. Water suppression during the NMR experiment was accomplished using the water gate pulse sequence supplemented with excitation sculpting (23Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1527) Google Scholar).RESULTSRdgB Homologs Complement the Extreme HAP-sensitive Phenotype of moa rdgB Double Mutants—Cytotoxicity tests were performed to demonstrate that yeast, mouse, and human RdgB homologs complement E. coli rdgB strains with respect to a rescue of HAP sensitivity. Rescue of the extreme HAP-sensitive phenotype by RdgB homologs was demonstrated by constructing plasmids with the E. coli, yeast, mouse, and human homologs of RdgB cloned into a pBR322-based plasmid so that expression was driven by the E. coli endonuclease IV promoter. An empty vector plasmid was also constructed to serve as a control. These plasmids were transformed into E. coli strains bearing either moa or moa rdgB mutations. Fig. 2 shows that E. coli moa strains bearing the empty vector plasmid are sensitive to HAP and display ∼10% survival when plated on medium containing 50 μg/ml HAP. moa rdgB strains bearing the empty vector plasmid are extremely sensitive to killing by HAP and display less than 1% survival when exposed to 5 μg/ml HAP. Fig. 2 shows that cells bearing plasmids expressing an RdgB homolog reverse the extreme HAP-sensitive phenotype of moa rdgB double mutants. The rescue is well past the levels of sensitivity displayed by the moa mutation alone for overexpression of E. coli, yeast, or mouse RdgB protein. With the exception of the human homolog, overexpression of an RdgB homolog results in greater than 80% survival at a HAP concentration of 50 μg/ml. Cells overexpressing the human RdgB complement the rdgB genomic mutation less efficiently and displayed a HAP sensitivity phenotype that is equivalent to a moa mutation alone. Nonetheless the data presented in Fig. 2 does indeed show that human RdgB can complement the rdgB genomic mutation. The human RdgB homolog shows enzymatic activity equivalent to the mouse RdgB homolog (see below), indicating that the reduced level of complementation is most probably caused by a lower level of enzyme expression in the complementation assay. These data support the idea that dHAPTP is indeed a substrate for RdgB and that dHAPTP arises in cells that are deficient in molybdopterin biosynthesis as we have suggested previously (7Burgis N.E. Brucker J.J. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Cytotoxicity test for RdgB complementation of HAP sensitivity. Relative HAP sensitivity of E. coli moa and moa rdgB mutants transformed with plasmid expressing RdgB homologs from a native E. coli promoter or empty vector plasmid. Fresh overnight cultures of strains to be assayed were serially diluted and then plated on TY agar containing various concentrations of HAP. Surviving colonies were scored the next day.

For the temperature sensitivity assay the plasmids were transformed into an E. coli strain with an rdgB recA200(Ts) genetic background. Transformants were streaked on antibiotic containing plates warmed to 30 and 42 °C and incubated overnight at those respective temperatures. Fig. 3 shows that cells bearing plasmids expressing an RdgB homolog are viable at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas cells bearing the empty vector plasmid are not. The fact that these homologs complement the synthetic lethal phenotype of an rdgB recA200(Ts) strain at 42 °C suggests that the endogenous dNTP(s), which E. coli RdgB is preventing from entering replication precursor pools, is a common substrate(s) for all four homologs.FIGURE 3Temperature sensitivity of recA200 rdgB mutants transformed with plasmid expressing RdgB homologs from a native E. coli promoter or empty vector plasmid. Rich media plates containing antibiotic were preincubated at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, streaked with transformed cells, and incubated overnight at the appropriate temperature. The cells were stained with acridine orange solution (0.2 mg/ml in ethanol) and photographed with UV exposure using a 590-nm optical filter (Kodak).

Because activity was much lower with dGTP as a substrate, dGTP concentrations in the range of 0.1–2.5 mm were chosen with 10–30-fold more enzyme per reaction. Previous studies have shown optimal activity with Mg2+ ions for the Methanococcus and E. coli homologs and optimal activity at a pH of about 10 (9Hwang K.Y. Chung J.H. Kim S.H. Han Y.S. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Vanderheiden B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 215: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose a reaction buffer containing 25 mm CHES, pH 9.5, 10 mm MgCl2. Activity of the human homolog has been reported to be enhanced 2-fold in the presence of DTT (11Lin S. McLennan A.G.

The human and mouse homologs have 6 and 5 cysteine residues, respectively, 5 of which are conserved in mammals, whereas the E. coli amino acid sequence has two cysteine residues with only one well conserved, and the S. cerevisiae amino acid sequence contains 1 cysteine residue that is not conserved. DTT is often added to enzyme reactions to provide an environment favorable for maintaining a reduced state for sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues. Therefore DTT would be most important in the react"

AID is involved in the DNA cleavage step of CSR, but the precise role of UNG is not yet understood. Mutations and deletions are footprints of abortive DNA cleavage in the immunoglobulin switch region in splenic B cells stimulated to undergo CSR. However, a UNG deficiency did not reduce the number of such footprints, indicating UNG is dispensable for the DNA cleavage step. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the role of UNG in CSR depends on its WXXF motif. This motif is also essential for the interaction of UNG with the HIV viral peptide Vpr, which recruits UNG to the HIV particle. Furthermore, exogenous Vpr had a dominant-negative effect on CSR. These results suggest that UNG is recruited to the CSR machinery through its WXXF motif by a Vpr-like host factor and plays a novel non-canonical role in a CSR step that follows DNA cleavage.

SHM introduces point mutations in the variable (V) region of Ig genes, resulting in an increase of the antibody affinity to antigens when coupled with selection of B cells by a limited amount of antigen. In the SHM reaction, DNA is first cleaved by single strand nicks, and mutations are subsequently introduced by erroneous DNA repair (4Honjo T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).CSR replaces the expressed heavy-chain constant (CH) region exons from Cμ with other downstream CH exons to generate antibodies with unaltered antigen specificity but with altered effector functions. In CSR, single strand nicks are introduced into both strands of the switch (S) regions to generate staggered cleavage ends with 3′ or 5′ overhangs, which are repaired to form blunt ends by gap-filling DNA synthesis and/or exonucleolytic digestion (4Honjo T.

During this repair process, mutations and deletions are often introduced into the rearranged S regions. Some cleavages in the S regions are abortive and repaired without CSR, but mutations and deletions nonetheless arise during their repair (13Winter E. Krawinkel U. Radbruch A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Gu H. Zou Y.R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1993; 73: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 15Dudley D.D.

Interestingly, UNG deficiency does not significantly affect the SHM frequency, unlike deficiencies of the mismatch repair enzymes, which reduce the SHM frequency to 20-50% (17Rada C. Ehrenstein M.R. Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 18Kim N. Bozek G. Lo J.C. Storb U. J. Exp.

However, UNG deficiency does bias the target base specificity of SHM toward GC, as does a deficiency of MSH2 (16Rada C. Williams G.T. Nilsen H. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Neuberger M.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 20Phung Q.H. Winter D.B. Cranston A. Tarone R.E. Bohr V.A. Fishel R. Gearhart P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1745-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the UNG deficiency in CSR and SHM have been interpreted to support the DNA deamination model: DNA cleavage in CSR and SHM is initiated by the AID-dependent deamination of cytosine (C) to form uracil (U) in the S and V DNA regions, respectively (21Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Subsequently, in this model, U bases are removed by UNG, and a single strand DNA cleavage is made at the abasic site by a base excision repair pathway enzyme, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (22Krokan H.E. Drablos F. Slupphaug G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8935-8948Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).Recently, however, catalytically inactive UNG mutants were shown to restore full CSR activity in UNG-deficient B cells (23Begum N.A.

Moreover, a specific UNG inhibitor, Ugi, blocks CSR activity without inhibiting double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), as assessed by histone γ-H2AX focus formation at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus (23Begum N.A. Kinoshita K. Kakazu N. Muramatsu M. Nagaoka H. Shinkura R. Biniszkiewicz D. Boyer L.A. Jaenisch R. Honjo T. Science. 2004; 305: 1160-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ugi did not inhibit AID-dependent DNA cleavage in the IgH gene during SHM (24Nagaoka H. Ito S. Muramatsu M. Nakata M. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results suggest that UNG is not essential for the cleavage step of CSR or SHM and has an unknown function besides its U-removal activity, which is required in the repair step of CSR. However, other groups, who used a ligation-mediated PCR assay to determine DSB, subsequently reported that UNG is required for DSB in CSR (25Schrader C.E. Linehan E.K. Mochegova S.N. Woodland R.T. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Imai K. Slupphaug G. Lee W.I. Revy P. Nonoyama S. Catalan N. Yel L. Forveille M. Kavli B. Krokan H.E. Ochs H.D. Fischer A. Durandy A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of UNG in SHM and CSR reactions has to be re-evaluated.We re-examined the involvement of UNG in DNA cleavage in CSR by analyzing mutations and deletions in the germ line Sμ region. The frequencies of deletions in the Sμ region in ung-/- and ung-/-msh2-/- IgM+ B cells were indistinguishable from the frequency in wild-type IgM+ B cells. A UNG deficiency increased the frequencies of mutations in the germ line sequence as well as in the rearranged S regions in B cells stimulated to undergo CSR. In addition, mutations in a conserved UNG motif, WXXF, abolished CSR without loss of the U-removal activity UNG. This WXXF motif is a UNGbinding site required an HIV peptide, Vpr, which recruits UNG to the HIV virion (27BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of exogenous Vpr inhibited CSR, apparently by competing with some endogenous factor for the WXXF site. These results indicate that UNG plays a hitherto unknown function in CSR, in a step that is downstream of DNA cleavage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice and Spleen-Cell Preparation—UNG-deficient mice were provided by R. Jaenisch, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA (29Endres M. Biniszkiewicz D. Sobol R.W. Harms C. Ahmadi M. Lipski A. Katchanov J. Mergenthaler P. Dirnagl U. Wilson S.H. Meisel A. Jaenisch R. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1711-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MSH2-deficient mice were provided by K. Tanaka (Osaka University, Osaka). MSH2 and UNG heterozygotes were intercrossed to yield double-knock-out mice. ung-/-msh2+/+ mice from among the littermates of the double-knock-out mice were used as the UNG-deficient mice. Wild-type (C57BL/6) and AID-/- (2Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T. Cell. 2000; 102: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar) mice were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The mice were maintained at the Institute of Laboratory Animals of Kyoto University, under the specific pathogen-free condition.Generation of Hybridomas—Splenocytes were obtained from 7- to 10-week-old mice and cultured at a concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI medium containing 7.5 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-4 and 25 μg/ml LPS. On day 4 of culture, the switching efficiency was monitored, and the activated B cells were fused to the NS-1 myeloma cells. IgM-secreting clones were screened by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay using goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotech), and the allotype of the cytoplasmic IgMs was then examined by FACS, using anti-mouse IgMa (DS-1, BD Pharmingen) and IgMb (AF6-78, BD Pharmingen). Single allotype-expressing hybridomas were expanded. Southern-blotting hybridization was carried out by standard procedures, after digestion of the hybridoma DNA with EcoRI and BamHI.Probes—Sμ probes were designed as previously reported (30Bottaro A. Young F. Chen J. Serwe M. Sablitzky F. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Reina-San-Martin B. Difilippantonio S. Hanitsch L. Masilamani R.F. Nussenzweig A. Nussenzweig M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1767-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ Sμ probes were synthesized by PCR using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) with genomic DNA as the template. The primers were: 5′ Sμ probe forward, 5′-CGAAACCAGGCACCGCAAATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGTGGCCTTCCTTCTGCGTAT-3′;3′ Sμ probe forward, 5′-AGCCGGACTAAACTATGCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCATGGCCACCAGATTCTTATCAG-3′.The PCR amplification products were poly-A-tailed and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI). The purified fragments were cloned into the plasmid pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Plasmid DNA was digested with EcoRI and separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel, and the DNA was isolated from the gel bands. The purified fragments were used as probes for Southern blots. Probe labeling was performed by the random-priming procedure, using DIG DNA Labeling mix (Roche Applied Science). Hybridized probes were revealed using the DIG detection Starter Kit (Roche Applied Science).Mutation Analysis of Switch Recombination Junctions and the Germ Line Sμ Region—Spleen cells from 2- to 8-month-old mice were cultured for 4 days in the presence of LPS (25 μg/ml) with or without IL-4 (7.5 ng/ml) to stimulate the B cells (2Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T. Cell. 2000; 102: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar), and the DNA was extracted. To analyze the germ line Sμ region of non-switched B cells, the B220+ IgG- cell population was sorted by FACSVantage™ using anti-IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies (BD Biosciences) after the cells were stimulated. The LPS plus IL-4 stimulation generated 19% and 4.6% IgG+1 cells among the wild-type and UNG-deficient B cells, respectively. LPS stimulation alone produced 7.2% and 0.47% IgG3+ cells among the wild-type and UNG-deficient B cells, respectively.Splenocytes were digested with proteinase K, and their genomic DNA was isolated. The Sμ-Sγ1, Sμ-Sγ3 (TaKaRa). The primers used for the first round of the nested PCR for switch recombination junctions were Sμ1 (5′-TAGTAAGCGAGGCTCTAAAAAGCAT-3′) and either Sγ1.1 (5′-CTGTAACCTACCCAGGAGACC-3′) or Sγ3.1 (5′-CTACTGAGTTCCTGTGCTTG-3′) (32Ehrenstein M.R. Rada C. Jones A.M. Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14553-14558Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were: 6 cycles of 93 °C (40 s), 64 °C (40 s), and 72 °C (120 s), followed by a further 24 cycles with the annealing performed at 55 °C.The second round of nested PCR was performed using the primers Sμ2 (5′-ATCGAATTCGCTTGAGCCAAAATGAAGTAGACT-3′) and either Sγ1.2 (5′-GTCGAATTCCCCCATCCTGTCACCTATA-3′) or Sγ3.2 (5′-CCGGAATTCTTGACCTGGTACCCTAGC-3′) (32Ehrenstein M.R. Rada C. Jones A.M. Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14553-14558Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were 24 cycles of 93 °C (40 s), 55 °C (40 s), and 72 °C (120 s). To amplify the germ line Sμ region, the primer pair Sμ1 and γSμ1 (5′-TCACCACAGCTCATCCCAGTTTACC-3′) was used for the first-round PCR, and the Sμ2 and γSμ2 (5′-CCGGAATTCCTCACCCTAGCTCAGCCAAGC-3′) pair for the secondround, nested PCR. The same PCR conditions were used as for the analysis of switch recombination junctions.The PCR products were digested with EcoRI, purified with the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), cloned into the pBluescript vector, and sequenced. The sequences were determined using an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Polymorphic replacements were carefully differentiated from mutations.Mutagenesis of UNG Constructs—Site-specific mutagenesis of the 231WXXF234 motif of mouse UNG was performed using the Quik-Change procedure (Stratagene). Primer sequences for the various mutants were: W231A (5′-AAGGAGAGGGGCGCGGAGCAGTTCACGG-3′), W231K (5′-AAGGAGAGGGGCAAGGAGCAGTTCACGG-3′), F234G (5′-AGGGGCTGGGAGCAGGGCACGGACGCGGTC-3′), F234Q (5′-AGGGGCTGGGAGCAGCAGACGGACGCGGTC-3′), and W231A/F234G (5′-AGGGGCGCGGAGCAGGGCACGGACGCGGTC-3′).All the constructs were subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of a retroviral vector, pFB-IRES-GFP. To monitor expression in live cells, an additional set of constructs was prepared by fusing the coding sequence for EGFP to the N terminus of each mutant and cloning the tagged mutants into the pFB retroviral vector (Stratagene). Various N-terminal mutants of UNG (serially truncated, exogenous NLS-bearing, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) binding-defective forms) were also produced by Pfu-PCR using appropriately designed primers and subcloned into the pFB retroviral vector.CSR and UDG Assays—To infect B cells from the spleen, the retrovirus-containing supernatant was prepared from platE cells following a standard protocol. Splenic B cells from UNG-deficient mice were pre-activated by exposure to LPS and IL-4 for 36-48 h before they were infected with the various UNG constructs, and the surface IgG1 expression was measured 48 h after the retroviral infection. A biotinconjugated anti-IgG1 primary antibody in combination with a streptavidin-APC secondary reagent was used for the surface staining. The percentage of IgG1-positive cells among the infected cells was calculated (GFP+ in the live gate).For the immunoblotting and enzyme assays, spleen cell lysates were prepared by brief sonication in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol (HED buffer) (33Di Noia J. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Crude lysate was cleared by high speed centrifugation, and 60 μg of soluble supernatant was subjected to Western detection.The uracil DNA glycosylase assay was carried out using a 5′-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide (a 30-mer) with an internal U residue. Reactions were performed at 37 °C using cleared lysate, and the results were normalized against GFP expression with 10 pmol of substrate in a Na+Mg+HED buffer. The reactions were terminated by alkali and heat treatment, and the products were fractionated by 12% urea-PAGE. The percentage of substrate conversion was estimated from scanned images and expressed in arbitrary units relative to wild type.Expression of Vpr in CH12F3-2 Cells—Wild-type HIV-1 Vpr and its R90K mutant were kind gifts from A. Takaori (Kyoto University). The W54R and H33R mutants were generated as previously described (Selig et al. (43Selig L. Benichou S. Rogel M.E. Wu L.I. Vodicka M.A. Sire J. Benarous R. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4842-4846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and all the mutants were cloned into the pMX-IRES-GFP vector. To introduce Vpr into the CH12F3-2 line, retrovirus-containing supernatant was prepared from 293T cells transfected with the test construct and an amphotropic helper vector. Viral infection was performed following a standard protocol, and 36 h post-infection the cells were stimulated with a combination of CD40L, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-β. Surface IgA expression was examined by staining the cells with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-IgA at various time points, and the switching efficiency was obtained by measuring the percentage of IgA-positive cells in the GFP+ gate.RESULTSInternal Deletions in the Sμ Region of UNG-deficient IgM+ B Cells—To re-evaluate the dispensability of UNG for the DNA cleavage step of CSR, we examined partial deletions in the Sμ region of IgM+ B cells from ung-/- mice that had been stimulated to undergo CSR.IgM+ hybridomas were generated from stimulated wild-type, ung-/-, ung-/-msh2-/-, and aicda-/- B cells, and the hybridoma DNAs were analyzed by Southern blot using the 5′ and 3′ Sμ probes (Fig. 1, A-C). We classified the hybridomas into three groups: (a) germ line on both alleles (G/G), (b) deletion on one allele (G/D), and (c) deletion on both alleles (D/D). The deletion frequency was calculated per chromosome (Fig. 1D).11 of the 86 Sμ loci (12.8%) in wild-type B cell-derived IgM+ hybridomas contained deletions, which is in agreement with previous reports (15Dudley D.D. Manis J.P. Zarrin A.A. Kaylor L. Tian M. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Reina-San-Martin B. Difilippantonio S. Hanitsch L. Masilamani R.F. Nussenzweig A. Nussenzweig M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1767-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Strikingly, both the ung-/- and ung-/- msh2-/- B cell-derived IgM+ hybridomas had deletions in the Sμ region at frequencies statistically indistinguishable from the wild-type ones (20.7 and 9.6%, respectively). By contrast, the aicda-/- B cells showed a deletion frequency that was scarcely above the background level (15Dudley D.D. Manis J.P. Zarrin A.A. Kaylor L. Tian M. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that the Sμ deletions in IgM+ hybridomas are AID-dependent and thus mediated by DNA cleavage. It is therefore likely that both UNG and Msh2 are dispensable for DNA cleavage in CSR.Increased Mutations in the Germ Line Sμ Region of UNG-deficient B Cells—To confirm the UNG dispensability for the DNA cleavage in CSR, we compared the mutation frequency in the germ line S regions between wild-type and ung-/- B cells. We analyzed the nucleotide sequences of the 200-bp region 5′ to the Sμ core sequence in 50 clones each from UNG-deficient and wild-type splenic IgG- B cells, after stimulation with LPS and IL-4 or with LPS alone (Fig. 2A). Although the CSR frequency in the ung-/- B cells was reduced to 6-24% (variable between isotypes) of the frequency in the wild-type B cells, the mutation frequency in the germ line Sμ region in ung-/- B cells increased nearly 3- to 4-fold for cells stimulated with either LPS plus IL-4 or LPS alone (Fig. 3, A and B, left panels). The increase in mutation frequency in the Sμ region of the UNG-deficient B cells correlated well with the number of mutations per mutated clone. The results indicate that the processivity of mutations per targeted site increased in the UNG-deficient cells. It is therefore likely that UNG somehow inhibits processive mutations in the Sμ region during repair.FIGURE 2S region sequence strategy and distribution of mutations and recombination junctions. The S region is shown schematically at the top with the positions of primers indicated by arrowheads. Spleen cells were stimulated with LPS plus IL-4 (for Sμ-Sγ1 recombination) or LPS alone (for Sμ-Sγ3 recombination) for 4 days. Redundant sites are not specified.

The number of times each substitution pattern occurred is shown at the right. UNG restricts mutations to the vicinity of switch junctions (C and D). The distribution of the mutations was analyzed up to 700 bp from the switch junctions in (C) wild-type and (D) ung-/- B cells. The proportion of the mutations in each 50-bp segment is plotted. Fraction of mutation equals the number of mutations in a fixed distance/total mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mutations were biased to a GC transition in the UNG-deficient B cells (Fig. 3, A and B, right panel), as is found with SHM in the Ig V genes (34Rada C. Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The locations of the mutations were not skewed compared with the locations of mutations induced by junctional breakpoints identified by the same PCR primer in switched B cells, supporting the assumption that germ line Sμ mutations are generated through abortive DNA cleavage in CSR (Fig. 2A). The mutation frequencies in the germ line Sγ1 and Sγ3 were too low to be evaluated quantitatively, as shown previously (35Schrader C.E. Bradley S.P. Vardo J. Mochegova S.N. Flanagan E. Stavnezer J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5893-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Increased Mutations in Rearranged S Regions of UNG-deficient B Cells—We next examined the effects of UNG deficiency on the mutation frequency in the S regions surrounding CSR breakpoints. We first scored mutations in the Sμ region immediately upstream of Sμ-Sγ1 or Sμ-Sγ3 recombination junctions generated by stimulation with LPS plus IL-4 or LPS alone, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B, left panel). The distribution of the recombination breakpoints in the Sμ,Sγ1, and Sγ3 regions was generally similar between the wild-type and ung-/- B cells (Fig. 2, A-C).FIGURE 4Mutation profiles in regions adjacent to CSR junctional breakpoints. Splenic B cells from the UNG-deficient and wild-type mice were stimulated with LPS plus IL4 (A) or LPS (B). The mutations within 200 bp to the 5′-(Sμ) and 3′-(Sγ) sides of the breakpoints were counted, and the proportion of clones that contained the indicated mutation numbers are depicted in the pie charts. Total mutation frequency in each population is shown below the chart with the actual mutation count/total sequenced length in parentheses. a, p < 4.7 × 10-6; b, p < 2.9 × 10-5; c, p < 1.2 × 10-12; and d = 0.58. The number of times each nucleotide substitution pattern occurred is shown in tabular form at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, the mutation frequency in the recombined Sμ region of the UNG-deficient B cells was ∼4-fold higher in the Sμ-Sγ1 junctions and 6-fold higher in the Sμ-Sγ3 junctions than in wild-type cells, which is in sharp contrast to the drastic reduction in CSR in these UNG-deficient cells. Both the average number of mutations per mutated clone and the frequency of mutated clones were higher in the UNG-deficient B cells (Fig. 4, left panels).The mutation frequencies in the rearranged Sγ regions were also higher than in their germ line counterparts. The mutation frequency and the number of mutations per mutated clone in the rearranged Sγ1 region were 2- to 3-fold greater in the UNG-deficient B cells than in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4A, left panel).The rearranged Sγ3 region showed a modest increase in mutation frequency in the UNG-deficient B cells (Fig. 4B, left panel). The base specificity of the mutations was similarly skewed to the GC transition in all the rearranged Sμ,Sγ1, and Sγ3 regions of the UNG-deficient B cells compared with wild-type B cells (Fig. 4, right panels).Of note, the mutations surrounding each recombination junction were spread over a larger region in ung-/- B cells than in the wild-type B cells (Fig. 3, C and D).

Using autaptic hippocampal cultures from transgenic mice expressing human PS1 with the A246E mutation, we demonstrate that mutant PS1 significantly depressed the amplitude of evoked α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Analysis of the spontaneous miniature synaptic activity revealed a lower frequency of miniature currents but normal miniature amplitude. Both alterations could be rescued by the application of a γ-secretase blocker. On the other hand, the application of synthetic soluble Aβ42 in wild-type neurons induced the PS1 mutant phenotype on synaptic strength. Together, these findings strongly suggest that the expression of mutant PS1 in cultured neurons depresses synaptic transmission by causing a physical reduction in the number of synapses. This hypothesis is consistent with morphometic and semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis, revealing a decrease in synaptophysin-positive puncta in PS1 mutant hippocampal neurons.

Alzheimer disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by a progressive deterioration in memory and other cognitive abilities. Neuropathological hallmarks include a progressive loss of neurons, synaptic degeneration, and deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in characteristic brain regions.

The exact pathogenic mechanism by which PS mutations cause memory loss and neurode-generation, however, remains unclear. Presenilins are integral components of a multiprotein protease complex termed γ-secretase that is responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptors (2De Strooper B.

Familial Alzheimer disease-linked PS mutations selectively enhance the production of the amyloidogenic 42-residue β-amyloid peptide (Aβ42), often at the expense of the less amyloidogenic Aβ40 generation (4Moehlmann T.

Neuropathological studies have indicated that synaptic abnormalities may represent the proximate cause of dementia in Alzheimer disease. Synaptic loss correlates better with the pattern and severity of cognitive impairment than formation of amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles (7Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. DeTeresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A. Katzman R. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). In addition, synaptic and dendritic loss precedes neuronal loss and is most prominent in limbic regions corresponding to the clinical deficits (7Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N.

The heterogeneity of the findings in different experimental settings may be due to the possibility that mutant PS1 exerts pathogenic effects not only by increasing Aβ42 production but also by influencing synapse formation or synaptic plasticity (22Saura C.A.

Here we aimed to analyze pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of synaptic vesicle release in mutant PS1 transgenic mice in detail by studying autapses in single-grown hippocampal neurons. Autapses are synapses between the axon and dendrites of the same neuron. These structures are built when neurons are cultured separately, a condition that is achieved by a special coating of the cell culture wells. The main advantage compared with conventional preparations is that these monosynaptic cultures ensure that the release from the same set of synapses is monitored regardless of the stimulation method and in absence of complex polysynaptic circuitry. Our results essentially show that mutant PS1 strongly affects both the amplitude of evoked excitatory currents as well as the frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents by decreasing the number of functional synapses. Mice—The parent PS1 transgenic mice (wild-type human PS1 and human mutant PS1[A246E]) were generated by microinjection of mini-gene constructs containing PS1 cDNA in a mouse Thy1 gene cassette into prenuclear embryos as described (10Moechars D. Dewachter I. Lorent K. Reverse D. Baekelandt V. Naidu A. Tesseur I. Spittaels K. Haute C.V. Checler F. Godaux E. Cordell B. Van Leuven F. J. Biol.

Transgenic strains were maintained on the FVB/N background and back-crossed to obtain homozygous mice for either wild-type (PS1wt) or mutant human PS1 (PS1mut). FVB/N mice were used as non-transgenic (Non-tg) controls. Cell Culture—Microisland cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons were prepared and maintained as described (25Rosenmund C. Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Science. 1993; 262: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 26Rosenmund C. Feltz A. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, astrocyte feeder wells enriched in type 1 astrocytes (>95%) were first prepared from postnatal day 1 mouse hippocampal tissue. After dissection and removal of the choroid plexus and meninges, the material was dissociated and trypsinized. Astrocytes were grown in culture media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose (Pan, Aidenbach, Germany), 5% fetal bovine serum (Pan), 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), N2 supplement (Invitrogen), Glutamax (Invitrogen), and Mito+ serum extender (BD Bioscience) at their indicated concentrations. Astrocytes were grown at 37 °C in a 10% CO2-enriched atmosphere. Once a monolayer was achieved in the flasks, cells were trypsinized and replated onto microdot-coated glass coverslips. Hippocampi were dissected from newborn mice pups and digested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium solution containing 0.2 mg/ml cysteine, 100 mm CaCl2, 50 mm EDTA, 10 units/ml papain (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped after 60 min, and tissue was gently triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Cell suspensions diluted to 5–8 × 104 cells/ml were then added to the prepared astrocyte feeder wells (see above). To prevent excessive proliferation of astrocytes, the anti-mitotic agent 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (8.1 mm) was applied to the cultures on the day after neuronal plating. For the γ-secretase inhibitor experiment, autaptic cultures were incubated with 1 μm N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl Ester (DAPT, Calbiochem) 48 h before the measurements. For the Aβ incubation studies, freshly diluted monomeric Aβ42 (100 nm, Bachem, Switzerland) was added to the autaptic cultures,and electrophysiological measurements were carried out after 48 h. Electrophysiology—For each experiment approximately equal numbers of cells from the respective genotypes were measured in parallel and blindly on the same day in vitro (18–20 days in vitro (DIV). Whole-cell recordings were performed using an EPC 9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronic, Lambrecht, Germany). The standard extracellular medium contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, and 15 μm bicuculline, 300 mosm, pH 7.3. NMDA-excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) were measured at 4 mm external Ca2+ in the presence of 5 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 10 μm glycine and in the absence of external Mg2+. Internal pipette recording solution consisted of 10 mm NaCl, 125 mm potassium gluco-nate, 1 mm EGTA, 4.6 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 15 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 mm units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 300 mosm, pH 7.3. Data were filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz using Pulse 8.5 software (HEKA Elektronic). Patch electrodes had resistances of 3–4 megohms. Series resistance and capacity of the electrodes were compensated; only recordings with access resistance below 15 megohms and with an initial membrane potential <-50 mV (measured in the current-clamp modus shortly after cell access was obtained) were included in the analysis. Access resistance and cell capacities (5–25 picofarads) were compensated. Cells were voltage-clamped at -70 mV, except for 1-ms depolarizations to 0 mV to elicit an action potential-like stimulus. The rise time constant (10–90%) of the synaptic currents was determined by fitting a linear function to the activating current, and the decay time constant was determined by fitting a single exponential function to the current decay. Detection of miniature EPSCs was usually performed for at least 60 s in the presence of 200 nm tetrodotoxin (Biotrend, Köln, Germany). Data were analyzed with a template detection program (Axograph 4.1, Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Threshold for detection was set to 3.5 times the base-line S.D. Captured miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) of individual cells were averaged to determine mean amplitude and charge per cell. Application of a hypertonic solution for pool size determination was made by pulsed application of 500 mm sucrose to the extracellular solution for 4 s using a fast perfusion system (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Evoked responses and responses to hypertonic sucrose solutions were always recorded successively from the same cell. The readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP) per cell was calculated by dividing the charge of the transient sucrose response with the mean mEPSC charge of the same cell, if available. To further determine the mean vesicular release probability, the number of vesicles released by a single action potential-like stimulus was divided by the number of vesicles in the RRP. Recordings and data analysis were performed blindly on each sample. Immunocytochemistry—Hippocampal cultures of 18–20 DIV were used for immunocytochemistry. For fluorescent microscopic determinations of synaptic density in neurons, cultures were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked, and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum (Dako Hamburg, Germany), 0.3% Triton X-100 (Calbiochem) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti microtubule-associated protein 2 (1:100, Chemicon, Hampshire, UK) for 60 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) for another 60 min. After another washing step, fluorescent-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany) was added, incubated for 60 min, and finally fixed in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Images were acquired on an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a 63× LD Achroplan objective and Axiovision 4.5 software (Zeiss). For quantification of the total dendritic length and total amount of synapses, analySIS software (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany) was used. The summary graph represents four independent experiments using different culture preparations from PS1mut animals and PS1wt controls. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Immunohistochemistry—Six hemispheres (3 of each geno-type) of 30-day- and 3-month-old wild-type human PS1, human mutant PS1[A246E], and controls were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Coronal 50-μm free floating sections were prepared with a VT 1000S vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and immunostained with anti-synaptophysin and Cy™3-conjugated streptavidin. Briefly, sections were placed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with antibody diluent (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Illkirch, France), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal antibody against synaptophysin (1:300, Chemicon). This step was followed by incubation in biotinylated swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:150, Dako), and finally, the sections were fluorescence labeled with Cy™3-conjugated streptavidin (1:25, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The sections were mounted on precoated glass slides (Super-frost-plus, Menzel, Braun-schweig, Germany) and covered (Coverquick, Labonord, Templemars, France). All sections were processed simultaneously under the same conditions. The immunofluorescent labeling protocol was repeated three times to assess the reproducibility of results. Immunolabeled brain sections were viewed with a Zeiss 40×/0.8 IR Achroplan objective on a Zeiss Axioskop 2FS mot LSM510 confocal microscope. Cy3 was excited with a HeNe Laser at 543 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was detected with a LP560 (longpass 560 nm) emission filter. Frames of 230 × 230-μm size were scanned with 0.22 μm/pixel, and the pinhole diameter was set to an area unit of 1. The z-distance of each z-stack ranged from 10 to 15 μm and consisted of 20–30 0.5-μm-spaced images. Synaptophysin levels were assessed as described previously (27Priller C. Bauer T. Mitteregger G. Krebs B. Kretzschmar H.A. Herms J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7212-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar)in the stratum radiatum and stratum moleculare of the hippocampus in three coronal sections per animal. Two serial optical z-stacks (one for each marker) of the synaptophysin-labeled structures were collected from each section. All series of z-stacks from each section were maximum intensity projected and acquired under standard conditions maintaining the same gain, aperture, and black level settings. This method of analysis was previously evaluated by Masliah et al. (28Masliah E. Terry R.D. Mallory M. Alford M. Hansen L.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 1293-1297PubMed Google Scholar, 29Masliah E. Terry R.D. Alford M. DeTeresa R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The digitized images were then analyzed regarding the signal intensity and density (covered area of immunohistochemistry-positive objects) of synaptophysin-labeled structures (PictureAnalyzer Software, Bjarne Krebs, Zentrum für Neuropathologie und Prion Forschung, Munich, Germany). A threshold was set so that all objects with an intensity value below the threshold were set equal to the background value. For each mouse, the values obtained for the stratum radiatum and stratum moleculare of the hippocampus were averaged. Western Blot—For measurement of the expression of synaptophysin in hippocampus, coronal brain sections were collected on glass slides and Nissl stained. The hippocampal region was then separately lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE as previously reported (30Krebs B. Kohlmannsperger V. Nolting S. Schmalzbauer R. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After electrotransfer of proteins to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotting was followed by the incubation with primary antibody against synaptophysin (1:5000, Chemicon) and β-actin (1:5000, actin I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) overnight. The visualization was performed with a secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (polyclonal goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin/alkaline phosphatase, Dako) and chromo-gene nitro blue tetrazolium salt with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate. Western blots were scanned with a high resolution flatbed scanner, and the density of bands was determined using Total Lab Version 2.01 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). Statistical Analysis—All error bars indicate the S.E. All results are reported as ± S.E. A value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant (Student's t test). Evoked Neurotransmitter Release in Non-tg, PS1wt, and PS1mut Neurons—Patch clamp recordings from single isolated neurons were used to assess possible defects in neurotransmitter release induced by mutant PS1. We concentrated our analysis on glutamatergic neurons, because they are much more abundant in autaptic cultures than in inhibitory cells producing γ-aminobutyric acid. We first tested the action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release. AMPA and NMDA synaptic responses were evoked by brief somatic depolarization (1-ms depolarization from -70mV holding potential to 0 mV) and measured as peak inward currents a few ms after action potential induction (Fig. 1, A and C). The amplitude of the evoked autaptic amplitudes of AMPA-EPSCs was reduced in PS1mut cells compared with neurons expressing human PS1wt and Non-tg mice (3.66 ± 0.46 nA for Non-tg, 3.24 ± 0.42 nA for PS1wt, and 2.16 ± 0.22 nA for PS1mut; p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Similarly, NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs, analyzed by blocking AMPA receptors by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (5 μm), revealed a significantly reduced amplitude in PS1 mutant cells when compared with cells from mice expressing human wild-type PS1 or from non-transgenic mice (2.14 ± 0.28 nA for Non-tg, 1.68 ± 0.19 nA for PS1wt, and 0.77 ± 0.08 nA for PS1mut; p < 0.05; Fig. 1D). No significant differences were observed in the kinetics (rise time and decay time constant τ) of both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs between PS1 mutant, PS1 wild-type, and non-transgenic neurons (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of evoked EPSC kinetics Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., n = 15–27 cells/genotype.Rise timeτmsmsAMPA EPSC Non-tg2.06 ± 0.197.25 ± 0.97 PS1wt2.14 ± 0.248.20 ± 0.67 PS1mut2.15 ± 0.216.72 ± 0.44NMDA EPSC Non-tg7.66 ± 0.9561.19 ± 3.55 PS1wt8.03 ± 1.0963.95 ± 4.89 PS1mut7.01 ± 0.9260.88 ± 4.39 Open table in a new tab Thus, the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission was found to be decreased in autaptic hippocampal neurons expressing mutant hPS1. Factors possibly influencing this change include (i) a decrease in postsynaptic responsiveness, (ii) an alteration in presynaptic release parameters, and (iii) a lower number of synapses. Spontaneous Neurotransmitter Release in Non-tg, PS1wt, and PS1mut Neurons—To define whether the pre- or the postsynaptic side is affected by mutant PS1, we analyzed the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous mEPSC activity (mEPSCs; Fig. 2A). We found that the frequency of mEPSCs was significantly lower in PS1mut neurons than in hPS1 and non-transgenic cells (8.03 ± 1.52 s-1 for Non-tg, 7.95 ± 1.53 s-1 for PS1wt, and 3.02 ± 0.59 s-1 for PS1mut neurons; p < 0.05; Fig. 2B). The mean mEPSC amplitude, however, was not affected (24.34 ± 0.87 pA for Non-tg, 23.36 ± 0.92 pA for PS1wt, and 25.06 ± 1.12 pA for PS1mut cells; p > 0.05; Fig. 2C), indicating that the responsiveness and number of postsynaptic receptors is not altered due to mutation of PS1. In addition, we calculated the number of vesicles released by an action potential-like stimulus by dividing the charge of evoked responses by that of a single mEPSC. For those neurons in which both EPSCs and mEPSCs were measured, the quantity of vesicles released during an EPSC was determined and found to be significantly lower in PS1mut neurons (526 ± 148 for Non-tg, 481 ± 111 for PS1wt, and 169 ± 68 for PS1mut cells; p < 0.05; Fig. 2D). Readily Releasable Vesicle Pool and Release Probability in Non-tg, PS1wt, and PS1mut Neurons—Presynaptic release is thought to depend on the size of the RRP and the release probability (Pr). We, therefore, performed a detailed analysis of the sizes of RRPs in neurons of Non-tg, PS1wt, and PS1mut neurons. The fact that the mEPSC rates were significantly different between the three genotypes suggested that the size of the RRP pool is changed in the presence of PS1mut. The sizes of RRP were quantified by measuring the response of Non-tg, hPS1, and PS1mut cells to pulsed application of 500 mm hypertonic sucrose solution for 3–4 s. This treatment induces the release of the entire pool of readily releasable vesicles, which in turn leads to a transient inward current followed by a steady current component (31Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 32Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). We calculated the amount of RRP vesicles by dividing the total charge of the transient current component after application of hypertonic sucrose by the charge of a single mEPSC measured from the same cell. Neurons from PS1mut mice showed significantly less releasable vesicles in their RRP compared with neurons from nontransgenic and PS1 wild-type mice (24.72 ± 5.61 × 103 for Non-tg, 16.15 ± 3.18 × 103 for PS1wt, and 8.14 ± 2.11 × 103 for PS1mut; p < 0.05; Fig. 3B). No differences were observed in the basal rate of RRP refilling, which was estimated by averaging the ratio of the charge of a second hypertonic sucrose response over the initial sucrose response measured 3.5 s prior (0.57 ± 0.05 for Non-tg, 0.55 ± 0.02 for PS1wt, and 0.57 ± 0.04 for PS1mut; p > 0.05; Fig. 3C). To estimate whether the efficiency of the action potential-induced vesicle release is influenced by PS1 mutation, we analyzed the vesicular release probability (Pvr). We determined Pvr by dividing the number of vesicles released during an action potential by the number of vesicles in the RRP. We found that Pvr did not vary significantly between cells from non-transgenic (4.24 ± 0.89%), PS1wt (4.25% ± 0.67%), and PS1mut neurons (4.41 ± 1.37%; Fig. 3D). The Pvr values obtained are similar to the values obtained in other studies on autaptic hippocampal neurons (33Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Cell. 2001; 104: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In summary, these results indicate that the content of presynaptic vesicles seems to be released efficiently and that the decrease in synaptic responses in PS1mut autapses can be attributed to the decrease in RRP. Paired Pulse Stimulation in Non-tg, PS1wt, and PS1mut Neurons—Changes in the synaptic release probability of a neuron may cause concomitant changes in short-term plasticity of synaptic transmission. Trains of action potentials lead to facilitation in synapses with low initial release probability but to depression in synapses with high initial release probability. By applying paired pulses with 25-500-ms intervals to the cultured neurons, the paired-pulse ratio, defined as relative amplitude of the second EPSC normalized to the first EPSC, was obtained and compared between non-transgenic, PS1wt, and PS1mut neurons.

BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that eEF1A2 has transforming properties; ectopic expression of wild type human eEF1A2 in mammalian cells enables anchorage-independent growth and enhances tumorigenicity in nude mice (9Anand N. Murthy S. Amann G. Wernick M. Porter L.A. Cukier I.H. Collins C. Gray J.W. Diebold J. Demetrick D.J. Lee J.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, eEF1A2 has an important role in promoting tumor development. However, the mechanism by which eEF1A2 promotes oncogenicity remains unclear. It has previously been reported that an eEF1A-like protein purified from carrots, PIK-A49, binds and activates carrot phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) (13Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests an important relationship between translation elongation and phosphatidylinositol generation. Phosphatidylinositols are negatively charged, membrane-bound phospholipids that serve as regulators of multiple signaling pathways (15Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

Cheever M.L. Kutateladze T.G. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 150-159PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositols are composed of an inositol ring covalently bound to a lipid phosphatidic acid backbone by a phosphodiester bond at the inositol D1 carbon. Inositol phosphorylation occurs at the D3, D4, or D5 carbons. Specific kinase families are responsible for phosphorylation at each of these sites. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, PI4K, and phosphatidylinositol 5-kinases phosphorylate the D3, D4, and D5 inositol carbons, respectively (15Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

PIK-A49 showed in vitro translation elongation factor activity and an ability to activate in vitro PI4K lipid kinase activity (13Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, PIK-A49 does not have complete amino acid sequence identity with wild-type carrot eEF1A and has yet to be cloned as a full-length cDNA. It is therefore unclear whether PIK-A49 is a bona fide eEF1A protein; nor is it known whether wild-type carrot eEF1A or eEF1A proteins from nonplant species participate in PI4K activation. In addition, there are three identified subfamilies of PI4K proteins, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III α, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III β (PI4KIIIβ), and PI4KII (19Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Vereb Jr., G. Vereb G. Kakuk A. Szivak I. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and it is unclear which PI4K isoform(s) is activated by PIK-A49 or other eEF1A proteins. Moreover, in vitro PI4K activation by PIK-A49/eEF1A has unknown physiological significance. Here we report that human eEF1A2 can directly bind and activate PI4KIIIβ. Ectopic expression of eEF1A2 in rodent and human cells increases overall PI4K activity and cellular phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) generation. Furthermore, eEF1A2 ablation reduces endogenous PI4K activity. This suggests that eEF1A2 is a physiological regulator of PI4KIIIβ. Cell Lines—MCF7, BT549, and Rat2 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown according to their instructions. Adenoviral Vectors— eEF1A2 was subcloned into the pShuttle-IRES plasmid (EcoRV/XhoI) with a FLAG epitope tag. eEF1A2 and GFP virus were manufactured by the Adenoviral Core Facility of the University of Ottawa. For viral transduction, BT549 and Rat2 cells were infected with Ad-eEF1A2 or Ad-GFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200 (BT549) or 500 (Rat2) in complete media. Cells were incubated with virus for a minimum of 24 h. Antibodies—Antibodies used for experiments were as follows: human PI4KIIIβ (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA), β-actin (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The generation of the rabbit polyclonal eEF1A2 antibody and its validation in Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry is described elsewhere (10Kulkarni G. Turbin D.A. Amiri A. Jeganathan S. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Wu T.D. Huntsman D.G. Lee J.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). GST Fusion Proteins— eEF1A2 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI/NotI site of pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-eEF1A2 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21DE3 and grown in Luria-Bertani media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 ∼0.7. 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for 2 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were equilibrated in lysis buffer and mixed with sonicated suspensions. PI4KIIIβ in pGEX-6P-3 was a gift of T. Balla (21Balla A. Vereb G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The GST-PI4KIIIβ fusion protein was purified as described (22Zhao X.H. Bondeva T. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GST-C/EBPβ was a kind gift from N. Wiper-Bergeron (University of Ottawa). To remove the GST moiety, 100 μg of GST-eEF1A2 was incubated overnight with 1 unit of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) in 1× PBS at room temperature. PI4KIIIβ was generated by cleaving 100 μg of GST-PI4KIIIβ with 1 unit of PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Lipid Kinase Assay—10 μl of recombinant protein in PBS, at concentrations indicated in the figure legends, was added to 35 μl of kinase buffer (1 mm EDTA, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100), 3 mm PI (or as indicated in the figure legend), and 5 μl of 10 mm ATP containing 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and incubated for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 60 μl of 1 n HCl. Phospholipids were extracted by adding 160 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v). After a brief vortex, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Aliquots of the organic phase (10-20 μl) were spotted onto TLC plates (Sigma) and placed in a pre-equilibrated tank containing CHCl3/acetone/MeOH/HOAc/water (46:17:15:14:8, v/v/v/v/v). Prior to use, TLC plates were precoated with 1% potassium oxalate, 3 mm EDTA in methanol/water (2:3, v/v) for 1 h and allowed to air dry overnight. Plates were activated by baking for 1 h at 110 °C. Phosphatidylinositol standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). PI4P spots were scraped and dissolved in 1-2 ml of water. Aliquots were then diluted in BetaMax scintillation fluid (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA), and scintillation counts were taken using the Wallac 1414 liquid scintillation counter (Fisher). Values of Km, Vmax, and Kcat were determined using the GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). For assays involving cell lysates, recombinant eEF1A2 and the cell lysate were added in a total volume of 10 μl. Cross-linking Studies—Purified eEF1A2 and/or PI4KIIIβ (without GST) were incubated in PBS and cross-linked with 30 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) in 0.2 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of glacial acetic acid at a 1:4 (v/v) ratio to the sample. Proteins were concentrated to a final volume of 50 μl with Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA), solubilized using 5% (w/v) sucrose in water, and electrophoresed in a continuous, nondenaturing 5% (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel using 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) running buffer as previously described (23Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 10.12B.11-10.12B.15Google Scholar). Cell Lysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were grown to 80-95% confluence in 100-mm cell culture plates. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice in detergent-free buffer (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 2.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% aprotonin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove membranes. Supernatants were collected, and protein levels were quantified using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 μg of total protein was precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C. Following this, 2-4 μg of PI4KIIIβ, FLAG, or eEF1A2 antibody coupled to beads were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and boiled for 5 min in sample buffer, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The covalent coupling of the eEF1A2 antibody to protein A-agarose beads was performed using a previously described protocol (24Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 522-523Google Scholar). Western blot detection was according to the manufacturer's instructions or as described for the eEF1A2 antibody (10Kulkarni G. Turbin D.A. Amiri A. Jeganathan S. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Wu T.D. Huntsman D.G. Lee J.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). For Western blotting, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% aprotonin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4,10 μg/ml pepstatin in ethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in Me2SO). siRNA Transfections—Sequences of the eEF1A2 siRNAs are 5′-UGGUCCUUUUGUCAAUACCtc-3′ (siRNA 1) and 5′-UCGAACUUCUCAAUGGUCCtt-3′ (siRNA 2). The negative control siRNA was purchased from Ambion (catalog number 4611; Austin, TX). siRNA transfections were performed using siPORT Lipid (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—To detect PI4P levels, Rat2 and BT549 cells were transfected with either eEF1A2·pcDNA3.1 (9Anand N. Murthy S. Amann G. Wernick M. Porter L.A. Cukier I.H. Collins C. Gray J.W. Diebold J. Demetrick D.J. Lee J.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or GFP-pcDNA3.1 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 h post-transfection, transfection medium was removed, and complete medium was added. The next day, cells were fixed and permeabilized as above. Cells were then blocked with 10% goat serum, PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and anti-PI4P IgM antibody was added (1:100 in PBS overnight; Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Goat anti-mouse IgM, (R)-phycoerythrin (Caltag Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) was then added at 1:100 in PBS for 30 min. eEF1A2 was detected with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:500 in PBS, 1 h; Sigma) followed by an AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:450 in PBS, 1 h; Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33258 (20 μg/ml; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were viewed with either a Leica DM-1L fluorescence microscope and deconvolved using Improvision 3.1 software (Richmond Hill, Canada) or an Olympus FluoView FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Fluorescence was quantified with the confocal microscope using Olympus software (FV1000, version 01.04a, Center Valley, PA). eEF1A2 Increases PI4KIIIβ Lipid Kinase Activity—To determine whether eEF1A2 could activate PI4KIIIβ, we purified recombinant GST-eEF1A2 and GST-PI4KIIIβ. The proteins were isolated both with and without their GST moiety. A Coomassie-stained gel of the purified proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. The predicted molecular mass of full-length, wild-type eEF1A2 is ∼54 kDa, and that of PI4KIIIβ is ∼100 kDa. We first determined whether eEF1A2 could increase PI4K activity in cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1B, the addition of GST-eEF1A2 to a cell lysate of BT549 breast carcinoma cells reproducibly doubled in vitro PI4P generation compared with the addition of GST alone or GST coupled to the C/EBPβ transcription factor. A representative TLC plate is also shown in the right panel of Fig. 1B. Bacterially expressed PI4KIIIβ has previously been reported to be active in in vitro lipid kinase assays (21Balla A. Vereb G. Gulkan H. Gehrmann T. Gergely P. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Antal M. Exp. Brain Res. 2000; 134: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Zhao X.H. Bondeva T. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, our GST-PI4KIIIβ was active in vitro, and its kinase activity was inhibitable by 0.2 μm wortmannin. Wortmannin inhibition indicates that we are measuring the lipid kinase activity of a type III PI4K, the family of PI4Ks to which PI4KIIIβ belongs. To investigate whether purified eEF1A2 could directly activate PI4KIIIβ, we next added recombinant eEF1A2 (without GST) to purified PI4KIIIβ (without GST). As shown in Fig. 1D, eEF1A2 increased PI4KIIIβ lipid kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. PI4KIIIβ activity was increased ∼2-fold. 100-200 nm eEF1A2 is required to maximally activate a 100 nm solution of PI4KIIIβ. No enhancement of PI4KIIIβ activity was observed in the presence of bovine serum albumin. In order to further determine how eEF1A2 affected PI4KIIIβ activity, we experimentally determined the PI4KIIIβ Km, Vmax, and Kcat for phosphatidylinositol with and without eEF1A2. Bovine albumin served as the control. As shown in Fig. 1E, eEF1A2 (without GST) reproducibly increased the Vmax of PI4KIIIβ (without GST) from 0.62 to 1.11 μmol/min/mg. This doubling of Vmax was also mirrored in the increase of Kcat from 0.82 to 1.48 s-1. The PI4KIIIβ Km was unchanged. eEF1A2 Binds PI4KIIIβ—We next tested whether eEF1A2 could directly interact with PI4KIIIβ in a cell-free system. As shown in Fig. 2A, purified PI4KIIIβ (without GST) was immunoprecipitated by GST-eEF1A2, and eEF1A2 (without GST) was immunoprecipitated by GST-PI4KIIIβ. Neither PI4KIIIβ nor eEF1A2 was immunoprecipitated by GST alone. We next investigated the stoichiometry of eEF1A2/PI4KIIIβ interaction. We incubated recombinant eEF1A2 and PI4KIIIβ (both without GST) and chemically cross-linked the resulting complex. As seen in Fig. 2B, after 1 h of incubation, most of the added PI4KIIIβ and eEF1A2 were found in a complex with an apparent molecular mass of 165 kDa. The formation of the complex was time-dependent, and a greater amount of complex was detected at 60 min of incubation relative to the 30 min time point. eEF1A2 has an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, and that of PI4KIIIβ is ∼100 kDa. The ∼165-kDa molecular mass of the complex indicates that eEF1A2 and PI4KIIIβ associate with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Neither eEF1A2 nor PI4KIIIβ formed detectable multimers on their own. We were unable to detect protein complexes with a molecular mass greater than 165 kDa, indicating that multimers containing more than one molecule each of eEF1A2 or PI4KIIIβ do not form. eEF1A2 Interacts with PI4KIIIβ in Mammalian Cell Lines— To determine whether eEF1A2 and PI4KIIIβ associate in cells, we first identified mammalian cells that express eEF1A2. In rodents and humans, eEF1A2 shows detectable mRNA and protein expression only in the tissues of the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (6Knudsen S.M. Frydenberg J. Clark B.F. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 7Lee S. Wolfraim L.A. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24453-24459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kahns S. Lund A. Kristensen P. Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have also observed eEF1A2 expression in many breast cancer cell lines (10Kulkarni G. Turbin D.A. Amiri A. Jeganathan S. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Wu T.D. Huntsman D.G. Lee J.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, we detected eEF1A2 protein expression in the MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell line but neither in BT549 breast carcinoma cells nor in the nontransformed Rat2 rat fibroblast cell line. We then used co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether wild-type eEF1A2 and PI4KIIIβ associate in MCF7 cells. We used detergent-free cell lysis for these experiments. As shown in Fig. 3B, eEF1A2 detectably immunoprecipitated with PI4KIIIβ, and PI4KIIIβ reciprocally immunoprecipitated with eEF1A2. Neither protein bound to the FLAG antibody control. Although immunoprecipitation is only semiquantitative, we estimate that ∼10% of endogenous PI4KIIIβ associated with eEF1A2 under detergent-free lysis conditions. A similar ratio of eEF1A2 was associated with PI4KIIIβ. Both PI4KIIIβ and eEF1A2 have been previously reported to be diffusively cytoplasmic, although PI4KIIIβ has some concentration in the Golgi apparatus (9Anand N. Murthy S. Amann G. Wernick M. Porter L.A. Cukier I.H. Collins C. Gray J.W. Diebold J. Demetrick D.J. Lee J.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Vereb Jr., G. Vereb G. Kakuk A. Szivak I. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We attempted to visualize eEF1A2 and PI4KIIIβ co-localization via immunofluorescence confocal microscopy but were unable to detect significant co-localization between PI4KIIIβ and eEF1A2 (not shown). Co-localization detection is complicated by the diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern of the two proteins and the limited extent to which the two proteins co-precipitate. Nonetheless, the detectable amount of eEF1A2 that co-precipitates with in vivo PI4KIIIβ indicates that PI4KIIIβ·eEF1A2 complexes do exist in MCF7 cells. eEF1A2 Is Sufficient to Increase Cellular PI4K Activity—To determine whether eEF1A2 expression was sufficient to increase PI4K activity in mammalian cells, we used an adenovirus to express eEF1A2 in BT549 and Rat2 cells. Neither cell line detectably expresses eEF1A2 without transduction (Fig. 3A). At a low MOI of 20 virus particles/cell, infection had little effect on PI4K activity; lipid phosphorylation was similar between eEF1A2-infected cells and those infected with GFP (Fig. 4A). However, increasing the MOI to 200 reproducibly doubled cellular PI4K activity in eEF1A2-infected cells relative to those infected with GFP (Fig. 4A). Similarly, infection of Rat2 cells with the eEF1A2 adenovirus doubled PI4K activity relative to GFP controls (Fig. 4B). Adenoviral infection by eEF1A2 does not detectably alter total PI4KIIIβ protein levels (Fig. 4C). Thus, eEF1A2 expression can increase PI4K activity in these mammalian cell lines. eEF1A2 Is a Physiological PI4K Regulator—To determine whether eEF1A2 had a physiological role in regulating PI4K activity, we reduced eEF1A2 protein levels in MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells express abundant eEF1A2 (Fig. 3A). For this purpose, we designed two eEF1A2-specific siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 5, both siRNAs substantially reduce eEF1A2 protein levels compared with those cells treated with a control siRNA or untreated cells. Some residual eEF1A2 remains, however. The siRNA-mediated decrease in eEF1A2 protein levels led to a concomitant 2-fold decrease in PI4K activity relative to controls. eEF1A2 Increases Cellular PI4P Generation—We next determined whether eEF1A2 could increase intracellular PI4P abundance. To this end, we transiently transfected Rat2 and BT549 cells with an eEF1A2 plasmid and stained these cells with an antibody specific for PI4P. As shown in Fig. 6A, BT549 and Rat2 cells transiently expressing eEF1A2 showed PI4P staining that is visibly brighter than in untransfected cells, indicating greater abundance of PI4P upon eEF1A2 expression. The increase in PI4P occurs throughout the cytosol (Fig. 6A). Transfection with GFP had no visible effect on PI4P levels (Fig. 6B). To quantitate the eEF1A2-dependent increase in PI4P generation, we divided each transfectant pool into groups based on expression of the transfected protein and quantified PI4P fluorescence in individual cells from each group. As shown in Fig. 6C, cells expressing moderate or high levels of eEF1A2 each have a significantly higher level of PI4P than those that express no or low eEF1A2 (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney). This increase of PI4P generation occurred in both Rat2 and BT549 cells transfected with eEF1A2. GFP had no effect on PI4P generation. Thus, eEF1A2 expression increases intracellular PI4P abundance. Phosphatidylinositol lipids are well documented participants in pathways that regulate organelle biogenesis, cell morphology, proliferation, and oncogenesis (25Pendaries C. Tronchere H. Plantavid M. Payrastre B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that eEF1A2 binds PI4KIIIβ, increases its in vitro lipid kinase activity and can increase intracellular PI4P generation in rat and human cells. We find that purified eEF1A2 can increase recombinant PI4KIIIβ activity in vitro. Two other direct PI4KIIIβ activators have been previously identified: ADP-ribosylation factor and neuronal calcium sensor-1 (26Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J.

ADP-ribosylation factor, a small GTPase, regulates Golgi function through PI4KIIIβ activation (27Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat.

Shefler I. Jeromin A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5320-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since we found that eEF1A2-directed siRNA reduced PI4K activity and that ectopic eEF1A2 expression increased this activity, it is likely that eEF1A2 is a novel and physiological PI4KIIIβ activator. In human cells, the bulk of PI4K activity is associated with the plasma membrane and the membranes of the nucleus, lysosome, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum (20Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Vereb Jr., G.

https://openalex.org/W1969032276,"The mouse cytomegalovirus M33 protein is highly homologous to mammalian G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) yet functions in an agonist-independent manner to activate a number of classical GPCR signal transduction pathways. M33 is functionally similar to the human cytomegalovirus-encoded US28 GPCR in its ability to induce inositol phosphate accumulation, activate NF-κB, and promote smooth muscle cell migration. This ability to promote cellular migration suggests a role for viral GPCRs like M33 in viral dissemination in vivo, and accordingly, M33 is required for efficient murine cytomegalovirus replication in the mouse. Although previous studies have identified several M33-induced signaling pathways, little is known regarding the membrane-proximal events involved in signaling and regulation of this receptor. In this study, we used recombinant retroviruses to express M33 in wild-type and Gαq/11–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts and show that M33 couples directly to the Gq/11 signaling pathway to induce high levels of total inositol phosphates in an agonist-independent manner. Our data also show that GRK2 is a potent regulator of M33-induced Gq/11 signaling through its ability to phosphorylate M33 and sequester Gαq/11 proteins. Taken together, the results from this study provide the first genetic evidence of a viral GPCR coupling to a specific G protein signaling pathway as well as identify the first viral GPCR to be regulated specifically by both the catalytic activity of the GRK2 kinase domain and the Gαq/11 binding activity of the GRK2 RH domain.

Lagerstrom M.C. Lundin L.G. Schioth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). GPCRs are present in virtually all free-living organisms and have also been found in numerous viruses including those in the herpesvirus family (2Guo H.-G. Browning P. Nicholas J. Hayward G.S.

Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). GPCRs are seven-transmembrane domain-spanning proteins that upon agonist binding adopt an active confirmation to stimulate GDP to GTP exchange on the Gα subunit and dissociation from the Gβγ heterodimer. The liberated Gα and Gβγ subunits can then induce a variety of cellular responses through the action of effector proteins and intracellular second messengers. In the case of GPCRs coupled to Gq/11 proteins, activation of these receptors stimulates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) activity, resulting in the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. The concerted action of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol leads to increased levels of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C. Although Gq/11-coupled receptors activate PLC-β via the action of the GTP-bound Gα subunit, Gi/o-coupled receptors have also been shown to stimulate PLC-β via the action of liberated Gβγ subunits (5Blank J. Brattain K. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23069-23075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lee C. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To regulate the levels of signaling necessary for an appropriate cellular response, activated GPCRs are uncoupled from heterotrimeric G proteins through a process termed desensitization. Desensitization is initiated when activated receptors undergo phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues within the intracellular loops and carboxyl tail by members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family (7Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). GRK phosphorylation promotes subsequent binding by β-arrestin proteins, which sterically block G protein coupling, facilitate receptor internalization, and promote G protein-independent, or nontraditional, signaling pathways (7Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). There are seven members of the GRK family (GRK1–7) that share a highly homologous kinase domain as well as an amino-terminal regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology (RH) domain (9Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Aside from GRK1 and 7 and GRK4, which are restricted to the retina and testes, respectively, GRKs are ubiquitously expressed and contribute to the phosphorylation and desensitization of most, if not all, activated GPCRs.GRK2 was one of the first GRK family members identified for its ability to induce phosphorylation of agonist-stimulated β-adrenergic receptor (10Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition to the RH and catalytic domain, GRK2 contains a carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. The pleckstrin homology domain of GRK2 is a phospholipid-binding domain that mediates GRK2 binding to Gβγ, thereby facilitating GRK2 localization to the plasma membrane (11DebBurman S.K.

The RH domain of GRK2 is homologous to RGS domains of other proteins, including RGS4, which typically serve as GTPase-activating proteins to promote hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on Gαq/11 proteins and thereby reduce signaling (15Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 16Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RH domain of GRK2 selectively binds GTP-bound Gαq/11 yet displays little GTPase-activating protein activity. This finding suggests that GRK2 can sequester GTP-bound Gαq/11 and inhibit GPCR signaling independent of receptor phosphorylation (17Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M.

Indeed, a growing list of cellular Gq/11-coupled receptors have been shown to be regulated by GRK2 through this phosphorylation-independent mechanism, revising the classical paradigm of GRK-mediated GPCR desensitization (17Carman C.V.

Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkens Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar). Cytomegalovirus infection is typically asymptomatic within the healthy host; however, congenital CMV infection or infection of immunocompromised hosts can result in a variety of disease syndromes including mental retardation, retinitis, and rejection of transplanted organs (21Pass R.F. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkens Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar).Recently, GPCR homologs have been identified within the genomes of several herpesviruses including CMV. These virally encoded GPCRs are speculated to have been “pirated” from the genome of the infected host throughout the evolution of the virus to alter host cell signaling pathways for the benefit of viral replication, dissemination, and/or immune evasion (22Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) encodes two GPCRs, M33 and M78, which, based on genome organization, are homologs of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) GPCRs UL33 and UL78, respectively (23Rigoutsos I. Novotny J. Huynh T. Chin-Bow S.T. Parida L. Platt D. Coleman D. Shenk T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4326-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Rawlinson W. Farrell H. Barrell B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8833-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although M33 appears to be homologous to UL33, it retains signaling properties more similar to that of another HCMV GPCR termed US28 (25Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies showed that M33 and US28 signal in an agonist-independent manner to induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, suggesting that US28 and M33 can couple to the Gq/11 signaling pathway (26Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Additionally, both US28 and M33 were shown to stimulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and CREB in vitro (26Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). More recently, data have suggested that US28 and M33 could promote smooth muscle cell migration, an early event in the formation of arterial plaques and the development of atherosclerosis (27Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 28Melnychuk R.M. Smith P. Kreklywich C.N. Ruchti F. Vomaske J. Hall L. Loh L. Nelson J.A. Orloff S.L. Streblow D.N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10788-10795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to the potential role of these viral GPCRs in the development of atherosclerosis, the ability of CMV GPCRs to stimulate cellular migration may have broader implications during viral replication in vivo and may contribute to viral dissemination or pathogenesis.Because of the strict species specificity of CMV, no in vivo model is available to study the role of US28 in HCMV pathogenesis. However, the importance of M33 in MCMV pathogenesis was emphasized in studies where recombinant MCMV deleted for M33 displayed decreased viral dissemination to and replication within the salivary gland in vivo (29Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parallels in activated intracellular signaling pathways between M33 and US28 suggest that the latter may play a similar role in HCMV pathogenesis in vivo. In the present study, we sought to determine the membrane-proximal events involved in M33 signaling and regulation. We utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type and Gαq/11 knock-out animals to demonstrate that M33 directly couples to the Gq/11 signaling pathway to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation in an agonist-independent manner. Additionally, we have identified M33 as the first viral GPCR to be regulated by both the catalytic and RH domains of GRK2. Taken together, our data suggest that although M33 retains the characteristic agonist-independent signaling activity observed from other viral GPCRs such as US28, it is dually regulated by GRK2 similar to various host cell Gq/11-coupled receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and HEK293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1573 and CRL-11268, respectively) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Wild-type (WT) and Gαq/11 knock-out (KO) MEFs were kindly provided by Dr. S. Offermanns (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (30Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4304-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For all of the transient transfections, the cells were transfected using Mirus Trans-IT® LT-1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mirus Bio Corp.).Plasmids—The M33 cDNA was cloned from DNA isolated from NIH3T3 cells infected with the MCMV strain K181+ (kind gift from Dr. R. Cardin, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio) and inserted into the EcoRV site within the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). M33HA and M33FLAG were created by PCR from M33 cDNA using a 3′ oligonucleotide encoding for the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) or FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), respectively. The resulting M33HA and M33FLAG sequences were cloned into the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3 and verified by DNA sequencing. M33ΔN, an M33 amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking the first 10 predicted amino acids, was cloned from pcDNA3-M33 using the 5′ oligonucleotide 5′-GCGGATCCGGACCATGGACGAGAGCGACTACCTG-3′ and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pcDNA3. M33ΔNFLAG was created similarly to M33FLAG, using pcDNA3-M33ΔN as a template. M33-R131A was generated from pcDNA3-M33 by a two-step PCR method using overlapping oligonucleotides encoding GCG at base pairs 391–393 in the M33 cDNA. The two PCR products were then used as templates in another round of PCR to generate M33-R131A, which was inserted into pcDNA3 and verified by DNA sequencing. M33HA-R131A was created by PCR from pcDNA3-M33-R131A using the same 3′ oligonucleotide used to generate M33HA. All untagged GRK2 constructs cloned into pcDNA3, as well as the Myc-tagged GRK2 and GRK2 D110A constructs, were kindly provided by Drs. R. Sterne-Marr ((Siena College, Loudonville, NY) and S. Ferguson (The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). The Myc-tagged GRK2 K220R and K220R/D110A constructs were generated by restriction digest of the parental plasmid at the KpnI sites within the GRK2 cDNA and pcDNA3. Fragments were then ligated into the KpnI site in pcDNA3 MycGRK2 or MycGRK2 D110A, respectively, and correct insert orientation was verified by DNA sequencing. For fluorescent confocal microscopy experiments, M33 and M33ΔN cDNAs were cloned in frame into the EcoRI and XhoI sites within the multiple cloning site of pEGFPN-2 (Clontech).Fluorescent Microscopy—HEK293 cells were plated onto collagen-coated 25-mm glass coverslips and transfected with 1.0 μg of pEGFPN-2, pEGFPN-2 M33 (M33GFP) or pEGFPN-2 M33ΔN (M33ΔNGFP). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were visualized using a Zeiss 510 inverted confocal microscope.Inositol Phosphate Accumulation Assay—Transiently transfected HEK293 cells or retrovirally transduced MEFs were radiolabeled with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol overnight. The cells were then treated with 20 mm LiCl for 3 h, after which cell lysates were prepared in 0.4 m perchloric acid and neutralized in 0.72 m KOH and 0.6 m KHCO3. For AlF–4 stimulation of Gα proteins, the cells were treated with 20 μm AlCl3 and 20 mm NaF during LiCl incubation, and lysates were prepared in a similar manner as described above. The lysates were then applied to Dowex columns (AG1-X8; Bio-Rad), washed, and eluted in 0.1 m formic acid and 1 m ammonium formate. The eluates were counted in a liquid scintillation counter and corrected for total [3H]myoinositol incorporation. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software and presented as fold inositol phosphate accumulation over basal.Co-immunoprecipitations and Western Blot—Forty-eight hours after transfection, HEK293 cell lysates were prepared in 1.0 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride). The cell lysates were precleared by incubating with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose® beads (Amersham Biosciences) and tumbling for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG® M2-agarose beads (Sigma), anti-HA.11-Sepharose beads (Covance), or anti-Myc agarose beads (Sigma) and tumbled for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and then solubilized in 3× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with primary anti-HA (1:2000) (Santa Cruz), anti-Myc (1:2000) (Sigma), or anti-Gαq/11 (1:1000) antibodies (Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence were used for detection and visualization of immunoprecipitating proteins, respectively.Receptor Deglycosylation—Forty-eight hours post-transfection, HEK293T cells expressing M33FLAG or M33ΔNFLAG were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were passed through a 22-gauge needle, briefly sonicated, and cellular debris was pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were then boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, cooled, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.75%. The samples were then untreated or treated with 500 units of PNGase F (New England BioLabs) for 30-s, 5-min, and 15-min time intervals. The samples were then subjected to Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (1:1,000; Santa Cruz) as described above.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—Forty-eight hours after transduction, WT and Gαq/11 KO MEFs were trypsinized and FACS analyzed using the BD FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences). The data from three independent experiments performed in duplicate were analyzed using CellQuest software, and representative histograms are presented.Retroviral Production and Transduction—M33 cDNA was blunt cloned into the HpaI site within the MigR1 retroviral vector to generate MigR1-M33. MigR1 is a bicistronic retroviral vector containing a multiple cloning site upstream of an internal ribosome entry site followed by the cDNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (31Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MigR1 or MigR1-M33 (3 μg) was then transiently co-transfected with 1 μg of pVSV-G into the packaging cell line HEK GP2–293 (Clontech). Supernatants containing VSV-G pseudotyped MigR1 or MigR1-M33 retroviruses were collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. For transduction of WT and Gαq/11 KO MEFs, 1 × 105 cells were plated in 12-well plates, and twenty-four hours later appropriate amounts of MigR1 or MigR1-M33 supernatants were added to the media. The 12-well plates were then centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 45 minutes at room temperature to facilitate viral binding. Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were assayed by FACS or inositol phosphate accumulation assay as described.In Vivo Kinase Assay—Forty-eight hours after transfection, HEK293 cells were washed and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium for 30 min. The cells were then labeled with 500 μCi/ml [32P]H3PO4 (MP Biomedicals) for 3 h, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1.0 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were precleared by incubating with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose® beads and tumbling for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG® M2-agarose beads and tumbled for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and then solubilized in 3× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. M33FLAG phosphorylation was analyzed by ImageQuant software, and the data were plotted using GraphPad Prism 4 software.RESULTSThe M33 Amino Terminus and NRY Motif Are Required for Stimulation of Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—In this study we investigated the G protein coupling and GRK regulation employed by the viral M33 GPCR during signal transduction. M33 was cloned from NIH3T3 cells infected with the K181+ strain of MCMV and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. Similar to other members of the UL33 family, M33 has been predicted to contain an alternative start site in the amino terminus, generating a truncated transcript lacking the first 10 amino acids (29Davis-Poynter N.J.

An expression construct for this truncated M33 protein (termed M33ΔN) was similarly cloned into pcDNA3. To assess signaling of M33, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 (mock) or increasing amounts of M33 (0.01, 0.05, 0.25, and 1.25 μg), and inositol phosphate accumulation was assessed. HEK293 cells transfected with M33 showed a dose-dependent increase in inositol phosphates measured in the absence of agonist in agreement with previous studies using full-length M33 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Similar signaling activity was observed with carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged versions of M33 (data not shown). Previous reports indicated that M33-mediated stimulation of smooth muscle cell migration was enhanced in the presence of the β-chemokine RANTES, suggesting that M33 signaling could be facilitated by agonist (28Melnychuk R.M. Smith P. Kreklywich C.N. Ruchti F. Vomaske J. Hall L. Loh L. Nelson J.A. Orloff S.L. Streblow D.N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10788-10795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, we observed no significant increase in M33-induced inositol phosphate accumulation in the presence of up to 500 ng/ml of mouse RANTES (data not shown), further supporting the idea that M33 signals in an agonist-independent manner.To assess the signaling activity of M33ΔN, which lacks the first 10 amino acids of M33, we analyzed the ability of this truncated protein to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation. As shown in Fig. 1B, M33ΔN fails to induce the formation of inositol phosphates as compared with full-length M33. To determine whether this loss in signaling activity is due to a defect in the ability of M33ΔN to properly localize to the plasma membrane, HEK293 cells were transfected with empty pEGFP-N2 vector (mock), GFP-tagged M33 (M33GFP), or GFP-tagged M33ΔN (M33ΔNGFP) and visualized using fluorescent confocal microscopy. In Fig. 1C, mock transfected cells expressing GFP alone displayed a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of GFP (left panel), whereas cells transfected with M33GFP show prominent expression of M33 at the cell surface (middle panel). In contrast, cells transfected with M33ΔNGFP displayed little or no cell surface expression with the majority of localization within the cytoplasm (right panel).The altered membrane localization of M33ΔN suggests that deletion of the 10 amino-terminal residues in M33 prevents proper maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, have shown to occur on both cellular and viral GPCRs (32Paulsen S.J. Rosenkilde M.M. Eugen-Olsen J. Kledal T.N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Lanctot P.M. Leclerc P.C. Clement M. Auger-Messier M. Escher E. Leduc R. Guillemette G. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because M33 has been predicted to contain a consensus N-linked glycosylation site at Asn20 (29Davis-Poynter N.J. Lynch D.M. Vally H. Shellam G.R. Rawlinson W.D. Barrell B.G. Farrell H.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine the glycosylation state of full-length M33 and the amino-terminal deletion mutant M33ΔN. Extracts from HEK293T cells expressing M33FLAG or M33ΔNFLAG were treated with the glycosidase PNGase F, and changes in molecular mass were monitored by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1D). In untreated extracts from cells expressing full-length M33FLAG, M33 runs as a broad series of bands, each with a molecular mass of ∼45 kDa; however, after 15 min of treatment with PNGase F, M33 runs as a single faster migrating band of ∼35 kDa. This result indicates that wild-type M33 is a mature glycosylated protein. Conversely, no shift in molecular mass is observed following PNGase F treatment of extracts from cells expressing M33ΔN, indicating that M33ΔN fails to undergo glycosylation. Taken together with the confocal data, our results suggest that the amino terminus of M33 is necessary for proper maturation and subsequent membrane localization of the receptor. Based on these observations, full-length M33 constructs containing the 10 amino-terminal residues were utilized for the following experiments in this study.Cellular GPCRs contain specific motifs necessary for G protein coupling. The DRY (Asp-Arg-Tyr) motif, a conserved feature located between the third transmembrane domain and the second intracellular loop, has been shown to be essential for G protein coupling and signaling activity (34Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, many constitutively active GPCRs, including mutant cellular GPCRs and those encoded by herp"

Mammalian αII- and βII-spectrin subunits form dimers that associate head to head with high affinity to form tetramers, but it is not known if this interaction is regulated. We show here that the short C-terminal splice variant of βII-spectrin (βIIΣ2) is a substrate for phosphorylation. <i>In vitro</i>, protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates Ser-2110 and Thr-2159; protein kinase A phosphorylates Thr-2159. Antiphospho-Thr-2159 peptide antibody detected phosphorylated βIIΣ2 in Cos-1 cells. Immunoreactivity was increased in Cos-1 cells by treatment with forskolin, indicating that phosphorylation is promoted by elevated cAMP. The effect of forskolin was counteracted by the cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor, H89. <i>In vitro</i>, protein kinase A phosphorylation of an active fragment of βIIΣ2 greatly reduced its interaction with αII-spectrin at the tetramerization site. Mutation of Thr-2159 to alanine eliminated inhibition by phosphorylation. Among the processes that require spectrin in mammals is the formation of neurites (incipient nerve axons). We tested the relationship of spectrin phosphorylation to neuritogenesis by transfecting the neuronal cell line, PC12, with enhanced green fluorescent protein-coupled fragments of βIIΣ2-spectrin predicted to act as inhibitors of spectrin tetramer formation. Both wild-type and T2159E mutant fragments allowed normal neuritogenesis in PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor. The mutant T2159A inhibited neuritogenesis. Because the T2159A mutant represents a high affinity inhibitor of tetramer formation, we conclude that tetramers are requisite for neuritogenesis. Furthermore, because both the T2159E mutant and the wild-type allow neuritogenesis, we conclude that the short C-terminal βII-spectrin is phosphorylated during this process."

The initial σ54-RNA polymerase (RNAP)·promoter complex, the closed complex, is transcriptionally silent. The transcriptionally proficient σ54-RNAP·promoter complex, the open complex, is formed upon remodeling of the closed complex by actions of a specialized activator protein that belongs to the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein family in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. The integrity of a highly conserved signature motif in the AAA activator (known as the GAFTGA motif) is important for the remodeling activity of the AAA activator and for open complex formation. We now provide evidence that the invariant threo-nine residue of the GAFTGA motif plays a role in sensing the DNA downstream of the σ54-RNAP-binding site and in coupling this information to σ54-RNAP via the conserved regulatory Region I domain of σ54 during open complex formation.

Gene transcription in bacteria is catalyzed by the multisub-unit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). 5The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; L1, loop 1; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 5The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; L1, loop 1; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. The catalytically competent core form of bacterial RNAP is a five-subunit enzyme (α2ββ′ω; E), which has to associate with a sixth subunit, the σ factor, for promoter-specific and regulated initiation of gene transcription. On the basis of differences in mechanism of action and amino acid sequence, bacterial σ factors are classified into two families. Most bacterial σ factors belong to the σ70 family, named after the prototypical housekeeping σ factor, σ70,of Escherichia coli. The major variant bacterial σ factor belongs to the σ54 class. Transcription initiation by RNAP containing σ70 (Eσ70) and σ54 (Eσ54) is mechanistically distinct. Eσ70 recognizes promoters that contain consensus sequences centered at DNA positions -35 and -10, respectively, from the transcription start site (at +1). The initial transcriptionally inactive Eσ70·DNA complex, called the closed complex, can spontaneously isomerize to form the transcriptionally active open complex, in which the DNA strands are separated and the RNAP is poised for RNA synthesis. In contrast, Eσ54 forms closed complexes on promoters that contain consensus sequences centered at DNA positions -24 and -12 (1Wigneshweraraj S.R. Burrows P.C. Bordes P. Schumacher J. Rappas M. Finn R.D. Cannon W.V. Zhang X. Buck M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 339-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Closed complexes formed by Eσ54 remain inactive for transcription unless activated by a specialized type of transcription activator protein that belongs to the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein family (2Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Eσ54-dependent transcription activators (from now on referred to as AAA activators) bind to DNA sites located (∼150–200 bases) upstream of the promoter (known as upstream activating sequences) and use the energy derived from ATP binding and hydrolysis to remodel the Eσ54 closed complex (2Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolysis-dependent binding interactions between the AAA activator and Eσ54 closed complex trigger a series of protein and DNA isomerization events in the Eσ54 closed complex, which result in the formation of the open complex. The major energetically favorable binding site for the AAA activator within the Eσ54 closed complex is the N-terminal Region I domain of σ54 (see Fig. 1A) (3Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which, in the closed complex, is located at the -12 consensus promoter region, where DNA opening for open complex formation nucleates (4Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M.K. Ishihama A. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 681-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the -12 promoter region, σ54 Region I meditates tight binding to a repressive fork junction structure and so prevents open complex formation in the absence of activation. Region I of σ54 is associated with a range of properties of Eσ54 (1Wigneshweraraj S.R. Burrows P.C. Bordes P. Schumacher J. Rappas M. Finn R.D. Cannon W.V. Zhang X. Buck M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res.

Region I ofσ54 has been shown to make extensive interactions with the catalytic β and β′ subunits of RNAP (8Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Buck M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3038-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The AAA activators of Eσ54 are mechanochemical P-loop ATPases of the AAA family (2Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R.

Structural analysis of one model AAA activator, E. coli PspF (phage shock protein F) (10Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M.

Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggests that mobile loops, called loops 1 (L1) and 2 (L2), within a hexameric assembly contact Region I of σ54 (see Fig. 1, B and C) and that these contacts form during the energy-coupling process that transmits a conformational change around the γ-phosphate of the ATP-binding site on PspF to changes in the Eσ54 closed complex conformation, which subsequently triggers open complex formation. Specifically, an invariant threonine residue in L1 (Thr86 in PspF) (see Fig. 1C) is thought to engage with σ54 Region I during the energy-coupling process (10Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H.

Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolysis-dependent movements of L1 and L2 have also been observed in the AAA activator Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 (nitrogen regulatory protein C1) (12De Carlo S. Chen B. Hoover T.R. Kondrashkina E. Nogales E. Nixon B.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Current models for energy coupling by PspF indicate that a range of functional states of the AAA domain of PspF will exist, depending upon its nucleotide-bound state, and that more than one conformation of σ54 Region I will exist for open complex formation to occur (10Rappas M.

To elucidate the role of σ54 Region I and the invariant Thr86 residue in the energy-coupling process, we have sought altered forms of σ54 that can compensate for defects displayed by a partially functional PspF variant containing a serine substitution at Thr86 in L1 (3Chaney M.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we established that the T86S form of L1 of PspF is defective in interaction with the Eσ54 closed complex in the presence of the ATP hydrolysis transition state analog ADP·AlFx (11Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ADP·AlFx-dependent complex between PspF and the Eσ54 closed complex (referred to as the ternary complex) is regarded as an intermediate state that is established en route to full open complex formation (3Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M.

Here, we describe the isolation of a new mutant form of σ54, σ54(G4L) (see Fig. 1A), capable of suppressing the defects of PspF(T86S) evident in ternary complex formation with the Eσ54 closed complex and during in vitro transcription initiation. We show that the “to-be-melted DNA” downstream of the -12 consensus promoter region somehow negatively affects the ability of PspF(T86S) to stably interact with the Eσ54 closed complex. The properties of PspF(T86S) andσ54(G4L) imply a role for the conserved GAFTGA motif in PspF and, by extension, in other AAA activators of Eσ54 in “sensing” the conformation adopted by the DNA downstream of the -12 promoter region and coupling this information to Eσ54 via Region I to allow open complex formation. Design and Construction of a σ54 Region I Fragment 2–14 Mutant Library—Klebsiella pneumoniae σ54 Region I amino acids 2–14 were subjected to random mutagenesis using a novel combinatorial codon-based mutagenesis approach that enabled the mutagenic rate to be controlled to obtain σ54 variants with few amino acids substitutions (14Gaytán P. Osuna J. Soberón X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A detailed background of this mutagenesis method is described by Gaytán et al. (14Gaytán P. Osuna J. Soberón X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This method is based on the use of five dinucleotides designated B2B3 (AA, TT, AT, GC, and CG). Mutant codons are assembled by tandem addition of a diluted mixture of the five dinucleotides to the growing oligonucleotide and a mixture of four nucleotides to generate 20 trinucleotides that encode a set of 18 amino acids. Thus, in this method, wild-type codons are doped with a set of mutant codons during oligonucleotide synthesis to generate random combinatorial libraries of primers that contain few codon replacements per variant. The mutagenic rate is controlled by varying the percentage of B2B3 dimers used to “dope” the second and third positions of the wild-type codons targeted for mutagenesis. An oligonucleotide, called oligonucleotide A (72-mer), with sequence 5′-tattggccctgcatATG-AAG/B1B2B3-CAA/B1B2B3-GGT/B1B2B3-TTG/B1B2B3-CAA/B1B2B3-TTA/B1B2B3-AGG/B1B2B3-CTA/B1B2B3-AGC/B1B2B3-CAA/B1B2B3-CAG/B1B2B3-CTT/B1B2B3-GCC/B1B2B3-atgacgccacaactg-3′ was assembled. The wild-type σ54 codons subjected to mutagenesis are in uppercase letters. A second oligonucleotide, called oligo-nucleotide B (63-mer), with sequence 5′-ttgctggagttctagagtggacagctgcagtagacgaatcgcctgctgcagttgtggcgtcat-3′ was designed to complement the 3′-flanking arm of oligonucleotide A. The complementary sequences of both oligonucleotides are shown in boldface. The flanking arms included two restriction sites, NdeI and XbaI (underlined). The introduction of the restriction sites did not change the wild-type coding sequence of σ54. The duplex DNA library of the target region was generated by the extension of complementary oligonucleotide B over mutagenic oligonucleotide A using the Klenow fragment (3′ → 5′ exo-) of DNA polymerase I. Briefly, an equimolar concentration of oligonucleotides A and B (500 pmol) was mixed in Klenow buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 at 25 °C), 10 mm MgSo4, and 1 m m DTT) containing all four dNTPs. For the annealing step, the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 15 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. 1 μl of Klenow fragment (5 units/μl) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following this, the Klenow fragment was heat-inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. The duplex DNA library was separated by gel electrophoresis and purified from single primer species on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel using a Qiagen gel extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The duplex DNA library was digested with NdeI and XbaI and used to replace the wild-type σ54 residues corresponding to positions 2–14 in pVB009 (15Grande R.A. Valderrama B. Morett E. J. Mol.

The clones that displayed the desired phenotype were sequenced to establish that mutation(s) were located only within amino acids 2–14 of σ54.

Previous results indicated that σ54 Region I amino acids 6–14 are important for binding to the AAA activator (11Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, we subjected σ54 amino acids 2–14 to a codon-based mutagenesis approach (14Gaytán P. Osuna J. Soberón X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutant σ54 library was transformed into E. coli strain TH1, which has a deletion of the rpoN gene, encoding σ54, and contains plasmids pRT22 (3Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and pWKS130 (18González V. Olvera L. Soberón X. Morett E. Mol. Micro-biol. 1998; 28: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pRT22 is a reporter plasmid and contains the σ54-dependent K. pneumoniae nifH promoter fused to the lacZ gene. pWKS130 constitutively encodes the NifA(T308S) activator protein. The transformed E. coli TH1 cells were plated onto X-gal-containing agar, and blue-white screening was used to identify σ54 mutants capable of recovering NifA(T308S) activity. In this experimental system, E. coli cells containing σ54 mutants capable of recovering the NifA(T308S) activity will produce colonies displaying a deep blue color. We isolated six colonies (rpoN-sup1–6) that displayed a deep blue color. An in vivo β-galactosidase activity assay was used to quantitatively assess the ability of these six mutant clones (rpoN-sup1–6) to recover the activity of the NifA(T308S) protein. As shown in Table 1, the NifA(T308S)-dependent expression of lacZ was ∼6–20-fold higher in the presence of the six mutant σ54 clones than in the presence of wild-type σ54. However, we noted that the level of transcriptional activity of the rpoN-sup clones with NifA(T308S) represented ∼15–20% of the transcriptional activity obtained with wild-type NifA. Thus, this result suggests that all six mutant σ54 clones, at least in the context of this assay, are able to specifically recover the activity of NifA(T308S).TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of σ54 Region I segment 1–14 from clones rpoN-sup1–6 The transcriptional activities of clones rpoN-sup1–6 in response to activation by NifA(T308S) or wild-type NifA are given. Open table in a new tab Sequence analyses of clones rpoN-sup1–6 revealed that all, except clone rpoN-sup4, contained three to five amino acid substitutions that were widely distributed within the σ54 Region I segment (amino acids 2–14) that was subjected to mutagenesis. Analysis of randomly chosen clones from the library that did not display a deep blue color also revealed multiple amino acid substitutions within this σ54 Region I segment. In line with the key objective of this study, we did obtain six mutant rpoN clones capable of suppressing the activation defect displayed by the NifA(T308S) protein, but failed to obtain rpoN clones with single amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, a common feature in all mutant clones that rescued NifA(T308S) was the high occurrence of hydrophobic amino acids at the mutated positions. Notably, all mutant clones had a mutation of the non-conserved glycine codon at position 4 (Gly4), and in most cases (rpoN-sup2 and rpoN-sup4–6), Gly4 was changed to a hydrophobic residue (Table 1). In most rpoN genes sequenced so far, position 4 is represented by a hydrophilic residue. From Table 1, it seems that the substitution of the conformationally flexible glycine residue at position 4 of K. pneumoniae σ54 Region I is a requirement for recovering the activity of NifA(T308S). Because, unlike the other clones, clone rpoN-sup4 contained substitutions only at Gly4 and Gln11 and displayed the second highest activity in the β-galactosidase assays (Table 1), we separated the G4L/Q11F mutations to further investigate the role of G4L and Q11F substitutions in recovering the activity of NifA(T308S). Initially, we used the in vivo β-galactosidase activity assay (as described above) to establish whether the single mutants σ54(G4L) and σ54(Q11F) are able to express lacZ in the presence of wild-type NifA. As shown in Table 2, σ54(G4L) was ∼20% more active than wild-type σ54. In contrast, σ54(Q11F) was ∼3–4-fold less active than either σ54(G4L) or wild-type σ54. Notably, the double mutant σ54(G4L/Q11F) was ∼20% more active than wild-type σ54 in expressing lacZ in a wild-type NifA-dependent manner. E. coli TH1 cell extracts were prepared and probed with anti-σ54 antibodies to confirm that the stability of σ54 was not affected by the Q11F mutation. The results showed that wild-type σ54, σ54(G4L), σ54(Q11F), and σ54(G4L/Q11F) were present at equal amounts under the assay conditions (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the Q11F single substitution in σ54 is unfavorable for wild-type NifA-dependent activation of transcription, but that σ54(Q11F) is expressed as a stable protein.TABLE 2In vivo transcriptional activities of wild-type σ54, σ54(G4L), σ54(Q11F), and σ54(G4L/Q11F) in response to activation by NifA(T308S), NifA(T308V), or wild-type NifA Assays were conducted in E. coli strain TH1 (ΔrpoN) containing plasmid pRT22, which carries the σ54-dependent K. pneumoniae nifH promoter fused to the lacZ gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). Values represent the average from at least three different data sets.σ54β-Galactosidase activityNifA(T308S)NifA(T308V)Wild-type NifAMiller unitsWild-type75 ± 2061.4 ± 534 801 ± 139G4L460 ± 2771 ± 1046 887 ± 296Q11F97 ± 355.6 ± 412 331 ± 156G4L/Q11F1356 ± 4659.1 ± 847 432 ± 1366 Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated whether the single mutants σ54(G4L) and σ54(Q11F) are able to recover NifA(T308S) activity as effectively as σ54(G4L/Q11F). As expected, wild-type σ54 was unable to express lacZ when NifA(T308S) was used for activation. Notably, only σ54(G4L) was able to recover the activity of NifA(T308S) and expressed lacZ at an ∼6-fold higher level compared with wild-type σ54 (Table 2). σ54(Q11F) was unable to recover NifA(T308S) activity (Table 2). Thus, it seems that the G4L substitution is the significant mutation in σ54 Region I that allows recovery of NifA(T308S) activity. However, the level of lacZ expression by σ54(G4L) was ∼3-fold reduced compared with σ54(G4L/Q11F). Thus, it seems that, in the context of σ54(G4L/Q11F), the hydrophobic substitution at Gln11 facilitates an improved interaction between Region I of σ54 and L1 of NifA(T308S). We assessed whether the σ54 mutants are able to suppress the NifA(T308S) mutant in vivo in an allele-specific manner by using another NifA mutant carrying a different substitution at the same L1 position (NifA(T308V)). Like NifA(T308S), this mutant is impaired in transcription activation, but contains an amino acid at position 308 that is geometrically and spatially very similar to a threonine residue. The in vivo activation assay showed that neither σ54(G4L) nor σ54(G4L/Q11F) was able to recover the activity of the activation-defective NifA variant containing the T308V substitution (Table 2). Hence, it appears that σ54(G4L) specifically recovers NifA(T308S) activity. Eσ54(G4L) Recovers the Activation-defective Property of PspF(T86S)-(1–275) in an in Vitro Transcription Assay—The in vivo analysis revealed that a single amino acid substitution at position 4 (G4L) in Region I of K. pneumoniae σ54 is sufficient to specifically recover the activity of NifA(T308S) and to explain the molecular basis for the activation defect of the NifA(T308S) mutant. To determine the properties of σ54(G4L) responsible for recovering the activity of NifA(T308S), we conducted a series of in vitro experiments that measured activator-dependent output by Eσ54 at several steps leading to productive transcription initiation. For the in vitro assays, we used the AAA domain of the AAA activator E. coli PspF (PspF-(1–275)) (11Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) containing the T86S substitution (the equivalent of the T308S mutation in NifA) because, in contrast to the NifA protein, (i) PspF-(1–275) is far better suited for in vitro studies and (ii) well established experimental assays exist to study PspF-(1–275)-dependent activation of Eσ54 transcription (3Chaney M.

Furthermore, PspF-(1–275) lacks the domain containing the helix-turn-helix motif and is thus able to efficiently activate transcription (in vivo and in vitro) from solution without the need to bind to upstream activating sequences, a property that significantly simplifies in vitro experimental desi"
https://openalex.org/W2052321896,"The t(2;5) chromosomal translocation occurs in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma arising from activated T lymphocytes. This genomic rearrangement generates the nucleophosmin (NPM)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) oncoprotein that is a chimeric protein consisting of parts of the nuclear protein NPM and ALK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify an adaptor protein Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target (SNT)-2 as a new partner that interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of ALK. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that SNT-1 and SNT-2 interacted with NPM-ALK and kinase-negative NPM-ALK mutant. Y156, Y567 and a 19-amino-acid sequence (aa 631–649) of NPM-ALK were essential for this interaction. The interaction through Y156 and Y567 was dependent on phosphorylation of these tyrosines, whereas the interaction through the 19-amino-acid sequence was independent of phosphorylation. NPM-ALK mutant protein mutated at these three binding sites showed significantly reduced transforming activity. This transformation-defective NPM-ALK mutant still interacted with signal transducing proteins such as phospholipase C-gamma and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which were previously reported to be relevant to NPM-ALK-dependent tumorigenesis. These observations indicate that the three SNT-binding sites of NPM-ALK are important for its transforming activity. This raises a possibility that SNT family proteins play significant roles in cellular transformation triggered by NPM-ALK, which though remains to be verified."
https://openalex.org/W2057682818,"Deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) result in replication errors within key tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, and cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Hematological malignancy with microsatellite instability is also associated with defective MMR, but little is known about the target genes for MMR. Here we identified Ikaros, a master transcription factor of lymphoid lineage commitment and differentiation, as a mutational target in spontaneous and radiation-induced T-cell lymphomas in Mlh1-deficient mice. Three quarters of lymphomas lacked Ikaros protein expression, which resulted from a frameshift mutation that created a stop codon. Mononucleotide repeat sequences at 1029-1034(C)6 and 1567-1572(G)6 in Ikaros were mutational hot spots with a one-base deletion occurring with a frequency of 45 and 50%, respectively. Point mutations and splicing alterations were also observed. In total, 85% of the lymphomas showed aberrations in Ikaros. The characteristic of Mlh1-deficient lymphomas is harboring of multiple mutations simultaneously in the same tumor, displaying a combination of two frameshift mutations at different repeats, frameshift and point mutations, and/or deletion mutations. This is the first report of Ikaros mutations coupled with Mlh1 deficiency in lymphomagenesis."

The experimental results show that there is more overall nucleotide insertion opposite (+)-ta-[BP]G due to particularly enhanced mismatch incorporation at 55 °C compared with 37 °C. The molecular dynamics simulations suggest that mismatched nucleotide insertion opposite (+)-ta-[BP]G is increased at 55 °C compared with 37 °C because the higher temperature shifts the preference of the damaged base from the anti to the syn conformation, with the carcinogen on the more open major groove side. The mismatched dNTP structures are less distorted when the damaged base is syn than when it is anti, at the higher temperature. However, with the normal partner dCTP, the anti conformation with close to Watson-Crick alignment remains more favorable.

It is well established that induction of the SOS response in Escherichia coli increases both error-free and error-prone bypass (43Shen X. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Ponten I. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R.

We show here that an increase in temperature from 37 to 55 °C increases bypass of the (+)-ta-[BP]G adduct by Dpo4, particularly due to enhancement of incorrect nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations show that the BP rings can be accommodated in the active site of Dpo4 in the smaller minor groove-side space (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A. Likhterov I.

Model.,. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) or the larger major groove-side pocket, with the modified guanine adopting the anti or syn glycosidic torsion conformation, respectively, at both 37 and 55 °C. However, at 55 °C the major groove/syn orientation is structurally less distorted and more favorable for mismatch incorporation; the minor groove/anti conformation, permitting near Watson-Crick pairing, remains preferred for the normal partner dCTP. The molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with the kcat values for nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion, and structurally explain the experimental findings. The results further suggest that the anti/syn equilibrium is temperature-dependent and influences the overall rate of catalysis, enzyme fidelity, and specificity. Modified Oligodeoxynucleotide Template and Primer Strands—The construction of BP diol epoxide-modified oligonucleotide strands was carried out as reported previously (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A.

In brief, the 11-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-TTATAG6*CACAC-3′ with the single (+)-ta-[BP]G adduct at G6*, was generated by a direct synthetic method, purified, and characterized as described previously (59Geacintov N.E.

The modified 11-mers and flanking 12- and 19-mers were annealed with a complementary 38-mer template strand (all purchased from Sigma Genosys), PAGE-purified, and then the three oligonucleotides were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) as described (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resultant 42-mer modified oligonucleotides (5′-CACGTAATGATGTTATAG6* CACACGCTATCTGGCCAGATCGCG-3′) were purified using 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 8 m urea. An unmodified control 42-mer template strand was constructed in a similar manner. The purity of the template was verified by end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and denaturing PAGE. The integrity of the modified oligonucleotide was verified by observing that the electrophoretic mobility of the 42-mer strand containing the (+)-ta-[BP]dG adduct located at the 25th nucleotide was somewhat slower than that of the unmodified 42-mer oligonucleotide. This difference is routinely utilized to monitor the integrity of a modified 42-mer sequence. Primer-extension Assays—Primer-extension assays were carried out as reported previously (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A. Likhterov I. Scicchitano D.A. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36951-36961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The primer strand utilized in the single dNTP incorporation experiments opposite the lesions (standing-start primer-extension assays) was 21 nucleotides in length and its 3′-terminal nucleotide extended up to the template base flanking the (+)-ta-[BP]dG adduct on the 3′ side (24th nucleotide from the 3′ end of the template). In the running start primer-extension assays, the primer strand was 18 bases in length and its 3′-terminal base extended up to the 21st template base counted from the 3′ end. All template-primer complexes had a 3-base single strand overhang at the 3′ side of the template. The primer strands were 5′-end labeled using 1 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and 0.01 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The labeled primers and unlabeled 42-mer DNA templates were annealed in a 1:1.25 ratio. The running start primer-extension assays with Dpo4 were carried out in a 40-μl volume containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, 2000 μm of each dNTP, and 10 nm Dpo4. These solutions were incubated at 37 or 55 °C, 10-μl aliquots were removed, and the reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of a “stop solution” (80% formamide, 5 mm Tris boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) after 15, 30, and 60 min. Standing start primer-extension assays were utilized to determine the kcat for insertion of each nucleotide by Dpo4 and were carried out with only one dNTP at a time. The actual measurements yielded the Michaelis-Menten parameters Vmax, the rate of dNTP incorporation at saturating concentrations of each dNTP, as described earlier (33Alekseyev Y.O. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10431-10438Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the relationship kcat = Vmax/[E0] was utilized to estimate kcat, where [E0] is the enzyme concentration. The 40-μl reaction solutions contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, 2.5 nm [32P]primer-template, and 10 nm Dpo4. The concentration of dNTP and reaction times were dependent on the saturation conditions for each dNTP. The dNTP concentrations and reaction times utilized are provided in supplemental Table S1. Vmax values are given in supplemental Table S2. All reaction stop mixtures were heated to 90 °C for 10 min prior to analysis on a 20% PAGE gel containing 8 m urea. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate prior to data analysis with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). All assays were conducted in triplicate (three independent trials) and the results are reported as averages with standard deviations. Molecular Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Dpo4 Ternary Complexes Containing the (+)-ta-[BP]G Adduct—Parameters for the (+)-ta-[BP]G, dNTP, and Mg2+ residues developed previously were employed in the current work (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A.

Biol. 2003; 327: 797-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out as described in Perlow-Poehnelt et al. (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A. Likhterov I. Scicchitano D.A. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36951-36961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) except that the systems were heated to and maintained at 328 K (55 °C) instead of 310 K (37 °C). In brief, the type I crystal structure of the Dpo4 ternary complex (7Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) was used as the starting structure for the molecular models (Protein Data Bank code 1JX4) with coordinates obtained from the Protein Data Bank (66Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27555) Google Scholar). The primer-template sequence used in the simulations is shown in Fig. 1b. Both the anti and syn conformations of the template (+)-ta-[BP]G were employed and each anti dNTP was modeled opposite the adduct. Systems were also constructed in which (+)-ta-[BP]G in the anti conformation was modeled opposite syn dATP and syn dGTP. A templating base and an incoming dNTP in the syn conformation have been observed in pol ι (67Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and Dpo4 (29Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Yang W. Nature. 2003; 424: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, a total of 11 simulations was carried out, including an unmodified control. The starting torsion angles for the anti and syn (+)-ta-[BP]G residues (see Fig. 1a) were: χ, 236°; α′, 109°; β′, 248° and χ, 71°; α′, 321°; β′, 230°, respectively. These combinations of χ, α′, and β′ are within domains computed to be favorable for this adduct (68Xie X.M. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2956-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The anti and syn dNTPs had starting χ torsions of 222° and 42°, respectively. The 3′-OH groups were added to the dideoxynucleotides in the crystal structure, and hydrogen atoms were added to all residues using the LEaP module of AMBER 6.0 (69Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Kollman P.A. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2671) Google Scholar). Details of the protocols for the molecular dynamics simulations are identical to those given in Perlow-Poehnelt et al. (28Perlow-Poehnelt R.A. Likhterov I. Scicchitano D.A. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36951-36961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except that the production runs were carried out at 328 K (55 °C). Plots of root mean squared deviations demonstrating the stability of the simulations are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Molecular alignments and Fig. 3 were produced using PyMol (Delano Scientific, CA). The results of typical running start primer-extension experiments at different reaction times are depicted in Fig. 2a. Under the given experimental conditions, translesion bypass is limited at 37 °C, but is significantly more pronounced at 55 °C, particularly after 60 min. In all cases, primer-extension slows after incorporation of the nucleotide opposite the template base 3′ to the damaged base, labeled as the -1 position in Fig. 2a. Insertion of the base opposite the adduct (position (0)) is the slowest, rate-determining step because partially extended primers accumulate just before the lesion. Extension from the lesion site appears to be significantly faster because there is little accumulation of primers with their 3′-terminal nucleotide opposite the (+)-ta-[BP]G adduct. These results are consistent with those of Boudsocq et al. (10Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that Dpo4 bypasses several bulky adducts at least 1 order of magnitude more slowly than unmodified DNA. A noteworthy feature of the running start experiments is that insertion of the base opposite the lesion is slower than extension beyond the lesion once a nucleotide has been incorporated into the primer strand opposite the adduct. In contrast, in the case of replicative polymerases, primer-extension past the (+)-ta-[BP]dG adduct is significantly slower than insertion of a base opposite the adduct (32Zhuang P. Kolbanovskiy A.

When an oligonucleotide contains fewer than 6 contiguous dT residues, the CspE interactions with single-stranded DNA are primarily electrostatic. The minimal length of single-stranded DNA to which CspE binds in a salt-resistant manner is eight nucleotides. We also show that CspE exists as a dimer in solution.

We present a possible mechanism to explain the role of CspE in chromosome condensation in vivo by CspE binding to distant DNA regions in the chromosome and dimerizing, thereby condensing the intervening DNA. The Csp proteins are an essential group of small proteins (67-73 amino acids) (1Graumann P.L. Schroder K. Schmid R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4611-4619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Graumann P. Wendrich T. Weber M. Schroder K. Marahiel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and the genes that encode them are present in the majority of sequenced bacterial genomes, some archaea, and one lower eukaryote (3Falsone S.F.

Biol. 2003; 55: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, a sequence homologous to Csps exists as the DNA binding domain in a family of transcription factors called Y-Box-binding proteins (5Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Most bacterial species contain multiple csp genes, generally between 2 and 12 (4Trun N. Johnston D. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 55: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). At least one csp gene is required for cell viability in all organisms where it has been tested (2Graumann P. Wendrich T. Weber M. Schroder K. Marahiel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli K12 contains genes for nine Csp proteins (CspA to CspI), which share between 46 and 91% similarity and between 29 and 83% identity in the primary amino acid sequence (4Trun N. Johnston D. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 55: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). When expressed at high levels, CspC and -E suppress the chromosome condensation defects of a deletion in the gene for the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein, MukB (6Yamanaka K. Mitani T. Feng J. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CspE also prevents DNA decondensation by camphor when expressed from a plasmid (7Hu K.H. Liu E. Dean K. Gingras M. DeGraff W. Trun N.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These properties implicate CspC and -E in chromosome condensation. In addition, CspA, -C, and -E modestly regulate specific genes (8La Teana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C. Gualerzi C.O.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and CspE binds to DNA and mRNA in transcription complexes (20Hanna M. Liu K. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5583-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is not known which of these activities comprises the essential function(s) of the Csp proteins. The crystal structures of several Csps indicates that they are OB-fold proteins composed of five anti-parallel β-strands that form a β-barrel (22Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For B. subtilis CspB, dimers are formed between two anti-parallel CspB molecules through interactions between the β4-β4 and β4-N terminus (23Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrier M. Willimsky G. Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A.

A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 25Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that 3 additional amino acids at the N terminus of CspA are responsible for its inability to dimerize (22Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We have studied both DNA binding and dimerization of CspE. CspE binds with the highest affinity to ssDNA containing 6 contiguous dT residues and has a binding site that is about 8 bases in length. In addition, we found that CspE from E. coli exists as a dimer in solution. Based on these results, we present an explanation for the role of CspE in chromosome condensation in vivo. Nucleic Acids and Purification of CspE—Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased as high pressure liquid chromatography-purified molecules from Integrated DNA Technologies. CspE was purified from the E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3 pLysS pCH1). pCH1 contains cspE, from the AUG start codon to 11 bp downstream of the TAA stop codon, in the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET9a (Promega). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an A600 = 0.8. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h, centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 300 mm NaCl. Cells were lysed by passage twice through a French press cell at 15,000 p.s.i. followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 0.1% polyethylenimine for 20 min on ice, centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, dialyzed against Buffer A, and applied to a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. The pH of the flow-through containing CspE was lowered to 7.5 and subjected to a SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. The void volume, containing CspE, was dialyzed against Buffer B (20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). The dialysate was adjusted to 3 m NaCl and applied onto a phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. CspE was eluted from the column by a linear salt gradient from 3 to 0 m NaCl in Buffer B. Fractions containing CspE were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (molecular weight cut-off 5000, Vivascience). The concentrated fractions were applied to a Sephracyl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) column in Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). The purity of CspE was determined to be more than 95% by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. The concentration of CspE was determined spectrophotometrically using the calculated extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 5690 liters mol-1 cm-1. CspE protein and ssDNA binding activity were shown to coelute on the final Sephracyl S-100 column with a constant specific activity across the peak (supplemental Fig. S1). Protein preparations were devoid of DNase activity as measured by the solubilization of 3H-labeled plasmid DNA. Edman degradation reactions (Midwest Analytical) on one preparation confirmed the identity of the protein as CspE (data not shown). Protein concentrations are expressed in molar concentrations of monomeric CspE. Nucleic Acid Binding Measured by Gel Filtration—Separation of CspE, DNA, or CspE-DNA complexes was carried out at room temperature on a 1.5 × 18 cm Sephracyl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) column in Buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol). The column was calibrated using bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease A (Amersham Biosciences). Blue dextran (Amersham Biosciences) was used to determine the exclusion volume. Reactions containing 24 μm CspE and 24 μm ssDNA were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in Buffer D prior to application to the column. The column was run at 0.1 ml/min, and fractions of 110 μl were collected and assayed for DNA and protein using SYBR green (Molecular Probes) and Bradford dye (Bio-Rad), respectively. CspE and ssDNA were run separately as controls. Nucleic Acid Binding Measured by Fluorescence Quenching—Fluorescence intensities of tryptophan were measured on a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer with a constant temperature of 25 °C and with excitation and emission wavelengths of 292 and 349 nm, respectively. CspE (0.5 μm) and DNA template (0.01-1 μm) were mixed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm KCl, incubated at room temperature for 5 min and, subsequently, fluorescence intensities were measured. These conditions were used for all quenching experiments under low salt conditions; high salt conditions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 m KCl. To determine whether quenching was due to specific interactions, 0.5 μm tryptophan (Sigma) was substituted for CspE. Fluorescence titrations were performed as individual reactions. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, was determined by fitting the binding curves to Equation 1 (26Lohman T. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using the Origin 7.5 software. Q=QmaxA-A2-4np[CspE]total[ssDNA]total2np[CspE]total(Eq. 1) where A = [CspE]total + np[ssDNA] + KD, np is the number of CspE monomers bound to one ssDNA molecule, Q is the percentage quenching of CspE Trp10 fluorescence after the addition of ssDNA, and Qmax is the maximum quenching obtained after complete saturation of the protein with ssDNA. The errors associated with the KD are generated by the curve fitting. The binding model does not take into account the degeneracy of multiple binding sites within one DNA molecule, and thus, the results represent apparent equilibrium constants. Chemical Cross-linking of CspE—Purified CspE was dialyzed extensively against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. CspE was diluted to 5 μm and incubated with 100 μm 3,3′-dithiobis-(sulfosuccinimidyl-propionate) (DTSSP, Pierce) or 0.05% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 100 mm followed by incubation for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were separated on a 10% Bis-Tris acrylamide gel (Invitrogen) in MES buffer. The gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by incubation in 0.1% glutaraldehyde and silver staining (Bio-Rad). CspE-ssDNA Binding as Monitored by Gel Filtration—We wanted to reinvestigate ssDNA binding by CspE since many previous reports were carried out at high protein concentrations (200 μm (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)), high ratios of CspE to nucleic acid (between 20 and 600 CspE monomers to one nucleic acid molecule (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Hanna M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), or both (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally, the smallest ssDNA template tested in binding assays was 45 nucleotides (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Hanna M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To lessen the possibility that the apparent binding is due to a contaminating sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, we used low μm concentrations of CspE and equal concentrations of CspE monomers and DNA in these experiments. We first investigated the binding of CspE to ssDNA using a 30-base oligonucleotide, Ybox30 (GATATTGACTTATTGAATAAAATTGGGTAA). This sequence is from the λ PR′ promoter and has been shown to contain a binding site for CspE (20Hanna M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CspE-Ybox30 interactions were demonstrated using gel filtration column chromatography (Fig. 1, A-C). We found that CspE alone eluted with a peak in fraction 30 (Fig. 1A) and Ybox30 DNA alone eluted with a peak in fraction 23 (Fig. 1B). When CspE and Ybox30 DNA were mixed at 24 μm each, protein and DNA co-eluted with a peak in fraction 22 (Fig. 1C). All of the detectable CspE eluted as a single higher molecular weight species, well separated from the position of CspE alone, demonstrating that CspE binds to ssDNA. CspE-ssDNA Binding as Monitored by Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching—Fluorescence quenching of the single tryptophan residue, Trp10, in CspE was used as an independent assay to measure DNA binding. Lopez et al. (29Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) established that the quenching of B. subtilis CspB tryptophan fluorescence correlated with CspB-ssDNA binding interactions. We observed that the intrinsic fluorescence of CspE was quenched by the addition of YBox30, indicating that CspE interacts with the ssDNA. Quenching was saturated at ∼65% by 0.5 μm Ybox30 DNA (Fig. 1D). There was no detectable quenching of l-tryptophan (Fig. 1D) or 0.5 μm N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide (data not shown) by YBox30 DNA, indicating that the quenching of the fluorescence intensity of CspE is due to direct interactions between CspE and ssDNA. Using this assay, no requirement for ATP, Mg2+, or other mono- or divalent cations was detected (data not shown). Sequence and Length Preferences of CspE for Binding to ssDNA—We explored the sequence specificity of CspE by testing the ability of CspE to bind to 15 base homopolymers of (dA)15, (dT)15, (dC)15, and the dG-rich heteropolymer, dG5dCdG5dCdG3, using fluorescence quenching (Fig. 2A). We found that with 0.5 μm CspE and 0.5 μm oligonucleotide, there was about 10-fold higher fluorescence quenching of CspE by (dT)15 as compared with (dA)15. There was insignificant CspE binding to (dC)15 or dG5dCdG5dCdG3. To determine the minimum size of ssDNA to which CspE binds, we tested oligonucleotides of (dT)5, (dT)7, (dT)9, (dT)11, (dT)13, and (dT)15 (Fig. 2B). Because binding is influenced by the number of protein molecules bound as well as the affinity of the protein for the DNA, we initially compared binding as the relative binding competency (defined as the concentration of ssDNA that gives 50% quenching; [ssDNA]0.5 (30Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15511-15518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). The titration curves showed that with respect to binding competencies, the different oligonucleotides segregate into three groups. CspE binds with similar competencies of 0.11, 0.14, and 0.15 μm to (dT)11, (dT)13, and (dT)15, respectively. CspE binds to (dT)7 and (dT)9 with binding competencies of 0.33 and 0.20 μm, respectively. Under these conditions, CspE did not appreciably bind to (dT)5 (binding competency of >2 μm; Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the minimum binding site is greater than 5 bases. It has been previously reported that CspA from E. coli has a binding site requirement for 6-7 dT residues within a 23-nucleotide dC oligonucleotide (18Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and CspB from B. subtilis has a minimal binding site size of 6 dT residues (29Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Max K.E.A. Zeeb M. Bienert R. Balbach J. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 702-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, our observations that CspE binds with the lowest competencies to (dT)11, (dT)13, and (dT)15 could reflect that these oligonucleotides contain more than one CspE binding site. By this logic, (dT)7 and (dT)9 should contain a single CspE binding site and, therefore, the apparent KD could be determined by fitting the fluorescence data to Equation 1 under “Experimental Procedures.” The KD for binding to (dT)7 was 52.7 ± 21.2 nm and for (dT)9, the KD was <28 nm. To examine the quantity and spacing of dT residues required in the binding site, we tested 8-base oligonucleotides containing 2, 4, or 6 dT residues flanked by dC residues. CspE bound to an oligonucleotide with 6 contiguous dT residues with an apparent KD < 23 nm,a KD similar to that determined for (dT)9 (Fig. 2C). CspE bound to an oligonucleotide with 4 dT residues with a much greater KD of 1349 ± 319 nm and had no significant binding to an oligonucleotide with 2 dT residues (Fig. 2C). We next tested the ability of CspE to bind to sequences with variable spacing between the dT residues. CspE bound poorly to CCTCCCTC, TCTCTCTC, and TCCTCCTC with a KD of 410 ± 150 nm, 508 ± 354 nm, and 1794 ± 774 nm, respectively (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that CspE has a preference for ssDNA containing six or more contiguous dT residues in an 8-base oligonucleotide. We next investigated the nature of the interaction of CspE with DNA. Previous work with B. subtilis CspB showed that CspB binds to dC homopolymers through interactions that are disrupted by 1 m NaCl, whereas it binds to dT homopolymers in a salt-independent manner (29Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the majority of the salt-sensitive interactions were electrostatic in nature, whereas the salt-resistant interactions were thought to be via hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and/or hydrophobic interactions (29Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike B. subtilis CspB, E. coli CspA binds to ssDNA only through salt-sensitive interactions (18Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether CspE interacts with ssDNA through salt-resistant or salt-sensitive interactions, we tested CspE binding to ssDNA in the presence of high salt (1 m KCl). When binding was measured with 0.5 μm CspE and 1 μm oligonucleotide, CspE binding to (dT)9, (dT)11, (dT)13, and (dT)15 was mainly through salt-resistant interactions (Fig. 3A). The interactions of CspE with CTTTTTTC and, to a lesser degree with TCTCTCTC also have a salt-resistant component (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that CspE requires more than 7 bases and 6 or more contiguous dT residues to transition from mainly electrostatic interactions to salt-resistant interactions with ssDNA. We tested whether CspE has a higher affinity for contiguous dT residues over the previously reported AT-rich sequences AATT, AATTT, AATTTT, AAATT, AAATTT, AAAATT identified using SELEX (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We examined the binding of CspE to 16 different oligonucleotides containing the individual AT-rich sequences listed above or combinations thereof (Table 1). The binding to the AT-rich sequences was compared with the binding of oligo(dT) of various lengths and to the 8-base oligonucleotides containing 2, 4, or 6 dT residues (Table 1). With the 16 oligonucleotides tested, we observed between 3 and 55% quenching of CspE fluorescence using 0.5 μm CspE and 0.5 μm DNA. CspE bound all of the oligonucleotides with much lower affinity than the dT-rich sequences, where we observed about 80% quenching with (dT)9 or CTTTTTTC and ∼90% quenching of CspE fluorescence with (dT)11, (dT)13, and (dT)15 using the same conditions. Moreover, the affinity of CspE for a given oligonucleotide did not correlate with the number of proposed CspE binding sites present in the oligonucleotide. For example, there was 15% quenching of CspE fluorescence with two oligonucleotides containing three proposed CspE binding sites, whereas there was 55% quenching of CspE fluorescence by an oligonucleotide containing a single proposed site. In summary, CspE has a higher affinity for (dT)9-15 than for any of the various oligonucleotides containing the proposed CspE binding sequences identified by SELEX.TABLE 1Binding of CspE to ssDNALength of ssDNA (No. of nucleotides)Quenching of CspEaThe average tryptophan quenching ± the standard error of three trials for CspE (0.5 μm) and ssDNA (0.5 μm) as described in “Experimental Procedures”%dT oligonucleotides TTTTT54.3 ± 1.3 TTTTTTT771.8 ± 3.2 TTTTTTTTT985.8 ± 1.6 TTTTTTTTTTT1189.4 ± 7.8 TTTTTTTTTTTTT1389.5 ± 3.0 TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT1592.3 ± 2.9dT/dC oligonucleotides CCCTTCCC812.9 ± 2.6 CCTTTTCC827.8 ± 10.5 CTTTTTTC884.8 ± 1.4Predicted CspE binding sequencesbThe underlined sequences are the AT rich regions reported to be binding sites for CspE (17) (17Phadtare S.

We chose the 10-base oligonucleotide, GCAATTTTGT, because it should contain one CspE binding site. It exhibited 40% quenching of the CspE fluorescence at 0.5 μm of CspE and oligonucleotide, significantly more than the 3.7% quenching seen with the other 10-base single CspE consensus binding site tested, ACAAATTGC (Table 1). Our results indicate that CspE binds with an apparent KD of 887.0 ± 267.1 nm to GCAATTTTGT (Fig. 2C), comparable with the binding to CCTTTTCC, which also contains 4 contiguous dT residues. CspE bound with a much greater affinity to either CTTTTTTC or (dT)9 with apparent KD values in the 30-50 nm range. Thus, 6 consecutive dT residues constitute a much better binding site than the SELEX selected sequences. Finally, we tested binding of CspE to four 30-base oligonucleotides, two containing a Y-Box and two containing an identical sequence except that the Y-Box had been mutated, since we and others have seen binding by CspE to Y-Box-containing ssDNA (Fig. 1) (20Hanna M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the DNA binding domain of Y-Box transcription factors is highly homologous to the Csp proteins in its primary amino acid sequence and secondary structure and binds with specificity to CCAAT (the Y-Box (5Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar)). At 0.5 μm each CspE and ssDNA, we found that CspE fluorescence was quenched about 50% by all four oligonucleotides (Table 1). Thus, CspE does not show preferential binding to Y-Box containing sequences. Dimerization of CspE—We determined the quaternary structure of CspE because two Csp proteins, CspB from B. subtilis and CspD from E. coli, have been shown to exist as dimers (19Yamanaka K. Zheng W. Crooke E. Wang Y.-H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and one, CspA from E. coli, exists as a monomer in solution (22Schindelin H. Jiang W. Inouye M. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 25Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). CspA contains 3 additional amino acids at the N terminus as compared with CspB, and it has been suggested that these 3 residues are responsible for the inability of CspA to dimerize. CspE has 2 additional amino acids at the N terminus, including Met1. Met1 is cleaved from CspE (data not shown), increasing its apparent similarity to CspB and its likelihood of dimerization (Fig. 4A). The apparent molecular weight of CspE in solution was determined using a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Fig. 4B). The majority of CspE (82%) eluted at the position of a 13.5-kDa protein, similar to the predicted size of a CspE dimer (14.6 kDa). High salt (1 m KCl) had no effect on the elution profile of CspE (data not shown). We also probed the oligomeric state of CspE by chemically cross-linking CspE with either DTSSP or glutaraldehyde (Fig. 4C). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that untreated CspE migrated as a 5.9-kDa protein, close to the calculated size of a 7.3-kDa monomer of CspE. After treatment with DTSSP, 17% of the CspE migrated to the position of a 10.6-kDa protein (as expected for a CspE dimer) and 83% migrated as a 5.4-kDa protein (as expected for monomeric CspE). The cross-linked proteins were somewhat heterogeneous, most likely due to intramolecular cross-linking of the 7 lysines present in CspE. Similarly, treatment with glutaraldehyde resulted in 41% of the protein migrating as a 12.6-kDa protein and the remainder migrating as a 5.9-kDa protein (54%) or a 20.8-kDa protein (5%) (Fig. 4C). As a control, we compared the cross-linking pattern of wild type CspE with an N-terminal His-tagged variant. Under our cross-linking conditions, His-tagged CspE dimers were not detected (data not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal extension interfered with dimerization. Together, these results indicate that wild-type CspE forms dimers. We have investigated how CspE interacts with DNA and with itself. We and others have shown that CspE binds to ssDNA (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Phadtare S. Severinov K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5583-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Importantly, we have shown that CspE binds with the highest affinity to oligonucleotides containing 6 or more consecutive dT residues. This high affinity binding site is different from the CspE consensus sequences reported by Phadtare et al. (17Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), yet strikingly similar to the binding site for B. subtilis CspB (29Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The binding site is greater than 5 bases in length and is more likely to be 8 or 9 bases, as judged by the salt-resistant binding to CTTTTTTC and (dT)9. We have calculated that the KD for CTTTTTTC or (dT)9 is ∼30 nm, and the KD for a 10-base oligonucleotide containing a previously reported CspE binding site is ∼900 nm, assuming that only one CspE binds per oligonucleotide. Thus, CspE has ∼30-fold greater affinity for the sequences identified here than for the SELEX selected sequences. It is known that protein-nucleic acid interactions can occur through contacts between the amino acid side chains and the bases, the sugar moiety, or the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA. For the bases or the sugar moiety, the associations would include mainly non-covalent interactions that would be not be disrupted by high ionic strength. For the backbone, the associations would have a significant ionic component that could be destabilized by weakening the charge-charge interactions through increasing the ionic strength (33Record M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). To investigate the mode of binding for CspE-ssDNA interactions, we tested binding under different salt conditions. We found that binding of CspE to ssDNA containing 6 or more contiguous dT residues was largely resistant to 1 m KCl, indicating that a significant component of the binding is from CspE interacting directly with the dT bases (Fig. 3). Because Csp proteins are highly homologous, we constructed molecular models of CspE as a monomer and a dimer, both with and without ssDNA (Fig. 5). A model of the monomeric form was generated using the known crystal and NMR structures of E. coli CspA, the crystal structure of Bacillus caldolyticus wild type Csp, and four mutant B. caldolyticus Csp proteins as chosen by SwissModel (34Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). We have also fashioned a model of CspE bound to (dT)6 based on the recent co-crystal structure of monomeric CspB from B. subtilis with (dT)6 (Fig. 5B). The model indicates that the ssDNA could fit into a cleft on one side of CspE, much like it does in CspB from B. subtilis. A dimeric model of CspE, more likely representing the structure we have determined for CspE in solution (Fig. 4), was generated based on the crystal structure of dimeric B. subtilis CspB (Fig. 5C). Additionally, we have modeled (dT)6 bound by each protomer of the dimer (Fig. 5D). Because the CspE dimers are predicted to be antiparallel, the DNA binding sites are likely on opposite sides of the dimer. How does binding to ssDNA translate into chromosome condensation? Previous studies have indicated that the folded chromosome contains ssDNA. The most direct demonstration of this point is from the in vivo induction of the T7 gene 3 protein. When this ssDNA-specific endonuclease is induced at low levels in E. coli, the cells die, and the chromosome is completely degraded (35Panayotatos N. Fontaine A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3173-3177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further indication of ssDNA regions in the condensed chromosome comes from studies on replication bubbles (36Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), transcription bubbles (37Lee D.N. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 759Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), DNA repair (38Iyer V. Rupp W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and recombination (for review, see Ref. 39Kreuzer K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that CspE binds to active transcription complexes (20Hanna M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in the vicinity of known ssDNA. Thus, there are many opportunities for CspE to bind to single-stranded regions of chromosomal DNA. Binding to ssDNA alone is not sufficient for chromosome condensation. However, ssDNA binding in combination with dimerization would provide a simple explanation for how CspE helps condense the chromosome. If CspE monomers were bound to separated regions of the chromosome, CspE dimerization would bring distant regions of DNA closer together (Fig. 5D). Binding to DNA either prior to or after dimerization would suffice for condensation. A survey of the E. coli chromosome indicates that there are 4662 (dT)6 or potential CspE binding sites in the genome. Calculations based on the size of the E. coli chromosome, which contains independently supercoiled loops, and the persistent length of DNA indicate that proteins that condense the chromosome are only responsible for a 2-3-fold reduction in the volume of the nucleoid (4Trun N. Johnston D. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 55: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). CspE, in combination with several other previously identified proteins in E. coli, would contribute to this 2-3-fold reduction. We would argue that in E. coli, which replicates its DNA every 40 min, can induce genes up to 1000-fold, and is very proficient at recombination, this 2-3-fold condensation could be accomplished by a transient mechanism. In fact, it has been shown in eukaryotic cells that condensing proteins bind differentially to the chromosomes (40Wang B.D. Eyre D. Basrai M. Lichten M. Strunnikov A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 41Ohta K. Wu T.C. Lichten M. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There are some reasons to suspect that chromosome condensation by Csp proteins may be linked to their ability to dimerize. Using the N-terminal sequence differences between CspA from E. coli and CspB from B. subtilis as the criteria for dimerization, E. coli CspB, -G, -I, -F, and -H should not be able to form dimers, whereas CspC, -D, and -E should (Fig. 4A). We have shown that CspE exists as a dimer (Fig. 4, B and C). As expected, CspD, which has perfect alignment of the N terminus with CspB, has also been shown to form dimers (19Yamanaka K. Zheng W. Crooke E. Wang Y.-H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The genetic screen that implicated CspE in chromosome condensation also implicated CspC but no other Csps (32Yamanaka K. Mitani T. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CspD may not have been identified in this screen because overexpression of CspD is lethal (Ref. 19Yamanaka K. Zheng W. Crooke E. Wang Y.-H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, electron micrographs of CspD bound to ssDNA show that CspD appears to condense DNA in vitro (19Yamanaka K. Zheng W. Crooke E. Wang Y.-H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1572-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore it is plausible that dimerization plays a role in DNA compaction by CspE. In summary, we have demonstrated two novel properties of CspE, preferred DNA binding to contiguous dT residues in ssDNA and homodimerization. Further experimentation will be aimed at testing whether these biochemical properties are responsible for the role of CspE in chromosome condensation. We thank U.

Numerous studies demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal five amino acids of the Gα subunits are a major determinant of specificity, however the receptor determinants of specificity are less clear. We have used a collection of 133 functional mutants of the C5a receptor obtained in a mutagenesis screen targeting the intracellular loops and the carboxyl terminus (Matsumoto, M. L., Narzinski, K., Kiser, P. D., Nikiforovich, G. V., and Baranski, T. J. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 3105–3121) to investigate how specificity is encoded. Each mutant, originally selected for its ability to signal through a nearly full-length Gαi in yeast, was tested to see whether it could activate three versions of chimeric Gα subunits consisting of Gpa1 fused to the carboxyl-terminal five amino acids of Gαi, Gαq, or Gαs in yeast. Surprisingly the carboxyl-terminal tail of the C5a receptor is the most important specificity determinant in that nearly all mutants in this region showed a gain in coupling to Gαq and/or Gαs. More than half of the receptors mutated in the second intracellular loop also demonstrated broadened G protein coupling. Given a lack of selective advantage for this broadened signaling in the initial screen, we propose a model in which the carboxyl-terminal tail acts together with the intracellular loops to generate a specificity filter for receptor-G protein interactions that functions primarily to restrict access of incorrect G proteins to the receptor.

Murphy B.J. Pelleymounter M.A. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2004; 3: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GPCRs are necessary for transmission of signals across cell membranes to orchestrate essential processes ranging from cell fusion in yeast to the ability to mobilize leukocytes to sites of infection in humans. The central role of GPCRs in nearly all physiologic processes is underscored by the fact that they are targets of ∼30% of all available pharmaceutical drugs (1Miller K.J. Murphy B.J. Pelleymounter M.A. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2004; 3: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GPCRs are named for their ability to bind and activate heterotrimeric G proteins made up of a Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunit. Activation occurs by transmitting a conformational change in the receptor, triggered by ligand binding, to the G protein. This catalyzes the release of GDP from Gα allowing GTP to bind and trigger dissociation of this subunit from Gβγ. Gα and Gβγ are then free to signal to their downstream targets to begin the signaling response. In humans there are 17 Gα, 5 Gβ, and 12 Gγ subunits (2Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1159-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The Gα subunits are classified by the type of downstream effectors that they signal to and the responses they evoke and can divided into four families: Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13 (3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 4Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Gαs subunits stimulate adenylyl cyclase, whereas Gαi subunits inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Gαq subunits signal through phospholipase C, and Gα12/13 activates various Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Given that a single cell may express many different G proteins and GPCRs, the G proteins to which the receptors couple to must be tightly controlled in order for a GPCR to activate the correct downstream response. Each GPCR signals through only a subset of Gα subunits creating a specificity profile for the receptor. For example, the GPCR that we study, the complement-derived C5a receptor (C5aR), couples to Gαi and the promiscuous Gα16 subunit of the Gαq family, but not Gαq itself, nor Gαs. Despite the ability of many receptors to couple to the same G protein, there is little homology among their intracellular loops, making it difficult to predict which G protein(s) a receptor will signal through based upon primary sequence alone. The nature of G protein specificity has been previously investigated using chimeric GPCRs created by swapping intracellular loop regions between receptors that couple to different Gα subunits. These experiments demonstrate that the second (5Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Nasman J. Jansson C.C.

Specific points of contact between the G protein and receptor have been identified, and these include the amino terminus (residues 8–23), the α4–β6 loop (residues 311–328), and the last 11 amino acids (residues 340–450) of the Gα subunit (25Hamm H.E.

Although several points of contact on the receptor-G protein interface have been identified, only the last five amino acids of the Gα subunit have been shown to play an integral role in G protein specificity. Exchange of these extreme carboxyl-terminal residues confers G protein specificity in both mammalian cells and yeast (32Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

We have used a collection of 133 functional C5aR mutants obtained by random saturation mutagenesis (RSM) of each intracellular region (Matsumoto et al., Ref. 67Matsumoto M.L. Narzinski K. Kiser P.D.

We found that all of the carboxyl-terminal mutants and more than half of the IC2 mutants demonstrated a gain in coupling to Gαq and/or Gαs chimeras. Based on the wide variety of mutations and truncations observed that allowed coupling to multiple chimeric Gα subunits, we propose that the carboxyl terminus and the intracellular loops create a specificity filter that acts to restrict access of incorrect G proteins to the receptor. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains BY1142 (Gαi3), BY1173 (Gαi3), BY1172 (Gαq), BY1401 (Gαs), and BY1404 (Gαs) have been previously described (33Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.

BY1142 contains a fusion of the amino-terminal 41 amino acids of the yeast Gα protein, Gpa1, followed by residues 34–354 of the human Gαi3. The BY1143 strain was created by transforming the BY1142 strain with a URA3 plasmid encoding C5a (pBN444) as previously described (34Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J.

BY1173, BY1172, BY1401, and BY1404 contain a fusion of amino acids 1–467 of the yeast Gα protein, Gpa1, followed by the last 5 amino acids of human Gαi3, Gαq, Gαs, and Gαs, respectively. These strains were transformed with either a URA3 plasmid expressing C5a (pBN444) or an empty URA3 vector (pBN443) and an ADE2 plasmid expressing the C5aR that were previously described (34Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Activation of the C5aR expressed from a plasmid in all strains used leads to signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and expression of the PFUS1-HIS3 reporter gene, allowing the yeast to grow in the absence of histidine. In addition, BY1173, BY1172, and BY1404 contain a PFUS1-β-galactosidase reporter gene. The CT2stop323 truncation was generated by mutating codon 323 of the C5aR to a stop codon using Pfu turbo mutagenesis (Stratagene). The RGS4 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Maurine Linder. Mutants M1–M4 were made by designing complementary oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutation(s), and a two-step PCR strategy was used to introduce the mutation(s) into the wild-type C5aR coding sequence in a pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. All mutations were verified by sequencing at the Washington University Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory. Yeast Transformation and Receptor Signaling Assays—Yeast transformations were done according to standard lithium acetate protocols. Relative signaling abilities of mutant receptors were assayed by restreaking three transformants of each mutant onto histidine-deficient medium containing varying amounts of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) (Sigma) (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm). Signaling levels were compared with wild-type C5aR expressed from an ADE2 plasmid, pBN482, and a non-functional mutant C5aR containing a stop codon in transmembrane helix 3, pBN483, which were previously described (34Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Growth in the absence of histidine was inferred to be dependent on C5aR signaling based on colony color (red colonies lack the C5aR ADE2 plasmid). β-Galactosidase assays were done by treating BY1173, BY1172, and BY1404 transformed with pBN482 with a range of the C5aR hexapeptide agonist W5Cha (GenScript) from 10-10 m to 10-5 m, and the assay was carried out as previously described (35Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase Treatment and Western Blots —RSM receptors were subcloned into a pIRES vector (Clontech) with Gαq (University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center) and transiently transfected into HEK293 cells by standard calcium phosphate methods. Cells were lysed 2 days after transfection in 250 μl of a 1 × sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by shearing through a 27G1/2 syringe. Lysates were heated for 5 min at 50 °C. 27 μl of each lysate was treated with 1000 units of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-maltose-binding protein fusion (Endo-Hf, New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 3 h. Samples were heated for 5 min at 50 °C, resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-C5aR antibody raised against residues 9–29 of the amino terminus. Western blots of yeast lysates were done as previously described. 3M. L. Matsumoto, K. Narzinski, P. D. Kiser, G. V. Nikiforovich, and T. J. Baranski, unpublished observation. Inositol 1,4,5-Triphosphate Accumulation—For Gαq signaling, the RSM receptors with Gαq in the pIRES vector were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells by standard calcium phosphate methods. The m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center) was used as a positive control. For Gα16 signaling, RSM receptors and Gα16 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and transiently co-transfected into HEK293 cells. IP3 levels were measured as previously described (35Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) where cells expressing the C5aR were treated with 1 μm W5Cha (GenScript) and cells expressing the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were treated with 10-4 m carbachol (Sigma). Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling procedures for restoring low energy backbone conformations of the intracellular loops in the mutant C5a receptors were exactly as those described earlier for the WT, including employment of the ECEPP/2 force field, and mounting the loops on the three-dimensional structure of the transmembrane region of C5aR (67Matsumoto M.L.

All possible low energy conformations for IC1 (fragment 63–71), IC2-(138–150), IC3-(224–236), and the C-terminal fragment 300–310, as well as for the “package” of IC1+IC2+IC3+fragment 300–310 were determined by subsequent application of geometrical sampling followed by energy minimization (67Matsumoto M.L.

Final selection of low energy conformations for the package was based on the energy cut-off of 30 kcal/mol and yielded 56 low energy structures for WT (see Matsumoto et al., Ref. 67Matsumoto M.L.

The obtained low energy structures for different mutant receptors were compared with each other by overlapping spatial positions of residues comprising the stems of transmembrane helices (residues 135–138 and 150–153 for IC2) and calculating the so-called “global” r.m.s. values for all heavy backbone atoms of the IC2 loop (residues 139–149). Determining G Protein Coupling of Intracellular Loop Mutants—The 133 functional intracellular loop C5aR mutants were originally selected by their ability to signal in the yeast strain BY1143, which contains a chimera of residues 1–41 of the yeast Gα, Gpa1, followed by residues 34–354 of human Gαi3 (67Matsumoto M.L. Narzinski K. Kiser P.D. Nikiforovich G.V. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3105-3121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of these mutants were then tested for signaling in three different strains carrying chimeras of amino acids 1–467 of Gpa1 followed by the last five amino acids of human Gαi3 (strain BY1173), Gαq (BY1172), or Gαs (BY1401) (33Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H. Watson M.A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to elucidate receptor determinants of specificity (Fig. 1a). The ability to express a single G protein chimera of interest in the presence of a single human GPCR provides a powerful tool for studying G protein-coupling specificity. In the isolated environment of the yeast cell, a single human GPCR can be studied in the absence of other receptors competing for G protein binding, and the readout of receptor activation is clear, because only a single G protein chimera is expressed. All yeast strains used in this study have been engineered so that receptor signaling leads to activation of the yeast-mating pathway resulting in expression of a PFUS1-HIS3 or PFUS1-β-galactosidase reporter gene (33Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H. Watson M.A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, if a receptor activates the particular G protein expressed, it confers the ability of the yeast to grow on histidine-deficient medium or express the β-galactosidase enzyme. To quantify the relative signaling strength of mutant receptors a β-galactosidase assay can be performed or the yeast can be grown in the presence of increasing amounts of 3AT, a competitive inhibitor of His3. The wild-type C5aR receptor was tested for signaling in the BY1173 (Gαi3), BY1172 (Gαq), and BY1404 (Gαs) strains by β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1b). The wild-type C5aR demonstrated dose-dependent β-galactosidase activity when treated with increasing amounts of the C5aR hexapeptide agonist W5Cha in the presence of the Gαi chimera but not in the presence of the Gαq or Gαs chimeras. This specificity profile was confirmed by the growth assay. BY1173 (Gαi3), BY1172 (Gαq), and BY1401 (Gαs) transformants of wild-type C5aR in the presence of the C5a ligand were assayed for signaling by testing their ability to grow on histidine-deficient medium in the presence of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm 3AT. The wild-type receptor demonstrated signaling in the presence of up to 50 mm 3AT with the Gαi chimera but showed no signaling with the Gαq or Gαs chimeras (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Thus, the chimeric Gα subunits demonstrate the natural specificity profile of the C5aR in mammalian cells. Each of the 133 receptors in our functional mutant collection were tested for the ability to signal through the chimeric Gα subunits in the presence of the C5a ligand in strains BY1173 (Gαi3), BY1172 (Gαq), and BY1401 (Gαs) using the growth assay. All 133 mutants that were originally selected for signaling in BY1143 signaled as well as the wild-type C5aR in the BY1173 strain (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Thus, there was no difference in the ability of the mutants to couple to either a more human Gαi3-like (BY1143) or a more Gpa1-like Gα subunit (BY1173).FIGURE 3Signaling of IC2 mutants via Gαi, Gαq, and Gαs chimeras.

They discovered that local dendritic translation of Kv1.1 occurs in CA1 dendrites of rat hippocampal slices and in cultured neurons. This local translation is inhibited by NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic signaling acting through the mTOR kinase. In the October 6th issue of Science, Raab-Graham et al. described two surprising findings. They discovered that local dendritic translation of Kv1.1 occurs in CA1 dendrites of rat hippocampal slices and in cultured neurons. This local translation is inhibited by NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic signaling acting through the mTOR kinase. The regulation of dendritic Kv1 channel expression, and ion channel expression in general, has now been greatly expanded by the exciting work of the Jan lab (Raab-Graham et al., 2006Raab-Graham K.F. Haddick P.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2006; 314: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In their recent report in Science, Jan and her colleagues found the first evidence for local activity-regulated local translation of Kv1 channels in dendrites, a mechanism distinct from that established by the same laboratory for the directed targeting of somatically synthesized channels to axons (Gu et al., 2003Gu C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2003; 301: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Members of the Kv1 family of α subunits form channels that are key and dynamic determinants of the excitability of mammalian axons and nerve terminals (Dodson and Forsythe, 2004Dodson P.D. Forsythe I.D. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), such that immunostaining for Kv1 α subunits is most obvious in axonal tracts and terminal fields (Trimmer and Rhodes, 2004Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 477-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Moreover, the function of axonal Kv1 channels is tightly regulated by intracellular trafficking determinants, restricted localization at precise subdomains of the axonal membrane (Wang et al., 1994Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4588-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modulation through diverse cell signaling pathways (Dodson and Forsythe, 2004Dodson P.D. Forsythe I.D. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that Kv1 channels also play an important role in dendrites of certain neurons (e.g., hippocampal CA1 and neocortical pyramidal neurons), as the channels that underlie the rapidly activating and slowly inactivating dendritic D-type Kv current (Yuan and Chen, 2006Yuan L.L. Chen X. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 78: 374-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Less is known of the mechanisms responsible for dendritic Kv1 channel expression, localization, and function. In Raab-Graham et al.'s recent report, they find a remarkable link between NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic activity and a reduction in Kv1.1 protein levels in dendrites. They then provide compelling data showing that this occurs through an unexpected mechanism, the mTOR-mediated suppression of dendritic Kv1.1 translation (Figure 1). Using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, they observed that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian Target of Rapamycin kinase (mTOR), led to increased Kv1.1 protein levels in stratum radiatum of hippocampal CA1, which contains the dendrites of the CA1 pyramidal cells. They observed similar increases in punctate structures in dendrites, but not axons, of rapamycin-treated dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures. The mTOR pathway has been implicated in certain forms of synaptic plasticity through effects on local protein translation. mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of S6 kinase and elF4E binding proteins leads to increased translation of a number of mRNAs via activation of ribosomal proteins and the release of eukaryotic translation initiator factor 4E (Klann and Dever, 2004Klann E. Dever T.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that while mTOR activity is generally associated with increased protein synthesis, it has also been shown to suppress translation of certain proteins (Pirola et al., 2003Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Johnston A.M. Chaussade C. Portis F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15641-15651Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as shown here for Kv1.1. Given the effects of rapamycin on dendritic Kv1.1 protein levels, the next question to address was whether this dendritic Kv1.1 was synthesized locally in dendrites or together with axonally destined Kv1.1 in the soma. Raab-Graham et al. combined sensitive in situ hybridization methods to measure dendritic Kv1.1 mRNA levels with a novel and elegant approach involving expression of a photoconvertible version of Kv1.1 protein that allowed for live cell imaging of Kv1.1 translation. Both endogenous Kv1.1 mRNA and newly synthesized Kv1.1 protein were found prominently in dendrites associated with translational “hotspots.” A unique aspect of local mRNA translation in dendrites is the selective localization of protein synthesis machinery at or near synaptic sites and an accumulation of mRNAs near synaptic sites that have recently experienced strong activity, a form of synaptic tagging (Martin and Zukin, 2006Martin K.C. Zukin R.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). That Kv1.1 mRNA was found at such sites prompted Rabb-Graham et al. to test whether translation of this component subunit of the Kv1 channels, critical to regulating dendritic excitability, could be regulated by neuronal activity (Figure 1), as has been shown for a subset of other dendritic proteins (e.g., ARC; Steward and Worley, 2001Steward O. Worley P.F. Neuron. 2001; 30: 227-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Applying AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist, led to significantly increased levels of endogenous Kv1.1 protein in neuronal cultures and local Kv1.1 translation while simultaneously decreasing mTOR phosphorylation. The mechanism underlying the increased translation was not investigated, such that inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic activity could affect local Kv1.1 mRNA accumulation (which could be measured by in situ hybridization), by increased dendritic targeting or by altering mRNA stability through effects on mRNA binding proteins. Alternatively (or additively), Kv1.1 translation itself could be regulated. In either case, NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity could locally inhibit Kv1.1 synthesis near active synapses, with subsequent impact on dendritic electrical signaling. The work by Raab-Graham et al. greatly expands the mechanisms whereby synaptic activity acutely regulates the Kv channels that are critical determinants of dendritic excitability. Lowered expression of Kv1 channels could lead to a local increase in the EPSP amplitude, a lowering of the voltage threshold, as well as an increase in the amplitude of back-propagating action potentials. The sum of these effects could be an increase in membrane depolarization and enhanced removal of the Mg2+ blockade of NMDA receptors. Interestingly, A-type Kv channels, composed of members of the Kv4 family and prominent in distal dendrites, also exhibit activity-dependent suppression, but in this case through direct channel phosphorylation (Johnston et al., 2003Johnston D. Christie B.R. Frick A. Gray R. Hoffman D.A. Schexnayder L.K. Watanabe S. Yuan L.L. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Conversely, recent studies have shown activity-dependent enhancement of delayed rectifier-type Kv2.1 channels, found on somata and proximal dendrites, through synaptically driven and calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation (Misonou et al., 2004Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory activity acts through disparate protein kinases and phosphatases to impact dendritic excitability via voltage-gated Kv channels. While local translation of many other dendritic proteins is controlled by neighboring synaptic activity, this is the first account of a Kv channel being regulated in such a manner. The implications of this are intriguing given the complex structure of mammalian Kv1 channels. Native neuronal Kv1 channels are oligomeric membrane proteins, composed of four polytopic transmembrane Kv1 α subunits, which are the voltage-sensing and pore-forming constituents of the channel complex, and up to four cytoplasmic auxiliary Kvβ subunits. What would be the impact of the novel activity-dependent regulation of Kv1.1 as demonstrated here on the subunit composition of the D-type Kv1 channels in CA1 dendrites? A wealth of evidence (biochemical, immunochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological) suggests that dendritic Kv1 channels are not likely to be Kv1.1 homotetramers, but instead heterotetramers of Kv1.1 with other Kv1 α subunits. As such, are other Kv1 α subunits coordinately regulated, or is the Kv1 channel subunit composition locally altered as a result of discrete activity-dependent dendritic translation of Kv1.1? Raab-Graham et al. showed that there was no local translation or activity-dependent regulation of Kv1.4 α subunits in dendrites; however, this inactivating or A-type Kv1 α subunit is not a likely component of noninactivating dendritic D-type channels (Guan et al., 2006Guan D. Lee J.C. Tkatch T. Surmeier D.J. Armstrong W.E. Foehring R.C. J. Physiol. 2006; 571: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As such, it will be important to investigate whether Kv1.2, which colocalizes with Kv1.1 on neocortical pyramidal cell dendrites (Wang et al., 1994Wang H. Kunkel D.D. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4588-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) exhibits local translation on dendrites as does Kv1.1. Another interesting question would be to investigate the effect of auxiliary Kvβ subunits on dendritic Kv1 channels. As Kv1 channel subunit assembly occurs cotranslationally in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), coordinated synthesis is critical to subunit composition. As such, we can envision two scenarios, one in which synaptic activity coordinately regulates each of the component Kv1 α and Kvβ subunits in a manner that locally alters their numbers, but maintains their composition. The second scenario is one in which such regulation is restricted to Kv1.1, leading to synapse-specific changes in subunit composition and channel function. A larger question is the impact of the observed changes in Kv1.1 protein expression on neuronal physiology. Raab-Graham et al. provided no evidence that the locally synthesized Kv1.1 generated functional Kv channels. Such experiments will be crucial to understanding the full impact of the novel regulation of Kv1.1 on the functional characteristics of dendrites. These studies also raise questions as to local activity-dependent translation of other dendritic voltage-gated channels (e.g., A-type Kv4, Kir2, HCN, Nav, Cav) crucial to dendritic signaling. Such questions will surely form the basis of many exciting studies in the future."
