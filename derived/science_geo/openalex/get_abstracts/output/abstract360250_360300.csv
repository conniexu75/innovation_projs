https://openalex.org/W2155804510,"Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation."

https://openalex.org/W2044117548,"Protein-RNA interactions have critical roles in all aspects of gene expression. However, applying biochemical methods to understand such interactions in living tissues has been challenging. Here we develop a genome-wide means of mapping protein-RNA binding sites in vivo, by high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP). HITS-CLIP analysis of the neuron-specific splicing factor Nova revealed extremely reproducible RNA-binding maps in multiple mouse brains. These maps provide genome-wide in vivo biochemical footprints confirming the previous prediction that the position of Nova binding determines the outcome of alternative splicing; moreover, they are sufficiently powerful to predict Nova action de novo. HITS-CLIP revealed a large number of Nova-RNA interactions in 3' untranslated regions, leading to the discovery that Nova regulates alternative polyadenylation in the brain. HITS-CLIP, therefore, provides a robust, unbiased means to identify functional protein-RNA interactions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2006711580,"A previously unrecognized subset of human natural killer (NK) lymphocytes is reported. These 'NK-22' cells are selectively localized in tonsil and gut mucosa and, in contrast to conventional NK cells, are poorly cytotoxic and secrete little or no interferon. Rather, they specialize in the secretion of interleukin 22 (IL-22), IL-26 and leukaemia inhibitory factor, all of which have been implicated in the protection of epithelia. The properties of NK-22 cells are consistent with an anti-inflammatory response that may contribute to the maintenance of mucosal integrity. This study identifies a subset of natural killer (NK) cells in the gut that produce interleukin-22, rather than mediate target cell killing. It is suggested that these NK cells, referred to as NK-22 cells, may help constrain inflammation and contribute to the maintenance of mucosal integrity. Natural killer (NK) cells are classically viewed as lymphocytes that provide innate surveillance against virally infected cells and tumour cells through the release of cytolytic mediators and interferon (IFN)-γ. In humans, blood CD56dim NK cells specialize in the lysis of cell targets1. In the lymph nodes, CD56bright NK cells secrete IFN-γ cooperating with dendritic cells and T cells in the generation of adaptive responses1,2. Here we report the characterization of a human NK cell subset located in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as tonsils and Peyer’s patches, which is hard-wired to secrete interleukin (IL)-22, IL-26 and leukaemia inhibitory factor. These NK cells, which we refer to as NK-22 cells, are triggered by acute exposure to IL-23. In vitro, NK-22-secreted cytokines stimulate epithelial cells to secrete IL-10, proliferate and express a variety of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic molecules. NK-22 cells are also found in mouse mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and appear in the small intestine lamina propria during bacterial infection, suggesting that NK-22 cells provide an innate source of IL-22 that may help constrain inflammation and protect mucosal sites."
https://openalex.org/W2087055812,"The promise of engineered T cells for treating cancer has been mitigated by their poor persistence when transferred to patients. Pule et al. now show that dual-specific T cells that recognize an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen and a tumor antigen survive longer in individuals with neuroblastoma. Engineering virus-specific T cells to recognize tumor antigens may improve the efficacy of this immunotherapy in latently infected cancer patients ( pages 1148–1150 ). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directed to nonviral tumor–associated antigens do not survive long term and have limited antitumor activity in vivo, in part because such tumor cells typically lack the appropriate costimulatory molecules. We therefore engineered Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CTLs to express a chimeric antigen receptor directed to the diasialoganglioside GD2, a nonviral tumor–associated antigen expressed by human neuroblastoma cells. We reasoned that these genetically engineered lymphocytes would receive optimal costimulation after engagement of their native receptors, enhancing survival and antitumor activity mediated through their chimeric receptors. Here we show in individuals with neuroblastoma that EBV-specific CTLs expressing a chimeric GD2-specific receptor indeed survive longer than T cells activated by the CD3-specific antibody OKT3 and expressing the same chimeric receptor but lacking virus specificity. Infusion of these genetically modified cells seemed safe and was associated with tumor regression or necrosis in half of the subjects tested. Hence, virus-specific CTLs can be modified to function as tumor-directed effector cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004280138,"Robert Blelloch and colleagues report the use of Dgcr8 knockout embryonic stem cells to identify ES cell-specific microRNAs that regulate the G1-S transition of the ES cell cycle. Dgcr8 knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells lack microprocessor activity and hence all canonical microRNAs (miRNAs). These cells proliferate slowly and accumulate in G1 phase of the cell cycle1. Here, by screening a comprehensive library of individual miRNAs in the background of the Dgcr8 knockout ES cells, we report that multiple ES cell–specific miRNAs, members of the miR-290 family, rescue the ES cell proliferation defect. Furthermore, rescued cells no longer accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These miRNAs function by suppressing several key regulators of the G1-S transition. These results show that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs promotes the G1-S transition of the ES cell cycle, enabling rapid proliferation of these cells. Our screening strategy provides an alternative and powerful approach for uncovering the role of individual miRNAs in biological processes, as it overcomes the common problem of redundancy and saturation in the miRNA system."

https://openalex.org/W2007846880,"Paul Brennan and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for lung cancer susceptibility. In addition to a previously reported variant at 15q25, they detect and replicate a new association at 5p15.33. We carried out a genome-wide association study of lung cancer (3,259 cases and 4,159 controls), followed by replication in 2,899 cases and 5,573 controls. Two uncorrelated disease markers at 5p15.33, rs402710 and rs2736100 were detected by the genome-wide data (P = 2 × 10−7 and P = 4 × 10−6) and replicated by the independent study series (P = 7 × 10−5 and P = 0.016). The susceptibility region contains two genes, TERT and CLPTM1L, suggesting that one or both may have a role in lung cancer etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2003609221,"The diversity of plasma membrane (PM) proteins presents a challenge for the achievement of cargo-specific regulation of endocytosis. Here, we describe a family of proteins in yeast (ARTs, for arrestin-related trafficking adaptors) that function by targeting specific PM proteins to the endocytic system. Two members (Art1 and Art2) of the family were discovered in chemical-genetic screens, and they direct downregulation of distinct amino acid transporters triggered by specific stimuli. Sequence analysis revealed a total of nine ART family members in yeast. In addition to similarity to arrestins, the ARTs each contain multiple PY motifs. These motifs are required for recruitment of the Rsp5/Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligase, which modifies the cargoes as well as the ARTs. As a result, ubiquitinated cargoes are internalized and targeted to the vacuole (lysosome) for degradation. We propose that ARTs provide a cargo-specific quality-control pathway that mediates endocytic downregulation by coupling Rsp5/Nedd4 to diverse plasma membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1984336157,Rewarding and aversive stimuli evoke very different patterns of behavior and are rapidly discriminated. Here taste stimuli of opposite hedonic valence evoked opposite patterns of dopamine and metabolic activity within milliseconds in the nucleus accumbens. This rapid encoding may serve to guide ongoing behavioral responses and promote plastic changes in underlying circuitry.
https://openalex.org/W324535036,"Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing influences development, physiology and disease, but its regulation in humans is not well understood, partially because of the limited scale at which the expression of specific splicing events has been measured. We generated the first genome-scale expression compendium of human alternative splicing events using custom whole-transcript microarrays monitoring expression of 24,426 alternative splicing events in 48 diverse human samples. Over 11,700 genes and 9,500 splicing events were differentially expressed, providing a rich resource for studying splicing regulation. An unbiased, systematic screen of 21,760 4-mer to 7-mer words for cis-regulatory motifs identified 143 RNA 'words' enriched near regulated cassette exons, including six clusters of motifs represented by UCUCU, UGCAUG, UGCU, UGUGU, UUUU and AGGG, which map to trans-acting regulators PTB, Fox, Muscleblind, CELF/CUG-BP, TIA-1 and hnRNP F/H, respectively. Each cluster showed a distinct pattern of genomic location and tissue specificity. For example, UCUCU occurs 110 to 35 nucleotides preceding cassette exons upregulated in brain and striated muscle but depleted in other tissues. UCUCU and UGCAUG seem to have similar function but independent action, occurring 5' and 3', respectively, of 33% of the cassette exons upregulated in skeletal muscle but co-occurring for only 2%."
https://openalex.org/W2067133520,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heritable human cancer-susceptibility disorder, delineating a genetically heterogenous pathway for the repair of replication-blocking lesions such as interstrand DNA cross-links. Here we demonstrate that one component of this pathway, FANCJ, is a structure-specific DNA helicase that dissociates guanine quadruplex DNA (G4 DNA) in vitro. Moreover, in contrast with previously identified G4 DNA helicases, such as the Bloom's helicase (BLM), FANCJ unwinds G4 substrates with 5'-3' polarity. In the FA-J human patient cell line EUFA0030 the loss of FANCJ G4 unwinding function correlates with the accumulation of large genomic deletions in the vicinity of sequences, which match the G4 DNA signature. Together these findings support a role for FANCJ in the maintenance of potentially unstable genomic G/C tracts during replication."
https://openalex.org/W2107742731,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can detect endogenous danger molecules released upon tissue injury resulting in the induction of a proinflammatory response. One of the TLR family members, TLR4, is constitutively expressed at RNA level on renal epithelium and this expression is enhanced upon renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The functional relevance of this organ-specific upregulation remains however unknown. We therefore investigated the specific role of TLR4 and the relative contribution of its two downstream signaling cascades, the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent cascades in renal damage by using TLR4-/-, MyD88-/- and TRIF-mutant mice that were subjected to renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results show that TLR4 initiates an exaggerated proinflammatory response upon I/R injury, as reflected by lower levels of chemokines and infiltrating granulocytes, less renal damage and a more preserved renal function in TLR4-/- mice as compared to wild type mice. In vitro studies demonstrate that renal tubular epithelial cells can coordinate an immune response to ischemic injury in a TLR4-dependent manner. In vivo we found that epithelial- and leukocyte-associated functional TLR4 contribute in a similar proportion to renal dysfunction and injury as assessed by bone marrow chimeric mice. Surprisingly, no significant differences were found in renal function and inflammation in MyD88-/- and TRIF-mutant mice compared with their wild types, suggesting that selective targeting of TLR4 directly may be more effective for the development of therapeutic tools to prevent I/R injury than targeting the intracellular pathways used by TLR4. In conclusion, we identified TLR4 as a cellular sentinel for acute renal damage that subsequently controls the induction of an innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1973240518,"Deciphering the mechanisms regulating the generation of new neurons and new oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, is of paramount importance to address new strategies to replace endogenous damaged cells in the adult brain and foster repair in neurodegenerative diseases. Upon brain injury, the extracellular concentrations of nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysLTs), two families of endogenous signaling molecules, are markedly increased at the site of damage, suggesting that they may act as ""danger signals"" to alert responses to tissue damage and start repair. Here we show that, in brain telencephalon, GPR17, a recently deorphanized receptor for both uracil nucleotides and cysLTs (e.g., UDP-glucose and LTD(4)), is normally present on neurons and on a subset of parenchymal quiescent oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We also show that induction of brain injury using an established focal ischemia model in the rodent induces profound spatiotemporal-dependent changes of GPR17. In the lesioned area, we observed an early and transient up-regulation of GPR17 in neurons expressing the cellular stress marker heat shock protein 70. Magnetic Resonance Imaging in living mice showed that the in vivo pharmacological or biotechnological knock down of GPR17 markedly prevents brain infarct evolution, suggesting GPR17 as a mediator of neuronal death at this early ischemic stage. At later times after ischemia, GPR17 immuno-labeling appeared on microglia/macrophages infiltrating the lesioned area to indicate that GPR17 may also acts as a player in the remodeling of brain circuitries by microglia. At this later stage, parenchymal GPR17+ oligodendrocyte progenitors started proliferating in the peri-injured area, suggesting initiation of remyelination. To confirm a specific role for GPR17 in oligodendrocyte differentiation, the in vitro exposure of cortical pre-oligodendrocytes to the GPR17 endogenous ligands UDP-glucose and LTD(4) promoted the expression of myelin basic protein, confirming progression toward mature oligodendrocytes. Thus, GPR17 may act as a ""sensor"" that is activated upon brain injury on several embryonically distinct cell types, and may play a key role in both inducing neuronal death inside the ischemic core and in orchestrating the local remodeling/repair response. Specifically, we suggest GPR17 as a novel target for therapeutic manipulation to foster repair of demyelinating wounds, the types of lesions that also occur in patients with multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2033455677,"No two roses smell exactly alike, but our brain accurately bundles these variations into a single percept 'rose'. We found that ensembles of rat olfactory bulb neurons decorrelate complex mixtures that vary by as little as a single missing component, whereas olfactory (piriform) cortical neural ensembles perform pattern completion in response to an absent component, essentially filling in the missing information and allowing perceptual stability. This piriform cortical ensemble activity predicts olfactory perception."
https://openalex.org/W2137737168,"The mechanisms by which PGC-1alpha gene expression is controlled in skeletal muscle remains largely undefined. Thus, we sought to investigate the transcriptional regulation of PGC-1alpha using AICAR, an activator of AMPK, that is known to increase PGC-1alpha expression. A 2.2 kb fragment of the human PGC-1alpha promoter was cloned and sequence analysis revealed that this TATA-less sequence houses putative consensus sites including a GC-box, a CRE, several IRSs, a SRE, binding sites for GATA, MEF2, p 53, NF-kappaB, and EBox binding proteins. AMPK activation for 24 hours increased PGC-1alpha promoter activity with concomitant increases in mRNA expression. The effect of AICAR on transcriptional activation was mediated by an overlapping GATA/EBox binding site at -495 within the PGC-1alpha promoter based on gel shift analyses that revealed increases in GATA/EBox DNA binding. Mutation of the EBox within the GATA/EBox binding site in the promoter reduced basal promoter activity and completely abolished the AICAR effect. Supershift analyses identified USF-1 as a DNA binding transcription factor potentially involved in regulating PGC-1alpha promoter activity, which was confirmed in vivo by ChIP. Overexpression of either GATA-4 or USF-1 alone increased the p851 PGC-1alpha promoter activity by 1.7- and 2.0-fold respectively, while co-expression of GATA-4 and USF-1 led to an additive increase in PGC-1alpha promoter activity. The USF-1-mediated increase in PGC-1alpha promoter activation led to similar increases at the mRNA level. Our data identify a novel AMPK-mediated regulatory pathway that regulates PGC-1alpha gene expression. This could represent a potential therapeutic target to control PGC-1alpha expression in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2134554344,"The mammalian visual system contains an extensive web of feedback connections projecting from higher cortical areas to lower areas, including primary visual cortex. Although multiple theories have been proposed, the role of these connections in perceptual processing is not understood. We found that the pattern of functional magnetic resonance imaging response in human foveal retinotopic cortex contained information about objects presented in the periphery, far away from the fovea, which has not been predicted by prior theories of feedback. This information was position invariant, correlated with perceptual discrimination accuracy and was found only in foveal, but not peripheral, retinotopic cortex. Our data cannot be explained by differential eye movements, activation from the fixation cross, or spillover activation from peripheral retinotopic cortex or from lateral occipital complex. Instead, our findings indicate that position-invariant object information from higher cortical areas is fed back to foveal retinotopic cortex, enhancing task performance."
https://openalex.org/W2084543989,"Background There is no evidence to date on whether transcriptional regulators are able to shift the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission events through selective control of gene expression. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate that reduced mitochondrial size observed in knock-out mice for the transcriptional regulator PGC-1β is associated with a selective reduction in Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) expression, a mitochondrial fusion protein. This decrease in Mfn2 is specific since expression of the remaining components of mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery were not affected. Furthermore, PGC-1β increases mitochondrial fusion and elongates mitochondrial tubules. This PGC-1β-induced elongation specifically requires Mfn2 as this process is absent in Mfn2-ablated cells. Finally, we show that PGC-1β increases Mfn2 promoter activity and transcription by coactivating the nuclear receptor Estrogen Related Receptor α (ERRα). Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism by which mammalian cells control mitochondrial fusion. In addition, we describe a novel role of PGC-1β in mitochondrial physiology, namely the control of mitochondrial fusion mainly through Mfn2."
https://openalex.org/W2060669801,"Dopamine is released under stress and modulates processing of aversive stimuli. We found that dopamine storage capacity in human amygdala, measured with 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA positron emission tomography, was positively correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes in amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex that were evoked by aversive stimuli. Furthermore, functional connectivity between these two regions was inversely related to trait anxiety. Our results suggest that individual dopamine storage capacity in amygdala subserves modulation of emotional processing in amygdala and dorsal cingulate, thereby contributing to individual differences in anxious temperament."
https://openalex.org/W2052469687,"The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a critical role for tumour adaptation to microenvironmental hypoxia, and represents an appealing chemotherapeutic target. Silibinin is a nontoxic flavonoid reported to exhibit anticancer properties. However, the mechanisms by which silibinin inhibits tumour growth are not fully understood. In this study, silibinin was found to inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation and HIF-1 transcriptional activity in human cervical (HeLa) and hepatoma (Hep3B) cells. Neither HIF-1alpha protein degradation rate nor HIF-1alpha steady-state mRNA level was affected by silibinin. Rather, we found that suppression of HIF-1alpha accumulation by silibinin correlated with strong dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its effectors ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), a pathway known to regulate HIF-1alpha expression at the translational level. Silibinin also activated Akt, a mechanistic feature exhibited by established mTOR inhibitors in many tumour cells. Moreover, silibinin reduced hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release by HeLa and Hep3B cells, and this effect was potentiated by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Finally, silibinin was found to be a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation. These results show that silibinin is an effective inhibitor of HIF-1 and provide new perspectives into the mechanism of its anticancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W2014867833,"The MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1)/CCR2 (CC motif chemokine receptor-2) pathway may play a role in macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue. Here we investigated the role of CCR2 in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages into obese adipose tissue in vitro and in vivo. Using the TAXIScan device, which can measure quantitatively the directionality and velocity of cell migration at time lapse intervals in vitro, we demonstrated that bone marrow cells (BMCs) from wild type mice migrate directly toward MCP-1 or culture medium conditioned by adipose tissue explants of genetically obese ob/ob mice, which are efficiently suppressed by pharmacological blockade of CCR2 signaling. The number of F4/80-positive macrophages was reduced in the adipose tissue from high fat diet-fed obese KKAy or ob/ob mice treated with a CCR2 antagonist propagermanium relative to vehicle-treated groups. We also found that the number of macrophages is reduced in the adipose tissue from ob/ob mice reconstituted with CCR2-/- BMCs (ob/ob + CCR2-/- BMCs) relative to those with CCR2+/+ BMCs (ob/ob + CCR2+/+ BMCs). Expression of mRNAs for CD11c and TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) markers of proinflammatory M1 macrophages was also decreased in the adipose tissue from ob/ob + CCR2-/- BMCs relative to ob/ob + CCR2+/+ BMCs, whereas mannose receptor and CD163, markers of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, were unchanged.

Obesity is a state of chronic, low grade inflammation; it is characterized by increased infiltration of macrophages, suggesting that macrophages are an important source of inflammation in obese adipose tissue (1Weisberg S.P.

Using an in vitro co-culture system composed of adipocytes and macrophages, we have demonstrated that a paracrine loop involving saturated fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor-α derived from adipocytes and macrophages, respectively, establishes a vicious cycle that augments the inflammatory changes (i.e. marked up-regulation of proinflammatory adipocytokines, such as MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α, and down-regulation of adiponectin) (4Suganami T.

These findings have led us to speculate that macrophages, when infiltrated, may participate in the inflammatory pathways that are activated in obese adipose tissue.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RS504393, a CCR2 antagonist, was purchased from TOCRIS Cookson (Bristol, UK). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Animal Studies—Generation of male CCR2-/- mice on the C57BL/6J background was reported previously (15Kuziel W.A. Morgan S.J. Dawson T.C. Griffin S. Smithies O. Ley K. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12053-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Four-week-old female C57BL/6J mice and ob/ob mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Tsukuba, Japan). Four-week-old male KK mice and KKAy mice were purchased from Nippon CLEA (Shizuoka, Japan). The green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic mice were kindly provided by Dr. M. Okabe (Osaka University, Suita, Japan) (16Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). The animals were housed in individual cages in a temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled room (12-h light and 12-h dark cycle) and allowed free access to water and standard chow (Oriental MF; 362 kcal/100 g, 5.4! energy as fat; Oriental Yeast) except when otherwise noted. At the end of the experiments, mice were sacrificed after a 1-h fast under intraperitoneal pentobarbital anesthesia (30 mg/kg). All animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Committee on Animal Research (No. 0050140). High Fat Diet Experiment—Twelve-week-old CCR+/+ and CCR2-/- mice were given free access to water and high fat diet (D12492, 524 kcal/100g, 60! energy as fat; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) for 20 weeks. Administration of Propagermanium—Five-week-old male KKAy mice fed high fat diet were given a CCR2 antagonist propagermanium (8 mg/kg/day) (14Yokochi S. Hashimoto H. Ishiwata Y. Shimokawa H. Haino M. Terashima Y. Matsushima K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in drinking water for 4 weeks. Five-week-old female ob/ob mice were fed standard chow supplemented with propagermanium (3 or 8 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. Bone Marrow Transplantation—BMCs were collected from the femur and tibia of female CCR2+/+ and CCR2-/- donor mice. Red blood cells were depleted by ACK lysing buffer (0.15 m NH4Cl, 1 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA), and the remaining cells were washed with PBS and resuspended at a density of 107 cells/ml in PBS containing 3! fetal bovine serum (Sanko Junyaku). BMCs (3 × 106 cells) obtained from CCR2+/+ or CCR2-/- donor mice were washed three times with cold PBS, and injected intravenously into 7 gray irradiated 7-week-old female wild type or ob/ob recipient mice. Each recipient mouse received CCR2+/+ or CCR2-/- BMCs. The efficiency of bone marrow transplantation was determined by counting GFP-positive cells in peripheral blood of wild type or ob/ob mice reconstituted with BMCs obtained from GFP transgenic donor mice (16Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). In this study, more than 90! of peripheral blood cells were substituted by GFP-positive cells (data not shown). Eleven weeks after the bone marrow transplantation, the perigonadal adipose tissue was harvested and analyzed. Histological Analysis—The perigonadal adipose tissue was fixed with neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. An immunohistochemical study was carried out using 5-μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections for the macrophage marker F4/80 as previously described (5Suganami T. Mieda T. Itoh M. Shimoda Y. Kamei Y.

The number of F4/80-positive cells was counted in a blinded fashion through the microscope with a ×400 objective and an eye-piece grid indicating a 0.0625-mm2 field of view. More than 100 serial fields were examined, and the data were expressed as the mean number/mm2. Blood Parameter Analysis—Blood was sampled from the tail vein of mice. Blood glucose was measured as previously described (19Kouyama R. Suganami T. Nishida J. Tanaka M. Toyoda T. Kiso M. Chiwata T. Miyamoto Y. Yoshimasa Y. Fukamizu A. Horiuchi M. Hirata Y. Ogawa Y. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Preparation of Conditioned Medium—The perigonadal adipose tissue was harvested aseptically from 14-week-old female C57BL/6J wild type mice and ob/ob mice as previously described (20Flachs P.

Kato H. Sugita S. Takeya M. Suganami T. Ogawa Y. Obesity (Silver Spring). 2008; 16: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Half of the adipose tissue was minced and then cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1! bovine serum albumin. The supernatants thus obtained were used for chemotaxis assay. The culture medium was used as a control. Cell Culture—The CCR2 expression vector was constructed by ligating the full-length mouse CCR2 cDNA into the XhoI-NotI site of BCMGSNeo vector and transfected into Jurkat cells using FuGENE-HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Jurkat cells stably expressing CCR2 (CCR2-Jurkat) were obtained by selecting with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). CCR2-Jurkat was maintained in RPMI (Nacalai Tesque) containing 10! fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaille, France) and antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5! CO2, 95! air atmosphere. BMCs were collected from the femur and tibia, suspended to 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, and kept at 37 °C before use. Real Time Horizontal Chemotaxis Assay Using TAXIScan—Chemotaxis of CCR2-Jurkat and BMCs was examined using the TAXIScan device (ECI, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) (22Kanegasaki S. Nomura Y. Nitta N. Akiyama S. Tamatani T. Goshoh Y. Yoshida T. Sato T. Kikuchi Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 282: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Nitta N. Tsuchiya T. Yamauchi A. Tamatani T. Kanegasaki S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 320: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CCR2-Jurkat was injected into one of two compartments through a hole connected to the compartment. To adjust the position of the cells, the medium was drawn out from the other hole provided for the other compartment. Drawing was stopped when cells were aligned in the channel close to the edge. One microliter of chemoattractant solution was injected into the other compartment to initiate chemotaxis and monitoring. Cell migration at 37 °C was recorded every 1 min for 30 min, and the migration pathway was recorded by clicking each cell on a display. The directionality of migration is expressed as the angle (radian) toward the concentration gradient (i.e. π/2 indicates that the cell is migrating toward the concentration gradient, whereas radian -π/2 indicates that the cell is migrating against the gradient). The velocity of cell migration is expressed as μm/s. The average directionality and velocity of migration were calculated by the values obtained every 1 min (Fig. S1) (23Nitta N. Tsuchiya T. Yamauchi A. Tamatani T. Kanegasaki S. J. Immunol. Methods. 2007; 320: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Nishio M. Watanabe K. Sasaki J. Taya C. Takasuga S. Iizuka R. Balla T.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirmed that CCR2-Jurkat migrate dose-dependently toward recombinant mouse MCP-1; 100 nm was most effective to induce chemotaxis (Fig. S2), which is consistent with a previous report (25Terashima Y. Onai N. Murai M. Enomoto M. Poonpiriya V. Hamada T. Motomura K. Suwa M. Ezaki T. Haga T. Kanegasaki S. Matsushima K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, 100 nm recombinant MCP-1 was used for further analysis. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System using TAQMAN® or SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers used were described in supplemental Table 1. Levels of mRNA were normalized to those of housekeeping gene 36B4 mRNA. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The MCP-1 concentrations in culture medium conditioned by adipose tissue explants were determined by the commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, NM). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—BMCs were harvested from the femur and tibia of CCR2+/+ or CCR2-/- mice, and mononuclear cells were separated by HISTOPAQUE (Sigma). Cells were incubated with Fc receptor-blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cells were then stained in staining buffer (PBS containing 0.1! bovine serum albumin and 5 mm EDTA) using fluorochrome-conjugated combinations of the following antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD11c (BD Biosciences). After washing twice with the staining buffer, flow cytometry was performed on EPICS ALTRA (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Macrophage Infiltration in CCR2+/+ and CCR2-/- Mice with High Fat Diet-induced Obesity—To investigate the role of CCR2 in macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue, we examined the response of CCR2+/+ and CCR2-/- mice to a high fat diet. Although there was no significant change in body weight between the genotypes, the weight of perigonadal adipose tissue was even increased in CCR2-/- mice relative to CCR2+/+ mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Histological examination revealed that the number of F4/80-positive cells in the adipose tissue is markedly reduced in CCR2-/- mice relative to CCR2+/+ mice (Fig. 1C; p < 0.01). We found that CCR2-/- mice have significantly lower blood glucose levels than CCR2+/+ mice 20 weeks after the high fat diet feeding (280.25 ± 29.09 mg/dl versus 193.33 ± 15.62 mg/dl; p < 0.05). These observations are consistent with the previous report on reduced macrophage infiltration in CCR2-/- mice fed a high fat diet during the course of obesity (8Weisberg S.P. Hunter D. Huber R. Lemieux J. Slaymaker S. Vaddi K. Charo I. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis of BMCs toward MCP-1 and Obese Adipose Tissue-conditioned Medium—It has been reported that macrophages in obese adipose tissue are mostly derived from the bone marrow (1Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7232) Google Scholar), but there is no direct evidence for the involvement of CCR2 expressed in BMCs. To explore the role of CCR2 in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages into obese adipose tissue, using the TAXIScan device, we examined the real time horizontal chemotactic response of mouse BMCs toward MCP-1 and adipose tissue-conditioned medium in vitro. The BMCs derived from wild type mice randomly migrated with the vehicle or PBS containing 3! bovine serum albumin. By contrast, BMCs migrated directly toward 10-7 m recombinant MCP-1, the dose of which was most effective to induce chemotaxis (Fig. S2). The directionality of migration was abrogated by pharmacological blockade of CCR2 signaling with a CCR2 antagonist, propagermanium (Fig. 2A). We also examined the chemotactic response of BMCs toward the culture medium conditioned by adipose tissue explants from ob/ob mice (ob/ob-conditioned medium). The BMCs randomly migrated with the control culture medium. By contrast, BMCs migrated toward ob/ob-conditioned medium directly and quickly. Furthermore, the directionality of migration was significantly abrogated by preincubation with propagermanium (Fig. 2B; p < 0.01). We also obtained essentially the same results with another CCR2 antagonist, RS504393 (Fig. 2C). These observations, taken together, suggest that BMCs migrate toward MCP-1 or ob/ob-conditioned medium via CCR2. The MCP-1 concentrations in ob/ob-conditioned medium were ∼150 ng/ml (i.e. 20 nm), which are roughly comparable with the dose of recombinant MCP-1 used in vitro (100 nm) (data not shown). In this study, we found that the migration of BMCs is direct toward ob/ob-conditioned medium relative to wild type-conditioned medium, whereas the velocity of migration is not different between the conditioned media used (Fig. S3). In addition, MCP-1 concentrations in ob/ob-conditioned medium were increased relative to wild type-conditioned medium (93.96 ± 8.71 ng/ml versus 150.75 ± 5.02 ng/ml, p < 0.01, n = 5). These observations are consistent with the concept that increased production of MCP-1 is involved in macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue (8Weisberg S.P. Hunter D. Huber R. Lemieux J.

Chemotaxis of CCR2-Jurkat toward MCP-1 and Obese Adipose Tissue-conditioned Medium—Because of the heterogeneity of BMCs, we next generated Jurkat cells stably expressing CCR2 (CCR2-Jurkat) to confirm that CCR2 is involved in cell migration toward MCP-1 or ob/ob-conditioned medium. In this study, CCR2 mRNA levels in CCR2-Jurkat were roughly comparable with those in BMCs from wild type mice (Fig. S4). The CCR2-Jurkat migrated directly toward recombinant MCP-1 at a dose of 10-7 m, whereas they moved randomly with the vehicle alone. By contrast, the directionality of migration was abrogated by preincubation with propagermanium (Fig. 3A and supplemental Movies 1–3, p < 0.05). The CCR2-Jurkat also migrated toward ob/ob-conditioned medium with the directionality of migration being significantly inhibited by propagermanium (Fig. 3B and supplemental Movies 6–8). The parent Jurkat, a human T lymphocyte cell line, expresses CXCR4 (CXC motif chemokine receptor 4) and binds SDF-1 with high affinity (26Maki W. Morales R.E. Carroll V.A. Telford W.G. Knibbs R.N. Stoolman L.M. Hwang S.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2346-2353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that the parent Jurkat migrates toward recombinant human SDF-1 through CXCR4 (22Kanegasaki S. Nomura Y. Nitta N. Akiyama S. Tamatani T. Goshoh Y. Yoshida T. Sato T. Kikuchi Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 282: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, it was unable to migrate toward recombinant mouse MCP-1 (data not shown). We also confirmed that the directionality and velocity of CCR2-Jurkat migration toward recombinant human SDF-1 are unaffected by preincubation with propagermanium (Fig. S5 and supplemental Movies 4 and 5), which suggests the specificity of propagermanium as a CCR2 antagonist in the chemotaxis assay. In this study, chemotaxis of CCR2-Jurkat toward ob/ob-conditioned medium was also significantly inhibited by another CCR2 antagonist, RS504393 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). These observations indicate that migration of CCR2-Jurkat in response to recombinant MCP-1 or ob/ob-conditioned medium is CCR2-dependent. Chemotaxis of BMCs toward Culture Medium Conditioned by Adipose Tissue Explants from Pioglitazone-treated ob/ob Mice—Previous reports showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation suppresses adipose tissue expression of MCP-1 and thus improves insulin sensitivity (27Maeda N. Takahashi M. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Nishizawa H. Kishida K. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y.

We also examined the chemotaxis of BMCs toward culture medium conditioned by adipose tissue explants from pioglitazone- and vehicle-treated ob/ob mice (ob/ob + pio- and ob/ob + veh-conditioned medium, respectively). In this study, we confirmed that MCP-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression is decreased and adiponectin mRNA expression is increased in the adipose tissue by pioglitazone treatment, which is consistent with previous reports (27Maeda N. Takahashi M. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Nishizawa H. Kishida K. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y.

The BMCs migrated directly toward ob/ob-conditioned medium, and the directionality of migration of BMCs was markedly abrogated with ob/ob + pio-conditioned medium (Fig. S6). On the other hand, there was no significant change in the velocity of migration between the conditioned medium used. These observations support the concept that treatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, pioglitazone, reduces the potential to induce macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue (11Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 12Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R. Goforth M.H. Morel C.R. Subramanian V. Mukundan L.

Effect of Propagermanium on Macrophage Infiltration into Obese Adipose Tissue—To explore the involvement of CCR2 in macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue in vivo, we examined the effect of propagermanium (8 mg/kg/day) in KKAy mice fed a high fat diet. Although there was no significant difference in body weight and adipose tissue weight between the propagermanium- and the vehicle-treated groups, the number of F4/80-positive cells was significantly decreased in the propagermanium-treated KKAy mice relative to the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 4, A–C, p < 0.01). In this study, we also found that the number of F4/80-positive cells is significantly reduced in ob/ob mice treated with propagermanium (3 mg/kg/day or 8 mg/kg/day) relative to the vehicle-treated group (p < 0.05), although body weight and adipose tissue weight are unchanged (Fig. 5, A–C). These observations, taken together, indicate that pharmacological blockade of CCR2 effectively reduces macrophage infiltration into obese adipose tissue.FIGURE 5Effect of propagermanium on adipose tissue macrophage infiltration in ob/ob mice.

https://openalex.org/W2082063605,"Background Mature miRNAs can often be classified into large families, consisting of members with identical seeds (nucleotides 2 through 7 of the mature miRNAs) and highly homologous ∼21-nucleotide (nt) mature miRNA sequences. However, it is unclear whether members of a miRNA gene family, which encode identical or nearly identical mature miRNAs, are functionally interchangeable in vivo. Methods and Findings We show that mir-181a-1, but not mir-181c, can promote CD4 and CD8 double-positive (DP) T cell development when ectopically expressed in thymic progenitor cells. The distinct activities of mir-181a-1 and mir-181c are largely determined by their unique pre-miRNA loop nucleotides—not by the one-nucleotide difference in their mature miRNA sequences. Moreover, the activity of mir-181a-1 on DP cell development can be quantitatively influenced by nucleotide changes in its pre-miRNA loop region. We find that both the strength and the functional specificity of miRNA genes can be controlled by the pre-miRNA loop nucleotides. Intriguingly, we note that mutations in the pre-miRNA loop regions affect pre-miRNA and mature miRNA processing, but find no consistent correlation between the effects of pre-miRNA loop mutations on the levels of mature miRNAs and the activities of the mir-181a-1/c genes. Conclusions These results demonstrate that pre-miRNA loop nucleotides play a critical role in controlling the activity of miRNA genes and that members of the same miRNA gene families could have evolved to achieve different activities via alterations in their pre-miRNA loop sequences, while maintaining identical or nearly identical mature miRNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2049087748,"The resting EEG is a dynamic index of cortical activation, cognitive function and consciousness and is therefore an intermediate phenotype for many behaviors in which arousal is implicated such as anxiety and alcoholism. We performed a dense whole genome linkage scan using 3878 unlinked SNPs in a large pedigree derived from a population isolate sample of 328 Plains American Indians. Alpha (8–13 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) EEG power was heritable (0.58–0.27) and stable over a 2 year period (r = 0.82–0.53). Genetic correlations between frequency bands were high (0.75). Linkage peaks for EEG power in all three frequency bands converged on chromosome 5q13-14 with genome-wide significant LOD scores of 3.5 (empirical p<0.0001) for alpha and beta power. A logical candidate gene, corticotropin releasing hormone-binding protein (CRH-BP), was located at the apex of these convergent linkage peaks. CRH-BP was significantly associated with alpha power in the Plains Indians and also in a replication sample of 188 Caucasians. Moreover, the same SNPs and haplotypes, located within the CRH-BP haplotype block, were also associated with anxiety disorders in the Plains Indians and alcohol use disorders in the Caucasians. CRH-BP modulates CRH which influences cortical and hippocampal EEG activity and is the primary mediator of the neuroendocrine stress response. Our results suggest a likely role for CRH-BP in stress-related alcoholism and highlight the use of the resting EEG as an intermediate phenotype for arousal-related behaviors such as anxiety and addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2000267168,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, complications and burden differ markedly between women and men. Although there is variation in the distribution of lifestyle factors between the genders, they do not fully explain the differences in CVD incidence and suggest the existence of gender-specific genetic risk factors. We aimed to estimate whether the genetic risk profiles of coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke and the composite end-point of CVD differ between the genders.We studied in two Finnish population cohorts, using the case-cohort design the association between common variation in 46 candidate genes and CHD, ischemic stroke, CVD, and CVD-related quantitative risk factors. We analyzed men and women jointly and also conducted genotype-gender interaction analysis. Several allelic variants conferred disease risk for men and women jointly, including rs1801020 in coagulation factor XII (HR = 1.31 (1.08-1.60) for CVD, uncorrected p = 0.006 multiplicative model). Variant rs11673407 in the fucosyltransferase 3 gene was strongly associated with waist/hip ratio (uncorrected p = 0.00005) in joint analysis. In interaction analysis we found statistical evidence of variant-gender interaction conferring risk of CHD and CVD: rs3742264 in the carboxypeptidase B2 gene, p(interaction) = 0.009 for CHD, and rs2774279 in the upstream stimulatory factor 1 gene, p(interaction) = 0.007 for CHD and CVD, showed strong association in women but not in men, while rs2069840 in interleukin 6 gene, p(interaction) = 0.004 for CVD, showed strong association in men but not in women (uncorrected p-values). Also, two variants in the selenoprotein S gene conferred risk for ischemic stroke in women, p(interaction) = 0.003 and 0.007. Importantly, we identified a larger number of gender-specific effects for women than for men.A false discovery rate analysis suggests that we may expect half of the reported findings for combined gender analysis to be true positives, while at least third of the reported genotype-gender interaction results are true positives. The asymmetry in positive findings between the genders could imply that genetic risk loci for CVD are more readily detectable in women, while for men they are more confounded by environmental/lifestyle risk factors. The possible differences in genetic risk profiles between the genders should be addressed in more detail in genetic studies of CVD, and more focus on female CVD risk is also warranted in genome-wide association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2078801475,"Cancer metastasis involves multiple steps including detachment of the metastatic cells from neighboring cells, the acquisition of motility and invasion to other tissue. All of these steps require the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we found that the protein palladin, a molecular scaffold with an important function in actin organization, is expressed at higher overall levels in tumors compared with benign breast tissue, and also expressed significantly higher in four invasive breast cancer cell lines when compared with four non-invasive cell lines. In addition, we found that palladin plays a key role in the formation of podosomes. Podosomes are actin-rich structures that function in adhesion and matrix degradation, and have been found in many invasive cell types. Our results show that phorbol ester treatment stimulated the formation of palladin-containing podosomes in invasive, but not in non-invasive cell lines. More importantly, palladin knockdown resulted in decreased podosome formation and a significant reduction in transwell migration and invasive motility. Palladin overexpression induced podosome formation in the non-invasive MCF7 cells, which are otherwise unable to form podosomes, suggesting that palladin plays a critical role in the assembly of podosomes. Overall, these results indicate that palladin overexpression contributes to the invasive behavior of metastatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093500283,"How neurons make specific synaptic connections is a central question in neurobiology. The targeting of the Drosophila R7 and R8 photoreceptor axons to different synaptic layers in the brain provides a model with which to explore the genetic programs regulating target specificity. In principle this can be accomplished by cell-type-specific molecules mediating the recognition between synaptic partners. Alternatively, specificity could also be achieved through cell-type-specific repression of particular targeting molecules. Here we show that a key step in the targeting of the R7 neuron is the active repression of the R8 targeting program. Repression is dependent on NF-YC, a subunit of the NF-Y (nuclear factor Y) transcription factor. In the absence of NF-YC, R7 axons terminate in the same layer as R8 axons. Genetic experiments indicate that this is due solely to the derepression of the R8-specific transcription factor Senseless (Sens) late in R7 differentiation. Sens is sufficient to control R8 targeting specificity and we demonstrate that Sens directly binds to an evolutionarily conserved DNA sequence upstream of the start of transcription of an R8-specific cell-surface protein, Capricious (Caps) that regulates R8 target specificity. We show that R7 targeting requires the R7-specific transcription factor Prospero (Pros) in parallel to repression of the R8 targeting pathway by NF-YC. Previous studies demonstrated that Sens and Pros directly regulate the expression of specific rhodopsins in R8 and R7. We propose that the use of the same transcription factors to promote the cell-type-specific expression of sensory receptors and cell-surface proteins regulating synaptic target specificity provides a simple and general mechanism for ensuring that transmission of sensory information is processed by the appropriate specialized neural circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2022307447,"Background Many of the PE/PPE proteins are either surface localized or secreted outside and are thought to be a source of antigenic variation in the host. The exact role of these proteins are still elusive. We previously reported that the PPE41 protein induces high B cell response in TB patients. The PE/PPE genes are not randomly distributed in the genome but are organized as operons and the operon containing PE25 and PPE41 genes co-transcribe and their products interact with each other. Methodology/Principal Finding We now describe the antigenic properties of the PE25, PPE41 and PE25/PPE41 protein complex coded by a single operon. The PPE41 and PE25/PPE41 protein complex induces significant (p<0.0001) B cell response in sera derived from TB patients and in mouse model as compared to the PE25 protein. Further, mice immunized with the PE25/PPE41 complex and PPE41 proteins showed significant (p<0.00001) proliferation of splenocyte as compared to the mice immunized with the PE25 protein and saline. Flow cytometric analysis showed 15–22% enhancement of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations when immunized with the PPE41 or PE25/PPE41 complex as compared to a marginal increase (8–10%) in the mice immunized with the PE25 protein. The PPE41 and PE25/PPE41 complex can also induce higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 cytokines. Conclusion While this study documents the differential immunological response to the complex of PE and PPE vis-à-vis the individual proteins, it also highlights their potential as a candidate vaccine against tuberculosis."

However, it is rather unclear how marine collagens are degraded because few marine collagenolytic proteases are studied in detail. Deseasins are a new type of multidomain subtilases. Here, the collagenolytic activity of deseasin MCP-01, the type example of deseasins, was studied. MCP-01 had broad substrate specificity to various type collagens from terrestrial and marine animals. It completely decomposed insoluble collagen into soluble peptides and amino acids, and was more prone to degrade marine collagen than terrestrial collagen. Thirty-seven cleavage sites of MCP-01 on bovine collagen chains were elucidated, showing the cleavage is various but specific. As the main extracellular cold-adapted protease from deep-sea bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913, MCP-01 displayed high activity at low temperature and alkaline range. Our data also showed that the C-terminal polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain of MCP-01 was able to bind insoluble collagen and facilitate the insoluble collagen digestion by MCP-01. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Trp-36 of the PKD domain played a key role in its binding to insoluble collagen. It is the first time that the structure and function of a marine collagenolytic protease, deseasin MCP-01, has been studied in detail.

These results imply that MCP-01 would play an important role in the degradation of deep-sea sedimentary particulate organic nitrogen. Collagens, which distribute in skin, scale, bone, tendon, teeth, and blood vessels are the major protein constituents of the extracellular matrix and the most abundant proteins in all higher organisms including marine animals. It is an important fraction of marine organic nitrogen, and its degradation is important for marine nitrogen recycling. Because the tightly coiled triple helical collagen molecule assembles into water-insoluble fibers, collagens are resistant to most proteases except for a limited number of collagenolytic proteases. The mechanism of marine collagen degradation in marine nitrogen recycling is rather unclear because there are only several reports about marine collagenolytic enzyme-producing bacteria and collagenases (1Merkel J.R.

Of all the collagenolytic proteases, mammalian collagenases, which are mammalian matrix metalloproteinases have been investigated in more detail than collagenolytic proteases from bacteria (6Watanabe K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 63: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Studies on the collagenolytic proteases from marine bacteria are rather minor and preliminary. Some marine collagenolytic enzyme-producing bacteria have been reported (1Merkel J.R. Dreisbach J.H. Ziegler H.B. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 145-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kurata A. Miyazaki M. Kobayashi T. Nogi Y. Horikoshi K. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2007; 57: 1549-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The collagenase from marine Vibro B-30 was purified and primarily characterized, which was reported at 1978 and 1980 (2Dreisbacht J.H. Merkel J.R. J.

Merkel J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3596-3599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, there has been no report on the characterization of marine bacterial collagenolytic proteases. The lack of knowledge of marine collagenolytic proteases is a huge holdback on the elucidation of the mechanism of marine collagen degradation. Collagens are water-insoluble fibers and thus a collagen-binding domain occurs in collagenolytic proteases, which has been proven in mammalian matrix metalloproteinases and bacterial collagenases from land (6Watanabe K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 63: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because there is no report on the gene and structure of a marine collagenolytic protease, it is unknown whether marine collagenolytic proteases have collagen-binding domains. Deseasins are a new type of subtilases mainly secreted by bacteria in deep-sea or lake sediment (7Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y.Z. Microbiol-SGM. 2007; 153: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Compared with other subtilases, deseasins are all multidomain enzymes with a polycystic kidney disease (PKD) 3The abbreviations used are: PKD domainpolycystic kidney disease domainPONparticulate organic nitrogenPz-peptide4-phenylazobenzyloixycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-o-ArgSu-AAAN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilideCDcatalytic domainEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein domain at their C terminus (7Chen X.L.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except that the PKD domain of the chitinase ChiA from Alteromonas sp. O-7 was reported to have binding ability to chitin (10Orikoshi H. Nakayama S. Hanato C. Miyamoto K. Tsujibo H. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2005; 99: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the function of the PKD domain of other enzymes has not yet been experimentally proven. Genomic sequence analysis of marine Gramella forsetii revealed that many exported proteins contain PKD domains (14Bauer M. Kube M. Teeling H. Richter M. Lombardot T. Allers E. Würdemann C.A.

SM9913 from 1855 meter deep-sea sediment, is the type example of deseasins studied because it is the first deseasin that has been purified and characterized. The catalytic characters of MCP-01 with casein as substrate have been studied (7Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y.Z.

Moreover, it was noticed that the multidomain structure of MCP-01 is similar to that of some hydrolases capable of digesting insoluble biopolymer, such as celluloses (11Ahsan M.M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5732-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chitinases (8Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that the C-terminal PKD domain of MCP-01 looks like a substrate-binding domain just as those in the hydrolases capable of digesting insoluble biopolymer. Thus, it was speculated that deseasin MCP-01 is probably able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in deep-sea. In this article, deseasin MCP-01 was proven to be able to digest insoluble collagens into soluble peptides and its collagenolytic characters were studied. Moreover, the C-terminal PKD domain of MCP-01 was proven to function as a binding domain during insoluble collagen digestion, and its binding properties, as well as its function in the digestion of insoluble collagen by MCP-01 was studied. Materials—Deseasin MCP-01 was purified from Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 as previously described (7Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y.Z. Microbiol-SGM. 2007; 153: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fish collagen was extracted from Pseudosciaena polyactis with the method described by Song et al. (18Song E. Kim S.Y. Chun T. Byun H.-J. Lee Y.M. Biomaterials. 2006; 27: 2951-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum and insoluble type I collagen fiber (bovine achilles tendon) was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Co., type II and IV collagen from BD Biosciences, acid-dissolved type I collagen (calf skin), elastin (bovine neck ligament), Pz-peptide (4-phenylazobenzyloixycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-o-Arg), and Su-AAA (N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide) from Sigma, and gelatin from Boston Biomedical Inc. Escherichia coli DH5α and pET-22b(+) (Novagen) were used as host and plasmid for the construction of expression vectors, and E. coli BL21(DE3) (Transgen) was used as expression host. Protein Expression and Purification of the Catalytic Domain of MCP-01—The genome DNA of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 was prepared with the previous method (7Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y.Z. Microbiol-SGM. 2007; 153: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment coding for the catalytic domain (CD) of MCP-01 (from M1 to G419) was amplified by PCR with the genome DNA of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913, Pfu polymerase (Fermentas), and two primers (P1, 5′-GCTCATATGAAAACAAAATTATCTATT-3′, and P2, 5′-CGCTCGAGTACCTCACCAATAGCGC-3′). The obtained fragment was then ligated into the NdeI-XhoI sites of vector pET-22b(+) to construct a recombined vector for the expression of CD, which was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The transferred strain was grown on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight. The culture was diluted 100-fold and grown on LB-ampicillin at 37 °C to A600 = 1.2. Then expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, at 170 rpm at 15 °C for 72 h. After a centrifugation of the fermented broth at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The sample was subjected onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibriated with buffer A. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl in buffer A and the fraction with protease activity was collected and dialyzed against Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). Then, the sample was further purified by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow equilibrated with buffer B with a linear gradient elution of 0–0.8 mm NaCl in buffer B and the fraction with protease activity was collected. Its purity was detected by SDS-PAGE with the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of the Recombinant PKD and Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Fusion PKD—A DNA fragment coding for the PKD domain of MCP-01 was amplified by PCR with the genome DNA of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913, Pfu polymerase, and two primers (P3, 5′-GGGACGCCATATGAGCCCACAACCACCACAA-3′, and P4, 5′-CCGCTCGAGAACAACCACTGTTTGAGTGAATGTA-3′). A recombined vector for the expression of recombinant PKD was constructed by a ligation of the fragment into the NdeI-XhoI sites of vector pET-22b(+)(DE3). To analyze the binding ability of the PKD domain to insoluble collagen, the EGFP was used to fuse with the PKD domain. The EGFP gene egfp was amplified with an overlapping sequence from vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) by PCR. The DNA fragment encoding PKD with the same overlapping sequence was also amplified. The two fragments were overlapped by mutagenesis by overlapping extension PCR (20An Y.F. Ji J.F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The chimeric gene was subcloned into pET-22b(+) for the expression of fusion protein PKD-EGFP. Both recombinant vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant PKD and PKD-EGFP were all expressed as C-terminal His6-tagged proteins by an inducement of 0.6 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 16 h, and purified with His·Bind metal chelating column. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the PKD Domain—Alignment of PKD domains were performed by Clustal X 1.83 (21Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35619) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by mutagenesis by overlapping extension-PCR with the vector PKD-EGFP as template. Mutated sites were introduced by the primers with single or double mutation. The mutated genes were subcloned into pET-22b(+) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). All mutations were confirmed by enzyme digestion and nucleotide sequencing. Fusion proteins were all expressed and purified with the same condition as PKD-EGFP. Protein Determination and Enzyme Assays—Proteins were assessed by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The collagenolytic activities of deseasin MCP-01 and its CD against collagen were determined with the method provided by Worthington Biochemical Co. (23Worthington Biochemical Corp.Worthington Enzyme Manual. Freehold, NJ1972: 43-45Google Scholar). The reaction time was 5 h for fish-insoluble collagen fiber and bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber, and 0.5 h for bovine-soluble types I, II, and IV collagen and gelatin. For insoluble collagen, 1 unit equals 1 nmol of l-leucine equivalents released from collagen in 1 h. For soluble collagens and gelatin, 1 unit equals 1 nmol of l-leucine equivalents from collagen in 1 min. The activity of MCP-01 to Pz-peptide was carried out with the method described by Miyake et al. (24Miyake R. Shigeri Y. Tatsu Y. Yumoto N. Umekawa M. Tsujimoto Y. Matsui H. Watanabe K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4140-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity to casein and Su-AAA (N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide) was measured with the methods previously described (7Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y.Z. Microbiol-SGM. 2007; 153: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The activity of the collagenase from C. histolyticum to all of the above substrates was measured with the same method as for MCP-01. To determine the effect of temperature on the activity of MCP-01 and the collagenase from C. histolyticum to bovine-insoluble type I collagen, the enzyme activities were measured from 0 to 80 °C. 50 mm Tris-HCl from pH 6.0 to 9.0 was used to determine the preferable pH profile of MCP-01 in the digestion of bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber. Various metal ions and inhibitors were added into buffer A to determine their influence on the activity of MCP-01 to bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber. Digestion Pattern Analysis of Insoluble Collagen Fiber by MCP-01—Fish-insoluble collagen fiber and bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber were digested by MCP-01 at 60 °C for 5 h, respectively. After centrifugation, the supernatant was assayed by SDS-PAGE with 12.5% acrylamide, and transferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). N-terminal amino acid sequences of the peptides released from bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber by MCP-01 were analyzed with Edman degradation by PROCISE491 (Applied Biosystems) at Beijing University, China. Collagen Binding Assay—Collagen binding assay was performed by adding various concentrations of PKD-EGFP or its mutants into 5 mg of bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber (or insoluble elastin) in 0.5 ml of double distilled water in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 40 °C with mixing and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The free fluorescence intensity in the solution before and after incubation was determined with FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Japan). EGFP was used as control in the experiment. The concentration of the initial and unabsorbed proteins was also determined. Structural Analysis of PKD Domain and Its Mutant W36A with CD—The PKD domain and its mutant W36A was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified with His·Bind metal chelating column. CD spectra of the purified PKD domain and W36A in the same concentration (0.5 mg/ml) in 20 mm boric buffer (pH 8.0) was measured on a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter (Japan) with a bandwidth of 4 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 200 nm/min. Each spectrum was an average of three scans monitored between 190 and 250 nm. The path length of the cuvette was 0.1 cm. The raw CD data were converted into mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol–1) at the entire wavelength using the relation: [θ]λ = θλM0/10/c. Substrate Specificity—Deseasin MCP-01 purified from the culture of Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 was used to hydrolyze some proteins and synthetic peptides to determine its substrate specificity. All the collagens used fish collagen and bovine type I (both insoluble and acid-dissolved), II, and IV collagens, as well as Pz-peptide were all suitable substrates for deseasin MCP-01. For the insoluble collagens from different sources, MCP-01 had higher activity to fish collagen and lower activity to bovine collagen than the collagenase from C. histolyticum. For soluble collagens, the order of preferred substrate for MCP-01 was gelatin > acid-dissolved type I collagen > type IV collagen > type II collagen, and the order for the collagenase from C. histolyticum was gelatin > type II collagen > acid-dissolved type I collagen > type IV collagen. MCP-01 had nearly the same specific activity to Pz-peptide as the collagenase from C. histolyticum. For other proteins, MCP-01 had obvious activity to casein, as well as a slight activity to elastin according to its slight activity to Su-AAA, whereas the collagenase from C. histolyticum had no activity to casein and Su-AAA (Table 1). These results showed that deseasin MCP-01 has broad specificity to various collagens. Moreover, as a marine protease, MCP-01 preferably degrades the collagen from marine animals than that from terrestrial animals. Collagens are the most abundant proteins of marine animals and are an important fraction of marine organic nitrogen. Therefore, it could be suggested that MCP-01 would have high ability to degrade various collagens in deep-sea sediments and therefore play an important role in the recycling of marine nitrogen.TABLE 1The substrate specificity of deseasin MCP-01 compared with that of the collagenase from C. histolyticumSubstrateMCP-01CollagenaseaThe collagenase from C. histolyticum purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp.units/mgFish-insoluble collagen fiber104344456Bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber16085274Bovine acid-dissolved type I collagen136.7113.1Bovine type II collagen67.6157.8Bovine type IV collagen89.397.0Gelatin151.0181.5Casein0.68bData from our previous work [7].0Pz-PLGPRc4-Phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Arg.24.824.6Su-AAAdN-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide.2.94bData from our previous work [7].0a The collagenase from C. histolyticum purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp.b Data from our previous work [7].c 4-Phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Arg.d N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide. Open table in a new tab Digestion Pattern of Insoluble Collagen Fiber by MCP-01—The digestion pattern of fish and bovine-insoluble collagen fiber by MCP-01 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After a 5-h digestion by MCP-01 at 60 °C, all fish-insoluble collagen fiber in the tube disappeared, whereas those in the control tubes without MCP-01 had only a little decrease. No peptide could be detected from the digestion solution of fish collagen by 12.5% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), showing that MCP-01 decomposed fish-insoluble collagen fiber completely into amino acids and small peptides lower than 10 kDa. As for bovine type I collagen fiber, after a 5-h digestion, almost all the collagen fiber in the tube with MCP-01 disappeared, whereas the fiber in the control tube without MCP-01 had no visible change. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a large amount of soluble peptides with molecular mass lower than 100 kDa were released from bovine collagen digestion by MCP-01 (Fig. 1B). These results further showed that MCP-01, as a marine collagenolytic protease, preferably decomposed fish collagen more than bovine collagen. Because the sequences of chain α1 and chain α2 of bovine type I collagen were clear, we tried to determine the cleavage sites of MCP-01 on them. The peptides released from bovine collagen were separated in SDS-PAGE and submitted to N-terminal sequence analysis. Finally, the N-terminal sequences of 6 released peptides in the peptide bands in SDS-PAGE were determined (Fig. 1B). A time course analysis of the digestion pattern of bovine type I collagen fiber by MCP-01 showed that the peptide with the N-terminal sequence of SGLDG and molecular mass of about 58 kDa was preferentially derived during the digestion (Fig. 1B). According to the determined N-terminal sequences, 37 possible cleavage sites of MCP-01 on type I collagen chain α1 and chain α2 were deduced (Fig. 2), suggesting that MCP-01 had various but specific cleavage sites on type I collagen fiber. This digestion pattern was similar to that of other bacterial collagenolytic enzymes (28Okamoto M. Yonejima Y. Tsujimoto Y. Suzuki Y. Watanabe K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 57: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but different from that of the mammalian collagenases. Mammalian collagenases only had one specific cleavage site on collagens to produce three-quarter and one-quarter fragments (29Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Rawling N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, London2004: 472-480Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The possible cleavage sites of deseasin MCP-01 on bovine collagen chain α1 (A) and chain α2 (B) deduced according to the N-terminal sequences of 6 released peptides from bovine-insoluble type I collagen by MCP-01.

The N-terminal sequences determined are shown in bold letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Temperature and pH on the Collagenolytic Activity of MCP-01—With bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber as substrate, MCP-01 was most active at 60 °C, and kept 12.4% of the highest activity at 0 °C. In contrast, the collagenase from C. histolyticum was most active at 50 °C, and almost no activity at 0 °C could be detected (Fig. 3A). This showed that, as a cold-adapted enzyme from a deep-sea psychrotolerant bacterium, MCP-01 has high activity at low temperature to be adapted to the cold environment. Cold-adapted enzymes usually have an optimum temperature lower than 40 °C because of their thermolability. Cold-adapted MCP-01 had an unusual high optimum temperature of 60 °C in the digestion of insoluble type I collagen fiber. Because type I collagen can be converted to gelatin at 60 °C and MCP-01 had high gelatinolytic activity (Table 1), most of the activity of MCP-01 at 60 °C might result from its gelatinolytic activity. With bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiber as substrate in Tris-HCl buffer, deseasin MCP-01 had an optimum at pH 9.0, and over 60% activity remained between pH 6.0 and 10.0 (Fig. 3B). Our experimental results showed MCP-01 had no collagenolytic activity in acetate, phosphate, carbonate, and a broad pH buffer containing sodium citrate. Therefore, the activity of MCP-01 to type I collagen fiber below pH 6.0 and over pH 10.0 could not be carried out. Effects of Metal Ions and Protease Inhibitors on the Collagenolytic Activity of MCP-01—Effects of 13 metal ions on the activity of deseasin MCP-01 to insoluble type I collagen fiber were measured. Among these metal ions, only Ca2+ (4 mm) markedly increased the enzyme activity by 174.1%. Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+ severely inhibited the enzyme activity by more than 50%. Co2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Sn2+, and Mn2+ moderately inhibited the enzyme activity by 38.7, 20.1, 17.4, 11.1, and 10.7% at 4 mm, respectively. Sr2+ and Li+ had a slight inhibitory effect and K+ had no effect on the enzyme activity. As a serine protease, the activity of MCP-01 to type I collagen fiber was conspicuously inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (96.1% inhibition, 5 mm). In addition, It was also inhibited by the divalent cation chelators EDTA (92.1%, 1 mm) and EGTA (73.6%, 1 mm), o-phenanthroline (36.6%, 5 mm), and sodium citrate (71.2%, 5 mm) probably because the Ca2+ in the catalytic domain of MCP-01 was deprived by these chelators (Table 2). These results showed that some metal ions and inhibitors had different and significant effects on the collagenolytic activity of MCP-01, which should be considered in the study and application of MCP-01.TABLE 2Effects of metal ions and protease inhibitors on the collagenolytic activity of deseasin MCP-01 to bovine-insoluble type I collagen fiberMetal ionRelative activity (%)Metal ionRelative activity (%)InhibitorsResidual activity (%)2 mm4 mm2 mm4 mm1 mm5 mmControl100100Mn2+85.789.3Control100100Li+86.294.5Fe2+51.444.6PMSFaPMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SC, sodium citrate; o-P, o-phenanthroline.9.03.9K+100.4100.2Co2+71.861.3EDTA7.911.6Mg2+79.479.9Ni2+40.831.2EGTA26.458.9Ca2+249.4274.1Zn2+31.224.1SC43.628.8Sr2+92.298.7Cu2+45.237.4o-P69.363.4Ba2+90.382.6Sn2+99.188.9a PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SC, sodium citr"

Given that many organisms also contain several profilin isoforms, specific formin/profilin pairs might be matched to optimally stimulate actin polymerization. We utilized a combination of bulk actin polymerization and single filament total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy assays to measure the effect of different profilin isoforms on the actin assembly properties of the cytokinesis formins from fission yeast (Cdc12p) and the nematode worm (CYK-1). We discovered that Cdc12p only effectively utilizes the single fission yeast profilin isoform SpPRF. Conversely, CYK-1 prefers the essential worm cytokinesis profilin CePFN-1 to the two non-essential worm profilin isoforms (SpPRF = CePFN-1 > CePFN-2 > CePFN-3). Chimeras containing the profilin-binding formin homology 1 (FH1) domain from one formin and the barbed-end associated FH2 domain from the other formin, revealed that both the FH1 and FH2 domains help confer profilin isoform specialization. Although the Cdc12p and CYK-1 FH1 domains cannot differentiate between profilin isoforms in the absence of actin, formin FH1 domains appear to preferentially select specific isoforms of profilin-actin. Surprisingly, analysis of profilin point mutants revealed that differences in highly conserved residues in both the poly-l-proline and actin binding regions of profilin do not explain their differential utilization by formin. Therefore, rapid formin-mediated elongation of profilin-actin depends upon favorable interactions of profilin-actin with the FH1 domain as well as the barbed-end associated FH2 domain. Specific formin FH1FH2 domains are tailored to optimally utilize actin bound to particular profilin isoforms.

Specific formin FH1FH2 domains are tailored to optimally utilize actin bound to particular profilin isoforms. Formin proteins assemble actin filaments for various cellular processes such as division, motility, establishing polarity and adhesion (1Faix J. Grosse R. Dev.

The formin family is diverse with at least 20 formin genes in plants, 18 in mammals, six each in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, three in fission yeast and two in budding yeast (4Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A prevalent model is that multiple formin isoforms are necessary because they are required for disparate cellular processes. Although we do not yet know the cellular role(s) of many formins, the nematode worm C. elegans formin CYK-1 and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe formin Cdc12p are required for cytokinesis (5Severson A.F.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).The molecular basis for the functional specificity of formins is not entirely clear, but likely involves a combination of regulatory and actin assembly properties. Formins are large multidomain proteins that contain a highly conserved actin assembly formin homology 2 (FH2) 2The abbreviations used are: FH, formin homology; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; OG, OR Green; PLP, poly-l-proline; DTT, dithiothreitol.2The abbreviations used are: FH, formin homology; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; OG, OR Green; PLP, poly-l-proline; DTT, dithiothreitol. domain and associated proline-rich profilin-binding FH1 domain, which are flanked on either side by regulatory domains. Some formins are regulated by auto-inhibition through association of their N- and C-terminal regulatory domains (1Faix J. Grosse R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Activated RhoGTPase binds to the N-terminal regulatory region and dissociates the C-terminal regulatory region, exposing the internal actin assembly FH1 and FH2 domains. The precise regulatory mechanism of many formins is not known, but activation at the right time and place is certainly important for functional specialization.Upon activation, formin FH1FH2 domains stimulate actin filament nucleation and then remain processively associated with the elongating barbed-end and direct the addition of profilin-actin at significantly higher rates than a filament without formin (3Kovar D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of formin-mediated elongation of profilin-actin is poorly understood.The specific actin assembly rates may be physiologically relevant, since the barbed-end elongation rate of profilin-actin differs between formin isoforms by as much as 10-fold (9Kovar D.R.

For example, the budding yeast cell polarity factor Bud6 binds to and enhances the actin assembly properties of the formin Bni1p, but not Bnr1p (18Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Finally, because most organisms including mammals and plants contain multiple profilin isoforms, it is possible that specific formin-profilin pairs are optimally tailored for particular cellular roles. Although fission yeast contains a single profilin isoform SpPRF, the nematode worm has three differentially expressed profilins CePFN-1, CePFN-2, and CePFN-3 (20Polet D. Lambrechts A. Ono K. Mah A. Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Baillie D.L. Ampe C. Ono S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the profilin isoform specificity of formin had not previously been explored.Utilizing a combination of bulk actin polymerization assays and time-lapse evanescent wave fluorescence microscopy of single actin filaments we discovered for the first time that formins differentially utilize specific profilin isoforms. The fission yeast cytokinesis formin Cdc12p exclusively utilizes fission yeast profilin SpPRF. On the other hand, the nematode worm cytokinesis formin CYK-1 differentially utilizes all three worm profilin isoforms (CePFN-1 > CePFN-2 > CePFN-3). CYK-1 elongates actin in the presence of the essential cytokinesis profilin CePFN-1 at ∼60 subunits/s, significantly faster than in the presence of the non-essential profilin isoforms CePFN-2 (∼40 subunits/s) and CePFN-3 (∼15 subunits/s). Furthermore, exploration of the molecular basis of profilin isoform specificity revealed important mechanistic details of formin-mediated elongation of profilin-actin. Surprisingly, both the profilin-binding FH1 and the barbed-end associated FH2 domains of formin are important for profilin isoform specialization. We also found that although formin FH1 domains bind with similar low μm affinity to profilin, the key molecular property of the formin FH1 domain is to select specific profilin-actin complexes. Additionally, the formin FH2 domain plays a previously undetected role in the assembly of profilin-actin. The formin FH2 may make a critically important association with profilin (or the profilin-actin complex) that is necessary for either the favorable addition of profilin-actin monomers to formin-associated barbed-ends or for the subsequent dissociation of profilin from the barbed-end. Interestingly, profilin residues required for binding to either poly-l-proline or actin do not seem to dictate differential utilization by specific formin isoforms. Therefore, both the FH1 and FH2 domains contribute to rapid formin-mediated elongation of profilin-actin, and assembly of actin bound to different profilin isoforms may help tune each formin for specific cellular tasks.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—Bacterial expression constructs for formin (FH1FH2) and formin (FH2) domains have been described: 1) FH1FH2Sp; pET21a-cdc12(882-1390)-HIS (11Kovar D.R.

The concentration of FH1Ce and FH1Sp were determined from the A205.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—For spontaneous assembly, seeded assembly, and critical concentration assays, actin assembly was measured from the fluorescence of 10-20% pyrene-actin (excitation at 364 nm and emission at 407 nm) with Spectramax Gemini XPS (Molecular Devices) and Safire2 (Tecan) fluorescent plate readers as described in detail previously (12Neidt E.M.

Plots of the dependence of the concentration of bound profilin on the concentration of PLP or formin (FH1) were fit with a quadratic function.Microscopy of Fluorescently Labeled Filaments—Products of spontaneous assembly reactions were examined by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (10Kovar D.R.

We investigated the effect of various profilin isoforms on actin assembly in the presence of Cdc12p (7Chang F. Drubin D. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and CYK-1 (5Severson A.F. Baillie D.L. Bowerman B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2066-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), formin proteins required for cytokinesis in fission yeast and the nematode worm embryo. Fission yeast has a single profilin SpPRF, whereas the nematode worm contains three differentially expressed profilins CePFN-1, CePFN-2, and CePFN-3 (20Polet D. Lambrechts A. Ono K. Mah A. Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Baillie D.L. Ampe C. Ono S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CePFN-1 is required for cytokinesis of the nematode worm early embryo, while CePFN-2 and CePFN-3 are nonessential (5Severson A.F. Baillie D.L. Bowerman B. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2066-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Polet D. Lambrechts A. Ono K. Mah A. Peelman F. Vandekerckhove J. Baillie D.L. Ampe C. Ono S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 14-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In the absence of formin, all four profilin isoforms inhibit spontaneous actin filament nucleation (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Plots of the dependence of the actin assembly rate on the concentration of profilin reveal equilibrium dissociation constants of profilin for Mg-ATP muscle actin monomers of 0.8, 0.08, 0.08, and 0.05 μm for SpPRF, CePFN-1, CePFN-2, and CePFN-3 (supplemental Fig. S1B).We began investigating formin/profilin isoform specialization by comparing the effect of SpPRF, CePFN-1, CePFN-2, and CePFN-3 on the rate of spontaneous actin monomer assembly in the presence of wild-type Cdc12p and CYK-1 constructs containing either both the formin homology 1 and 2 domains (Cdc12p, FH1FH2Sp; CYK-1, FH1FH2Ce) or just the FH2 domain (Cdc12p, FH2Sp; CYK-1, FH2Ce) (Fig. 1A). A range of profilin concentrations has two possible effects on formin-mediated actin monomer assembly, depending upon both the formin construct and type of profilin (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2). In the case of favorable formin/profilin pairs, lower profilin concentrations up to ∼2.5 μm maximally increase the spontaneous actin assembly rate, whereas higher concentrations progressively reduce the assembly rate (Fig. 1, B and D; FH1FH2Sp with SpPRF). The biphasic effect is due to profilin enhancing the barbed-end elongation rate while inhibiting nucleation, and because excess profilin competes with profilin-actin for binding to formin (9Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 10Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J.

Cell. 2006; 21: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The effect with unfavorable formin/profilin pairs is monophasic, because all profilin concentrations from low to high increasingly reduce the spontaneous actin assembly rate (Fig. 1, B and D; FH1FH2Sp with CePFN-1). These different outcomes show that formins are molecularly suited for particular profilin isoforms.First, FH2Sp and FH2Ce, constructs lacking the profilin-binding FH1 domain, do not effectively assemble actin in the presence of any profilin isoform (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Second, FH1FH2Sp effectively assembles actin in the presence of fission yeast profilin but not in the presence the three worm profilins (Fig. 1, B and D). Third, FH1FH2Ce effectively assembles actin in the presence of fission yeast profilin SpPRF and worm profilins CePFN-1 and CePFN-2, but not actin in the presence of worm profilin CePFN-3 (Fig. 1, C and F).Profilin Isoforms Differentially Enhance Formin-mediated Barbed-end Elongation—Profilin’s contribution to formin-mediated actin monomer assembly is complicated because profilin reduces the nucleation efficiency while increasing the barbed-end elongation rate (3Kovar D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether differences between favorable and unfavorable formin/profilin pairs are due to their effects on the barbed-end elongation rate and/or nucleation efficiency. We began our investigation of the elongation rate by determining the effect of profilin on the addition of Mg-ATP actin monomers to the barbed-end of pre-assembled actin filaments in the presence of wild-type form"

Our previous work has implicated a role for TEAD-1 in the fast-to-slow fiber-type transition in response to mechanical overload. To investigate whether TEAD-1 is a modulator of slow muscle gene expression in vivo, we developed transgenic mice expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TEAD-1 under the control of the muscle creatine kinase promoter. We show that striated muscle-restricted HA-TEAD-1 expression induced a transition toward a slow muscle contractile protein phenotype, slower shortening velocity (Vmax), and longer contraction and relaxation times in adult fast twitch extensor digitalis longus muscle. Notably, HA-TEAD-1 overexpression resulted in an unexpected activation of GSK-3α/β and decreased nuclear β-catenin and NFATc1/c3 protein. These effects could be reversed in vivo by mechanical overload, which decreased muscle creatine kinase-driven TEAD-1 transgene expression, and in cultured satellite cells by TEAD-1-specific small interfering RNA. These novel in vivo data support a role for TEAD-1 in modulating slow muscle gene expression.

A functionally important characteristic of mammalian skeletal muscle is its diversity in fiber type composition, making each skeletal muscle uniquely suited for a particular function. This property is brought about by the differential transcription of contractile protein gene families during embryonic myogenesis and by the influence of nerve activity (1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 2Biressi S. Molinaro M. Cossu G. Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The structure of skeletal muscle is highly specialized for the generation of force that is required for various movement patterns and postural maintenance. The force-generating capacity of skeletal muscles occurs by means of an intricate organization of contractile proteins into myofibrils composed of repeating units called sarcomeres, the smallest force-producing unit of a muscle fiber (cell). Of the skeletal muscle contractile proteins, myosin heavy chain (MyHC) 2The abbreviations used are: MyHCmyosin heavy chainMOVmechanical overloadTEADTEA domainHAhemagglutininMCKmuscle creatine kinaseWTwild typesiRNAsmall interfering RNAEDLextensor digitorum longusTgtransgenicRTreverse transcriptionqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionNFATnuclear factor of activated T-cellsGSKglycogen synthase kinase 2The abbreviations used are: MyHCmyosin heavy chainMOVmechanical overloadTEADTEA domainHAhemagglutininMCKmuscle creatine kinaseWTwild typesiRNAsmall interfering RNAEDLextensor digitorum longusTgtransgenicRTreverse transcriptionqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionNFATnuclear factor of activated T-cellsGSKglycogen synthase kinase is a motor protein comprising the thick filament of sarcomeres, and it has been shown to represent a major determinant of the unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax) of a given muscle or muscle fiber (3Barany M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). The MyHC protein is encoded by a multigene family that produces four distinct adult-stage MyHC isoforms termed fast type IIb, IIx/d, IIa, and slow type I (or β). Because each MyHC displays distinct biochemical (actin-activated ATPase activity) and physiological (force-velocity) properties, their expression pattern has been shown to contribute to the classification of four primary fiber types named fast IIb, IIx/d, IIa, and slow type I. Therefore, the amount and type of MyHC comprising the sarcomeres of a given skeletal muscle is of functional importance. myosin heavy chain mechanical overload TEA domain hemagglutinin muscle creatine kinase wild type small interfering RNA extensor digitorum longus transgenic reverse transcription quantitative reverse transcription nuclear factor of activated T-cells glycogen synthase kinase myosin heavy chain mechanical overload TEA domain hemagglutinin muscle creatine kinase wild type small interfering RNA extensor digitorum longus transgenic reverse transcription quantitative reverse transcription nuclear factor of activated T-cells glycogen synthase kinase A noteworthy feature of adult skeletal muscle is its intrinsic ability to adapt its fiber-type composition to accommodate functional demands imposed by contractile usage patterns. In this regard, both human and animal studies have reported perturbation-specific skeletal muscle adaptations that involve mass, endurance, strength, power, metabolic properties, and MyHC expression pattern/fiber type (4Booth F.W.

American Physiology Society, Bethesda, MD1996: 1075-1123Google Scholar). Recent inquiries into the molecular basis of skeletal muscle remodeling have provided evidence that stimulation of the calcium-activated calcineurin, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and protein kinase D1 (PKD1) signaling pathways cooperate to modulate the transcriptional activation of slow fiber genes through class II HDAC degradation and the activation of members of the MEF2 and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factor families (5Kim M.S. Fielitz J. McAnally J. Shelton J.M. Lemon D.D. McKinsey T.A. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 3600-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Potthoff M.J.

In addition to MEF2 and NFAT, other transcriptional regulators, such as MusTRD/GTF3, Six1, Eya1, PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and PPARδ, have been implicated in fiber type-specific gene expression (8Grifone R.

In our previous work aimed at identifying cis-acting element(s) that direct βMyHC slow fiber gene expression and mechanical overload (MOV) responsiveness, we delineated an A/T-rich element (βA/T-rich; –269/–258, 5′-GGAGATATTTTT-3′) that appears necessary for βMyHC transgene slow fiber expression and MOV responsiveness (14Vyas D.R. McCarthy J.J. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30832-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By using the βA/T-rich element as bait in a one-hybrid screen of both adult skeletal muscle and MOV-plantaris cDNA libraries, we identified TEAD proteins as the functionally relevant βA/T-rich binding factor. Interestingly, additional experiments revealed specific TEAD protein binding to a subset of A/T-rich/MEF2 elements located within the control region of several other muscle-specific genes and revealed that this binding was enriched during MOV-induced fast to slow fiber type switching (15Karasseva N. Tsika G. Ji J. Zhang A. Mao X. Tsika R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5143-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The vertebrate TEAD genes encode a family of transcription factors that include TEAD-1 (NTEF-1/TEF-1), TEAD-2 (ETEF-1/TEF-4), TEAD-3 (DTEF-1/TEF-5), and TEAD-4 (RTEF-1/TEF-3). All TEAD family members contain an evolutionarily conserved 72-amino acid DNA binding domain (TEAD) that is found in plant (ABAA), fly (Scalloped), and yeast (TEC1) transcription factors. TEAD proteins have been shown to serve a regulatory role by binding to canonical MCAT elements (5′-CATTCC(T/A)-3′) located in the promoter/enhancer region of several cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle genes and by combinatorial interactions with adjacently bound transcriptional regulators and ubiquitous and/or tissue-specific coactivators (16Larkin S.B. Ordahl C.P. Harvey R.P. Rosenthal N. Heart Development. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1999: 307-329Crossref Google Scholar, 17Yoshida T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although most mammalian tissues express more than one TEAD protein during embryonic and adult life, several recent studies involving single or double TEAD gene inactivation (TEAD-1, TEAD-2, and TEAD-4) have shown that these transcription factors serve both unique and overlapping functional roles during embryonic development (18Sawada A. Kiyonari H. Ukita K. Nishioka N. Imuta Y. Sasaki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kaneko K.J. Kohn M.J. Liu C. DePamphilis M.L.

Thus, the regulatory specificity of each TEAD protein during development and in response to various stimuli is probably due to their capacity to recognize a broad spectrum of DNA elements, accessibility to target elements, interactions with various tissue-specific co-activator/co-binding proteins, post-translational modifications, or subtle gradients in their expression levels. To investigate whether TEAD-1 functions as a modulator of basal and/or inducible slow muscle gene expression in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that expressed HA-tagged TEAD-1 under the control of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter. The mouse MCK promoter has been extensively studied in both cultured striated muscle cells and transgenic mice (23Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Nguyen Q.G. Buskin J.N. Himeda C.L. Fabre-Suver C. Hauschka S.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46494-46505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, a 3300-nucleotide region of the MCK 5′-flanking sequence was shown to be sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene at high levels in skeletal muscle, at lower levels in the heart, and at barely detectable levels in nonmuscle tissue, which is similar in pattern and magnitude to the expression pattern of the endogenous MCK gene (23Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that 48 h of MOV virtually repress the expression of the 3300-bp MCK promoter/reporter gene (26Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the latter data, we hypothesize that any phenotype resulting from MCK-driven TEAD-1 overexpression could in part be reversed by 48 h of MOV. We show that a persistent increase in TEAD-1 protein induced a change in MyHC and troponin complex protein expression pattern and contractile properties that more closely resemble slow oxidative muscle fibers. We further demonstrate that increased HA-TEAD-1 expression activated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/3β, resulting in decreased nuclear β-catenin and NFATc1/c3. The latter effects could be reversed in vivo by 48 h of MOV, which decreased MCK-driven TEAD-1 transgene expression, and in cultured satellite cells by TEAD-1 siRNA. These data support a novel role for TEAD-1 in modulating a slow skeletal muscle gene program. Generation and Screening of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of purified transgene DNA into pronuclei of single cell fertilized embryos, as described previously (27Tsika R.W. Exercise Sport Sci. Rev. 1994; 22: 361-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transgene-positive mice (founders) were identified using PCR. Subsequent offspring derived from mating the founders were also screened for transgene incorporation by using PCR. In the present study, multiple independent transgenic lines representing the HA-TEAD-1 transgene were studied, and all lines were maintained in a heterozygous state by continual outbreeding to nontransgenic BDF1 mice. The transgene was designed as follows. The mouse TEAD-1 cDNA containing an in-frame HA tag at its 5′-end was subcloned at the 3′-end of the MCK regulatory sequences. The HA-tagged TEAD-1 cDNA was released from pBluescriptSK by XhoI digest and subcloned into the blunt-ended PstI site of plasmid pBSMCK (a generous gift from Dr. R. Kahn), which consisted of a 6.5 genomic region composed of 3.3 kb of the MCK promoter and enhancer 1, untranslated exon 1, 3 kb of intron 1, which included the enhancer 2 region, and the first 16 bp of exon 2 (28Bruning J.C.

The TEAD-1 cDNA was followed by the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The transgene was released from the plasmid by KpnI/SacII digest, gel-purified, and injected into fertilized eggs of BDF1 mice. The incorporation of an HA tag allowed us to easily make a distinction between endogenous TEAD-1 protein and the transgene-encoded HA-TEAD-1 protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Mechanical Measurements—Force-velocity and power-load relationships on adult (5-month-old) sex-matched wild-type (WT) and HA-TEAD-1 transgenic mice (n = 4–6 mice/group) were determined using Dynamic Muscle Control software (Aurora Scientific) to elicit tetanic afterloaded contractions as previously described (29Sonnemann K.J.

Contractile measurements were completed with the assessment of maximal isometric contraction (Po). Following the completion of mechanical measurements, the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was removed from the experimental apparatus, blotted on filter paper, and immediately weighed. The total cross-sectional area (mm–2) for each muscle was determined by dividing muscle mass (mg) by the product of optimal fiber length and 1.06 mg mm–3, the density of mammalian skeletal muscle (30Lynch G.S. Hinkle R.T. Chamberlain J.S. Brooks S.V. Faulkner J.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 535: 591-600Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar).

The values for twitch and tetanic tension were normalized to cross-sectional area to obtain specific tension (millinewtons mm–2). In a similar fashion, power output (watts) was normalized with respect to muscle mass (watts kg–1) (30Lynch G.S. Hinkle R.T. Chamberlain J.S. Brooks S.V. Faulkner J.A. J. Physiol.

Protein Isolation for Western Blots—For total protein extracts, 50 mg of tissue was homogenized for 30 s on ice in 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1, 2, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), using an Omni International TH homogenizer. For isolation of nuclear protein, the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer. Sonication for 10 s with a dismembranator (Fisher) of homogenates was followed by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 and incubation on ice for 30 min. Membrane fractions were isolated by homogenizing tissues in 1.5 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EDTA), centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, mixing the supernatant with 3.2 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm mannitol, 2 mm EDTA), and centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 min. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and extracts were stored at –80 °C. Protein separation and analysis was performed as previously described (15Karasseva N. Tsika G. Ji J. Zhang A. Mao X. Tsika R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5143-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Experimental and standard bands were scanned and quantified using Multi Gauge software, and the experimental data were normalized by dividing by the signal of the standard. The antibodies used in this study are as follows: TEAD-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), HA (Cell Signaling), Akt, p-Akt, Akt1, and Akt2 (Cell Signaling), GSK-3α/β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p-Ser-GSK-3α and p-Ser-GSK-3β (Cell Signaling), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Cell Signaling), β-catenin (Cell Signaling), NFATc1 and NFATc3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Serca2a (Badrilla), Serca1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Myoglobin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Troponin I slow (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), histone H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IP90 anti-peptide antibody (Abcam), and anti-rabbit IgG (horseradish peroxidase-linked) and anti-mouse IgG (horseradish peroxidase-linked) (Cell Signaling). Protein Extraction for High Resolution Gel Electrophoresis—Protein extraction and high resolution gel electrophoresis for MyHC isoform separation were performed as described previously (32Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg of muscle tissue of adult (5-month-old) and aged (11-month-old) wild-type and TEAD-1 Tg mice was processed, and 0.75 μg of total protein was separated on an 8% acrylamide gel by 104 V for 24 h at 4 °C. The gel was then stained with SilverSNAP stain (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Animal Care and MOV Surgical Procedure—The imposition of a mechanical overload (bilateral) on the fast twitch plantaris muscle was accomplished as described by us previously (26Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and approved by the Animal Care Committee for the University of Missouri-Columbia. The animals were housed in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited animal facility. Satellite Cell Isolation and siRNA Transfection—Freshly isolated satellite cells from adult mice were isolated and cultured as previously described (33Cornelison D.D. W. Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Goetinck P.F. Rauvala H. Rapraeger A.C. Olwin B.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscle was dissected from the hind limbs, minced, digested in 400 units/ml collagenase type I (Worthington), diluted in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen), filtered, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were cultured on treated plates (Nunc) coated with 0.66% gelatin unless otherwise noted. After 2 days in culture, 50 nm siRNA mouse TEFD1 (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool) and siCONTROL Non-Targeting #1 were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the protein was extracted after 36 h of incubation and analyzed by Western blot as described above. RNA Samples and Isolation—EDL muscles of adult wild-type and transgenic (RTN12) mice were surgically removed and transferred to RNAlater (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from ∼20–50 mg of tissue from each animal using RNA STAT-60 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel Test Inc). Equal amounts of total RNA from each of four replicate tissue samples were pooled for cDNA synthesis after RNA quality control tests. RNA Quality Control—Immediately prior to cDNA synthesis, the purity and concentration of RNA samples were determined from A260/280 readings using a dual beam UV spectrophotometer, and RNA integrity was determined by capillary electrophoresis using the RNA 6000 Nano Lab-on-a-Chip kit and the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription, PCR, and Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Single strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.02 to 2.0 μg of each total RNA sample using the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conventional PCR for TEAD isoforms was performed using 20 nmol of the following primers for TEAD-1 (5′-AGAGCCCTGCCGAAAACATGG and 5′-TGGCTGTCCTGTCTGTATCAT), TEAD-2 (5′-GGAAGGCAGCGAAGAGGGC and 5′-CTTCACGTCTGGAACATTCCAT), TEAD-3 (5′-TGGACAAGGGTCTGGACAACG and 5′-AACCTTGAGGAGGAGGAGAAG), TEAD-4 (5′-ATTACCTCCAACGAGTGGAGC and 5′-CTGGCAAAGCTCCTTGCCAAA), and tubulin (5′-TCACTGTGCCTGAACTTACC and 5′-GGAACATAGCCGTAAACTGC), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 nm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase per reaction at 95 °C for 5 min at 95 °C, 65 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each for 26–30 cycles, and at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was analyzed on a 1.2% standard agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Approximately 20 ng of each cDNA (9 μl) was mixed with 10 μl of TaqMan® Gene Expression 2× PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1 μl of each indicated TaqMan® gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems) in 384-well plates and analyzed on the 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Primary analysis of the acquired signal data were performed in SDS 2.3 and RQ Manager 1.2 (Applied Biosystems). Outlier reactions were removed after Grubb's test identification, and differential expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method. Persistent Expression of Transgenic HA-TEAD-1 Is Restricted to Striated Muscle and Does Not Induce Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy—Our previous work has implicated a role for TEAD-1 in the fast-to-slow fiber type transition in the fast twitch plantaris muscle as a result of mechanical overload (14Vyas D.R. McCarthy J.J. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30832-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Karasseva N. Tsika G. Ji J. Zhang A. Mao X. Tsika R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5143-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the phenotypic consequences of a persistent increase in striated muscle TEAD-1 protein expression in vivo, we have generated multiple transgenic mouse lines that express hemagglutinin-tagged TEAD-1 (HA-TEAD-1) cDNA under the control of the mouse muscle-specific creatine kinase regulator sequences (Fig. 1A). A comparison of body weight, normalized skeletal muscle weight (muscle weight/tibia length or muscle weight/body weight), or cross-sectional area (data not shown) did not reveal a difference between age and gender-matched WT and TEAD-1 Tg mice. These data demonstrate that an increase in total TEAD-1 protein (endogenous and exogenous (transgenic)) was not sufficient to directly and/or indirectly induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy or to alter the growth rate of the TEAD-1 Tg mice. To determine the tissue-specific and developmental expression pattern of the MCK-HA-TEAD-1 transgene, we performed Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody and total protein extracts isolated from skeletal muscles composed of varying proportions of fast and slow fiber types, nonmuscle tissues, and the heart of adult (5-month-old) WT and TEAD-1 Tg mice. Endogenous MCK gene expression is restricted to striated muscle (skeletal muscle and heart) and is first detected in skeletal muscle at approximately embryonic day 17. In addition, the magnitude of MCK gene expression in adult skeletal muscle follows a fiber type-specific pattern wherein the highest level of expression is detected in fast type IIb fibers, with successively lower levels occurring in the order IIx/d > IIa > I (β) (34Trask R.V. Billadello J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Lyons G.E. Muhlebach S. Moser A. Masood R. Paterson B.M. Buckingham M.E. Perriard J.C. Development. 1991; 113: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, extensive study of the mouse MCK promoter has revealed that transgenic mice harboring a 3300-nucleotide region of MCK 5′-flanking sequence displayed an expression pattern that mimicked that of the endogenous MCK gene (23Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Nguyen Q.G. Buskin J.N. Himeda C.L. Fabre-Suver C. Hauschka S.D.

By Western blot analysis, HA-TEAD-1 protein was detected only in the total protein extracts isolated from adult hearts, as well as adult, embryonic day 17 (fetal), and day 14 postnatal skeletal muscle of all three TEAD-1 Tg lines (4Booth F.W.

The additional HA band that appears in lanes 2 and 3 for transgenic line 4 probably represents a truncated HA-TEAD-1 product due to degradation or a smaller product, initiation of translation at an alternative site, or truncation of the transgene during chromosomal integration at a second site. Moreover, HA-TEAD-1 protein was not detected in the cellular extracts obtained from the brain, liver, spleen, or kidney of TEAD-1 Tg mice (Fig. 1G). Consistent with the broad expression pattern of endogenous TEAD-1 protein, anti-TEAD-1-specific antibody detected endogenous TEAD-1 protein in the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, liver, spleen, and kidney of adult WT and TEAD-1 Tg mice (Fig. 1, B–H). Multiple bands were detected when using anti-TEAD-1 antibody, because this antibody recognizes a common epitope (amino acids 86–199) present in both HA-TEAD-1 and endogenous TEAD-1 protein (Fig. 1, B–H). Consistent with the pattern of MCK gene expression, HA-TEAD-1 protein was detected at the highest levels in the EDL and plantaris muscles, which contain a predominance of fast type II fibers (>90%), whereas comparatively lower levels were detected in the soleus muscle (∼60–70% type I fibers) and in the adult heart (Table 1). Importantly, although HA-TEAD-1 protein was detected in the heart of adult HA-TEAD-1 Tg (line 12) mice, a significant deficit in cardiac function was not detected, as assessed by echocardiography and MRI analysis. 3R. W. Tsika, et al. manuscript in preparation. Since all lines displayed a similar striated muscle-restricted HA-TEAD-1 expression pattern, we have chosen to present only our analysis of HA-TEAD-1 Tg line 12. Since adult striated muscle has been shown to express multiple TEAD protein isoforms, we employed RT-PCR and qRT-PCR to assess whether the mRNA levels encoding other TEAD isoproteins in TEAD-1 Tg line 12 mice would be altered due to a persistent i"
https://openalex.org/W2086189807,"Vertebrate studies show neuroligins and neurexins are binding partners in a trans-synaptic cell adhesion complex, implicated in human autism and mental retardation disorders. Here we report a genetic analysis of homologous proteins in the honey bee. As in humans, the honeybee has five large (31-246 kb, up to 12 exons each) neuroligin genes, three of which are tightly clustered. RNA analysis of the neuroligin-3 gene reveals five alternatively spliced transcripts, generated through alternative use of exons encoding the cholinesterase-like domain. Whereas vertebrates have three neurexins the bee has just one gene named neurexin I (400 kb, 28 exons). However alternative isoforms of bee neurexin I are generated by differential use of 12 splice sites, mostly located in regions encoding LNS subdomains. Some of the splice variants of bee neurexin I resemble the vertebrate alpha- and beta-neurexins, albeit in vertebrates these forms are generated by alternative promoters. Novel splicing variations in the 3' region generate transcripts encoding alternative trans-membrane and PDZ domains. Another 3' splicing variation predicts soluble neurexin I isoforms. Neurexin I and neuroligin expression was found in brain tissue, with expression present throughout development, and in most cases significantly up-regulated in adults. Transcripts of neurexin I and one neuroligin tested were abundant in mushroom bodies, a higher order processing centre in the bee brain. We show neuroligins and neurexins comprise a highly conserved molecular system with likely similar functional roles in insects as vertebrates, and with scope in the honeybee to generate substantial functional diversity through alternative splicing. Our study provides important prerequisite data for using the bee as a model for vertebrate synaptic development."
https://openalex.org/W2072779149,"Spectrins are ubiquitous scaffolding components of the membrane skeleton that organize and stabilize microdomains on both the plasma membrane and the intracellular organelles. By way of their numerous interactions with diverse protein families, they are implicated in various cellular functions. Using small interfering RNA strategy in the WM-266 cell line derived from human melanoma, we found that αII-spectrin deficiency is associated with a defect in cell proliferation, which is related to a cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (first gap phase), as evaluated by DNA analysis and Rb phosphorylation. These observations coincided with elevated expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21Cip. Concomitantly, spectrin loss impaired cell adhesion and spreading. These cell adhesion defects were associated with modifications of the actin cytoskeleton, such as loss of stress fibers, alterations of focal adhesions, and modified expression of some integrins. Our results provide novel insights into spectrin functions by demonstrating the involvement of αII-spectrin in cell cycle regulation and actin organization.

These cell adhesion defects were associated with modifications of the actin cytoskeleton, such as loss of stress fibers, alterations of focal adhesions, and modified expression of some integrins. Our results provide novel insights into spectrin functions by demonstrating the involvement of αII-spectrin in cell cycle regulation and actin organization. First identified at the intracellular surface of the erythrocyte plasma membrane, the spectrin-based skeleton is considered as a nearly ubiquitous and complex spectrin-actin network in metazoan cells (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev.. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Google Scholar).Spectrins are giant extended flexible molecules composed of two subunits (α and β) that intertwine to form αβ heterodimers. Spectrin is normally considered to exist as tetramers resulting from self-association of αβ dimers. Spectrin tetramers constitute the filaments of the lattice, the nodes of which are cross-linked by actin filaments. This spectrin-based skeleton is bound to various transmembrane proteins either directly, or more frequently through two connecting proteins, ankyrin and protein 4.1. In mammals, the spectrin family currently includes seven genes encoding for two α-subunits (αI and αII), four “conventional” β-subunits (βI to βIV) and one β heavy subunit (βV), as well as multiple alternatively spliced variants, each of these species presenting its specific cellular expression pattern. For example, whereas αI-spectrin is essentially expressed in the mature erythrocyte, αII-spectrin is the most common form in nucleated cells.The functions clearly determined up to date for the spectrin network emerge from human mutations associated with diseases as well as from animal models. Numerous studies on red cells, particularly those in hereditary hemolytic anemia, have clearly established its importance for supporting cell shape and for maintaining cell membrane integrity and stability (2Delaunay J. Blood Rev.. 2007; 21: 1-20Google Scholar, 3Gallagher P.G. Curr. Hematol. Rep.. 2004; 3: 85-91Google Scholar). In nucleated cells, the spectrin-based skeleton has been shown to participate in the stabilization or activation of several specialized membrane proteins, as recently reported for the TRCP channels (4Odell A.F. Van Helden D.F. Scott J.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 4395-4407Google Scholar). The direct interaction between TRCP4 channel and spectrin is involved in the regulation of the channel surface expression and activation. One consistent feature observed when spectrin or its binding partner ankyrin are lost or defective, is a failure of interacting membrane proteins to accumulate at the appropriate site. The loss of βIV-spectrin observed in quivering mice with hearing defect is associated with a mislocation of voltage-gated channels from the axon initial segment and the node of Ranvier (5Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 156: 337-348Google Scholar, 6Parkinson N.J. Olsson C.L. Hallows J.L. McKee-Johnson J. Keogh B.P. Noben-Trauth K. Kujawa S.G. Tempel B.L. Nat. Genet.. 2001; 29: 61-65Google Scholar). In humans, βIII-spectrin mutations, which are responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, are associated with a mislocation of the glutamate transporter EAAT4 at the surface of the plasma membrane (7Ikeda Y. Dick K.A. Weatherspoon M.R. Gincel D. Armbrust K.R. Dalton J.C. Stevanin G. Durr A. Zuhlke C. Burk K. Clark H.B. Brice A. Rothstein J.D. Schut L.J. Day J.W. Ranum L.P. Nat.

In Drosophila, loss of β-spectrin led to loss of Na,K-ATPase from the basolateral domain of epithelial cells (9Dubreuil R.R. Wang P. Dahl S. Lee J. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 149: 647-656Google Scholar). In an extreme case, loss of a variant of βII-spectrin in mice led to death in utero (10Tang Y. Katuri V. Dillner A. Mishra B. Deng C.X. Mishra L. Science.. 2003; 299: 574-577Google Scholar).Although the consequences of loss of function of β-spectrins and ankyrins are progressively better explained, the cellular consequences of α-spectrin defects are less well established, except in the context of red blood cells: mutations in the gene coding for αI-spectrin mainly expressed in mature red blood cells from mammals, are associated with severe hemolytic anemia and in some cases with a short survival (11Grimber G.

For the first time we show that depletion of αII-spectrin is associated with a loss of cell adhesion as well as with an arrest of cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against lamin and paxillin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, against p15, p16, and p27 proteins were from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal antibodies against αII-spectrin, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), integrins (α4, α5, α6, αV, β3, and β4), p16 and p21 proteins were purchased from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies against α3, β1, β3, and αVβ3 integrins were purchased from Chemicon International. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against αII-spectrin were previously described (16Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H. Dhermy D. Grandchamp B. Lecomte M.C. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2002; 22: 3527-3536Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—The human melanoma cell line, WM-266-4 (derived from a metastatic site of a malignant melanoma) (ATCC, CRL-1676), was grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine or glutamax, 1 mm sodium pyruvate and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed with siRNA duplexes at different concentrations using jetSI-ENDO (PolyPlus) according to the manufacturer's procedure: transfection reagent dilution (1 μl into 25 μl of serum free Opti-MEM) was mixed to siRNA duplexes diluted in Opti-MEM (25 μl). After 30 min incubation, the mixture (1 volume) was added to 5 volumes of cells in suspension (100,000 cells/ml).The transfection efficiency was estimated at 24 h after transfection by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur flow cytometer, BD Biosciences) using either negative control siRNA labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Qiagen) or Silencer FAM-labeled GAPDH siRNA (Ambion). Cell viability was also estimated by flow cytometry after cell treatment with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Six siRNA duplexes targeting human αII-spectrin were tested: four were from Dharmacon (individual siGENOME duplex D-009933-01, D-009933-02, D-009933-03, and D-009933-04), two were from Ambion (Silencer Pre-designed siRNAs 12798 and 142727); negative silencer control siRNAs (non-relevant) and siRNA targeting p21 were from Dharmacon (siCONTROL™ Non-Targeting siRNA Pool and siGENOME SMART pool M-003471, respectively).Western Blot Analysis—After two washes with prewarmed Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen), the cells were directly lysed on plates in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS and anti-protease mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations were estimated in a colorimetric assay using the BCA method (microAssay Uptima), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard protein. Aliquots of cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins (between 8 and 20 μg) were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (either 0.45 or 0.1 μm) (Protan, Schleicher & Schuell) using a Tris glycine buffer (in the presence of 10% methanol for 0.1-μm membrane). After saturation in 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS buffer, pH 7.5, the membranes were then probed overnight at 4 °C with the indicated primary antibodies. After extensive washing, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Nordic Immunological Laboratories). Immune complexes were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). The chemiluminescence was quantified using the Quantity One® One-dimensional Analysis software after acquisition with the Molecular Imager® Gel Doc™ (Bio-Rad).Cell Cycle Analysis and Apoptosis Study by Flow Cytometry—The cell cycle was analyzed by estimation of the DNA content by flow cytometry. The WM-266 cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA treatment (Invitrogen). After washing, 5 × 105 cells were first fixed with 1% of paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 min, then after two washes in PBS, with 70% ethanol for at least 30 min. The DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide concomitantly with RNase treatment (0.2 mg/ml in PBS, 0.2% BSA for 30 min in the dark).Apoptosis was studied using DiOC6, a green fluorescent cationic dye that accumulates in active mitochondria and is used to follow changes in the membrane potential of mitochondria that occur during apoptosis. Transfected cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA. After washing in PBS, 5 × 105 cells were stained with 80 nm DiOC6 in PBS, 0.2% BSA and dead cells were detected by staining with 15 μg/ml propidium iodide.Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells grown on CC2 slides (Nunc) were washed in prewarmed Dulbecco's PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and saturated 30 min either with buffered saline solution containing 0.1% BSA or with Image-iT™ Signal Enhancer (Molecular Probes). Primary and secondary antibody dilutions were made either in buffered saline solution containing 0.1% BSA or in background reducing buffer (DakoCytomation). When indicated, nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO 3 (Molecular Probes) after treatment with RNase for 30 min. In a final step, immunolabeled cells were mounted in ProLong™ Antifade Gold solution. Secondary labeled anti-IgG antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Alexa Fluor™ 488 and Alexa Fluor™ 568). F-actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence was observed by confocal microscopy using either a Zeiss LSM 510 META or a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope up-graded with a D-Eclipse C1 confocal system.Study of Integrin Expression by Flow Cytometry—The surface expression of integrins (α3, α4, α5, αVβ3, β1, and β3 integrins) was studied 72 h after transfection. The cells were detached using Versene. After washing, 5 × 105 cells were diluted in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS, 0.2% BSA and incubated 90 min at 4 °C with primary monoclonal antibodies diluted at 5 μg/ml in PBS, 0.2% BSA. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were incubated 45 min at room temperature with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted at 5 μg/ml in PBS, 0.2% BSA. Cells were then washed and suspended in 500 μl of PBS, 0.2% BSA containing 0.2 μg/ml propidium iodide to exclude dead cells from flow cytometric analysis. The background was assessed by cell labeling with an antibody directed against V-CAM, an adhesion molecule not expressed in WM-266 cells. Quantifications were done using the QIFIKIT® beads kit from DAKO Cytomation.Static Cell Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed at 72 h after transfection on culture dishes. Control and transfected cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA. After washing in Dulbecco's PBS, the transfected cells were stained with 10 μg/ml Calcein AM (Molecular Probes) when the control cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. After two washes in complete culture medium, transfected cells were mixed with control cells as internal standard in a 1/1 ratio. These mixtures made of two cell populations in suspension were plated in triplicate on 12-well plates (2 × 106 cells per well) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After two washes with complete culture medium, the remaining adherent cells were visualized by fluorescence using Evolution VF camera (Media Cybernetics). Ten images were acquired for each sample of mixed cells, and adherent cells were counted using Image-Pro® Plus software. The results are expressed as the mean percentages of adherent transfected cells versus control adherent cells (100%). Spread cells were discriminated from round cells according to fluorescence intensity of Calcein, the round cells showing a higher intensity. To check the involvement of integrins in adhesion, cells were incubated 90 min with blocking antibodies directed against α3, α5, and αVβ3 integrins (15-25 μg/ml) before seeding. Control cells were incubated with IgG isotype (25 μg/ml).RESULTSThe Down-regulation of αII-Spectrin Expression by siRNA in the WM-266 Melanoma Cell Line Is Effective after 48 h Transfection—To select optimal and specific siRNAs targeting αII-spectrin, six siRNA duplexes were tested on spectrin expression in the WM-266 melanoma cells during 4 days after transfection. In a first step, the transfection conditions were optimized using non-relevant labeled siRNA to get the best transfection efficiency associated to a good level of cell viability as assayed by propidium iodide exclusion in flow cytometry. In the transfection conditions we have determined (see “Experimental Procedures”), the percentage of transfected cells was about 95% (as evaluated by flow cytometry) with a cell viability at 24 h after transfection between 70% of the total amount of cells (including cells in suspension) and more than 95% of the adherent cells after washes.Spectrin siRNAs were efficient only after 48 h transfection as evaluated on Western blots; their effects were more pronounced at 72 and 96 h. Among the six siRNAs tested, two were more efficient (siRNAs 1 and 2 from Dharmacon, named Sp1 and Sp2 in Fig. 1, respectively) with a dose-dependent response. At 25 nm concentration, Sp1 siRNA and Sp2 siRNA induced a decrease of at least 50% in the amount of αII-spectrin after 48 h transfection as compared with non-relevant control siRNA (lane NR siRNA), and routinely between 70 and 80% after 72 h transfection.Spectrin Loss Is Associated with Modifications of Cell Shape and Spreading—We further analyzed the spectrin depletion in transfected cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In cells treated with non-relevant siRNA, αII-spectrin antibodies revealed a diffuse distribution of αII-spectrin throughout the cytoplasm, and also an association with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Fibrillar actin labeled with phalloidin was present at the plasma membrane and formed stress fibers (Fig. 2A). These patterns were identical to those observed in non-transfected cells (data not shown). In cells treated with siRNAs targeting αII-spectrin, immunofluorescence staining of αII-spectrin confirmed the decrease of spectrin expression, the residual staining being restricted to the membrane (Fig. 2, B and C). This reduced expression of spectrin was associated with important modifications of the cell shape, the spectrin-depleted cells being much smaller, rounded and less spread. Labeling studies with phalloidin showed a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, with a reduction of the basal stress fibers network and an increase of the annular cell border (cortical actin). These features were particularly obvious in Fig. 2B where we could compare a non-transfected cell as indicated by its normal spectrin labeling with transfected cells exhibiting a strong decrease in spectrin labeling, reduced size and spreading. Both loss of spreading and actin network disorganization were more pronounced at higher concentrations of spectrin siRNA (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2αII-Spectrin siRNA knockdown is associated with modifications of cell shape and spreading as revealed by immunofluorescence analysis. WM-266 cells were cultured for 72 h following transfection with non-relevant siRNA at 25 nm (A) or siRNA 1 targeting αII-spectrin at 15 (B) and 25 nm (C). The non-relevant siRNA-treated cells (A) are spread with the presence of actin stress fibers (labeled with phalloidin, pseudo-colored in red) and αII-spectrin (stained with polyclonal anti-Sp-αII antibodies, pseudo-colored in green) has a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm, and is also associated with the plasma membrane. After siRNA knockdown of αII-spectrin expression, transfected cells exhibited a concomitant decrease in spectrin labeling, cell size, and spreading, together with a reduction of the F-actin stress fibers network (B and C). The merged image in panel B is particularly illustrating of the cellular phenotype modifications, as indicated by the presence of a cell with normal spectrin labeling. Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO 3 (pseudo-colored in blue). Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)During the course of cell culture, we observed a progressive decrease in adherent cells concomitantly to an increase in detached cells in samples treated with spectrin siRNAs, in comparison with control cultures treated either with transfection reagent alone or with non-relevant siRNA. This feature raised two questions: a possible cell death by apoptosis and/or a defect in cell adhesion as suggested by the modifications of cell shape and spreading.Spectrin Loss Inhibits Cell Proliferation via G1 Phase Arrest—When compared with samples treated with the transfection reagent alone, the number of total cells (adherent cells and detached cells) was significantly reduced 72 h after transfection in samples treated with siRNA targeting spectrin (Sp1 and Sp2 siRNAs) (50% less) (Fig. 3). This effect was more pronounced after the 96-h culture; the number of cells is 65% less in spectrin siRNA-treated cells. The number of non-relevant siRNA-treated cells was also decreased (25% less after 72 and 96 h transfection), exhibiting a slight toxicity of non-relevant siRNA, but this effect is not statically significant (Fig. 3). The cell numbers observed in samples treated with spectrin siRNAs were significantly decreased compared with samples treated by non-relevant siRNAs (p < 0.05 at 96 h after transfection).FIGURE 3Spectrin depletion is associated with a defect in cell proliferation. Cell growth was evaluated during 4 days by cell counting in samples treated with transfection reagent (TR), siRNA targeting αII-spectrin (Sp1 and Sp2), or non-relevant siRNA (NR) at 25 nm. The number of cells in samples treated with spectrin siRNAs was significantly decreased (*, p < 0.05) compared with samples treated with NR siRNA after 72 and 96 h treatment. These data were obtained from three separate transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This decreased number of total cells could be related either to apoptosis and cell death or to growth arrest. In a first step, we have checked apoptosis and cell death by flow cytometry analysis. Apoptotic cells were identified by the absence of labeling with DiOC6, a marker of mitochondrial membrane potential, and dead cells were assessed by DNA labeling with propidium iodide. At 72 h after transfection, we observed no important differences between cells transfected with the siRNA of spectrin and those transfected with non-relevant siRNA (Fig. 4A). A moderate apoptosis and cell death appeared only at 96 h after transfection (data not shown). We concluded that apoptosis and cell death are late effects and cannot fully explain the loss of cells observed at 72 h.FIGURE 4Spectrin depletion inhibits cell proliferation via G1 arrest. A, spectrin depletion was not obviously associated (at 72 h) with apoptosis as evaluated by the presence of a few cells without DiOC6 labeling (R3) and with cell death as evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) labeling (R1). B, the number of cells in the G2/M and S phases (as evaluated by DNA labeling with PI) was decreased in samples treated with Sp1 siRNA (red line) and Sp2 siRNA (blue line) as compared with sample treated with non-relevant siRNA (gray background), indicating a cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The peak at the left of the curve corresponds to cell fragments (not excluded in this analysis). C, the retinoblastoma Rb protein was mainly in a hypophosphorylated status in cells treated with spectrin siRNA (Sp1 and Sp2) when this protein was essentially highly phosphorylated in cells treated with either transfection reagent (TR) or non-relevant siRNA (NR), confirming an arrest of the cell cycle at G1. D, the Western blot probed with antibodies directed against the CDK inhibitor p21 revealed an increased expression of p21 in samples treated with spectrin siRNAs. This increased expression was highly significant as shown in panel E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We investigated the cell cycle by flow cytometry analysis of cell DNA content after labeling with propidium iodide. At 72 h, the number of cells in the S phase (DNA-synthetic phase) and G2/M phases (second gap phase/mitosis) is clearly decreased in samples treated with spectrin siRNAs, with a concomitant increase in the G1 phase (first gap phase) as compared with samples treated with non-relevant siRNA (Fig. 4B). The percentage of cells in G2/M (estimated from 6 independent experiments) is 8.2 ± 1.2 and 7.4% ± 2.1 in samples treated with Sp1 RNA and Sp2 RNA, respectively, compared with 14.2% ± 1.2 in samples treated with non-relevant siRNA. This effect is more pronounced at 96 h after transfection (data not shown). These data suggest that spectrin depletion is associated with an arrest of cell cycle at G1 phase.To better explore the cell cycle regulation, we checked for the phosphorylation state of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which regulates cell cycle progression. In resting cells, the activity of Rb is negatively regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases, which phosphorylate Rb in the G1 phase. Thus the hyperphosphorylated species are primarily found in proliferating cells. As shown by Western blot in Fig. 4C, Rb migrates as multiple bands due to varying degrees of phosphorylation. In cells treated with transfection reagent and non-relevant siRNA, the predominant species consisted of hyperphosphorylated forms (ppRb) (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 4, respectively), whereas in cells treated with siRNAs targeting spectrin, the hyperphosphorylated Rb (ppRb) is strongly decreased with a concomitant increase in the underphosphorylated Rb (pRb) (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively).This cell cycle arrest was further studied by analyzing the expression of G1 checkpoint and G1/S transition proteins, and especially cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, p27, p16, and p15 by Western blot. We failed to detect p16 inhibitor, which is frequently mutated in melanoma cells (17Li W. Sanki A. Karim R.Z. Thompson J.F. Soon Lee C. Zhuang L. McCarthy S.W. Scolyer R.A. Pathology.. 2006; 38: 287-301Google Scholar). The p27 inhibitor was also difficult to analyze as its expression is often decreased in melanoma cells. P15 inhibitor expression was not obviously modified (data not shown). In contrast, p21 inhibitor expression was increased between 1.8 and 2.4 times at 72 h in samples treated with Sp1 and Sp2 siRNAs (at 30 nm) as compared with samples treated with transfection reagent (lane TR in Fig. 4, D and E); p21 expression was slightly increased (×1.2) in samples treated with non-relevant siRNA (Fig. 4, D and E). These effects were still observed at 96 h (data not shown). To appreciate its role in the cell cycle control in the WM-266 cell line, protein p21 was knocked-down. After 48 h of siRNA treatment at a concentration of 30 nm, p21 was not detected in the cell lysates by Western blotting (Fig. 5A); the p21 loss was associated with a significant increase of cell proliferation, indicating that p21 acts as a negative modulator of proliferation in this cell line (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Protein p21 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in the WM-266-4 cell line. Cells were transfected with siRNAs either targeting p21 or non-relevant control (NR siRNA) at 30 nm. The SDS cell lysates obtained at 48 and 72 h after transfection were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies directed against p21 and lamin A/C (used as a loading control). Protein p21 was no longer detected at 48 and 72 h (A). The number of cells in samples treated with p21 siRNAs was significantly increased as compared with samples treated with NR siRNAs (p < 0.05) (B). These data were obtained from two separate transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Spectrin Depletion Is Associated with a Defect of Cell Adhesion—The loss of adherent cells transfected with siRNAs targeting αII-spectrin raised the second question of a defect in cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 2, the cells treated with siRNA targeting spectrin were rounded and not well spread. To address this question, we performed static adhesion assays of melanoma cells at 72 h after transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 2 h after replating, the number of adherent cells transfected by non-relevant siRNAs was similar to that of cells treated with transfection reagent (100%) (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the number of adherent cells treated with Sp1 and Sp2 siRNAs was significantly decreased compared with non-relevant siRNA-treated cells: only 40 and 70% of cells treated with Sp1 and Sp2 siRNAs, respectively, were still adherent. In addition to a defective adhesion, the spectrin knock-down cells showed a defect in spreading as shown in Fig. 6, B and C: 4 h after seeding, 24 and 37% of the remaining adherent cells treated with Sp1 and Sp2 siRNAs were spread as compared with 68 and 54% for adherent cells treated with transfection reagent or non-relevant siRNA, respectively.FIGURE 6Spectrin depletion alters static adhesion and cell spreading. A, adhesion assays were performed on the WM-266-4 cells at 72 h after transfection with either siRNAs targeting αII-spectrin (Sp1 and Sp2) or non-relevant siRNA (NR siRNA) at 30 nm or without siRNA (TR). Two hours after replating, the adhesion of WM-266-4 cells treated with siRNAs targeting αII-spectrin was significantly decreased when compared with cells treated with non-relevant siRNA as indicated by the number of remaining cells after washing. Panel B shows the Calcein-labeled cells, 4 h after seeding. Cells treated with Sp1 siRNA were mainly rounded and cons"
https://openalex.org/W2145549828,"Thermochromatium tepidum is a thermophilic purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium collected from the Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park. A previous study showed that the light-harvesting-reaction center core complex (LH1-RC) purified from this bacterium is highly stable at room temperature (Suzuki, H., Hirano, Y., Kimura, Y., Takaichi, S., Kobayashi, M., Miki, K., and Wang, Z.-Y. (2007) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1767, 1057–1063). In this work, we demonstrate that thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC is much higher than that of its mesophilic counterparts, and the enhanced thermal stability requires Ca2+ as a cofactor. Removal of the Ca2+ from Tch. tepidum LH1-RC resulted in a complex with the same degree of thermal stability as that of the LH1-RCs purified from mesophilic bacteria. The enhanced thermal stability can be restored by addition of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-depleted LH1-RC, and this process is fully reversible. Interchange of the thermal stability between the two forms is accompanied by a shift of the LH1 Qy transition between 915 nm for the native and 880 nm for the Ca2+-depleted LH1-RC. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements reveal that degradation temperature of the native LH1-RC is 15 °C higher and the enthalpy change is about 28% larger than the Ca2+-depleted LH1-RC. Substitution of the Ca2+ with other metal cations caused a decrease in thermal stability of an extent depending on the properties of the cations. These results indicate that Ca2+ ions play a dual role in stabilizing the structure of the pigment-membrane protein complex and in altering its spectroscopic properties, and hence provide insight into the adaptive strategy of this photosynthetic organism to survive in extreme environments using natural resources.

Purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium, Thermochromatium tepidum, was originally isolated from a hot springs in Yellowstone National Park and can grow anaerobically at optimum temperatures of 48–50 °C with an upper limit of 58 °C (1Madigan M.T. Science. 1984; 225: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is the highest temperature of all known purple bacteria (2Madigan M.T. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A number of soluble proteins purified from this organism have been shown to be thermostable with respect to their mesophilic counterparts. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, a key enzyme of the Calvin cycle, from Tch. tepidum was reported to be most catalytically active at 50 °C, and it remained active at 60 °C over 20 min, whereas the same enzyme from the closely related mesophilic bacterium Allochromatium vinosum completely lost its activity over the same period (3Heda G.D. Madigan M.T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 51: 45-50Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Heda G.D. Madigan M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar behavior was observed for the high potential iron-sulfur proteins from the two bacteria (5Moulis J.-M. Scherrer N. Gagnon J. Forest E. Garcia D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi M. Saito T. Takahashi K. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 2005; 78: 2164-2170Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and was attributed to subtle differences in the amino acid sequence and structure (7Liu L.-J. Nogi T. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The thermal stability mechanism of the membrane proteins is somewhat complicated because of complex protein-protein and protein-detergent/lipid interactions (8Minetti C.A.S.A. Remeta D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 453: 32-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of reaction center (RC) 3The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; LH, light-harvesting; DDM, n-dodecyl maltoside; DPC, n-decylphosphocholine; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; OG, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside.3The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; BChl, bacteriochlorophyll; LH, light-harvesting; DDM, n-dodecyl maltoside; DPC, n-decylphosphocholine; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; OG, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. from Tch. tepidum, the thermal stability was shown to be strongly dependent on the type and composition of detergents used (9Nozawa T. Madigan M.T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There are three arginine residues in the Tch. tepidum RC (10Fathir I. Tanaka K. Yoza K. Kojima A. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. Lottspeich F. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 51: 71-82Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which are not present in the RCs of other mesophiles. These basic residues are located at the membrane interface, as revealed by the high resolution crystal structure (11Nogi T. Fathir I. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and were postulated to contribute to the RC stability. However, engineering of the arginine residues into structurally homologous positions in the RC of Rhodobacter sphaeroides did not improve the thermal stability, and the native RC of R. sphaeroides showed the same degree of thermal stability to the Tch. tepidum RC under similar experimental conditions (12Watson A.J. Hughs A.V. Fyfe P.K. Wakeham M.C. Holden-Dye K. Heathcote P. Jones M.R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was concluded that the Tch. tepidum RC is not inherently more stable than the R. sphaeroides RC at least when these complexes are removed from the membrane (12Watson A.J. Hughs A.V. Fyfe P.K. Wakeham M.C. Holden-Dye K. Heathcote P. Jones M.R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We reported in a previous work that strong interaction exists between the Tch. tepidum RC and its surrounding core light-harvesting 1 (LH1) complex (13Wang Z.-Y. Shimonaga M. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 78: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), providing evidence for a subsequent proposal that such interaction could enhance the stability of the so-called LH1-RC core complex (12Watson A.J. Hughs A.V. Fyfe P.K. Wakeham M.C. Holden-Dye K. Heathcote P. Jones M.R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The high stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex has been confirmed (14Kobayashi M. Fujioka Y. Mori T. Terashima M. Suzuki H. Shimada Y. Saito T. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments using liposome revealed that the Tch. tepidum RC alone does not have pronounced stability, and it gains a remarkable stability through the strong interaction with the LH1 complex (14Kobayashi M. Fujioka Y. Mori T. Terashima M. Suzuki H. Shimada Y. Saito T. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A highly purified LH1-RC core complex was shown to be stable at room temperature over 10 days (15Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for the enhanced thermal stability of Tch. tepidum LH1-RC has been unclear. Another striking feature of the Tch. tepidum is that its LH1 complex exhibits an unusual Qy absorption at 915 nm, about 35 nm red-shifted from its mesophilic homologue. In a recent study (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that calcium ions are involved in this behavior through a strong interaction with LH1 polypeptides, and the Ca2+ binding to the LH1 is estimated to occur in a stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+/LH1αβ subunit = 1:1. Excitation dynamics of the energy transfer have been compared in the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms (17Ma F. Kimura Y. Zhao X.-H. Wu Y.-S. Wang P. Fu L.-M. Wang Z.-Y. Zhang J.-P. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 3349-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this work, we present experimental evidence that the Ca2+ is required for the enhanced thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex. Effects of Ca2+ depletion and replacement of the Ca2+ with other metal cations on the stability were examined using absorption, CD, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Based on the results, the roles of Ca2+ in the thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex are discussed in relation to several known factors responsible for the enhanced stability of proteins from thermophiles. Although protein thermal stability has been extensively investigated, to our knowledge the metal ion-induced enhancement of the thermal stability has not been reported for the proteins from photosynthetic organisms. The results of this study will provide insight into how the LH1-RC complex of this thermophilic organism was adapted to the growing environment at elevated temperatures by utilizing natural resources. Sample Preparation—LH1-RC complex from Tch. tepidum was isolated and purified as described previously (15Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, the chromatophores were treated with 0.35% (w/v) lauryldimethylamine N-oxide at 25 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation, the pellet was treated with 1.0% (w/v) n-decylphosphocholine (DPC) to obtain the LH1-RC-rich components. The extract was purified by a DEAE anion-exchange column (Toyopearl 650S, TOSOH) equilibrated at 4 °C with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.8% (w/v) DPC. The LH1-RC fractions eluted by a linear gradient of CaCl2 from 10 to 25 mm were collected. The LH1-RC complexes from A. vinosum and Rhodospirillum rubrum were used as references for a comparison with that of Tch. tepidum. Chromatophores from A. vinosum were treated with 1.5% (w/v) n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25 °C for 60 min, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 150,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was purified with a sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 12 h in a 10–40% (w/v) continuous sucrose gradient solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.7% (w/v) OG to isolate the LH1-RC complexes. The Rsp. rubrum chromatophores were treated with 1.0% (w/v) OG in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) at 25 °C for 60 min, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C and 150,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was loaded onto the DEAE anion-exchange column (Toyopearl 650S, TOSOH) equilibrated at 4 °C with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl maltoside. The LH1-RC fractions eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 75 to 160 mm were collected. Detergents in the LH1-RC samples from A. vinosum and Rsp. rubrum were replaced with DPC by repeatedly washing the samples with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.8% (w/v) DPC. Ca2+-depleted Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex was prepared as described previously (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The native LH1-RC complex, which has an LH1 Qy absorption of ∼915 nm and is therefore designated as B915, was first passed through a size-exclusion column (Sephadex G25M PD10, GE Healthcare) to remove excess of salts in solution. The filtrate was then incubated at 0 °C for 15 min in darkness with 0.5 mm EDTA to remove the bound Ca2+, followed by extensive washing with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.8% (w/v) DPC to remove the residual EDTA. The resulting LH1-RC complex has an LH1 Qy absorption ∼880 nm and is therefore designated as B880. For metal cation-substitution experiments, 40 mm Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, and Cd2+ was added to the B880 sample as chloride, and the mixture was incubated at 0 °C overnight. Thermal Degradation—Thermal degradation of the LH1-RC complexes was monitored via the LH1 Qy band intensities after incubation at a given temperature for 0–96 min. For the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complexes, sample concentrations were normalized with respect to the carotenoid band at 514 nm because this band has been shown to be unaffected by Ca2+ depletion and metal substitution (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the CD measurements, concentrations of B915 and B880 were adjusted to an absorbance of 0.10 at 280 nm, and the thermal denaturations were examined by monitoring both the CD intensity at 222 nm and the LH1 Qy absorption intensity after 5 min of incubation at a given temperature. Thermal stabilities of the metal-substituted LH1-RC complexes were assessed using the relative LH1 Qy peak intensities monitored at 50 °C as a function of the incubation time. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC measurements of the LH1-RC complexes from Tch. tepidum were conducted using a nanoDSC II calorimeter (model 6100, Calorimetry Science Corp.). Sample concentrations were adjusted to 3.1 and 2.6 mg/ml for B915 and B880, respectively, in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.8% (w/v) DPC. Thermal degradation of the samples was monitored at a range of 10–100 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The DSC measurement for the B880 was carried out in the absence of Ca2+. For the measurement of B915, 20 mm CaCl2 was added to the sample solution. The reference buffer for each measurement was the same as that used for each sample preparation. Spectroscopic Measurements—Absorption and CD spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer and a Jasco J-720w spectropolarimeter, respectively(16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The CD spectra were recorded with 20 nm/min scan speed, 1.0-nm bandwidth, and 2-s response time. Fig. 1 shows changes in the absorption spectra of the Tch. tepidum B915 and B880 at 50 °C as functions of time. The native B915 complex exhibits a largely red-shifted LH1 Qy absorption band at 914.5 nm (15Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Overall spectral character, including LH1 Qy (914.5 nm), Qx (592 nm), and Soret bands (379 nm), was firmly retained over a 96-min incubation (Fig. 1A). The carotenoid bands at 486, 514, and 551 nm, as well as the protein bands at 280 nm, remained almost unchanged by the thermal treatment. In contrast, the LH1 Qy band of the Ca2+-depleted B880 species rapidly decreased and completely disappeared after 48 min of incubation (Fig. 1B). With increasing incubation time, the 879-nm band decreased, and a new band at 775.5 nm appeared with an isosbestic point at 802 nm. This indicates that the Ca2+-depleted B880 complex is thermally more unstable than the B915, and the LH1 complex was directly decomposed into monomeric forms of the BChl a-bound α- and β-polypeptides upon the degradation. In addition, the carotenoid bands completely disappeared after a 96-min incubation, and the denatured carotenoid molecules were presumed to contribute to the increase of the absorption intensities shorter than 410 nm. The thermal stabilities of the B915 and B880 were further investigated over a wide range of temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the changes in relative LH1 Qy band intensities of the two complexes as functions of time at various temperatures. The Qy band of the B915 retained 98% intensities over 64 min up to 40 °C. The relative intensities deceased to 89 and 72% at 50 and 60 °C, respectively, during the same period, and completely disappeared in about 10 min at 70 °C. This suggests that decomposition of the B915 is markedly enhanced at the temperatures higher than 60 °C (Fig. 2A). In comparison, the Qy band of the Ca2+-depleted B880 apparently decreased with incubation time even at 30 and 40 °C and rapidly diminished at temperatures higher than 50 °C (Fig. 2B). The marked difference obviously indicates that calcium ions are required for the thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complex. The thermal stabilities of the Tch. tepidum B915 and B880 were compared with those of native LH1-RC complexes from mesophilic purple bacteria. The LH1 Qy bands were at 884 nm for A. vinosum (B884) and 875 nm for Rsp. rubrum (B875). There was no essential difference in the thermal stability between the native and EDTA-treated mesophilic LH1-RC samples (see supplemental material). This indicates that the Ca2+ concentration has no clear effect on the stability of LH1-RC from mesophilic species, in contrast to the effect on Tch. tepidum LH1-RC. Degradation profiles of the A. vinosum and Rsp. rubrum LH1-RC complexes were similar to that of the Tch. tepidum B880. The temperature dependences of the LH1 Qy peak intensities at different time intervals are shown in Fig. 3 for the four LH1-RC complexes. The Tch. tepidum B880, A. vinosum B884, and Rsp. rubrum B875 revealed almost identical behavior, whereas the Tch. tepidum B915 showed an enhanced thermal resistance under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that removing Ca2+ reduced the thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC to a level similar to that of its mesophilic counterparts. The above measurements were made by monitoring the Qy absorption bands of BChl a molecules, which sensitively reflect the configuration of the chromophores in the LH1 complex. To gain information on the protein stability, we examined temperature dependence of the secondary structure of the LH1-RC complex using far-UV CD spectroscopy. Fig. 4, A and B, shows the CD spectra of Tch. tepidum B915 and B880, respectively, at a variety of temperatures between 30 and 90 °C. Both the B915 and B880 exhibited a similar spectral shape at 30 °C (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that there was no change in the secondary structure of the polypeptides upon Ca2+ depletion. However, the CD spectrum of B880 significantly changed with increasing temperature, whereas that of the B915 was almost completely retained up to 70 °C. The relative CD intensities at 222 nm are plotted in Fig. 4C as a function of the temperature. Above 60 °C, the CD intensity of B880 rapidly decreased with elevation of the temperature and reached about 30% at 90 °C. In contrast, the relative CD intensity of the B915 remained at 85% even after incubation at 90 °C. The results indicate that the thermal stability of the secondary structure also decreased with the removal of Ca2+ from the LH1-RC complex. It was noted that the CD intensity of the B880 remained almost unchanged with incubation at 30–50 °C where a significant decrease had already occurred for the corresponding LH1 Qy absorption. When the CD intensity of the B880 began to diminish rapidly at temperatures higher than 60 °C, the LH1 Qy absorption band was completely eliminated. A similar tendency was also observed for the B915, indicating that thermal degradation first occurred as decomposition of the LH1 complex into monomeric forms of the BChl a-bound α- and β-polypeptides, and was followed by denaturation of the secondary structures of the LH1 polypeptides. The thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complexes was studied quantitatively by DSC measurement. Fig. 5 shows the endotherms of B915 and B880. In each case, a single transition was observed in the temperature range of the scan. The B915 exhibited a sharp peak centered at 75.0 °C, indicating a high degree of structural integrity. For the Ca2+-depleted B880, a much broader transition was detected with the maximum shifted downward to 59.9 °C, and there were two small shoulders around 40 and 68 °C. Taking into account the temperature dependences of absorption and CD spectra, the DSC main peaks are considered to correspond to the temperatures at which the LH1 complexes are dissociated into monomeric α- and β-polypeptides. If this is the case, the results indicate that Ca2+ binding to the LH1 enhances the thermal stability of the LH1-RC complex by 15 °C. Enthalpy changes ΔH of these transitions were calculated to be 6690 and 5210 kJ/mol for the B915 and B880, respectively. The difference could be interpreted as evidence of destabilization by removal of the Ca2+ from B915. To further examine the effects on the thermal stability, reconstitution experiments were carried out using the Ca2+-depleted B880 and various divalent cations. Beside the alkali earth metal cations, Cd2+ was chosen as a probe because it has the same valence and similar ionic radius as Ca2+. Fig. 6 shows the time changes of relative LH1 Qy intensities at 50 °C for the native and reconstituted LH1-RC complexes. Of these cations, only the Ca2+-substituted LH1-RC displayed essentially the same stability as the native B915. Other metal ion-substituted LH1-RC complexes also exhibited enhanced stability relative to the B880, but the extent was strongly dependent on the cation species. The results can be rationalized in terms of stability order: native B915(914.5) ≈ Ca2+(914.5) > Ba2+(890) ≈ Sr2+(890) > Mg2+(887.5) > Cd2+(887.5) > B880(880.5), where the LH1 Qy peak positions in nanometer are indicated in parentheses. No correlation was observed between the thermal stability and the ionic radius of the cations. However, the thermal stability seems to be correlated with the LH1 Qy peak position between the metal ion-substituted complexes; the greater the red shift, the more stable the LH1-RC complex. This study demonstrates that Ca2+ ions are required for the enhanced thermal stability of the LH1-RC core complex from Tch. tepidum. Removal of the Ca2+ from the native complex B915 resulted in the form B880 with thermal stability reduced to that of its mesophilic counterparts. The enhanced thermal stability of B915 can be completely restored by addition of Ca2+ to B880. This reversible process is also accompanied by an interchangeable shift of the LH1 Qy transition between 915 and 880 nm, as reported previously (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-induced thermal stability of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC may be closely related to the living environment of this organism, as the bacterium was collected from a reddish mat embedded in the carbonate sinter of a sulfide thermal spring (∼45 °C) located in the Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park (1Madigan M.T. Science. 1984; 225: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which is known to contain rich mineral calcium carbonate. In this regard, the results of this study provide useful information on the adaptive strategy utilized by this photosynthetic organism to survive in an environment of elevated temperatures using the natural resources. Metal ion-induced enhancement of thermal stability has been reported for water-soluble proteins. Nereis sarcoplasmic Ca2+-binding protein was shown to undergo large conformational and stability changes upon ion binding (18Christova P. Cox J.A. Craescu C.T. Proteins. 2000; 40: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The structural change from a molten globule (apo-state) to the ion-bound native form was accompanied by increases in both chemical and thermal stabilities in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > apo. Similar characteristics were observed for parvalbumins, a group of small vertebrate-specific Ca2+-binding proteins (19Henzl M.T. Agah S. Larson J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3594-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding domain exhibited higher thermal stability and strong tendency to self-associate in the presence of Ca2+. The results of this study add a new example that large membrane proteins can also acquire thermal resistance by utilizing metal ions. Unlike the water-soluble proteins mentioned above, the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC undergoes very small changes in conformation upon Ca2+ binding, which can only be detected by the LH1 Qy transition (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The far UV-CD spectra did not show any marked change between the B915 and B880 forms, suggesting that the conformational change may occur mainly in the side chains and/or tertiary structure (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This work clarifies several speculations derived from previous studies on the stability of Tch. tepidum RC. From the high resolution crystal structure of this complex (11Nogi T. Fathir I. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), three basic residues on the periplasmic side of the membrane, which are not present in the RCs of other mesophiles, were highlighted as candidates for specific interactions that may contribute to an enhanced thermal stability if it occurs. In an attempt to isolate pure, RC-free LH1 complexes from this bacterium, we found that interaction between the LH1 and RC was so strong that separation of the two complexes was not successful (13Wang Z.-Y. Shimonaga M. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 78: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that these basic residues mentioned above do not actually enhance the thermal stability of the RC (12Watson A.J. Hughs A.V. Fyfe P.K. Wakeham M.C. Holden-Dye K. Heathcote P. Jones M.R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the Tch. tepidum RC alone does not have pronounced stability (14Kobayashi M. Fujioka Y. Mori T. Terashima M. Suzuki H. Shimada Y. Saito T. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results, together with modeling analysis, led to a proposal that the RC is stabilized by the surrounding LH1 complex through strong ionic interactions between the basic residues in RC and acidic residues at the C-terminal end of the LH1 α-polypeptide (12Watson A.J. Hughs A.V. Fyfe P.K. Wakeham M.C. Holden-Dye K. Heathcote P. Jones M.R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Kobayashi M. Fujioka Y. Mori T. Terashima M. Suzuki H. Shimada Y. Saito T. Wang Z.-Y. Nozawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This study provides evidence that interaction alone between Tch. tepidum RC and LH1 is not enough to bring about an enhanced thermal stability because the B880 revealed a stability at the same levels as those of the mesophilic counterparts (Fig. 3), and the Ca2+ is an indispensable cofactor acting as a trigger to induce a more stabilized structure of the LH1-RC complex. The possible interaction site identified previously coincides with the Ca2+-binding site proposed in our recent work (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are three Asp residues in the C terminus of Tch. tepidum LH1 α-polypeptide, which are considered to serve as potential ligands to the Ca2+. A deletion unique to the α-polypeptide in this region is also thought to play an essential role in forming the Ca2+-binding site. The unusual red shift of the Tch. tepidum LH1 Qy transition at 915 nm was demonstrated to be related to Ca2+ binding, and the Qy transition is strongly dependent on metal cations (16Kimura Y. Hirano Y. Yu L.-J. Suzuki H. Kobayashi M. Wang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13867-13873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown in this study that the thermal stability of the divalent cation-reconstituted LH1-RC seems to be related to the LH1 Qy transition. The complex with a greater LH1 red shift tends to have a higher thermal stability (Fig. 6). However, it is not clear whether there exists a general correlation between the LH1 Qy transition and thermal stability. Two other LH1 complexes from purple bacteria strain 970 and R. parvum 930I were reported to exhibit Qy absorptions at 963 nm (20Permentier H.P. Neerken S. Overmann J. Amesz J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and 909 nm (21Glaeser J. Overmann J. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Tuschat C. Beatty J.T. Overmann J. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 81: 181-199Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), respectively. The large red shifts were explained in terms of enhanced exciton interaction among the BChl a molecules and specific interactions between BChl a and LH1 polypeptides, but thermal stability of these complexes has not been examined, although the optimum growth temperature for the R. parvum 930I was reported to be 30 °C. As the Ca2+ is involved in the marked changes of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC in both spectroscopic and thermal properties, it is intriguing to speculate on the details of the specific interactions at molecular level between the Ca2+, LH1, and RC. Although a number of high resolution structures have been available for RC and LH2 complexes (11Nogi T. Fathir I. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A crystal structure at 4.8 Å has been determined for the LH1-RC complex from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (32Roszak A.W. Howard T.D. Southall J. Gardiner A.T. Law C.J. Isaac N.W. Cogdell R.J. Science. 2003; 302: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To gain more detailed information on the side-chain conformation of LH1 complex, structures at higher resolutions are required, and to this end the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC has recently been crystallized (15Suzuki H. Hirano Y. Kimura Y. Takaichi S. Kobayashi M. Miki K. Wang Z.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions of this study, both the Tch. tepidum B915 and B880 revealed a similar pattern of thermal degradation to those of the LH1-RC complexes from mesophilic bacteria, i.e. dissociation of the LH1 complexes into monomeric forms of the BChl a-bound α- and β-polypeptides, followed by a denaturation of the polypeptides. The B915, however, displayed much higher stability than the B880 complex. The DSC measurements provided quantitative evidence that the dissociation temperature of the B915 was 15 °C higher than that of B880, and the enthalpy change for the B915 dissociation was about 28% larger than that for B880. The enthalpy changes measured by DSC for both B915 and B880 are much larger than that determined by the spectroscopic method for an association of Rsp. rubrum αβ(BChla)2 subunit into LH1 complexes (33Pandit A. Visschers R.W. van Stokkum I.H.M. Kraayenhof R. van Grondelle R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12913-12924Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Vágh A.P. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Arluison V. Seguin J. Caer J.-P. Le Sturgis J.N. Robert B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1276-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Carotenoids were not incorporated in these reconstitution experiments. The large enthalpy changes in this study may be attributed to the following: (a) the strong interaction between LH1 and RC; (b) stabilization of the LH1 complex by carotenoids, and (c) stabilization of the whole LH1-RC complex by the phosphocholine detergent. Actually, enthalpy changes estimated from the spectroscopic analysis for the B915 and B880 were comparable with those from the DSC measurements (data not shown). Metal substitution experiments indicated that the thermal stability of Tch. tepidum LH1-RC strongly depends on properties of the metal cations used (Fig. 6). Generally, ligands involved in the Ca2+-binding site are mainly oxygen atoms in carboxylate groups of acidic residues, amide bonds, and water molecules. In addition to the negative charge of the oxygen atoms, recent studies have revealed that the mode of carboxylate binding (monodentate versus bidentate) also plays an important role in recognition of a native metal cofactor (36Dudev T. Lim C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2007; 40: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on a statistical analysis of the known structures of metalloproteins, factors governing the carboxylate-binding modes have been proposed, and the difference in the binding mode in Mg2+- and Ca2+-containing proteins can be rationalized. The Ca2+-binding site was shown to prefer a bidentate form compared with the Mg2+-binding site, and a carboxylate monodentate-bidentate switch could be used to fine-tune the metal-binding site affinity and/or selectivity, thus modifying the function/character of the metalloproteins (36Dudev T. Lim C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2007; 40: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our results in this work show that metal cations can regulate thermal stability of a large pigment-membrane protein complex, and the subtle changes in the metal-binding site can be sensitively monitored by the LH1 Qy transition. The highly selective property of metal ion binding to the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC may be used as a useful model for investigation of the mechanism of molecular recognition, and provide a potential design tool that could be employed for engineering new pigment-membrane protein complexes with controlled thermodynamic and spectroscopic functions.

https://openalex.org/W1963605590,"Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infection and HCV/HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) co-infection are growing problems in injection drug users (IDU). Their prevalence and genotypic patterns vary with geographic locations. Access to harm reduction measures is opening up opportunities for improving the HIV/HCV profiling of IDU in China, where IDUs account for a significant proportion of the two infections especially in the southern part of the country. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross sectional study was conducted. Through the Liuzhou Methadone Clinic, a total of 117 injection drug users (IDUs) were recruited from Guangxi, Southern China. A majority of the IDUs (96%) were HCV antibody positive, of which 21% were HIV infected. Unlike HCV monoinfection, there was spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of HIV/HCV coinfection, the latter also characterized by a higher prevalence of needle-sharing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that genotype 6a was predominant in the study population. There were shorter genetic distances among the 6a sequences compared to the other HCV subtypes-1a, 3a, and 3b. Conclusion/Significance The results suggested that HIV and HCV were introduced at around the same time to the IDU populations in Southern China, followed by their differential spread as determined by the biologic characteristics of the virus and the intensity of behavioural risk. This pattern is different from that in other South East Asian countries where HCV infections have probably predated HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2033031763,"Individual mice have a unique odor, or odortype, that facilitates individual recognition. Odortypes, like other phenotypes, can be influenced by genetic and environmental variation. The genetic influence derives in part from genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). A major environmental influence is diet, which could obscure the genetic contribution to odortype. Because odortype stability is a prerequisite for individual recognition under normal behavioral conditions, we investigated whether MHC-determined urinary odortypes of inbred mice can be identified in the face of large diet-induced variation. Mice trained to discriminate urines from panels of mice that differed both in diet and MHC type found the diet odor more salient in generalization trials. Nevertheless, when mice were trained to discriminate mice with only MHC differences (but on the same diet), they recognized the MHC difference when tested with urines from mice on a different diet. This indicates that MHC odor profiles remain despite large dietary variation. Chemical analyses of urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) are consistent with this inference. Although diet influenced VOC variation more than MHC, with algorithmic training (supervised classification) MHC types could be accurately discriminated across different diets. Thus, although there are clear diet effects on urinary volatile profiles, they do not obscure MHC effects."

To balance the need for copper with the necessity to prevent accumulation to toxic levels, cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to regulate copper acquisition, distribution, and storage. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1. Although Mac1 activates the transcription of genes involved in high affinity copper uptake during periods of deficiency, little is known about the mechanisms by which Mac1 senses or responds to reduced copper availability. Here we show that the copper-dependent enzyme Sod1 (Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase) and its intracellular copper chaperone Ccs1 function in the activation of Mac1 in response to an external copper deficiency. Genetic ablation of either CCS1 or SOD1 results in a severe defect in the ability of yeast cells to activate the transcription of Mac1 target genes. The catalytic activity of Sod1 is essential for Mac1 activation and promotes a regulated increase in binding of Mac1 to copper response elements in the promoter regions of genomic Mac1 target genes. Although there is precedent for additional roles of Sod1 beyond protection of the cell from oxygen radicals, the involvement of this protein in copper-responsive transcriptional regulation has not previously been observed. Given the presence of both Sod1 and copper-responsive transcription factors in higher eukaryotes, these studies may yield important insights into how copper deficiency is sensed and appropriate cellular responses are coordinated.

Unicellular organisms are constantly exposed to a plethora of changing environments and thus have developed sophisticated uptake, distribution, and storage systems that function to assimilate essential nutrients from the environment. Copper is included among these essential nutrients, and once inside cells, it is incorporated as a catalytic or structural cofactor into a variety of proteins (1Prohaska J.R. Gybina A.A. J.

The redox potential that makes copper an important cofactor also allows the ion to undergo Fenton chemistry to produce the potent hydroxyl radical (OH·) (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem.

Organisms have evolved sophisticated homeostatic systems to maintain appropriate intracellular copper levels that are below levels that could lead to cellular damage (4Balamurugan K. Schaffner W.

Cell. 2004; 3: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper in the extracellular environment is reduced by cell surface reductases, Fre1 and Fre2, and is transported across the plasma membrane by the high affinity copper transporter Ctr1 or the functionally redundant Ctr3 protein (6Dancis A.

Inside cells, the Cox17 chaperone facilitates the delivery of copper to the cytochrome c oxidase complex in the mitochondria, and this function is required for aerobic respiration (9Glerum D.M.

Interestingly, recent data have demonstrated that Cox17 localized exclusively to the mitochondria is sufficient for delivery of copper to cytochrome c oxidase (12Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggests that either an as yet unidentified chaperone or a small molecule carrier is responsible for trafficking of copper from the plasma membrane to Cox17 in the mitochondria. The Atx1 chaperone delivers copper to the Golgi, where it is pumped into the lumen of the secretory compartment by the P-type ATPase Ccc2 (13Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J.

Mac1 is activated in response to copper deprivation, leading to transcription of the genes involved in high affinity copper uptake, such as CTR1, CTR3, and FRE1 (20Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J.

Previous experiments using a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DBD and the Mac1 TAD demonstrated that the TAD is responsive to changes in bioavailable copper levels (23Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal Mac1 TAD contains two cysteine- and histidine-rich domains, REP-I (C1) and REP-II (C2), that each binds four Cu1+ ions in a tetranuclear copper cluster (24Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mutations in the C1 domain lead to constitutively active Mac1up proteins, whereas analogous mutations in the C2 domain decrease the trans-activation of Mac1 (19Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A.

Cell. 2005; 4: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that a constitutively active Mac1up1 protein binds fewer copper ions per molecule than the wild type protein (24Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mac1up1 is constitutively bound to the promoter of its target genes (20Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that loss of copper ions from Mac1 may be important for its activation. Studies using yeast two-hybrid analysis also indicate that copper starvation results in release of an intramolecular interaction between the Mac1 DBD and TAD (24Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Although it has previously been demonstrated that Mac1 protein fragments bind copper ions and that this binding is important for its regulation (24Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is unclear how copper binding may be regulated. Previous studies have shown that Mac1 is a nuclear resident protein, suggesting that copper is either assembled co-translationally or is delivered to the nucleus in order to regulate Mac1 (19Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, there is virtually no free copper in the cell, and it has been demonstrated that copper is associated almost exclusively with either chaperones or the copper-containing proteins that are targets of these chaperones (30Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar).We began with the hypothesis that one of the three known copper chaperone proteins, Atx1, Cox17, or Ccs1, might be responsible for copper delivery to or removal from Mac1. Here we find that both Ccs1 and its target, Sod1, are necessary for robust activation of Mac1 in response to low copper conditions. We found that the requirement for Ccs1 during Mac1 activation is due to its role in delivery of copper to Sod1 and that the disproportionation of superoxide is necessary for Mac1 activation. However, the role of Sod1 in Mac1 activation appears to be more complex than simply a global protection against oxidative stress, since both genetic and chemical suppression of oxidative stress in sod1Δ cells failed to restore Mac1 activity to wild type levels. Moreover, we demonstrated that Sod1 and the Ccs1 copper chaperone partially localize to the yeast nucleus and that deletion of SOD1 reduces the ability of Mac1 to bind to CuRE elements in the genome upstream of the CTR1 gene in response to low copper bioavailability. Taken together, these results suggest that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase enzyme plays a role in the sensing or responding to copper deficiency to activate gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Plasmids—All isogenic S. cerevisiae deletion strains were created by replacement of the endogenous locus with a floxed kanamycin resistance cassette and subsequent removal of this cassette (31Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). The sod1Δ pmr1Δ double mutant was created by deletion of PMR1 in an sod1Δ strain, and the ccs1Δ sod1Δ double mutant was created by deletion of SOD1 in a ccs1Δ strain. The SOD1-GFP and the MAC1-TAP strains were obtained from the GFP- and TAP-tagged collections (32Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S.

Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The MAC1-TAP sod1Δ strain was created by deletion of SOD1 in the MAC1-TAP background. The MAC1up1 strain and its wild type parental strain have been previously described (19Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and the MAC1up1 sod1Δ isogenic variant was created by deletion of SOD1 in this strain. The Y190 yeast strain was used in the yeast one/two-hybrid experiments, and the Y190 sod1Δ strain was created by deletion of the SOD1 gene in the Y190 background (34Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The GAL1–10-LacZ reporter plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Alan Hinnebusch. The Caenorhabditis elegans SOD1 plasmid was previously described by Jensen and Culotta (35Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41373-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ySOD1 plasmid was created by cloning a PCR fragment containing the SOD1 gene and its endogenous promoter and terminator as an XbaI/XhoI fragment into the pRS416 vector. The SOD1 plasmid was created by subcloning the SOD1 sequence from ySOD1 as an XbaI/Xho1 fragment into the pRS415 vector. The SOD1R143D and the SOD1G85R alleles encoding catalytically inactive SOD1 mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis of SOD1 using overlap PCR and then cloned as BamHI/XhoI fragments into pRS415 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment with the coding sequence for the first 105 amino acids of SCO2 as an in-frame amino-terminal fusion with the SOD1 gene under the control of the SOD1 promoter was created using overlap PCR and cloned by gap repair into pRS415 to create the SCO2-SOD1 plasmid. The pGB4D1-Trp MAC1 1–159, pVT102-Leu VP16, pVT102-leu MAC1 240–417, and pVT102-leu MAC1up1 240–417 plasmids were a generous gift from Dr. Dennis Winge (24Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the yeast one-hybrid experiment, a PCR product containing codons 42–417 of the MAC1 gene was cloned by gap repair as an in frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the pGBKT7 plasmid backbone (Clontech).β-Galactosidase Activity Assay for Mac1 Function—Cells were transformed with the previously described Mac1 reporter plasmid pCm64CTR3-LacZ or pRSCTR3-LacZ (20Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).RNA Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted from cells grown to mid-log phase using a modified hot phenol method (39Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). CTR1 or ACT1 gene fragments were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP to be used as probes. Quantification of the RNA blot was performed using ImageQuant TL version 2003.02 software (Amersham Biosciences) and processed using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 (Adobe Systems).Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were prepared either using a glass bead/Triton X-100 method (6Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by alkali extraction (40Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated using the Yeast Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Sigma) and then resuspended in buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA and solubilized on ice for 30 min. SDS-PAGE was performed, and samples were probed with anti-Sod1 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Thomas O’Halloran), anti-TAP antibody (Open Biosystems), anti-Pgk1 antibody (Invitrogen), or anti-Por1 antibody (Molecular Probes).Functional Assays for Sod1 and Mac1—For phenotypic analysis, wild type and mutants were spotted on SC plates, SC -lysine plates, SC -methionine -lysine plates, or media containing ethanol (2%) and glycerol (3%) as the sole carbon sources (YPEG). To test superoxide dismutase catalytic activity, protein extracts were obtained using the glass bead/Triton X-100 method, and samples were subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis followed by nitro blue tetrazolium staining (41Flohe L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Mac1-TAP protein function was tested by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions of cells on YPD, YPEG, and YPEG with 100 μm CuSO4.Fluorescence Microscopy—A BY4742-derived yeast strain with a functional genomic fusion of GFP at the carboxyl terminus of the SOD1 or CCS1 open reading frame was used for localization of Sod1 and Ccs1, respectively (33Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar).ChIP PCR Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as previously described (42Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H. Strahl B.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 3 h to mid-log phase in YPD medium, 100 μm CuSO4 or 500 μm BCS was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 15 min before cross-linking with formaldehyde. After cell lysis by vortexing with glass beads and ultrasonication to shear DNA, 250 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with IgG-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The precipitated DNA was used for PCR with primers for either the CTR1 promoter region or the CMD1 promoter region. The primers used to amplify the CTR1 promoter region were 5′-TAA GGA TCG AAA CTG CAC CTC AAC-3′ and 5′-ACA TAC AAG ACC CTC TCG AGA TGA CA-3′. The primers used to amplify the CMD1 promoter region were 5′-CGCTTCCTCTCAATTCCCAAAGT-3′ and 5′-GTG ATG TAG GAC ACT CTC CAA GG-3′. PCRs were performed using serial dilutions of the output DNA to be sure that the reaction was in the linear range, and the ChIP experiment was repeated three times with similar results. The data presented are representative of three independent experiments. Digital images of ChIP results were quantitated using ImageQuant software and processed using Adobe Photoshop.RESULTSThe Ccs1 Copper Chaperone Is Required for Robust Activation of Mac1—In S. cerevisiae, expression of the high affinity copper uptake system is regulated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1. Mac1 has been demonstrated to be a nuclear resident protein, and protein fragments have been shown to directly bind copper atoms, suggesting that the copper status of Mac1 could be important to its regulation. The mechanism by which copper is incorporated into this protein remains unknown, and it is unclear how copper might enter or leave the nucleus. We began by testing whether one of the three known copper chaperones, Atx1, Ccs1, or Cox17, is involved in the regulation of Mac1. A CTR3-LacZ reporter plasmid that contains two copies of the CuRE from the CTR3 promoter upstream of the LacZ gene was used to quantitate Mac1 activity. We found that the yeasts lacking CCS1 display a severe defect in the activation of Mac1 in response to decreased copper availability induced by supplementation of the growth medium with the copper-specific chelator BCS. Cells harboring an atx1Δ allele do not show defects in activation of the Mac1 reporter, and, as expected, mac1Δ cells are completely defective in CTR3-LacZ activity in response to copper deficiency (Fig. 1A). The cox17Δ mutant also displays a defect in activation of the Mac1 reporter. However, these same cells show a significant reduction in activation of a reporter gene for the unfolded protein response (supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggest that the COX17-dependent defect in activation of the Mac1 reporter is due to a more general loss of transcriptional regulation. RNA blotting analysis of the CTR1 transcript confirmed that ccs1Δ mutants show decreased induction of this Mac1 target gene in response to copper deprivation as compared with wild type cells. As expected, mac1Δ cells show nearly undetectable levels of CTR1 mRNA (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar results were observed with the transcript of a second Mac1 target, FRE1, indicating that Ccs1 plays a more general, rather than a CTR1-specific, role in Mac1 activation. 4L. K. Wood and D. J. Thiele, unpublished data.Cu,Zn-superoxide Dismutase Functions in the Activation of Mac1—The copper chaperone Ccs1 delivers copper to the Sod1 enzyme in a series of steps that are critical for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activation in yeast (16Culotta V.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Two possibilities could explain the diminished ability of ccs1Δ mutants to activate Mac1 in response to low copper. First, it is possible that Ccs1 functions directly in the activation of Mac1. Second, it is possible that the defect of ccs1Δ cells is an indirect effect due to an inability to deliver copper to, and thus activate, Sod1. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells harboring a wild type CCS1 gene but lacking SOD1 were tested for the ability to activate the CTR3-LacZ reporter plasmid in response to copper deprivation. sod1Δ mutants display a Mac1 regulation phenotype that phenocopies ccs1Δ cells, consistent with the observation that yeast Sod1 is largely dependent on Ccs1 for its activation (Fig. 2A) (46Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As expected, mac1Δ cells are completely defective in activation of CTR1 expression under conditions of copper deficiency. This reduced ability to activate Mac1 is also evident at the level of Mac1 target mRNA, as shown by RNA blotting analysis of the CTR1 transcript (Fig. 2, B and C). The poor activation of Mac1 in an sod1Δ strain is not due to a general defect in gene transcription, since the induction of the galactose-inducible reporter plasmid is unaffected in sod1Δ cells (Fig. 2D). However, deletion of SOD1 in a strain expressing the constitutively active MAC1up1 allele does not affect the regulation of Mac1 protein (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that the Sod1 protein is also required for physiological Mac1 activation in the same pathway as Ccs1, yet this requirement can be bypassed by a constitutively active variant of the Mac1 protein.FIGURE 2Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase functions in the activation of Mac1. A, sod1Δ cells exhibit defects in the induction of a Mac1 reporter plasmid upon copper depletion. WT, ccs1Δ, and sod1Δ cells transformed with the CTR3-LacZ reporter plasmid were grown to mid-log phase in complete media or media with 10 μm or 100 μm BCS and β-galactosidase assays were performed. ccs1Δ cells and sod1Δ display similar defects in the ability to activate the Mac1 reporter in response to limiting copper. Samples were analyzed in triplicate and data are representative of at least three independent experiments. B, the induction of Mac1 target mRNA upon copper depletion is decreased in sod1Δ cells. RNA blotting analysis for the CTR1 transcript also indicates that sod1Δ mutants show decreased activation of Mac1 in response to copper deprivation. C, quantification of mRNA blots from B.

The subcellular localization of 5-LO is regulated, with nuclear import commonly leading to increased leukotriene production. We report here that 5-LO is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser-271 in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. This residue is nested in a classical nuclear export sequence, and phosphorylated Ser-271 5-LO was exclusively found in the nucleus by immunofluorescence and by fractionation techniques. Mutation of Ser-271 to Ala allowed nuclear export of 5-LO that was blocked by the specific nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin b, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-271 serves to interfere with exportin-1-mediated nuclear export. Consistent with previous reports that purified 5-LO can be phosphorylated on Ser-271 in vitro by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, the nuclear export of 5-LO was increased by either treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB 203,580 or co-expression of a kinase-deficient p38 MAPK. Nuclear export of 5-LO can also be induced by KN-93, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, and the effects of SB 203,580 plus KN-93 are additive. Finally, HeLa cells, which lack nuclear 5-LO, also lack constitutive phosphorylation of Ser-271. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser-271 serves to inhibit the nuclear export of 5-LO. This action works in concert with nuclear import, which is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser-523, to determine the subcellular distribution of 5-LO, which in turn regulates leukotriene biosynthesis.

In particular, LTB4 promotes the recruitment and activation of leukocytes, stimulates phagocytosis and killing of pathogens, and promotes the synthesis of proteins involved in the inflammatory process. Through these effects and others, the overproduction of LTB4 helps drive the chronic inflammation that characterizes asthma (2Drazen J.M. Lilly C.M. Sperling R. Rubin P. Israel E. Adv.

The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) initiates the biosynthesis of LTs from the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid and represents a key point of regulation. In its resting state 5-LO is a soluble enzyme that can reside in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus (27Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

The 5-LO protein has three nuclear import sequences that can be regulated and function independently from one another (30Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Jones S.M. Luo M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol.

These sequences determine the degree of nuclear localization of 5-LO, as they act additively rather than redundantly (32Luo M. Pang C.W.M. Gerken A.E. Brock T.G. Traffic. 2004; 5: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is important because the amount of LTB4 produced upon 5-LO activation increases with the amount of 5-LO present within the nucleus (33Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Luo M. Jones S.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12165-12170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser-523 on 5-LO via the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway serves to inhibit nuclear import (35Luo M. Jones S.M. Flamand N. Aronoff D.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40609-40616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and inhibit LTB4 biosynthesis (36Luo M. Jones S.M. Coffey M.J. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Exaggerated nuclear import of 5-LO could, therefore, play an important role in the overproduction of LTB4 associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. Much less is known about the regulation of nuclear export of 5-LO. It appears that 5-LO can be exported by an exportin-1-like mechanism, as treatment of CHO cells overexpressing a fusion protein involving 5-LO and green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the exportin-1 inhibitor leptomycin b (lmb) reduced cytoplasmic 5-LO (37Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Exportin-1 binds a nuclear export sequence (NES) on target proteins. By forming a heterotrimer with a target protein and ranGTP, exportin-1 mediates one form of nuclear export (for review, see Ref. 38Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Exportin-1 binds leucine-rich NESs with the consensus pattern of LXXLXL or LXXXLXL, where X is any intervening residue. Other hydrophobic residues and, in particular, isoleucine, may replace the leucines. Some NESs have been recognized to have a specific secondary structure, with a portion of the NES residing on an α-helix and a portion extending onto an adjacent random coil (39Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 40Meng W. Swenson L.L.

This structure is found in NESs from p53, IκBα, MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK)-2 and 14–3-3. To our knowledge, no region of 5-LO that matches these features has been identified to date. The nuclear export of proteins can be regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including phosphorylation. For example, phosphorylation of the retinoic acid receptor RXRα by Jun kinase activates its export from the nucleus (41Zimmerman T.L. Thevananther S. Ghose R. Burns A.R. Karpen S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of ERK5 by MEK5 inhibits its nuclear export (42Kondoh K. Terasawa K. Morimoto H. Nishida E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1679-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Notably, the purpose of phosphorylation in these examples is not to alter intrinsic activity; indeed, RXRα is not an enzyme. In vitro experiments have shown that recombinant 5-LO can be phosphorylated on Ser-271, by MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK-2) and possibly by MK-3 (43Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and by protein kinase A (44Werz O. Szellas D. Steinhilber D. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of Ser-271 has been demonstrated in vitro, it has yet to be demonstrated in cells or tissues. Importantly, assays of 5-LO activity indicated that phosphorylation of Ser-271 in vitro had no appreciable effect on enzyme activity (43Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 44Werz O. Szellas D. Steinhilber D. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that phosphorylation of Ser-271 serves some purpose other than to alter the intrinsic activity of 5-LO. In this study we sought to determine whether phosphorylation of Ser-271 affected nuclear export of 5-LO. Specifically, we asked if Ser-271 might already be phosphorylated in cells with nuclear 5-LO and, hypothesizing that phosphorylation might inhibit export, would dephosphorylation or mutation of Ser-271 allow exportin-1-dependent export of 5-LO. This would be particularly relevant to inflammatory signaling given that the subcellular localization of 5-LO strongly affects LTB4 biosynthesis. Sequence and Structural Analysis—Amino acid sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Primary accession numbers for proteins are: for 5-LOs, human P09917, mouse P48999, rat P12527, hamster P51399, dog XP_534950, opossum XP_001364255, cow XP_613515; for rabbit 15-LO, P12630.

Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and DNA Construction—Plasmids containing the wild type (WT) 5-LO and the S523A and the S271A mutants of 5-LO alone in pcDNA or fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pEGFP have been described previously(34Luo M.

Substitutions of Leu-270 and Leu-272 with Ala in 5-LO were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Mutations and protein frame reading were verified by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Sequencing Core, University of Michigan). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). Plasmid and oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoblotting—NIH 3T3, HeLa, and COS-1 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (complete medium). IMR-90 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3 empty vector, pcDNA3-p38-kinase-deficient, or pcDNA3-MAPK kinase 3, described previously (47Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), were maintained in similar medium with 200 μg/ml Geneticin before performing experiments. Cells were plated at 70% confluency and transfected with plasmids using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 16–20 h post-transfection cells were treated with complete medium containing various compounds including 1–30 μm SB 203,580, 0.1–10 μm KN-93, or 5 ng/ml lmb for 0–6 h. After treatment cells were washed with PBS, harvested by a rubber policeman, and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) with complete protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science). Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking, the membranes were probed with either a polyclonal antibody raised against a phosphorylated Ser-271 peptide kindly provided by Dr. Qingyuan Ge (Cell Signaling Technologies), or LO-32 or H-5, two antisera against human 5-LO and FLAP, respectively (a generous gift of Dr. J. F. Evans, Merck Research Laboratories) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). Cell Fractionation—NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing WT 5-LO and FLAP were harvested, washed with cold (4 °C) PBS, then fractionated as described previously (48Flamand N. Lefebvre J. Surette M.E. Picard S. Borgeat P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were disrupted in cold (4 °C) lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml of both aprotinin and leupeptin, and complete proteases and phosphatases inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)), vortexed for 20 s, placed on ice for 5 min, then centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was then added to the resulting supernatants (non-nuclear fraction), pellets (nuclear fraction), or whole cell lysates. Samples were boiled for 10 min then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot as described in the previous section. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells grown on chamber slides (four chambers per slide) were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA overnight, then washed and treated as described. For immunostaining, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in permeabilization buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (titer 1:250) in blocking buffer for 1 h. Mounting was done in mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were visualized and imaged using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped for epifluorescence and digital image capture using a SPOT RT camera or using an Olympus FluoView 500 laser scanning confocal microscope. Quantitation of Subcellular Distribution—As described previously (30Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 100 positively transfected NIH 3T3 cells were scored by blinded evaluators as to whether nuclear fluorescence was greater than, equal to, or less than cytosolic fluorescence. Care was taken to avoid damaged, dead, or autofluorescent cells. Results from at least three independent transfections were used for statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using p < 0.05 as indicative of statistical significance. Pairs of group means were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer post test. Ser-271 Is Phosphorylated on 5-LO in Untreated NIH 3T3 Cells—The finding that 5-LO could be phosphorylated on Ser-271 by MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 in vitro (43Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was the first unequivocal report of direct phosphorylation of the 5-LO protein. However, an absence of evidence that this phosphorylation could occur in living cells (e.g. when p38 MAPK was activated in cells in the presence of radiolabeled phosphate) raised many questions. We hypothesized that induced phosphorylation of Ser-271 would be difficult to demonstrate if that residue was already phosphorylated. This was tested using an antibody raised against a peptide containing phosphorylated Ser-271. Cellular proteins from NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing WT 5-LO or GFP/5-LO, when assayed for 5-LO with phosphorylated Ser-271 (p271 5-LO) by immunoblot, produced bands at ∼78 kDa for WT 5-LO and ∼105 kDa for GFP/5-LO, and these corresponded to bands detected with an antibody for total 5-LO (Fig. 1). The p271 5-LO antibody did not detect 5-LO when Ser-271 was mutated to Ala, and it did not detect a band in untransfected NIH 3T3 cells. The antibody successfully detected S523A 5-LO; stripping and reprobing of the blot for total unphosphorylated 5-LO indicated similar levels of 5-LO expression in the different sets of transfected cells. 5-LO as well as p271 5-LO appeared as a doublet when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, as has been observed previously (36Luo M. Jones S.M. Coffey M.J. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41512-41520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results indicate that at least a portion of the total cellular 5-LO in transfected, but otherwise untreated, NIH 3T3 cells is phosphorylated on Ser-271. Structural Analysis of the Ser-271 Region—To potentially gain some insight into the purpose of phosphorylation on Ser-271, we evaluated its structural context. In primary sequences from the known or predicted 5-LOs of different species, Ser-271 is conserved as either a Ser or Thr (Fig. 2). In fact, the only variations near Ser-271 are conservative substitutions at Gln-269 and Gln-274. The predicted sequences for dog, opossum, and cow indicate that Ser-271 may be replaced with Thr, which could still be targeted by a Ser/Thr kinase. Importantly, the Leu residues surrounding Ser-271 (Leu-266, Leu-270, Leu-272) are conserved in all 5-LO species. The remarkable similarity of primary sequence of the Ser-271 region across the 5-LOs from different species contrasts with its dissimilarity with the parallel region from rabbit reticulocyte 15-LO (Fig. 2). The Ser-271 region rests atop the catalytic domain of 5-LO, distant from the regulatory PLAT domain, according to published putative models of 5-LO tertiary structure (49Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 75-83Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 50Lu¨tteke T. Krieg P. Fu¨rstenberger G. von der Lieth C.W. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2482-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Ser-271 region is held in place by two β-strands of a four β-strand complex that appears to be found in all LOs, plant, and animal. In the different 5-LOs there are consistently 33 residues between the conserved β-strands, whereas there are 29 residues in the 15-LOs, which accounts for 4 missing residues in any homology alignment (e.g. Fig. 2). Computer modeling (50Lu¨tteke T. Krieg P. Fu¨rstenberger G. von der Lieth C.W. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2482-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicates that the Ser-271 region is a short α-helix, with Ser-271 at the amino terminus. In addition, the hydrophobic residue Leu-270 sits just outside the helix and projects outward, away from the catalytic domain. Thus, the Ser-271 region is highly conserved among and unique to the 5-LOs, structurally resembles an NES (at least according to computer modeling), and is projected externally. Subcellular Localization of p271 5-LO—The finding that Ser-271 is embedded in a potential NES suggested that the subcellular localization of p271 5-LO as well as total 5-LO should be determined. When NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 5-LO/GFP and stained for p271 using the phospho-specific antibody, 5-LO/GFP was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A), whereas p271 5-LO was strictly nuclear (Fig. 3B), as indicated by DNA staining (Fig. 3C). The phosphorylated 5-LO was indeed intranuclear, as analysis utilized confocal microscopy. Similar results were obtained by analyzing cells transfected to express WT 5-LO and FLAP by cell fractionation combined with immunoblotting (Fig. 3D). That is, p271 5-LO was predominantly found in nuclear fractions, whereas total 5-LO was evident in both non-nuclear and nuclear fractions. The 5-LO activating protein, FLAP, known to be a nuclear membrane-associated protein (51Soberman R.J. Christmas P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was used as a nuclear marker. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Ser-271—The similarity of the Ser-271 region to a classical NES suggested that this region might interact with the classical exportin, exportin-1. Furthermore, knowing that Ser-271 is phosphorylated (Fig. 1) and that p271 5-LO is predominantly nuclear in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Ser-271 blocks the export of 5-LO from the nucleus toward the cytosol. To assess this, we mutated Ser-271 to Ala and examined the effect on 5-LO subcellular distribution. Replacing only Ser-271 with Ala produced a significant change in the subcellular distribution of 5-LO; significantly more cells had either balanced nuclear and cytoplasmic 5-LO or predominantly cytoplasmic 5-LO (Fig. 4B). Importantly, NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing S271A 5-LO produce significantly less than half as much LTB4 when stimulated with calcium ionophore (10 μm) with added arachidonic acid (10 μm) versus cells with WT 5-LO (1912 + 232 versus 4570 + 807 pg/ml; p < 0.01) (34Luo M. Jones S.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12165-12170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells expressing S271A 5-LO with the nuclear export inhibitor lmb (5 ng/ml, 2 h) resulted in the redistribution of 5-LO to the nucleus (Fig. 4C). These changes were evaluated by scoring more than 100 cells per condition for whether nuclear fluorescence was greater than, equal to, or less than cytosolic fluorescence and analyzing values from three independent experiments. Quantitative analysis indicated that for the S271A mutation, statistically more cells had a balanced (n = C) or cytoplasmic (N < C) fluorescence distribution than did WT 5-LO (Fig. 4D). In addition, there was no statistical difference between the subcellular distribution of fluorescence in cells expressing S271A treated with lmb and that of cells expressing WT 5-LO with or without lmb (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained when fluorescence was from GFP using GFP/5-LO fusion proteins or from immunofluorescence of 5-LO in constructs lacking GFP (not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-271 increased the rate of lmb-sensitive nuclear export of 5-LO. Role of p38 MAPK on 5-LO Distribution—As a first approach to assess the role of p38 MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-271 on 5-LO, we used IMR-90 cells (normal fetal lung fibroblasts) stably transfected with MAPK kinase 3, which activates p38, or a kinase-deficient p38. These cells have been characterized previously (47Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). IMR-90 cells stably expressing MAPK kinase 3, and thus having constitutively active p38 MAPK, and transfected with GFP/5-LO have predominantly nuclear 5-LO (Fig. 5B), like WT IMR-90 cells transfected with GFP/5-LO (Fig. 5A). However, cells stably expressing a kinase-deficient p38 MAPK have more cells with 5-LO balanced in distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). Quantitative analysis supported that the distribution of 5-LO in the latter cells was statistically different from that in either the WT cells or the MAPK kinase 3 cells (data not shown). The role of p38 MAPK in 5-LO distribution was also assessed using the p38 inhibitor SB 203,580. Initial experiments indicated that SB 203,580 produced time- and dose-dependent changes in the subcellular distribution of 5-LO (not shown). At 1–10 μm, SB 203,580 caused a slow shift of GF"

The protein kinase TBK1 is critically involved in virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. In this study, we identify an alternatively spliced isoform of TBK1, termed TBK1s, which lacks exons 3–6. Upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection, TBK1s is induced in both human and mouse cells and binds to RIG-1, disrupting the interaction between RIG-I and VISA. Consistent with that result, overexpression of TBK1s inhibits IRF3 nuclear translocation and leads to a shutdown of SeV-triggered IFN-β production.

CO2 at 37 °C. L929 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10! fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The method for generation of bone marrow dendritic cells (GM-CSF-DC) has been described previously (26Hou W. Wu Y. Sun S. Shi M. Sun Y. Yang C. Pei G. Gu Y. Zhong C. Sun B. J.

TBK1-/- MEFs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infection—293T, L929, Huh7, TBK1-1 MEF, and GM-CSF-DC cells were infected with the indicated concentration of SeV in serum-free medium. After incubation for 2 h, cells were added with the same volume medium containing 20! fetal calf serum. After infection, cells were collected and used for various experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cultures of HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with various combinations of plasmids. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were performed as described before (27Shi M. Deng W. Bi E. Mao K. Ji Y. Lin G. Wu X. Tao Z. Li Z. Cai X. Sun S. Xiang C. Sun B. Nat.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4! formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5! Triton X-100, blocked, and nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence images were captured with a Leica TCS SP2 laser confocal microscope. Reporter Assays—Cells (1 × 105/well in 24-well plates) were transfected with the indicate amount of expression plasmids combined with 100 ng of indicated reporter genes and 40 ng of pRL-TK (Clontech). The total DNA concentration was kept constant by supplementing with empty vector pcDNA3.0. In some experiments, cells were infected with SeV after transfection. In all experiments, cells were lysed, and reporter activity was analyzed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The values represented the average of three independent experiments with variability shown by the error bars. Statistics—All measurements were performed in at least three independent experiments, and the means ± S.D. were calculated. The Student's t test was used to compare two independent groups. For all tests, values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Identification of a Splice Variant of TBK1, termed TBK1s, Which Lacks Exons 3–6—The mouse Tbk1 gene is organized into 21 exons and 20 introns (Fig. 1A). Exons 2–6 (corresponding to amino acids 1–234) encode the S_TKc domain, which mediates the phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7. RT-PCR for TBK1 on RNA isolated from BM-DC infected with 10 HAU/ml Sendai virus reveals two cDNA species of 2190 and 1567 bps, respectively (Fig. 1B). Sequence analysis shows that the larger band is identical to the published sequence of full-length Tbk1, while the smaller band represents an alternative splicing isoform of Tbk1, lacking exons 3–6 and subsequently referred to as Tbk1s. Excision of exons 3–6 results in translation from the second ATG and leads to an in-frame deletion of the kinase domain (amino acids 1–234) (Fig. 1A). Moreover, analysis of genomic locus that contains the human TBK1 sequence suggests a similar splice acceptor-donor site that could lead to a splice variant similar to the mouse TBK1s isoform. To further investigate the existence of the Tbk1 spliced isoform in human, we designed human Tbk1 isoform-specific primers and Tbk1s isoform-specific primers based on the difference of splicing site (human Tbk1 NCBI GenBank™ Accession Number: NM_013254). Human hepatoma Huh7 cells were infected with Sendai virus and the expression of human TBK1 and TBK1s mRNA were measured by RT-PCR using human Tbk1 isform-specific primers and human Tbk1s isoform-specific primers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1C, a Tbk1s-specific PCR product (∼60 bp) was detected in cells infected with SeV. To further confirm the existence of the TBK1 spliced isoform, we analyzed TBK1s protein expression. To assess this, we used rabbit polyclonal antibodies against amino acids 355–729 of mouse TBK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect the presence of TBK1s protein, and cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with TBK1s plasmid served as positive control. In addition to an endogenous ∼75-kDa band (TBK1 protein), an endogenous ∼55-kDa protein (TBK1s protein), which was consistent with exogenous expression of TBK1s in 293T was recognized in BM-DC infected with SeV (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, TBK1s protein could be induced in Huh7 cells treated with SeV or IFNβ (Fig. 1E). Compared with the constitutive expression of TBK1, the expression of TBK1s was inducible and lower. The tissue distribution of TBK1s expression, assessed by immunoblot analysis, showed that brain, heart, kidney, lymph node, and thymus had relative high expression of TBK1s protein (Fig. 1F). Intriguingly, TBK1s protein was more abundant than TBK1 protein in heart and kidney. Our data not only demonstrated the existence of the Tbk1 spliced isoform in both mouse and human cells, but also led us to further investigate the function of TBK1s. The Kinase Domain of TBK1 Is Critical for the Induction of IFN-β—Initially, to investigate the function of TBK1s, TBK1-/- MEF cells were reconstituted with plasmids encoding TBK1 or TBK1s, and cells were infected with SeV after transfection. Expression of the transfected protein in TBK1-/- MEF cells were first confirmed by immunoblot assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, TBK1 and TBK1s protein were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells. Luciferase assays showed that expression of TBK1 but not TBK1s could induce IFN-β promoter reporter activity upon SeV infection (Fig. 2B). Consistently, the expression of TBK1 but not TBK1s in these cells strongly induced Ifnb and IP-10 mRNA (Fig. 2C). Previous studies had shown that TBK1 mediates its effects via IRF3 (20Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar, 23McWhirter S.M. Fitzgerald K.A.

A. 2004; 101: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), we therefore analyzed nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon SeV infection. To assess this, TBK1-/- MEF cells were transfected with IRF3-GFP plasmid in addition, and nuclear translocation of IRF3 was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy after SeV infection. As shown in Fig. 2D, SeV infection resulted in translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus in cells transfected with TBK1 plasmid. In contrast, GFP-IRF3 remained in the cytoplasm in cells transfected with TBK1s plasmid. Together, these data indicate that the kinase domain of TBK1 is essential for its mediated signaling pathway. TBK1s Specifically Inhibits SeV-induced IFN-β Activation—It has been reported that TBK1 is essential for Type I interferon production in virus-triggered signaling pathway. Because TBK1s is an alternative splicing isoform of TBK1, which lacks the kinase domain, we hypothesized that TBK1s could play an inhibitory role on this pathway. To test this hypothesis, 293T cells were transfected with TBK1s plasmid or the vector control, and infected with different doses of SeV after 24 h of transfection. In reporter gene assays, TBK1s inhibited SeV-triggered activation of ISRE and IFN-β promoter, whereas it slightly enhanced SeV-triggered activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we measured the effect of TBK1s on the induction of type I IFN-inducible genes including Ifnb, IP-10, and the NF-κB-dependent gene IL-8 by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3B, TBK1s inhibited expression of Ifnb and IP-10 mRNA induced by SeV, while TBK1s had no effect on expression of IL-8 mRNA. These data suggest that TBK1s specifically inhibits SeV-induced IFN-β activation. We also assessed the expression of transfected TBK1s protein. Immunoblot analysis with anti-TBK1 antibody showed that ectopic expression of TBK1s is about once higher than that of endogenous TBK1 protein (Fig. 3C). To further evaluate the effect of TBK1s on the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, nuclear extracts from SeV-infected 293T cells were analyzed for the presence of IRF3. The accumulation of IRF3 in the nucleus triggered by SeV was inhibited when 293T cells were transfected with TBK1s plasmid, whereas NF-κB subunit p65 translocation was not affected (Fig. 3D). Together, these observations show that TBK1s negatively regulates SeV-triggered IRF3 but not the NF-κB activation pathway. TBK1s Inhibits RIG-I- but Not VISA- or TBK1-mediated Activation of IFN-β Promoter—To elucidate the mechanism for the negative effect of TBK1s on SeV-triggered IFN-β signaling pathway, we first used reporter gene assays to locate the target of TBK1s. As TBK1s lacks a kinase domain compared with full-length TBK1, we theorized that TBK1s might inhibit TBK1-mediated activation. To address this, 293T cells were transfected with TBK1 plasmid, the indicated reporter, and increasing concentrations of TBK1s plasmid. Unexpectedly, our data revealed that TBK1s had no effect on ISRE or the IFN-β promoter activity induced by TBK1 (Fig. 4A, supplemental Fig. S1A). Because TBK1 is activated downstream of RIG-I and VISA in response to SeV, we then investigated the effect of TBK1s on RIG-I- and VISA-mediated activation of ISRE, the IFN-β promoter, and NF-κB. RIG-I or VISA combined with the indicated reporter were transfected into 293T cells with increasing concentrations of TBK1s. As shown in Fig. 4B, TBK1s inhibited RIG-I-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, TBK1s had no effect on ISRE or the IFN-β promoter activity induced by VISA (Fig. 4C, supplemental Fig. S1C). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis with anti-TBK1 antibody showed that TBK1s could inhibit RIG-I-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter although ectopic expression of TBK1s protein was less than that of endogenous TBK1 protein (Fig. 4B). Consistent with previous data, TBK1s did not inhibit NF-κB activity induced by RIG-I, VISA, or TBK1 (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). These data suggest that TBK1s could target RIG-I. TBK1s Binds RIG-I and Disrupts the Interactions of RIG-I with VISA—Because TBK1s inhibited RIG-I- but not VISA- or TBK1-mediated signaling, we speculated that TBK1s may sequester RIG-I in an inactive complex and block its interaction with VISA. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether TBK1s could interact with RIG-I or VISA. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that the splice variant TBK1s but not full-length TBK1 can interact with RIG-I (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the interaction between TBK1s and VISA could not be detected (data not shown). Furthermore, to map the binding regions for RIG-I and TBK1s, we generated a series of FLAG-tagged truncation mutants of RIG-I and HA-tagged truncation mutants of TBK1s. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, the coiled-coil domain of TBK1s (amino acids 372–501) and the CARDs domain of RIG-I (amino acids 1–128) were found to be responsible for the interaction. It has been demonstrated that RIG-I initiates downstream signaling cascades via CARDs by association with VISA (13Meylan E. Curran J. Hofmann K. Moradpour D. Binder M. Bartenschlager R. Tschopp J.

Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Because TBK1s interacts with RIG-I via the CARDs domain of RIG-I, we assessed whether TBK1s can disrupt the interaction of RIG-I with VISA. The vector, TBK1s plasmid or TBK1s mutant 1–371 were transfected into 293T cells, and then the cells were infected with SeV. It was found that the interaction between RIG-I and VISA could be detected upon SeV infection, while ectopic expression of wild-type TBK1s in 293T cells was able to block the endogenous interaction of RIG-I with VISA (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, the TBK1s mutant 1–371, which lacks the coiled-coil domain, did not efficiently inhibit the interaction of RIG-I with VISA as did wild-type TBK1s. Consistent with these data, the TBK1s mutant 1–371 was unable to effectively inhibit SeV-triggered activation of the IFN-β promoter compared with wild-type TBK1s (Fig. 5F). To illustrate the physiological role of TBK1s, we also analyzed the endogenous interaction of TBK1s with RIG-I. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of lysates of L929 after SeV infection, which showed specific interaction between endogenous RIG-I and TBK1s (Fig. 5G). In contrast, the endogenous interaction between TBK1 and RIG-I could not be detected (Fig. 5G). In conclusion, the splice variant TBK1s negatively regulated SeV-triggered IFN-β signaling pathway through disrupting the interaction of RIG-I with VISA. Negative control of Type I IFN production is an essential physiological process and can be achieved at multiple levels. For instance, LGP2, a RNA helicase protein, which lacks CARD domains at its N terminus, can be induced by virus and serves as a negative regulator by sequestering viral RNA from RIG-I and MDA5 (29Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 30Venkataraman T.

RNF125, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates RIG-I-induced antiviral signaling through mediation of RIG-I degradation (33Arimoto K. Takahashi H. Hishiki T. Konishi H. Fujita T. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate a new mechanism of negative regulation of Type I IFN production by alternative splicing of TBK1 pre-mRNA. Alternative splicing is a mechanism that allows for individual genes to express multiple mRNAs that encode proteins with diverse and even antagonistic function. Indeed, alternative splicing has been described for various adaptors and transcription factors involved in antiviral response, including IRF family members (34Karpova A.Y. Howley P.M. Ronco L.V. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Mancl M.E. Hu G. Sangster-Guity N. Olshalsky S.L. Hoops K. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P. Pitha P.M. Pinder K. Barnes B.J. J. Biol.

Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been reported that IRF-5 alternatively spliced isoforms are differentially regulated by at least two alternative promoters, while the splicing of IRF-3 and IRF-3a transcripts may be regulated in a tissue-specific manner (34Karpova A.Y. Howley P.M. Ronco L.V. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Mancl M.E. Hu G. Sangster-Guity N. Olshalsky S.L. Hoops K. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P. Pitha P.M. Pinder K. Barnes B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21078-21090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that the expression of TBK1s, as compared with constitutive expression of TBK1, can be induced by SeV infection or IFNβ treatment. Furthermore, expression of Tbk1s was significantly higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from the HCV-infected patients than those in the healthy controls, while it was down-regulated in PBMC from the HCV-infected patients treated with IFN-α/ribavirin whose HCV RNA turn to negativity (HCV Neg) (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S1). Consistent with a previous report (40Vilasco M. Larrea E. Vitour D. Dabo S. Breiman A. Regnault B. Riezu J.I. Eid P. Prieto J. Meurs E.F. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 1635-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the expression of Tbk1 was not found to alter significantly upon HCV infection. Such a regulated production of TBK1s would result in the controlled inhibition of type I IFN production. Intriguingly, the ratio of TBK1s protein expression versus TBK1 protein expression in heart and kidney were really high, indicating TBK1s could be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. However, differential isoform expression and regulation of TBK1 remain to be addressed. Because TBK1s does not contain the kinase domain but does maintain the ability to bind IRF3 (data not shown), it was proposed that the mechanism by which TBK1s inhibits virus-triggered signaling pathway probably involves sequestration of TBK1 from IRF3, thereby preventing IRF3 activation. While the present study is in agreement with the negative regulatory role of TBK1s, differences were found in the proposed mechanism of inhibition. Actually, TBK1s inhibits RIG-I- but not TBK1-mediated activation of ISRE and the IFN-β promoter, and TBK1s negatively regulates virus-triggered IFN-β signaling pathway by disrupting the interaction of RIG-I with VISA. It is reasonable to assume that TBK1s targets RIG-I instead of TBK1. First, the expression of TBK1s is lower than that of TBK1 even upon Sendai virus infection (Figs. 1 and 5G); second, IRF3 phosphorylation mediated by TBK1 is not blocked in the presence of TBK1s (data not shown). In this study, we show that the coiled-coil domain of TBK1s is responsible for the interaction between RIG-I and TBK1s. Actually, full-length TBK1 also contains the coiled-coil domain. It is not yet clear why TBK1 does not bind to RIG-I but TBK1s does. Given the fact that kinase-defective TBK1 (K38A) can bind to RIG-I, we suggest that it would be related to the kinase activity (supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, RIG-I binds to TBK1s via its CARDs. It has been reported the Lys-172 residue of RIG-I is critical for efficient TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and for VISA binding (41Gack M.U. Shin Y.C. Joo C.H. Urano T. Liang C. Sun L. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Chen Z. Inoue S. Jung J.U. Nature. 2007; 446: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). In fact, RIG-I interacts with TBK1s through the Lys-172 and Lys-193 residues of RIG-I (supplemental Fig. S3). These data further supported the idea that TBK1s negatively regulates virus-triggered IFN-β signaling pathway by disrupting the interaction of RIG-I and VISA. It is notable that TBK1s negatively regulates virus-triggered IRF-3 but not NF-κB activation pathways. It is most likely that TBK1s is similar to MyD88s, a splice variant of MyD88 that differentially modulates NF-κB and AP-1-dependent gene expression in the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway (42Janssens S. Burns K. Vercammen E. Tschopp J. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 43Burns K. Janssens S. Brissoni B. Olivos N. Beyaert R. Tschopp J. J. Exp.

Biol. 2002; 12: 467-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We proposed other domains in TBK1s such as ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) might be responsible for differential regulation of the IRF3 and NF-κB pathway by TBK1s. Considerable further experimentation will be necessary to clarify the precise mechanism. We tried to further explore the physiological role of TBK1s by siRNA (data not shown). Unfortunately, neither of the two pairs of siRNA we designed based on the difference of the splicing sites could specifically knockdown TBK1s expression. Nonetheless, the regulated expression of TBK1s, endogenous interaction of TBK1s with RIG-I, and higher expression of TBK1s in HCV-infected patients indicate that TBK1s play an important role in modulating the virus-triggered signaling pathway.

Ligation of short RNA fragments could have liberated the prebiotic polymerization systems from the thermodynamically demanding task of reaching a (pre)genetically meaningful size by stepwise addition of one precursor monomer at the time. The origin of informational polymers is not understood. Considering only extant nucleic acids and according to the simplest possible logic, the progression of events could have been: synthesis of nucleic bases, formation of nucleosides thereof, activation by phosphorylation, polymerization of short oligonucleotides, their elongation, and eventually their survival through replication and evolution. The bottom-up approach to the origin of (pre)genetic polymers requires a definition of the minimal information. A minimal complexity of two different nucleotides (1Rich A. Kasha M. Pullman B.

Chemtracts. 1991; 2: 439-442Google Scholar) was proposed for the ancestral genetic system, major advantages being provided by the more prompt availability of the precursors and by the lower heterogeneity of suitable physical-chemical conditions. Based on the longer half-life of adenine and diamino purine (6Levy M. Miller S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7933-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and on the good yield of both compounds from aqueous ammonium cyanide (7Orò J.

Biol. 1968; 38: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a ribozyme composed of only these two different nucleotides was developed (9Reader J.S. Joyce G.F. Nature. 2002; 420: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It was reasonably claimed that “without at least two different subunits, there is no information and thus no basis for Darwinian evolution” (9Reader J.S. Joyce G.F. Nature. 2002; 420: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The “genetic” meaning of such a minimal molecular information is intrinsically limited. Evolution entails maintenance and at the same time the possibility of accepting variations of the macromolecular information. At some point in Darwinian evolution, nucleic polymers had to arise that were long enough to satisfy these divergent necessities. The nonenzymatic polymerization process has been studied for decades, the results essentially showing that polymers of several tens can be obtained (reviewed in Ref. 10Orgel L.E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 99-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) from preactivated precursors. The prebiotic validity of a process requiring complex preactivations has been questioned (4Wächtershäuser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1134-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Orgel L.E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 99-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 11Orgel L.E. Trends in Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An additional difficulty is to be found in the standard state Gibbs free energy change (12van Holde K. Halvorson H.O. van Holde K.E. The Origins of Life and Evolution. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1980: 31Google Scholar), which essentially states that condensation reactions are extremely inefficient in water. Considering the crucial step of elongation, the limit to the formation of nucleic polymers endowed of (pre)genetic potential is established by the intrinsic instability of long polymeric forms. If the polymerization process is slow, an equilibrium between synthesis and degradation of the polymer would rapidly be reached, preventing the accumulation of sufficiently long, (pre)genetically meaningful information. Polymer elongation by successive condensation steps adding one monomer at the time is not a likely mechanism for the accumulation of (pre)genetic information. Focusing on the stability problem, a detailed analysis was performed of the relative stabilities of the key chemical bonds (3′-phosphoesteric, 5′-phosphoesteric, and β-glycosidic) in RNA (13Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in DNA (14Saladino R. Crestini C. Busiello V. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35658-35669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For RNA, this analysis led to the conclusion that conditions exist in which the key bonds are more stable in the polymer than in the precursor monomer. In these conditions (water, temperature between 60 and 90 °C), the polymer is the fittest form (13Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Helv. Chim.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) further stabilize the polymer and widen the thermodynamic niche in which the accumulation of information is favored. If a condition is identified in which a ribozyme-like activity is exerted by a sequence-homogeneous oligonucleotide leading to sequence duplication, the basis would be established for the simplest replicatory system eventually able to incorporate mutations and evolve. We focus on the problem: if short RNA polymers form in a simple aqueous environment, does an intrinsic property of RNA exist that allows their spontaneous ligation, thus bypassing the mentioned difficulties?

Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were all purchased from Dharmacon and provided in the standard lyophilized form. Commercial distilled water was further purified by tridistillation-deionization with a MilliQ Advantage A10. Pure or Tris-HCl-buffered water was pretreated for 2 h at the temperature of the assay to be performed, a time lapse sufficient to reach and maintain the temperature-specific pH. The temperature-stabilized pH values (determined on a Beckman Ø 40 pH meter) are given throughout. RNA Labeling and Handling—For RNA 5′ labeling, 300 pmol of the oligonucleotide RNA were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). The oligonucleotide was then purified on a 16% denaturing acrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 8 m urea) gel. After elution, the residual polyacrylamide was removed by a NuncTrap Probe purification column (Stratagene). Subsequently the RNA, suspended in STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) was precipitated by the addition of glycogen (20 μg/μl of bidistilled sterile water) and 3 volumes of ethanol, kept overnight at -20 °C, centrifuged, washed once with 70% ethanol/water, and dehydrated (Savant, 13.000 rpm, 10 min, room temperature, environmental atmospheric pressure). The pellet was suspended in H2O, distributed in aliquots, immediately frozen, and conserved at -20 °C. Typically one aliquot was used for each experiment. Each experimental point consisted of 2–4 pmol of RNA (typically 15,000 cpm/pmol). The Ribo-oligonucleotide Ligation Protocols and Analyses—The basic ligation protocol consisted of the following steps: 20 pmol of 5′-labeled RNA (6 × 105 cpm) were resuspended in 45 μl of Tris-HCl-buffered water at the appropriate pH. This amount of RNA was normally used for six experimental points. A Tris-HCl-buffered solution of 20 mm 3′,5′-cAMP was added to reach a final volume of 90 μl. The sample was divided in six 15-μl aliquots and treated as appropriate for each experimental variable. A sample was immediately precipitated by the addition of 25 μl of MilliQ water, 50 μl of sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 7.5, 300 μl of 96% ethanol, 1 μl of 20 μg/μl glycogen. Before the addition of alcohol, the sample was thoroughly vortexed. The other samples were precipitated similarly after the appropriate treatments. Variants were tested of this basic protocol, and the oligonucleotides were treated at the temperature, time, and solution conditions indicated where appropriate. After precipitation the samples were suspended in 5 μl of formamide buffer, heated for 3 min at 65 °C, and loaded on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 8 m urea). Densitometric analysis was performed with Epson expression 1640 XL Kodak imaging software, and quantification was by OptiQuant 3.10. Fragment Size Determination—Given the known difficulty of obtaining precise size markers for large RNA molecules, the determination of the fragment lengths was verified by the linearity of their migration in semi-log plots. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows such linearity in the semi-log plots of molecules 24, 48, and 96 nucleotides long and of their combinations with a 15-mer: 39 (24 + 15), 69 (24 + 15 + 15 + 15), and 78 (24 + 24 + 15 + 15). The electrophoretic image of these data is shown in Fig. 3A. Supplemental Fig. S2 shows the same linearity observed for the molecules resulting from a complex series of ligations, affording fragments of the following sizes: 24, 34, 39, 48, 64, 69, 78, and 96 (data from Fig. 3C). Nuclease Treatment—Phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus venom (EC 3.1.4.1) (snake venom phosphodiesterase I) from Sigma (in vials of ≥0.4 units, purified, catalog number P3243) is a 5′-exonuclease that hydrolyzes 5′-mononucleotides from 3′-hydroxy-terminated ribo-oligonucleotides. It cleaves both 2′,5′- and 3′,5′ phosphodiester linkages, and it is here typically used at 1 milliunits/assay in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 20-μl assays. Stop mix (2 μl/tube) was 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, SDS 20%. One unit hydrolyzes 1.0 μmol of bis (p-nitrophenyl)phosphate/min at pH 8.8 at 37 °C. Nuclease P1 from Penicillium citrinum (EC 3.1.30.1) is from Sigma (catalog number N8630; specific activity, 200 units/mg protein). It catalyzes the sequence nonspecific endonucleolytic cleavage of single-stranded RNA to yield nucleoside 5′-phosphates and 5′-phospho-oligonucleotides. Specific for 3′,5′ phosphodiester linkages, it is here typically used at 1 × 10-3 units/sample in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.4, 5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2 in 20-μl assays. One unit liberates 1.0 μmol of acid-soluble nucleotides from RNA/min at pH 5.3 at 37 °C. Multimerization was observed by simply leaving ribo-oligonucleotides in water in the presence of an adenine-based nucleotide cofactor. The reaction is dependent upon time, type of cofactor, oligonucleotide length and sequence, temperature, and pH. Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of formation of dimer- and tetramer-sized multimers from both a 24-mer ribo-oligonucleotide (5′A23U3′)(first five lanes on the left) and from a 23-mer (5′A233′)(three rightmost lanes) as a function of increasing treatment periods. RNA oligomers were reacted in Tris-HCl-buffered water at 60 °C at pH 6.2. The formation of only even-numbered multimers was observed. The formation of multimers requires the presence of a cofactor (as detailed in Fig. 1B). The formation of the dimer precedes in time that of the tetramer (i.e. compare the relative intensities in Fig. 1A, lane 3). Detailed kinetics are reported in supplemental Fig. S3. The earlier onset of formation of the dimer relative to that of the tetramer is also described in detail (supplemental Fig. S3). The kinetic constants of the reactions leading to the formation of the dimers were determined at 40, 50, and 60 °C, based on kinetic analyses similar to that shown for 60 °C in supplemental Fig. S3: 2 × 10-3 h-1, 2.8 × 10-2 h-1, and 7.1 × 10-2 h-1, respectively. The constants for the reactions leading to tetramers were not determined, because of the complexity of the reaction for their formation (see Fig. 5). The background level was considered as the amount of dimer that is already formed at time 0, because of ligation reactions occurring during the handling of the sample.FIGURE 5A model explaining for the observed directionality of the ligation events. Oligomers are idealized as rods whose 5′ (red) and 3′ (black) extremities are indicated throughout by this color-code. Arrow A, 5′ to 5′ ligation brings to the impossibility (×) of continuing the reaction to form the tetramer. Arrow B, 3′ to 3′ ligation: same.

The dependence of ligation upon the concentration of cofactors is reported in Table 1.

The results (i.e. Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8) show that this is not the case and that ligation occurs for both types of extremities. A relatively higher efficiency was observed for the homogeneous A-stretch (compare in Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5 versus 6–8, and Table 2). An additional reason for the use of oligonucleotides with a U at the 3′ extremity is the empirically observed higher stability in water of the 3′-terminal ApU step (relative to the ApA steps) (not detailed). In a ladder of fragments produced by hydrolysis, this feature decreases the presence of the (n - 1) oligomer, thus facilitating, in kinetic analyses, the quantitative evaluation of full-sized molecules. In addition to ligation, during the treatment in water, the oligomers also undergo hydrolytic degradation, as shown by the ladder of bands below the monomer-sized 24-mer fragment.TABLE 2Quantitative analysis of ligation test system resultsSelf-ligating polymerLigation rateaGiven is the ligation rate in the condition that proved optimal for A23U, which has been scaled to 10,000 (see Table I)Tetramer vs. dimerbTetramer formation is observed only in the presence of the cofactors 2′-AMP, 3′-AMP, and 3′,5′-cAMP.

Aures K. Epstein D. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1995; 23: 2431-2432Crossref Google Scholar, 20Soukup G. Breaker R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1308-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the phosphoester chain normally requires participation of the 2′-OH group as an internal nucleophile (20Soukup G. Breaker R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1308-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) in two “nucleophilic cleavage” events: the transesterification and hydrolysis reactions. During transesterification, the 2′-OH nucleophile attacks the tetrahedral phosphorus to afford a 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate. This species is then hydrolyzed into a mixture of 3′- and 2′-phosphate monoesters. Both steps are catalyzed by protons, hydroxide, nitrogen derivatives, and metal ions. The degradation profile characteristically yields a double-banded profile, because of a first cleavage of the 5′ phosphodiester bond leaving a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate extremity (20Soukup G. Breaker R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1308-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), which is successively opened resulting in a 2′ or 3′ phosphate extremity (as indicated in the right side of Fig. 1A). The stability at high temperature of oligonucleotide A and of other oligonucleotides in water as a function of pH is characterized in detail (17Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Pino S. Crestini C. Saladino R. Di Mauro E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide As are particularly stable between pH 5.0 and 6.5. Ligation and hydrolytic degradation occur simultaneously (Fig. 1). No indication of reciprocal interference by the two reactions was observed, aside from the fact that hydrolysis slowly depletes the pool of full-length molecules undergoing ligation. The half-life of the full-length oligomers was calculated measuring the decrease of the monomer-sized molecules (for details of this simple procedure see Ref. 17Ciciriello F. Costanzo G. Pino S. Crestini C. Saladino R. Di Mauro E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At 60 °C the half-life of the 24-mer is 65 ± 7 h. The kinetics of ligation are much faster, as described above. The nature of the cofactor favoring ligation was explored (Fig. 1B). In addition to 3′,5′-cAMP (Fig. 1A), adenine, adenosine, 2′-AMP, 3′-AMP, adenosine 5′-monophosphate, 2′,3′-cAMP, ADP, and ATP were analyzed in the same conditions as the analysis for di- and tetramerization reported in Fig. 1A. Active ligation was favored by 2′-AMP (not shown), 3′-AMP, and 5′-AMP. Adenine, adenosine, ADP, and ATP only showed minor stimulation of the reaction. 2′,3′-cAMP was not active at all (not shown). The relative half max values of all cofactors analyzed are reported in Table 1. Treatment for longer periods did not modify the pattern. In the moderate reaction conditions used (namely, 6 h, 60 °C, pH 6.2), the nucleoside and nucleotide forms are stable, and no transphosphorylation occurs (13Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Costanzo G. Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16729-16735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed effect can be attributed to the primary chemical forms tested, excluding the involvement of molecular species deriving from degradation or transphosphorylation. The formation of dimers and tetramers but not of trimers and pentamers (nor of higher forms) entails a ligation reaction preceded by the coupling of the reacting molecules two by two and excludes a tandem-wise polymerization mechanism. The two coupled molecules may undergo covalent linking only if the reacting phosphate and hydroxyl groups are in the necessary close proximity and in the appropriate relative position. These two conditions are satisfied only by matching the oligomers into a double strand encompassing the whole length of the molecules in the case of equal-sized molecules or by matching them starting from one extremity in the case of molecules differing in size. If matching is not complete, and the double strand is slipped with its ends protruding, the terminal phosphate and hydroxyl groups will not be in the necessary reactive proximity. Presumptive circular forms were also observed (see supplemental Fig. S5). This model is mentioned here to allow the interpretation of the experiments that follow and is described in more detail below. Fig. 2 shows the results of the same analysis performed on similar but shorter oligomers: 5′A9U3′ and 5′A14U3′. The behavior of the 15-mer (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5) is similar to that of the 24-mer (Fig. 1A). The formation of dimers still takes place with the 10-mer, although at a reduced rate (lane 9). This behavior is consistent with the observation (22Brahms J. Michelson A.M. Van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 15: 467-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) that fragment size is the limiting factor for the formation of poly(A) double strands at acidic pH values. The effect of the pH in the ligation mechanism is described below. The ligation of the A14U 15-mer was tested in the absence and in the presence of 3′,5′-cAMP, as indicated where appropriate (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 4 and 5, respectively). In the absence of the cofactor, the ligation of the monomer to yield dimer is marginal (Fig. 2, compare lane 3 with lane 5), and the tetramer is not formed at all. However, the very fact that ligation may occur in the absence of an externally added molecular species (Fig. 2, lane 3) is in principle relevant per se. The A9U 10-mer undergoes less efficient dimerization in water (Fig. 2, lane 9). In this case no ligation is evident in the absence of cofactor (not shown), no tetramer is formed, and the dimer formation does not exceed 3.0% of the total input. Molecular forms with molecular size slightly higher than the monomer size are also formed (arrow on the right side of lane 9). One form is particularly evident that is presumably the product of self-ligation leading to a presumptive circular molecule (supplemental Fig. S5). Despite the strong increase in the multimerization efficiency brought about by a cofactor (i.e. 3′,5′-cAMP or 2′-AMP), the products formed in its absence are of identical size (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5). In the 10-mer the size of the dimer formed is exactly 20, as shown by its correspondence (Fig. 2, lane 9) with the 20-mer in a degradation ladder obtained by hydrolysis of a 24-mer (Fig. 2, lane 6 versus lane 9). This shows that (i) 3′,5′-cAMP is not retained in the final product (unless one hypothesizes an unlikely and unnecessary intermediate nucleotide substitution step, for which no experimental indication was obtained) and (ii) its function is that of a typical catalysis cofactor, favoring a reaction that would occur anyway. This conclusion is strengthened by the observation that 3′,5′-cAMP favors aggregation of RNA oligomers, as shown by the following analysis: 5′-labeled A14U RNA was left in water in the usual conditions (60 °C, 6 h) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 3′,5′-cAMP. The samples were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 20 min in Eppendorf apparatus), and the supernatant was then separated from the precipitate. Both were measured by Cherenkov, the results showing that starting at 10 mm 3′,5′-cyclic AMP, the RNA oligomer markedly decreases its solubility (data not shown). Solubility of cyclic AMP is known to be limited, and a concentrated solution (>50 mm) tends to precipitate at room temperature. In addition, the solubility of double-stranded RNA is also known to be limited, as initially reported by Holcomb and Tinoco (23Holcomb D.N. Tinoco I. Biopolymers. 1965; 3: 121-133Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), who describe a “large aggregation of the double strand helices” of polyribonadenylic acid. Both phenomena (low solubility of 3′,5′-cAMP and decreased solubility of RNA upon formation of the double strand) are concurrent in decreasing the solubility of RNA and in concentrating it. The aggregates can be dissolved by resuspending the precipitate obtained in 0.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate (see “Methods”). In summary, RNA oligomers in water undergo dimerization and tetramerization. The order of increasing efficiency is 10-mer < 15-mer < 23-mer < 24-mer (Table 2). Cofactors 3′,5′-cAMP, 2′-AMP, and 3′-AMP stimulate the reaction by at least 2 orders of magnitude. Tetramerization only occurs with the 15-mer and 23- or 24-mer in the presence of 3′,5′-cAMP, 2′-AMP, and 3′-AMP. Two-species Ligation—Fig. 3 shows the multimerization reaction performed with mixtures of oligomers. In A a reaction is shown in which the oligomers were 5′ A23U3′ and 5′ A14U3′. The two oligonucleotides were present in water at the same concentration (3.5 pmol each in 15 μl), with only the A23U 24-mer being labeled at the 5′ extremity. Thus, only the products of ligation encompassing at least one 24-mer should be observed in the autoradiogram. As indicated on the top of Fig. 3A, the two lanes on the left show the ligation reactions of the A23U 24-mer when present alone, resulting in the formation of the dimer and of the tetramer. When unlabeled A14U 15-mer is included (shown in the two lanes on the right), additional fragments are observed, corresponding to the combinations expected in the case of heterogeneous ligation events. The numerical combinations are indicated at the right side of the figure. The linearity of the semilog plot of these values as a function of the migration confirms the attributed values (supplemental Fig. S1). Fig. 3B shows a scanning profile of the upper part of the gel containing the ligation products (from an underexposed auto-radiogram). The profile shows that length-homogeneous new species (i.e. 24-mer + 24-mer) form more abundantly than heterogeneous ones (i.e. 24-mer + 15-mer), and as observed for homogeneous ligations, shorter combinations are more abundant than longer ones (i.e. dimers > tetramers, both in homo- and in heterogeneous species). The ladder generated by hydrolysis of the tetramer in the upper part of the second lane (Fig. 3A) is noteworthy. The distance between the bands is twice as wide as in the “each band cleavage” pattern, indicating that the hydrolytic cleavage occurs every second residue, not every single one (scanning pattern not shown). Four-species Ligation—A ligation assay was performed on a mixture of four different oligomers. The 5′-labeled 5′A23U3′ 24-mer was added with equal amounts of unlabeled"
https://openalex.org/W2025466342,"Background HIV-1 has evolved ways to exploit DCs, thereby facilitating viral dissemination and allowing evasion of antiviral immunity. Recently, the fate of DCs has been found to be extremely dependent on the interaction with autologous NK cells, but the mechanisms by which NK-DC interaction controls viral infections remain unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of NK-DC cross-talk on maturation and functions of HIV-infected immature DCs. Methodology/Principal Findings Immature DCs were derived from primary monocytes, cultured in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF. In some experiments, DCs were infected with R5-HIV-1BaL or X4-HIV-1NDK, and viral replication, proviral HIV-DNA and the frequency of infected DCs were measured. Autologous NK cells were sorted and either kept unstimulated in the presence of suboptimal concentration of IL-2, or activated by a combination of PHA and IL-2. The impact of 24 h NK-DC cross-talk on the fate of HIV-1-infected DCs was analyzed. We report that activated NK cells were required for the induction of maturation of DCs, whether uninfected or HIV-1-infected, and this process involved HMGB1. However, the cross-talk between HIV-1-infected DCs and activated NK cells was functionally defective, as demonstrated by the strong impairment of DCs to induce Th1 polarization of naïve CD4 T cells. This was associated with the defective production of IL-12 and IL-18 by infected DCs. Moreover, the crosstalk between activated NK cells and HIV-infected DCs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral DNA expression in DCs. HMGB1, produced both by NK cells and DCs, was found to play a pivotal role in this process, and inhibition of HMGB1 activity by glycyrrhizin, known to bind specifically to HMGB1, or blocking anti-HMGB1 antibodies, abrogated NK-dependent HIV-1 replication in DCs. Conclusion These observations provide evidence for the crucial role of NK-DC cross-talk in promoting viral dissemination, and challenge the question of the in vivo involvement of HMGB1 in the triggering of HIV-1 replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2086488637,"ATP-DnaA is the initiator of chromosomal replication in Escherichia coli, and the activity of DnaA is regulated by the regulatory inactivation of the DnaA (RIDA) system. In this system, the Hda protein promotes DnaA-ATP hydrolysis to produce inactive ADP-DnaA in a mechanism that is mediated by the DNA-loaded form of the replicase sliding clamp. In this study, we first revealed that hda translation uses an unusual initiation codon, CUG, located downstream of the annotated initiation codon. The CUG initiation codon could be used for restricting the Hda level, as this initiation codon has a low translation efficiency, and the cellular Hda level is only ∼100 molecules per cell. Hda translated using the correct reading frame was purified and found to have a high RIDA activity in vitro. Moreover, we found that Hda has a high affinity for ADP but not for other nucleotides, including ATP. ADP-Hda was active in the RIDA system in vitro and stable in a monomeric state, whereas apo-Hda formed inactive homomultimers. Both ADP-Hda and apo-Hda could form complexes with the DNA-loaded clamp; however, only ADP-Hda-DNA-clamp complexes were highly functional in the following interaction with DnaA. Formation of ADP-Hda was also observed in vivo, and mutant analysis suggested that ADP binding is crucial for cellular Hda activity. Thus, we propose that ADP is a crucial Hda ligand that promotes the activated conformation of the protein. ADP-dependent monomerization might enable the arginine finger of the Hda AAA+ domain to be accessible to ATP bound to the DnaA AAA+ domain.

The initiation of chromosomal replication is strictly regulated during the cell cycle. In Escherichia coli, a crucial target for this regulation is the formation of an active initiation complex, including the ATP-bound DnaA protein (ATP-DnaA) and the chromosomal replication origin, oriC (1Messer W.

The minimal oriC region contains 11 GATC sequence repeats that are available for modification by the DNA-adenine methyltransferase. Nascent strand synthesis transiently generates a hemimethylated oriC that is the target of SeqA. In the second system, there is a reduction of DnaA molecules that are accessible to the oriC. The datA locus is located near the oriC and can bind to a considerable number of DnaA molecules (11Kitagawa R. Ozaki T. Moriya S. Ogawa T.

The clamp-mediated coupling of replication and initiation regulation appears to be widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Bacillus subtilis YabA acts as a negative regulator of initiation by forming a complex with DnaA and the clamp; however, this protein shares no obvious homology with the primary sequence of Hda (18Noirot-Gros M.F.

The eukaryotic sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, interacts with the replication licensing factor Cdt1 (21Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat.

This interaction promotes ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cdt1, which is associated with the blockage of re-replication. In a reconstituted RIDA assay, Hda catalytically promotes DnaA-ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the DNA-loaded clamp (24Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T.

This reaction requires the clamp binding to Hda via its short N-terminal region that carries the QL(S/D)LF motif conserved among clamp-binding proteins (24Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y.

Besides the N-terminal region, Hda carries an AAA+ domain that is homologous with the DnaA AAA+ domain (12Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This domain bears Walker-type nucleotide-binding motifs and several specific motifs that are conserved in the AAA+ family (28Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A common feature of typical AAA+ proteins is the formation of multimers in which ATP binding and hydrolysis events occur at the inter-subunit interface and mediate a conformational change. In this process, a conserved arginine residue called an arginine finger plays a crucial role in the recognition of ATP bound to the adjacent protomer (29Davey M.J. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Ogura T. Whiteheart S.W. Wilkinson A.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Based on our biochemical and mutational analyses of DnaA, Hda, and the DNA-loaded clamp, the following model is provided (24Su'etsugu M. Takata M. Kubota T. Matsuda Y. Katayama T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Hda arginine finger directly promotes DnaA-bound ATP hydrolysis upon interaction between the AAA+ domains of DnaA and Hda. The DNA-loaded clamp mediates this interaction as a platform, on which the DnaA N-terminal domain supportively interacts with the Hda-clamp complex, and the DnaA DNA-binding domain recognizes the duplex DNA flanking the clamp. Here we found that Hda specifically binds to ADP but not ATP in vitro and in vivo. Apo-Hda formed a homomultimer that is likely to consist of several protomers in the absence of ADP. ADP binding promoted dissociation of the Hda homomultimers to monomers and activated Hda function in the RIDA system in vitro. Further in vitro and in vivo analyses using the Walker motif mutants of Hda suggested that ADP binding is crucial for Hda function in vivo. ADP-Hda but not apo-Hda formed a functional complex with ATP-DnaA and the DNA-loaded clamp. The Hda arginine finger could be buried into the inter-subunit interface of apo-Hda homomultimers, and ADP-dependent monomerization might expose the arginine finger on the surface, promoting interaction with ATP-DnaA. Construction and Expression of Hda Derivatives for the N-terminal Analyses—Plasmids pBAD/Hda and pHda4 (an intermediate pBAD/Hda construction) were constructed previously (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T.

When the absorbance (A600) of the culture reached 0.5, arabinose (0.5%) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. Determination of the N-terminal Sequence of Hda-cHis—Purification of Hda-cHis expressed using pBAD/Hda-cHis was performed using the same method as that previously described for a His-tagged Hda (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hda-cHis was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and sequenced by an Edman degradation method using a Procise 494HT protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Construction and Purification of Hda-cHis—A fragment bearing the Hda-cHis coding region was amplified by PCR using pBAD/Hda-cHis as a template and the primers 5′-CGTCTAGAAGGAGATATACATATGAACACACCGGCACAGCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CTCTCATCCGCCAAAACAGCCAAG-3′, and cloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET21a (Novagen), resulting in pET/Hda-cHis. BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET/Hda-cHis were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 of the culture reached 0.8; isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and cells were further incubated for 2 h. All the following procedures were performed at 0–6 °C. Isolation of a soluble fraction from cell lysates and nickel column chromatography were performed by the same method as that previously described for a His-tagged Hda (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yielding Hda-cHis Fr II. To isolate the multimers and monomers, Hda-cHis Fr II (55 μg) was loaded using a flow rate of 5 μl/min onto a Superdex-200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-58, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 120 mm potassium glutamate. For dissociation of ADP, Hda-cHis Fr II (3.5 mg/ml, 220 μl) was incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, dissolved in buffer A containing 6 m urea, and loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, yielding Hda-cHis Fr III. Purification of Hda-cHis and Its Mutant Derivatives from an Insoluble Fraction—Hda-cHis was purified from an insoluble fraction of BL21(DE3) cell lysate harboring pET/Hda-cHis. The insoluble cell lysate fraction was washed, and protein pellets were obtained by the same method as that previously described for nontagged Hda (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The pellets were dissolved in buffer A containing 6 m urea and loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column using the same method as that described for Hda-cHis Fr III. Plasmids for overexpressing mutant Hda-cHis were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pET/Hda-cHis. Purification of these derivatives was performed using an insoluble cell lysate fraction and the same method as described above. Construction and Purification of nHis-Hda—The plasmid for overexpressing nHis-Hda was constructed by XhoI digestion and self-ligation of a PCR fragment amplified using pBAD/His-Hda as a template and the primers 5′-CCACTCTCGAGCTCGGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGAAACACACCGGCACAGC-3′. Expression and purification were performed by the same method as that previously described for His-tagged Hda (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yielding nHis-Hda Fr II. nHis-Hda Fr II (28 μg) was loaded onto a Superose-12 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 40 μl/min, and fractions including the multimers or monomers were pooled. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), except that SDS-PAGE was performed until the 6.5-kDa prestained marker protein had migrated out of the gel. ADP Binding Assay—Hda proteins were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C or on ice in buffer A (12.5 or 25 μl) containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the indicated concentrations of [3H]ADP. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore HA, 0.45 μm), followed by washing and quantification of the radioactivity that was retained on the membranes (31Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Purification of a Purchased ATP Sample—ATP (Sigma) was applied onto a Mini-Q column equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 7 m urea, and 50 mm NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 50 to 400 mm. Elution of ATP and ADP was monitored at A280. The peak fraction of ATP was pooled, diluted in water, and applied onto a Mini-Q column equilibrated with 50 mm NH4HCO3. ATP was eluted with 1 m NH4HCO3 and dried under a vacuum. Reconstituted RIDA Assay—The staged RIDA reconstituted system was used essentially as described previously (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the first stage, the clamp (50 pmol) and ϕX174 nicked circular DNA (1.75 μg, 0.5 pmol, circular) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-58, 8 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm potassium glutamate) containing 1 mm ATP and γ complex (225 ng). The resulting DNA-loaded clamp was isolated in a void volume by a spin-column method using Sephacryl S-400 HR (0.63 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B. In the second stage, the isolated DNA-loaded clamp (100 molecules of the clamp per DNA circle) was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer B (25 μl) containing 120 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, [α-32P]ATP-bound DnaA (0.5 pmol), and Hda in the presence or absence of ATP (2 mm) or ADP (30 or 200 μm). Nucleotides bound to DnaA were recovered on a nitrocellulose filter and analyzed using polyethyleneimine TLC and a BAS2500 Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). In Vivo Analysis of Hda Activity in DnaA-ATP Hydrolysis—A fragment containing an hda-coding region and its upstream sequence (1.5 kb) was amplified by PCR using genome DNA and the primers 5′-CGGGATCCCGCTCTCTTTCGCAATGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGCATCCGACAATAAACACC-3′, before being cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pACYC177, resulting in pHCS4-1. The kan gene derived from pUC4K (GE Healthcare) was inserted into the BamHI site of pHCS4-1, resulting in pACYC/ntHda. pACYC/ntHdaA1B1, pACYC/ntHdaB2, or pACYC/ntHdaA1B2 was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). These hda mutants bear substitutions of R56A/D102A (for A1B1), D102A/N103A (for B2), and R56A/D102A/N103A (for A1B2). MK86 [rnhA17::Tn3 ΔoriC::TcR Δhda::CmR] cells (12Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) harboring pACYC177, pACYC/ntHda, pACYC/ntHdaA1B1, pACYC/ntHdaB2, or pACYC/ntHdaA1B2 were grown at 37 °C in modified TG medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.4 mCi/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml) but lacking NaCl and Na2SO4 to an A600 of 0.15 as described previously (13Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa K. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). DnaA was isolated by immunoprecipitation from cleared lysates, and the nucleotides bound to the recovered DnaA were separated using polyethyleneimine TLC, followed by BAS2500 analysis. In Vivo Detection of ADP-Hda—Labeled cells and cell lysates were prepared using the method described above for the in vivo analysis of DnaA nucleotide forms. MC1061 cells harboring pBAD/nHis-Hda were grown at 37 °C in modified TG medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and 0.2% glycerol instead of glucose. When A600 of the culture reached 0.1, arabinose (0.5%) was added and incubation continued for 10 min. Cells in the culture (0.5 ml) were collected by a brief centrifugation, washed in 0.9% NaCl (0.5 ml), incubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of lysozyme (5 mg/ml) in buffer C (0.2 ml) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm ADP, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. These lysates were thawed on ice, clarified by centrifugation, and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with rotation in the presence of MagneHis nickel particles (7.5 μl, Promega). The beads were collected and washed four times in buffer C (50 μl), and the bead-bound materials were recovered in buffer C (5 μl) containing 1 m imidazole. Radiolabeled nucleotides in the recovered fraction were separated using polyethyleneimine TLC and a solvent consisting of 1 m HCOOH and 0.7 m LiCl or one consisting of 0.5 m KH2PO4, followed by BAS2500 analysis. Spin-column Assay for Association of DnaA and Hda with the DNA-Clamp Complex—For a large scale preparation of the DNA-loaded clamp, the clamp (2 nmol) and M13mp18 nicked circular DNA (95 μg, 20 pmol, circular) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in buffer B (1 ml) containing 1 mm ATP and 9 μg of γ complex. The reaction was loaded onto a Superose-6 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, yielding the DNA-loaded clamp in the void fraction (60 molecules of the clamp per DNA circle). The isolated DNA-loaded clamp was incubated on ice for 15 min in buffer A (12.5 or 25 μl) containing Hda, followed by a brief incubation in the presence of ATP-DnaA (2 pmol or the indicated amount) and immediate spin-column isolation as follows. Buffer A (12.5 μl) was added only when the reaction was 12.5 μl, and the sample was applied onto a Sephacryl S-400 HR spin column (0.63 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B, and the DNA and bound proteins were isolated into the void by a brief centrifugation (3000 × g, 3 min) at 4 °C. Pulldown Assay for Association of DnaA and Hda with the DNA-Clamp Complex—The DNA-loaded clamp was prepared using the same method as described for the spin-column analysis. nHis-Hda (5 pmol or the indicated amount) was incubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of Co2+-conjugated magnet beads TALON (120 μg, Invitrogen) in buffer D (12.5 μl) containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij-58, 8 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 mm potassium glutamate. The Hda-bound beads were further incubated on ice for 5 or 15 min in the presence of the DNA-loaded clamp and 20 mm imidazole, followed by incubation for 10 min in the presence of ATP-DnaA, collection by magnetic force, and washing in buffer D (25 μl) containing 20 mm imidazole. The bead-bound materials were eluted in buffer (10 μl) containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. The hda Initiation Codon CUG Is Located Downstream of the Annotated GUG Initiation Codon—Previously, we constructed an Hda-overproducing plasmid (pBAD/Hda) based on the annotated coding region of the hda gene (Fig. 1A) (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the course of analyses, we noticed that the size of Hda expressed by pBAD/Hda (the protein and the plasmid are designated ex-Hda and pBAD/ex-Hda) was slightly higher than that of native Hda expressed from the chromosomal gene (Fig. 1B). We could not detect this slight size difference under the previous Western blot conditions; however, in this study, we extended the electrophoresis time and were able to observe small variations. pBAD/ex-Hda carried modifications in the hda upstream region to enhance expression as follows: the annotated initiation codon GUG (32Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6050) Google Scholar) and the original Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence were replaced with AUG and the T7 phage gp10 SD sequence, respectively (Fig. 1A) (25Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether the size difference was attributed to these modifications, we analyzed the sizes of Hda expressed by the chromosomal gene, pBAD/ex-Hda and pHda4, which bears the original chromosomal upstream region of the hda gene (Fig. 1A). The size of pHda4-derived Hda was similar to that of the chromosomal gene-derived Hda and lower than that of ex-Hda (Fig. 1B). In these experiments, Hda was overexpressed in KA450 cells [ΔoriC rnhA dnaA]. Overexpression of Hda inhibits normal cell growth, which is suppressed by deletions of oriC and rnhA (12Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The rnhA mutation activates alternative origins to replicate the chromosome in a manner independent of DnaA and oriC (33Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To determine the N-terminal residues of the native Hda, we constructed pBAD/Hda-cHis, a pHda4 derivative expressing a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged form of Hda (Hda-cHis; Fig. 1C). Edman degradation using purified Hda-cHis revealed that the N-terminal amino acid sequence was MNTPA, which suggests that the initiation codon used in vivo is the CUG sequence that is located 45 nucleotides downstream from the annotated GUG initiation codon (Fig. 1A). A substitution of the CUG sequence to CUU inhibited Hda expression (Fig. 1B). Like CUU, CUG usually codes for leucine. The size of the Hda translated from the CUG sequence was calculated to be 26.6 kDa; this means that the size of the native Hda was ∼2 kDa smaller than the size of ex-Hda (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the results of the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). These results support the idea that the CUG sequence uniquely functions as the initiation codon of Hda. The extra N terminus in ex-Hda is rich in hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1A), which might expedite the migration of this protein in SDS-PAGE and might result in a reduced difference in the apparent molecular sizes between ex-Hda and the native Hda. RIDA Activity of Hda-cHis—To analyze the activity of Hda-cHis in the RIDA system, we overproduced Hda-cHis using pET/Hda-cHis. Approximately 50% of the expressed Hda-cHis was recovered in a soluble cell lysate fraction and was used for purification by nickel-affinity column chromatography. The purity of the resultant fraction (Hda-cHis Fr II) was >90% (Fig. 2A). Gel filtration analysis of Hda-cHis Fr II revealed maj"
https://openalex.org/W2082438289,"Mast cells are key components of the immune system, where they help orchestrate the inflammatory response. Aberrant mast cell activation is linked to a variety of allergic diseases, including asthma, eczema, rhinitis, and nasal polyposis, which in combination affect up to 20% of the population in industrialized countries. On activation, mast cells release a variety of signals that target the bronchi and vasculature and recruit other immune cells to the inflammatory site. Prominent among such signals are the cysteinyl leukotrienes, a family of potent proinflammatory lipid mediators comprising leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)), LTD(4), and LTE(4). LTC(4), the parent compound, is secreted from mast cells following Ca(2+) influx through store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. Here, we show that activated mast cells release a paracrine signal that evokes Ca(2+) signals in spatially separate resting mast cells. The paracrine signal was identified as a cysteinyl leukotriene because 1) RNAi knockdown or pharmacological block of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme prevented activated mast cells from stimulating resting cells. 2) Block of cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptors on resting mast cells with the clinically prescribed receptor antagonist montelukast prevented their activation by active mast cells. 3) RNAi knockdown of cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptors on resting cells prevented them from responding to the paracrine signal derived from activated mast cells. 4) Purified LTC(4) evoked Ca(2+) signals in mast cells that were identical to those triggered by the paracrine signal. Low levels of stimulus intensity released sufficient levels of leukotriene to activate resting cells. Leukotriene secretion still occurred tens of minutes after stimulation, suggesting a role as a long-lasting trigger in mast cell activation. Stimulation of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor activated CRAC channels and evoked prominent store-operated Ca(2+) entry. This resulted in further cysteinyl leukotriene production, triggering a positive feedback cascade. Acutely isolated mast cells from patients with allergic rhinitis exhibited store-operated Ca(2+) influx through CRAC channels and responded to cysteinyl leukotrienes. Histological analysis of samples taken from patients revealed clustering of mast cells, often located within 20 microm of each other, a distance sufficient for paracrine signaling by leukotrienes to operate effectively. We conclude that a positive-feedback cascade involving CRAC channels and cysteinyl leukotrienes constitute a novel mechanism for sustaining mast cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2155293003,"Erwinia carotovora are phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria of agronomic interest as these bacteria are responsible for fruit soft rot and use insects as dissemination vectors. The Erwinia carotovora carotovora strain 15 (Ecc15) is capable of persisting in the Drosophila gut by the sole action of one protein, Erwinia virulence factor (Evf). However, the precise function of Evf is elusive, and its sequence does not provide any indication as to its biochemical function. We have solved the 2.0-Å crystal structure of Evf and found a protein with a complex topology and a novel fold. The structure of Evf confirms that Evf is unlike any virulence factors known to date. Most remarkably, we identified palmitoic acid covalently bound to the totally conserved Cys209, which provides important clues as to the function of Evf. Mutation of the palmitoic binding cysteine leads to a loss of virulence, proving that palmitoylation is at the heart of Evf infectivity and may be a membrane anchoring signal. Fluorescence studies of the sole tryptophan residue (Trp94) demonstrated that Evf was indeed able to bind to model membranes containing negatively charged phospholipids and to promote their aggregation. Erwinia carotovora are phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria of agronomic interest as these bacteria are responsible for fruit soft rot and use insects as dissemination vectors. The Erwinia carotovora carotovora strain 15 (Ecc15) is capable of persisting in the Drosophila gut by the sole action of one protein, Erwinia virulence factor (Evf). However, the precise function of Evf is elusive, and its sequence does not provide any indication as to its biochemical function. We have solved the 2.0-Å crystal structure of Evf and found a protein with a complex topology and a novel fold. The structure of Evf confirms that Evf is unlike any virulence factors known to date. Most remarkably, we identified palmitoic acid covalently bound to the totally conserved Cys209, which provides important clues as to the function of Evf. Mutation of the palmitoic binding cysteine leads to a loss of virulence, proving that palmitoylation is at the heart of Evf infectivity and may be a membrane anchoring signal. Fluorescence studies of the sole tryptophan residue (Trp94) demonstrated that Evf was indeed able to bind to model membranes containing negatively charged phospholipids and to promote their aggregation. Flies have been recurrently thought to be involved in the transmission of animal and plant diseases; they live on decaying medium enriched in micro-organisms, and they constitute ideal vectors for microbial dissemination through food contamination because of their close association with animals or plant communities. Although the potential hazard of flies on humans is generally accepted, the interactions between bacteria and potential fly vectors are poorly documented. Unlike the situation observed for plague bacteria and fleas (1Hinnebusch B.J. Rudolph A.E. Cherepanov P. Dixon J.E. Schwan T.G. Forsberg A. Science.. 2002; 296: 733-735Google Scholar) or for many protozoan parasites infecting humans and mosquitoes (2Beerntsen B.T. James A.A. Christensen B.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.. 2000; 64: 115-137Google Scholar), in which the insect is an obligate host, little is known about the mechanisms that allow bacterial persistence within flies (3Vallet-Gely I. Lemaitre B. Boccard F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol.. 2008; 6: 302-313Google Scholar). The identification of one gene, the Erwinia virulence factor (Evf) 3The abbreviations used are: Evf, Erwinia virulence factor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry; PC, phosphatidylcholine; POPS, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine; DTT, dithiothreitol; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. that promotes bacterial persistence in the gut of Drosophila larvae, has recently revealed the existence of specific strategies that may enhance survival of bacteria within insects and their dissemination in their environment. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lives in decaying fruits and has been occasionally implicated in the transmission of plant phytopathogens such as the enteric bacteria Erwinia carotovora (4Molina J.J. Harisson M.D. Brewer J.W. Am. Pot. J.. 1974; 51: 245-250Google Scholar, 5Kloepper J.W. Brewer J.W. Harrison M.D. Am. Pot. J.. 1981; 58: 165-175Google Scholar). E. carotovora species induce the soft rotting of many fruits and potatoes through the production of a battery of pectinolytic enzymes (6Barras F. van Gijsegem F. Chatterjee A.K. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol.. 1994; 32: 201-234Google Scholar). A strain of E. carotovora carotovora, Ecc15, was identified that, contrary to most bacterial species, can persist in the gut of Drosophila larvae after natural ingestion (7Basset A. Khush R.S. Braun A. Gardan L. Boccard F. Hoffmann J.A. Lemaitre B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2000; 97: 3376-3381Google Scholar). This infection relies on a very specific bacterium host interaction because only a very limited number of strains is capable of inducing this response. A genetic screen set up to search for infective genes revealed that infectivity is mediated by a single gene, Erwinia virulence factor (Evf) (8Basset A. Tzou P. Lemaitre B. Boccard F. EMBO Rep.. 2003; 4: 205-209Google Scholar). The expression of Evf is regulated by Hor, a member of the family of transcriptional regulators of the SlyA type that are usually involved in the regulation of virulence genes (9Ellison D.W. Miller V.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol.. 2006; 9: 153-159Google Scholar). Evf is only present in a subset of Erwinia strains that have infectious properties and was characterized as a gene that promotes survival and dissemination (10Acosta Muniz C. Jaillard D. Lemaitre B. Boccard F. Cell. Microbiol.. 2007; 9: 106-119Google Scholar). Strikingly, transfer of Evf into noninfectious, and normally nonpersistent, Gram-negative bacteria enables them to persist in the Drosophila gut and to elicit a systemic immune response. The biochemical function of the Evf protein and the exact mechanism by which it promotes bacterial persistence in the gut remain unknown. However, it was shown that it does not function using previously well known mechanisms of bacterial survival. It does not act by directly counteracting the host immune response; it is not a toxin, and it does not provide protection against antibacterial peptides or against reactive oxygen species. The presence of Evf leads to the accumulation of bacteria in the anterior midgut and dramatically affects gut physiology (10Acosta Muniz C. Jaillard D. Lemaitre B. Boccard F. Cell. Microbiol.. 2007; 9: 106-119Google Scholar). Evf therefore reveals a new aspect of bacterial strategies for colonizing an insect gut niche. Interestingly, Ecc15 accumulated in the infected gut in a nonrandom arrangement reminiscent of biofilms, which might allow the bacteria to interfere with gut peristalsis and therefore prevent elimination by passive transfer through the gut. Biofilm formation in the gut preventing normal blood feeding is also seen in the infection of the flea vector by Yersinia pestis (11Hinnebusch B.J. Perry R.D. Schwan T.G. Science.. 1996; 273: 367-370Google Scholar). Evf has few orthologues in other bacteria and no identified functional sequence signatures. Interestingly, the closest homologue is a gene from Photorhabdus luminescens, a bacterium that exists in symbiosis in the guts of nematodes (12Sicard M. Hering S. Schulte R. Gaudriault S. Schulenburg H. Environ. Microbiol.. 2007; 9: 12-25Google Scholar) suggesting that Evf-like proteins are also virulence factors that promote specific interaction with the host gut allowing persistence. To better understand the function of the Evf protein at the molecular level, we have determined its crystal structure. We show that Evf is an α/β protein with a complex topology and a novel fold. Most remarkably, the crystal structure and mass spectrometry data clearly demonstrate that a palmitoic acid is covalently linked to the 209 cysteine residue via a thioester linkage. To assess whether the association of Evf with palmitoic acid is necessary for infection, mutations of this cysteine residue into alanine or serine were tested for infectivity. All mutants lacking the palmitoic acid-bound residue did not give rise to an immune reaction. We also showed that Evf interacted with model membranes and was able to promote their aggregation. We postulate that the palmitoyl moiety might play a role in these membrane-associated processes. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Labeling—Evf was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pOM1-evf as a template (7Basset A. Khush R.S. Braun A. Gardan L. Boccard F. Hoffmann J.A. Lemaitre B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2000; 97: 3376-3381Google Scholar). An additional sequence coding for a 6-histidine tag was introduced at the 3′ end of the gene during amplification. The PCR product was then cloned into a derivative of the pET9 vector. Expression was done at 37 °C during 3 h using the transformed Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3) strain (Novagen) and 2× YT medium (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). When the cell culture reached an A600 nm of 1, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), and the cells were grown for a further 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and stored overnight at –20 °C. Cell lysis was completed by sonication. The His-tagged protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), eluted with imidazole, and loaded on to a Superdex™ 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared as described and purified as the native protein (13Quevillon-Cheruel S. Collinet B. Tresaugues L. Minard P. Henckes G. Aufrere R. Blondeau K. Zhou C.Z. Liger D. Bettache N. Poupon A. Aboulfath I. Leulliot N. Janin J. van Tilbeurgh H. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2007; 363: 21-37Google Scholar). The homogeneity and selenomethionine labeling of the proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE mass spectrometry. The covalent palmitoylation of Cys209, as suggested by analysis of the crystal structure, was verified by mass spectrometry. All spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Determinations of the molecular masses of Evf proteins were performed in linear mode (accelerating voltage, 25 kV; grid voltage, 93%; guide wire, 0.3%; delay, 600 ns) with external calibration using sinapinic acid as matrix. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Crystals of both the native and selenomethionine-labeled protein were grown from a 1:1 μl mixture of protein (10 mg/ml) with 25% PEG4000, 50 mm Bicine, pH 8, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin. The addition of trypsin resulted in in situ limited proteolysis and was necessary for crystal formation. X-ray diffraction data from a crystal of the selenomethionine-substituted protein were collected on beamline ID23-1 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) at a single wavelength of 0.9798 Å, corresponding to the peak position of the selenium K-edge to optimize the anomalous scattering signal strength. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with two Evf copies per asymmetric unit, corresponding to 40% solvent content. Data processing was carried out with the programs MOSFLM (14Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and SCALA (15Collaborative Computational Project Number Acta Crystallogr.Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50 (4): 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The cell parameters and data collection statistics are reported in Table 1. A total of 720 frames of 1° rotation were collected on a single crystal with an attenuated beam, with no evidence of overall radiation damage. Because of the high redundancy, the two selenium atoms were readily localized using the Hyss module of PHENIX (16Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2003; 59: 1966-1973Google Scholar). Phasing was performed using Sharp (17Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Google Scholar). A high resolution dataset was recorded on the same crystal without any attenuation. The program SOLOMON (18Abrahams J.P. De Graaff R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.. 1998; 8: 601-605Google Scholar) was used for density modification using the phases from Sharp, and the resulting phases were transferred into the high resolution dataset. A combination of Arp/warp (19Perrakis A. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar) and Resolve (20Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat.. 2004; 11: 49-52Google Scholar) was able to build 90% of the structure. Further rebuilding and refinement of the model were performed with O (21Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1996; 52: 829-832Google Scholar) and refined with REFMAC (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Sample Preparation and Mass Spectrometry Measurements—For ESI-MS measurements, 20 μl of purified Evf protein (4.5 μg/μl) was desalted with size exclusion chromatography columns (Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns, Bio-Rad), following the manufacturer's recommendations, and eluted in water. Ten μl of desalted Evf protein was mixed with the same volume of acetonitrile (100%) and DTT (10 mm). The reaction was left to proceed for 20 min at 56 °C and then 1% of formic acid was added. Desalted protein samples were loaded into nanoelectrospray needles (Proxeon Biosystems A/S, catalogue number ES 388). Positive ion ESI mass spectra were acquired using a QTOF Premier mass spectrometer (Waters). The instrument was mass-calibrated by spraying a solution of sodium iodide (2 μg/μl). The ion source parameters were as follows: capillary voltage 1.4 kV, cone voltage 40 V, ion source block temperature 80 °C, nebulizer gas flow 25 liters/h. The mass spectra were analyzed using the MassLynx software (Waters) and deconvoluted using the MaxEnt 1 algorithm. For nanoLC-MS/MS analyses, 1 μl of purified Evf protein (4.5 μg/μl) was diluted in 10 μl of 20% acetonitrile, 80% 50 mm NH4HCO3 and enzymatically digested with bovine trypsin or Pseudomonas fragi Asp-N (both purchased from Roche Applied Science) with an enzyme/protein ratio of 1/45 (w/w). The digestion was left to proceed for 4 h at 37 °C. When reduction/alkylation reactions were performed, DTT and iodoacetamide were added after protein dilution at a final concentration of 5 and 18 mm, respectively. DTT was first added for 20 min, and then iodoacetamide was added and left to react for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Peptide mixtures were Speed-Vac-treated for 10 min and then analyzed with the QTOF Premier mass spectrometer coupled to the Acquity nano-UPLC equipped with a trapping column (Symmetry C18, 180 μm × 20 mm, 5-μm particle size) and an analytical column (BEH130 C18, 75 μm × 100 mm, 1.7-μm particle size) (Waters). The aqueous solvent (buffer A) was 0.1% formic acid in water, and the organic phase (buffer B) was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A 2–40% B gradient was set for 25 min. Mass spectrometer parameters were as described previously for ESI-MS measurements except for capillary voltage (3 kV) and collision energy (ramping from 15 to 40 eV). For exact mass measurements, Glu-fibrinopeptide reference (m/z = 785.8426) was continuously supplied during nanoLC-MS/MS experiments using the lockspray device. Peptide mass measurements were finally corrected by ProteinLynx Global Server, (Waters) during data processing. Peak lists were generated by ProteinLynx Global Server, and processed data were submitted to searching using the following parameters: data bank His-tagged Evf protein; peptide tolerance 15 ppm; fragment tolerance 0.1 Da; digest reagent trypsin or Asp-N; variable modifications oxidation (methionine) and palmitoylation (cysteine, Serine); fixed modifications carbamido-methylation (cysteine). For MALDI-MS analyses, peptide extracts (0.5 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) matrix compounds (Sigma). MALDI-MS measurements were carried out on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in the positive ion reflectron mode. Peak lists were generated by the Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems), and processed data were submitted to the Find-Mod and Findpep software using the already described parameters except for tolerance at 50 ppm. Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a home-modified SLM spectrofluorimeter with slit width of 4 nm for excitation and 8 nm for emission. Excitation was vertically polarized, and the emission was detected through a polarizer oriented at the magic angle 55°. Measurements were performed in 100-μl microcuvettes. Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays were obtained from the polarized Ivv(t) and Ivh(t) components measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting technique. A light-emitting diode (PLS 295, serial number PLS-8-2-237 from Picoquant, Berlin-Adlershof, Germany) (maximal emission at 298 nm) operating at 10 MHz was used as excitation source. A short pass Asahi Spectra UV filter ZUS300 was used in front of the LED. A Hamamatsu fast photomultiplier (model R3235-01) was used for detection. Emission wavelength was selected through a Omega 320AELP cutoff filter and a Oriel bandpass filter UG5-005FG09-50S. Fluorescence intensity decay analyses were performed with the maximum entropy method (23Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol.. 1994; 240: 262-311Google Scholar), using a multiexponential model, Σi αi exp(–t/τi), as described previously. A classical anisotropy model, A(t) = Σi βi exp(–t/θi), in which any rotational correlation time (θ) is coupled with each lifetime (τ), was used to resolve polarized fluorescence decays (24Vincent M. Gallay J. Eur. Biophys. J.. 1991; 20: 183-191Google Scholar). The amplitude of the internal rotation, ωmax, was calculated according to the wobbling-in-cone model (25Kinosita Jr., K. Kawato S. Ikegami A. Biophys. J.. 1977; 20: 289-305Google Scholar). Preparation of Sonicated Phospholipid Vesicles—The phospholipid suspensions were prepared by sonication using egg PC and POPS (both from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) dissolved in chloroform. The organic solution was evaporated to dryness in a glass tube under a stream of nitrogen. Remaining traces of organic solvent were further removed by submitting the sample to high vacuum during several hours. Hydration of the sample was achieved with either 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, or 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 5. After vortexing, the multilamellar vesicles formed were sonicated at room temperature with the micro-tip of a Branson-B12 sonifier during 5 min with half-duty cycles. Drosophila Strain and Natural Bacterial Infection—A transgenic strain carrying a diptericin-lacZ was used to monitor the immune response of larvae. Diptericin-lacZ is a P transgene containing a fusion between 2.2 kb of upstream sequence of the antibacterial peptide gene diptericin and the β-galactosidase gene (26Tzou P. Ohresser S. Ferrandon D. Capovilla M. Reichhart J.M. Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Immunity.. 2000; 13: 737-748Google Scholar). Approximately 200 third-instar larvae were placed in a 2-ml tube containing 200 μl of concentrated bacteria pellet (A600 = 200) from an overnight culture and 400 μl of crushed banana. The larvae, bacteria, and banana were thoroughly mixed in the microcentrifuge tube; the tube was closed with a foam plug, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the mixtures then transferred to a standard cornmeal fly medium and incubated at 29 °C. LacZ titration was performed as described (27Romeo Y. Lemaitre B. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2008; 415: 379-402Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. Bacteria were cultured in Lennox medium with the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml rifampicin; 100 μg/ml spectinomycin). The rifampicin-resistant Ecc15 and Ecc15 derivatives were grown at 29 °C. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C.TABLE 2Bacterial strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsDescriptionSource or Ref.Bacterial strainsE. carotovora 15 (Ecc15)Wild type8Basset A. Tzou P. Lemaitre B.

Structure Determination and Quality—The full-length Evf protein failed to crystallize. To help crystallization, we have screened crystallization conditions of the Evf protein in presence of trypsin protease. This may enable unstructured regions to be proteolyzed, thereby providing a truncated construct more suitable for crystal formation. This is an often used strategy for obtaining or improving crystals, but usually the truncated construct is further purified to remove the protease. We opted for a different strategy that consists of directly adding the protease to the crystallization drops. In our strategy, the nature and concentration of the protease are used as variable parameters in the crystallization screen. The idea is to provoke proteolysis directly under physicochemical conditions where crystals of the truncated product can nucleate. This strategy has been applied successfully in a number of projects in our laboratory (28Leulliot N. Godin K.S. Hoareau-Aveilla C. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Varani G. Henry Y. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Mol. Biol.. 2007; 371: 1338-1353Google Scholar, 29Leulliot N. Chaillet M. Durand D. Ulryck N. Blondeau K. van Tilbeurgh H. Structure (Lond.).. 2008; 16: 52-61Google Scholar). Once a crystal hit was found, all the subsequent optimizations were performed with the protease present in the crystallization drop. The effect of the protease on crystallogenesis is discussed further. The structure of Evf was solved by single anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine-labeled protein. The presence of only two methionines (excluding the N-terminal methionine) for a total of 270 residues made the detection of the selenium sites challenging. Fortunately, the weakness of the anomalous signal was compensated by the high resistance of the crystals in the x-ray beam, which enabled a highly redundant dataset to be collected. The final model contains residues 8–19 and 24–277 for one chain and residues 10–19 and 27–277 for the other. The two copies of Evf have identical structures (r.m.s.d. 0.38 Å). Refinement statistics are gathered in Table 1 and show good stereochemistry for the final model. Evf Structure Reveals a Novel Fold—The Evf protein adopts a globular fold with approximate dimensions 60 × 50 × 25 Å. The Evf protein contains two 310 helices (H1 and H2), six α-helices (α1 to α6), and 10 β-stands (β1 to β10) with a fairly complex topology (Fig. 1A, generated using Tops (30Westhead D.R. Slidel T.W. Flores T.P. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci.. 1999; 8: 897-904Google Scholar)). A search in the EBI-SSM server found no proteins with a similar fold in the Protein Data Bank. The Evf protein structure is therefore the first representative of a novel protein fold family. The Evf fold can be described as a central mixed β-sheet sandwiched between two α-helical layers (Fig. 1, B and C). The six-stranded β-sheet contains four antiparallel strands (β6β7β8β3/β4) which is completed after β6 by strand β2 and β1 from the N terminus of the protein and β9 from the C terminus as follows: β2 follows β6 and the β1 and β9 strands both form the last “strand” of the β-sheet, respectively, anti-parallel and parallel to β2. The β-sheet is highly curved and forms a half-barrel that cradles one of the α-helices (α4), a structural trait reminiscent of the fold seen in proteins of the hot-dog and related families (31Leulliot N. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Sorel I. Graille M. Meyer P. Liger D. Blondeau K. Janin J. van Tilbeurgh H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 23447-23452Google Scholar, 32Liger D. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Sorel I. Bremang M. Blondeau K. Aboulfath I. Janin J. van Tilbeurgh H. Leulliot N. Proteins.. 2005; 60: 778-786Google Scholar). The helical domain packing on the exterior convex side of the β-sheet is composed of the α1 at the N terminus, the α2, H1 and α3 helices (inserted between β2 and β3), and the α6 and α7 helices (inserted between β8 and β9). The α2 and α3 helices pack on the β-sheet roughly parallel to the β-strands, whereas α1 and α7 pack on the α2 and α3 helices at an ∼20° angle. Although this helical cap seems to form an independent structural domain, it contains elements from the N and C terminus of the protein. The second α-helical layer on the concave side of the β-sheet is composed of the α4 and α5 helices (inserted between β4 and β6) and the H2 310 helix (inserted between β7 and β8). The α4 helix runs inside the half-β-barrel, whereas α5 and H2 are perpendicular to the barrel axis and form a “lid” over the side of the barrel. In Situ Proteolysis during Crystallogenesis—As the protein only crystallized in the presence of trypsin, we set out to identify the crystallized Evf fragment. Mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing of dissolved crystals proved that Evf was cleaved at Arg23. Surprisingly, the electron density maps clearly showed that the peptide between residues 8 and 19 was present and well defined in the crystal structure forming helix α1 and flanking residues. The seven N-terminal residues up to the beginning of helix α1 and the three residues after α1 (Pro20–Gly22) in the α1-β1 loop were not visible in the final electron density map and were therefore not modeled. Trypsin digestion led to cleavage of the polypeptide chain at Arg23, and the residues from the N terminus and from the cut α1-β1 loop are probably disordered. It therefore appears that digestion of the protein by trypsin did not help crystallization by providing a shorter construct but simply by cutting inside the α1-β1 loop. Contrary to the residues 30–36 before β1, which pack against the side of the protein and have B-factors comparable with the rest of the protein residues, residues 23–29 protrude more into the solvent and have higher B-factors suggesting that residues 20–29 form a mobile loop. In our structure, the distance between Gly19 and Arg23 is compatible with the modeling of the three missing residues, but the cut most probably relaxes the structure of the loop away from a conformation that hampers crystallization. Inspection of the crystal packing indeed shows that this region is involved in intermolecular contacts, which could have been hindered with the intact protein. Addition of the protease therefore acts as a surface engineering step rather that removing unstructured regions. Evf Is S-Palmitoylated on Cys209—During refinement, clear residual electron density was detected indicating the presence of a long chain ligand covalently linked to Cys209 (Fig. 2). The hydrophobic nature of the surrounding residues and the form of the electron density suggested that a fatty acid was bound. To gain insight into the chemical nature of the fatty acid, direct ESI-MS measurements of the desalted Evf protein with and without DTT treatment were performed.

Although the function of eIF4B is conserved among plants, animals, and yeast, eIF4B is one of the least conserved of initiation factors at the sequence level. Mammalian eIF4B is a constitutive dimer; however, conflicting reports have suggested that plant eIF4B may exist as a monomer or a dimer. In this study, we show that eIF4B from wheat can form a dimer and we identify the region responsible for its dimerization. Zinc stimulated homodimerization of eIF4B and bound eIF4B with a Kd of 19.7 nm. Zinc increased the activity of the eIF4B C-terminal RNA-binding domain specifically. Zinc promoted the interaction between eIF4B and PABP but not the interaction between eIF4B and eIF4A or eIFiso4G, demonstrating that the effect of zinc was highly specific. The interaction between PABP and eIFiso4G was also stimulated by zinc but required significantly higher levels of zinc. Interestingly zinc abolished the ability of eIFiso4G to compete with eIF4B in binding to their overlapping binding sites in PABP by preferentially promoting the interaction between eIF4B and PABP. Our observations suggest that wheat eIF4B can dimerize but requires zinc. Moreover zinc controls the partner protein selection of PABP such that the interaction with eIF4B is preferred over eIFiso4G.

Protein synthesis is an essential step in gene expression, and several global and specific regulatory mechanisms targeting translation have evolved to control the level of proteins. As the recruitment of a ribosome to an mRNA is typically the rate-limiting step in translation (1Preiss T. Hentze M. BioEssays. 2003; 10: 1201-1211Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), regulation of protein synthesis occurs primarily during translation initiation. Several eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) 2The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic translation initiation factorPABPpoly(A)-binding proteinRRMRNA recognition motifGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin 2The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic translation initiation factorPABPpoly(A)-binding proteinRRMRNA recognition motifGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin are required to promote the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to an mRNA and to assemble the 80 S ribosome at the appropriate initiation codon (2Kapp L.D.

Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 87-128Google Scholar). The eIF4 group of initiation factors is particularly important for the recruitment of the ribosome. eIF4F binds to the 5′-cap structure of an mRNA and is composed of eIF4E, which is responsible for cap binding, and eIF4G, a modular scaffolding protein that interacts with eIF4E, eIF4A (an RNA helicase), eIF3 (required for 40 S binding to an mRNA), and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (4Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 949-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interaction between PABP and eIF4G results in the circularization of an mRNA and stimulates its translation by promoting 40 S recruitment (5Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 6Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition to eIF4F, plants contain an isoform, called eIFiso4F, which is composed of eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G (7Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In its function as a DEA(D/H) helicase, eIF4A uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind any secondary structure present in the 5′-leader of an mRNA that would otherwise inhibit 40 S subunit scanning (2Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 657-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). eIF4B enhances the helicase activity of eIF4A and eIF4F (8Rogers Jr., G.W. Richter N.J. Lima W.F.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The two RNA-binding domains in mammalian eIF4B have been proposed to bind mRNA and ribosomal RNA simultaneously, which also may contribute to 40 S subunit recruitment to an mRNA (11Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA. 1996; 2: 38-50PubMed Google Scholar). Like its animal ortholog, plant eIF4B can bind two RNA molecules simultaneously but differs from mammalian eIF4B in that it contains three RNA-binding domains (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24351-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to their interaction with eIF4G, mammalian and plant PABP also interact with eIF4B (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol.

A single interaction domain for eIF4B is present within a 32-amino acid region representing the C-terminal end of RNA recognition motif (RRM) 1 of PABP (15Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25247-25258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two eIFiso4G interaction domains are present in PABP: the first maps to a 36-amino acid region encompassing the C-terminal end of RRM1, the linker region, and the N-terminal end of RRM2 to which eIFiso4G binds strongly, whereas the second site maps to RRM3–4 to which eIFiso4G binds weakly (15Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25247-25258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interaction domain for eIF4B substantially overlaps the N-proximal eIFiso4G interaction domain in PABP. Consequently eIF4B and eIFiso4G exhibit competitive binding to PABP (15Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25247-25258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), supporting the overlapping nature of their interaction domains. eukaryotic translation initiation factor poly(A)-binding protein RNA recognition motif glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin eukaryotic translation initiation factor poly(A)-binding protein RNA recognition motif glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin In addition to its interaction with PABP, eIF4B interacts with eIF4G (or eIFiso4G), eIF4A, and, as mentioned previously, eIF3 and RNA. Thus, eIF4B helps to organize the assembly of the translation initiation machinery. Mammalian eIF4B is known to be a dimer in which the central DRYG-rich domain (16Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W. B. Davies M.V. Kelleher K. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) mediates eIF4B self-association as well as its interaction with eIF3a (10Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although wheat eIF4B has been reported to be a dimer (17Metz A.M. Wong K.C. Malmstrom S.A. Browning K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), no self-association was detected in a direct pulldown assay (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24351-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly the RNA binding activity of each of the three wheat eIF4B RNA-binding domains depends on the dimerization of the protein (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24351-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The observation that this aspect of eIF4B function is at variance with the observed lack of self-association has left unresolved the issue of whether or not plant eIF4B can dimerize. In this study, we present evidence that homodimerization of wheat eIF4B is dependent on a physiological concentration of zinc. The domain responsible for homodimerization mapped to a region encompassing the C-terminal RNA-binding domain. Zinc also stimulated the activity of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain as well as the interaction of PABP to its binding sites on either side of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain in eIF4B. Zinc did not stimulate the activity of the two other RNA-binding domains or the interaction of eIF4B with eIF4A or eIFiso4G, observations suggesting that the effect of zinc was specific to promoting the self-association of eIF4B, its interaction with PABP, and the activity of its C-terminal RNA-binding domain. Because zinc preferentially promoted the interaction between eIF4B and PABP, eIFiso4G was unable to compete with eIF4B in binding to their overlapping binding sites in PABP in the presence of zinc. These results suggest that zinc controls homodimerization of wheat eIF4B as well as the selection of partner proteins of PABP. Plasmid Construction and Protein Expression—Constructs for the expression of full-length or truncated eIFiso4G, eIF4B, and PABP were described previously (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24351-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additional constructs expressing eIF4B polypeptides were generated by PCR amplification of the appropriate coding region that was introduced into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (GE Healthcare) to generate GST-tagged protein, into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET19b (Novagen) to generate His-tagged protein, or into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pET19b to generate non-tagged protein. Point mutations were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis or using the GeneEditor in vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Promega). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. RNA Binding Assay—Truncated or full-length GST or His-tagged eIF4B was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells following induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and crude extract was made in Buffer B-100 (200 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) without EDTA but with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Poly(A)-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) was equilibrated in washing buffer (Buffer B-100 without EDTA but with 0.1% Triton X-100). The crude extract was incubated with the resin at 4 °C for 20 min with shaking. The resin was washed extensively with washing buffer, and the bound protein was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie. To test the metal ion requirement for RNA binding, divalent metal ions were tested by their addition as the chloride salt at the indicated concentration to the standard RNA binding assay reaction containing GST- or His-tagged eIF4B. Following incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, the poly(A)-Sepharose 4B resin was washed, and the extent of RNA binding was determined by SDS-PAGE. Dithiothreitol was omitted in reactions containing CoCl2, FeCl2, or NiCl2 to avoid reduction of the metal. Protein Interaction—Protein interactions were analyzed as described previously (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24351-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modification. GST fusion protein was added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) washed three times with precooled Buffer B-100 (supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100). Following incubation with shaking at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. Recombinant prey protein from crude extract was added to the resin and incubated for 2 h. The resin was washed four times with Tween phosphate-buffered saline (TPBS; 0.1% Tween 20, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Bound protein was released following the addition of SDS sample buffer to the resin. Following heating and centrifugation, the protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained or used for Western analysis. To eliminate apparent protein interaction resulting from RNA tethering, RNase A was added to the binding reaction assay. RNase A was added to the resin containing the bait protein and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The prey protein was treated similarly. The prey protein and metal ions were then added, and the reaction was incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. After extensive washing, bound protein was released following the addition of SDS sample buffer to the resin. The protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, and used for Western analysis. Western Analysis—Protein was transferred to 0.22-mm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk, 1% NaN3 in TPBS followed by incubation with antiserum in TPBS with 1% milk for 1.5 h. Membranes were washed twice with TPBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) diluted to 1:10,000 for 1 h. The blots were washed twice with TPBS, and the signal was detected typically between 1 and 15 min using chemiluminescence (Pierce). Anti-His antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. eIF4A and eIFiso4G antisera (a generous gift of K. Browning) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Fluorescence Titration Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SPEX Fluorolog-τ-2 spectrofluorometer equipped with a high intensity (450-watt) xenon arc lamp at 22 °C. Excitation and emission slit widths of 2.0 and 3 mm were used, and a path length of 1.0 cm was used. All chemicals were molecular biology grade. Binding experiments were performed using 50 and 150 nm full-length eIF4B protein to which increasing amounts of ZnCl2 and MgCl2 were added individually in separate experiments. To study the competition between Zn2+ and Mg2+ metal ion for the protein binding site, eIF4B was titrated with MgCl2 in the presence of 1000 nm ZnCl2. The background emission was eliminated by subtracting the signal from buffer containing an appropriate quantity of substrate. Data were averages of three or more titrations. Experiments using eIF4B were performed using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm to monitor the emission at 332 nm. The binding buffer used for all fluorescence studies consisted of 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl (pH 7.6). The fluorescence was normalized by using the formula fb = (F0 – Fobs)/(Fobs – F∞)(F0/F∞) + (F0 – Fobs), which is directly related to the fraction of protein bound (fb), where Fobs is the observed fluorescence, F0 is the fluorescence observed in the absence of any metal ion (that is the fluorescence of the protein), and F∞ is the fluorescence at saturation. The normalized fluorescence was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). The details of the data fitting are described elsewhere (9Bi X.P. Ren J.H. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Wei C.C. Balasta M.L.

ATPase Activity Assay—20-μl assays containing 15 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm non-labeled and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000–5000 cpm/pmol), and 0.5 μg of poly(U) RNA as described previously (21Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ZnCl2 and the indicated amounts of purified initiation factors. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and stopped by the sequential addition at 4 °C of 0.5 ml of a mixture of 20 mm silicotung-state and 20 mm sulfuric acid, 1.2 ml of 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 ml of 5% ammonium molybdate in 4 m sulfuric acid, 300 μl of a 1:l mixture of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 100% acetone, and 2 ml of a 1:l mixture of isobutyl alcohol and benzene. The tubes were then mixed and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min to separate the phases. Free phosphate from 0.5 ml of the organic phase was measured using scintillation counting from which the background was subtracted, and the picomoles of ATP hydrolyzed were quantitated. Identification of the eIF4B Dimerization Domain—Homodimerization of animal eIF4B requires a DRYG-rich domain (10Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding region in wheat eIF4B is rich only in glycine and aspartic acid, and its sequence is poorly conserved among plant homologs. To determine whether plant eIF4B can dimerize, full-length GST-tagged wheat eIF4B was used to pull down His-tagged eIF4B polypeptides, which were then detected using anti-His antiserum. GST-eIF4B did not interact with His-eIF4B45–280 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), which contains the region corresponding to the animal DRYG-rich dimerization domain, but did interact with His-eIF4B280–527 (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Neither His-eIF4B45–280 nor His-eIF4B280–527 bound to GST alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). These data indicated that the region corresponding to the animal DRYG-rich dimerization domain was not involved in the self-association of wheat eIF4B, but rather a region within the C-terminal half of eIF4B was required. To more precisely map the region responsible for homodimerization, a series of N-terminal deletions were tested for their ability to bind His-eIF4B280–527. His-eIF4B280–527 was able to bind to GST-eIF4B280–527 and GST-eIF4B320–527 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) but bound further N-terminal truncations significantly less, e.g. GST-eIF4B340–527, GST-eIF4B358–527, and GST-eIF4B390–527 (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6, respectively). This suggested that the N-terminal boundary of the dimerization domain is located between residues 320 and 340. This is similar to the N-terminal border of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain (12Cheng S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24351-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A construct containing a region sufficient for RNA binding, i.e. GST-eIF4B317–340 (see below), however, failed to bind His-eIF4B280–527 (Fig. 1C, lane 7), suggesting that this region was not sufficient for homodimerization. C-terminal truncations of eIF4B were also tested for their ability to bind His-eIF4B280–527. His-eIF4B280–527 bound GST-eIF4B69–390 (Fig. 1D, lane 6) and GST-eIF4B69–360 (Fig. 1D, lane 5), whereas binding to GST-eIF4B69–324 was markedly reduced (Fig. 1D, lane 4). Further C-terminal truncation abolished binding (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). Together these data suggested that the region between residues 320 and 360 contains the domain required for eIF4B self-association (Fig. 1F). The fact that eIF4B requires a specific region for dimerization indicates that its self-association, although weak under these conditions, is not because of nonspecific interactions. The region between amino acids 320 and 360 includes the C-terminal RNA-binding domain. RNA binding activity, however, does not explain the self-association of eIF4B as other eIF4B constructs containing the N-terminal or central RNA-binding domains did not exhibit eIF4B self-association in the absence of the region between residues 320 and 360 (Fig. 1; also see below). To test whether this region alone is sufficient for homodimerization, a GST fusion eIF4B fragment containing residues 320 to 360 (i.e. GST-eIF4B320–360) was tested for its ability to interact with His-eIF4B280–527. Although His-eIF4B280–527 bound GST-eIF4B320–527 and GST-eIF4B69–360 (Fig. 1E, lanes 4 and 7, respectively) as observed above, no binding to GST-eIF4B320–360 was detected (Fig. 1E, lane 2), suggesting that this region is necessary but may require additional sequence for proper folding to support the interaction. Dimerization of eIF4B Is Stimulated by Zinc—eIF4B, either as a GST fusion or when non-tagged, bound cobalt-based affinity resin (data not shown), suggesting that it could be a metal-loprotein. Cobalt is a borderline metal as defined by Pearson (22Pearson R.G. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1990; 100: 403-425Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This group of metal ions, which includes Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+, has a preference for the imidazole ring of histidine residues in proteins (23Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 24Porath J. Trends Anal. Chem. 1988; 7: 254-259Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar); seven histidine residues are present in wheat eIF4B. To examine whether metal ions may stimulate eIF4B self-association, several divalent metal ions were tested for their ability to stimulate the interaction between GST-eIF4B320–527 and His-eIF4B280–527 using the pulldown assay. The presence of 10 μm Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+ had no effect on eIF4B self-association (Fig. 2A, top panel, compare lanes 2–4 with lane 1). In contrast, 10 μm Zn2+ substantially stimulated eIF4B self-association (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 5). Ni2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ also stimulated eIF4B self-association (Fig. 2A, top panel, lanes 6–8) but to a smaller extent than did Zn2+. In the pulldown assay, zinc is included during the incubation of the prey protein with the bait protein as well as in the subsequent washes of the bait·prey protein complex. To determine how quickly the enhancement of eIF4B self-association by Zn2+ is lost when the latter is absent in the wash buffer, the protein interaction assay was performed in the presence of Zn2+ but washed with buffer lacking Zn2+. In the absence of Zn2+, little to no self-association of eIF4B was observed at a normal exposure of the Western blot (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 1), although a low level of interaction was observed with a longer exposure (Fig. 2B, middle panel, lane 1). Following formation of the bait·prey protein complex in the presence of Zn2+, a substantial stimulation of self-association was observed even after four washes in the absence of Zn2+ (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 2). Additional washes of the complex in the absence of Zn2+, however, resulted in a decrease in the level of self-association detected (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). To determine whether the presence of Zn2+ during the interaction and wash steps maintains the self-association, the effect of wash buffer containing Zn2+ was compared with wash buffer lacking Zn2+. When Zn2+ was absent from both the binding and wash buffer, little self-association of eIF4B was detected (Fig. 2C, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). The presence of Zn2+ during the incubation of the prey protein with the bait protein but not during the subsequent four washes of the bait·prey protein complex resulted in a level of self-association similar to that when Zn2+ was present in both (Fig. 2C, top panel, compare lane 3 with lane 5). The presence of Zn2+ during eight washes of the bait·prey protein complex maintained the self-association compared with the decrease in self-association when Zn2+ was absent from the wash buffer (Fig. 2C, top panel, compare lane 6 with lane 4). These results indicate that binding of Zn2+ is relatively stable but can be removed from eIF4B by extensive washing in the absence of Zn2+. As GST can dimerize (26Trakshel G.M. Maines M.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), GST-eIF4B constructs may be expected to dimerize preferentially and reduce their interaction with His-eIF4B constructs. Moreover, it was formally possible that the His tag in the His-eIF4B constructs might bind zinc and facilitate an interaction between His-eIF4B constructs, thus reducing their interaction with GST-eIF4B constructs. To eliminate any effect that the GST or His tags may have had on the observed self-association of eIF4B, the HA and FLAG tags were substituted for the GST and His tags, respectively. HA-tagged eIF4B320–527 was used to pull down FLAG-tagged eIF4B280–527, and the presence of FLAG-eIF4B280–527 was detected using anti-FLAG antiserum. In the absence of HA-eIF4B320–527, only limited binding of FLAG-eIF4B280–527 to the resin was detected (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 3). In the absence of Zn2+, little self-association was detected above the background binding (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 4). As observed when the GST- and His-tagged proteins were used, however, the presence of Zn2+ during the pulldown and subsequent washes resulted in a substantial increase in self-association (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 6). The increase in eIF4B self-association by zinc was similar to that observed between the GST- and His-tagged constructs (Fig. 2B). As observed above, the absence of Zn2+ from the wash buffer resulted in reduced self-association (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 5). Similar results were obtained for the effect of Zn2+ on the interaction between GST-eIF4B280–527 and HA-eIF4B320–527. In the absence of Zn2+, little self-association was detected (Fig. 2E, top panel, lane 4). Inclusion of Zn2+ in the binding and wash buffers resulted in a substantial increase in self-association (Fig. 2E, top panel, lane 6), whereas the absence of Zn2+ from the wash buffer resulted in reduced self-association (Fig. 2E, top panel, lane 5). GST alone did not interact with HA-eIF4B320–527 in the presence or absence of Zn2+ (Fig. 2E, top panel, lanes 1–3). These results demonstrate that the effect of Zn2+ on eIF4B self-association is independent of the tag used and that eIF4B self-association is not obscured by the use of the GST and His tags. To determine the degree of eIF4B self-association, GST-eIF4B320–527 was used to pull down His-eIF4B280–527 in the presence or absence of zinc, and the amount of His-eIF4B280–527 bound to GST-eIF4B320–527 was determined by Coomassie staining following resolution of the proteins by SDS-PAGE. Following quantitation of the proteins and normalization for the difference in their molecular weights, the relative molar amount of GST-eIF4B320–527 and His-eIF4B280–527 in a complex in the absence of zinc was 1:0.006 (Fig. 2F, lane 5), suggesting a level of association less than 1%. In the presence of zinc during binding but not in the subsequent wash steps, the relative molar amount of GST-eIF4B320–527 and His-eIF4B280–527 in a complex was 1:0.16 (Fig. 2F, lane 6), an increase in association of 26-fold over that observed in the absence of zinc. When zinc was present during binding and in the subsequent wash steps, the relative molar amount of GST-eIF4B320–527 to His-eIF4B280–527 in a complex was 1:0.28 (Fig. 2F, lane 7), an increase in association of 46-fold over that observed in the absence of zinc. These results indicate that a significant fraction of the eIF4B is present as a complex in the presence of zinc. The concentration of zinc required for eIF4B self-association was next examined. Addition of zinc stimulated the binding of His-eIF4B280–527 to full-length GST-eIF4B as it did for GST-eIF4B320–527 and did so ove"

We measured the head-saccades of barn owls and the responses of neurons in their auditory space-maps while presenting a long duration noise-burst and a simulated echo. Under this paradigm, there were two possible stimulus segments that could potentially signal the location of the echo. One was at the onset of the echo; the other, after the offset of the direct (leading) sound, when only the echo was present. By lengthening the echo's duration, independently of its delay, spikes and saccades were evoked by the source of the echo even at delays that normally evoked saccades to only the direct source. An echo's location thus appears to be signaled by the neural response evoked after the offset of the direct sound."
https://openalex.org/W2128704534,"The pentapeptide repeat is a recently discovered protein fold. Mycobacterium tuberculosis MfpA is a founding member of the pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP) family that confers resistance to the antibiotic fluoroquinolone by binding to DNA gyrase and inhibiting its activity. The size, shape, and surface potential of MfpA mimics duplex DNA. As an initial step in a comprehensive biophysical analysis of the role of PRPs in the regulation of cellular topoisomerase activity and conferring antibiotic resistance, we have explored the solution structure and refolding of MfpA by fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, and analytical centrifugation. A unique CD spectrum for the pentapeptide repeat fold is described. This spectrum reveals a native structure whose β-strands and turns within the right-handed quadrilateral β-helix that define the PRP fold differ from canonical secondary structure types. MfpA refolded from urea or guanidium by dialysis or dilution forms stable aggregates of monomers whose secondary and tertiary structure are not native. In contrast, MfpA refolded using a novel time-dependent renaturation protocol yields protein with native secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. The generality of time-dependent renaturation to other proteins and denaturation methods is discussed."

Principal Findings In this work we demonstrate that BAL 31 activity is affected by the presence of guanine in single-stranded DNA oligomers. Specifically, nuclease activity is shown to be affected by guanine's presence in minimal homopolymeric tracts in the middle of short oligomer substrates and also by its presence at the 3′ end of ten and twenty base oligomers. G•C rich regions in dsDNA are known to cause a decrease in the enzyme's nuclease activity which has been attributed to the increased thermal stability of these regions, thus making it more difficult to unwind the strands required for enzyme access. Our results indicate that an additional phenomenon could be wholly or partly responsible for the loss of activity in these G•C rich regions. Thus the presence of a guanine tract per se impairs the enzyme's functionality, possibly due to the tract's bulky nature and preventing efficient progression through the active site. Conclusions This study has revealed that the general purpose BAL 31 nuclease commonly used in molecular genetics exhibits a hithertofore non-characterized degree of substrate specificity with respect to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligomers. Specifically, BAL 31 nuclease activity was found to be affected by the presence of guanine in ssDNA oligomers."
