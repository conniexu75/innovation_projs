https://openalex.org/W2003999479,"This discussion of a few preliminary experiments with nickel points out some of the potential uses of low energy electron diffraction in improving our understanding of many types of surface phenomena. The first, and probably the most basic use, is in the study of clean surfaces. As illustrated in this article, the physical properties of the surface layer of atoms may be totally unlike those in the bulk of the crystal. It is necessary to understand such phenomena before a thorough understanding of chemical effects on surfaces can be achieved. The adsorption of gases, oxidation and corrosion, and the formation of epitaxial layers can all be studied in great detail by low energy electron diffraction."

In particular, it now appears likely that an intensive study of the distribution of elements in meteorites will enable one to draw important conclusions concerning the structure of planets, the origin of our solar system, and the relative 'cosmic' abundances of the chemical elements . Unfortunately, with the exception of a very few common elements such as oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, nickel, and calcium, the large majority of the elements are present in meteorites to an extent of only a few parts per million. As it is frequently desirable to assay the concentration of many of the rarer constituents of meteorites with an accuracy of 10 per cent or better, grave analytical problems are presented. V. M. Goldschmidt, Hevesy, and the Noddacks, who did much of the excellent earlier work on assaying the rarer constituents of meteorites, used at one time or another straightforward quantitative chemical methods, x-ray spectroscopy, and chemical spectroscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2053445395,"The incoherent scattering of incident radio energy by free electrons at high altitudes is useful for measuring plasma density and kinetic temperatures in the magnetosphere. The radio wave resolves a particular spatial Fourier component of the plasma-density fluctuations that is approximately proportional to the ionization density in the region where the scattering occurs. Echoes are obtained from all parts of a volume filled with plasma without mutual interference since this scattering is very weak. Thus, through the use of pulsed radar, the electron density can be measured as a function of distance. The range resolution of the measurement is proportional to the length of the pulse. A large radar station, the Jicamarca Radar Observatory, near Lima, Peru, was established primarily to make incoherent scatter studies of the earth's upper atmosphere and determine the usefulness of these observations in a general study of plasma instabilities. Electron density profiles for varying altitudes obtained by the Jicamarca Radar Observatory are presented. (H.G.G.)"
