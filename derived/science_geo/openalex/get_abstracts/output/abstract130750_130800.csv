We found previously that detergent insolubility of lipids was characteristic of phases in which lipid acyl chains are ordered. We presented evidence that GPI-anchored proteins are insoluble because they associate with cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich lipid domains with properties similar to the liquid-ordered phase. Here, this model was tested by a variety of approaches. First, we demonstrated that saponin, which removes cholesterol from cell membranes and allows solubilization of GPI-anchored proteins by Triton X-100, had the same effect on the GPI-anchored protein alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) in SCRLs of appropriate lipid composition. The similarity of saponin action in cells and simple liposomes suggests that the compound disrupts protein-lipid interactions. However, direct interactions between PLAP and cholesterol were not needed for insolubility, because the protein was also insoluble in cholesterol-free liposomes containing lipid in an ordered phase. Instead, cholesterol acted by greatly enhancing the formation of a detergent-insoluble phase by sphingolipids, which have a tendency to form ordered phases. We propose that saponin solubilizes GPI-anchored proteins because the lipid composition of cell membranes (and the SCRLs used above) supports ordered phase formation in the presence but not the absence of cholesterol. Supporting this model, saponin did not promote Triton X-100 solubilization of PLAP in SCRLs with sphingolipid levels high enough to allow ordered phase formation in the absence of cholesterol. We also showed that two additional GPI-anchored proteins are detergent-insoluble in SCRLs and that detergent does not artifactually create ordered domains or cause components of solubilized membranes to associate with detergent-resistant membranes present in separate bilayers in the same lysate. We conclude that the ordered domain model explains the behavior of detergent-resistant membranes in liposomes and cells.

This property is surprising because GPI-anchored proteins are restricted to the extracellular leaflet of the lipid bilayer, and it has been generally presumed that most detergent-insoluble membrane proteins bind to the cytoskeleton. We showed earlier that GPI-anchored proteins are present in detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fragments that can be isolated from cell lysates after extraction (3Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). A number of other groups have replicated this finding in a wide variety of cell types (4Cinek T. Horejsı́ V.A. J.

These findings suggested that direct interactions between GPI-anchored proteins and lipids in detergent-insoluble membrane domains might lead to detergent insolubility. Further support for this proposal came from studies in which a GPI-anchored protein, PLAP, was incorporated into sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich liposomes (SCRLs), which have a lipid composition similar to that of detergent-insoluble membrane domains isolated from cells (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The protein associated with detergent-insoluble membranes derived from SCRLs after extraction. This result showed directly that interactions between PLAP and lipids were sufficient for detergent insolubility of the protein; no other proteins were required. Based on further liposome studies on the lipid requirements for detergent insolubility, we proposed that DRMs are present in cell membranes as domains in a sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich ordered phase. DRMs are similar in several ways to the liquid-ordered (lo) phase previously described in model membranes (11Ipsen J.H. Karlström G. Mouritsen O.G. Wennerström H. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1995; 68: 978-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). lophase domains can co-exist in bilayers with domains in the more familiar gel or liquid crystalline (lc) phases (14Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Pure phospholipids exist in a solid, ordered gel phase at low temperatures. Above a melting temperature (T m) that is characteristic of each lipid, pure lipids form the fluid, disordered lc phase. Most of the phospholipids in cell membranes have low T m values and are believed to be in the lc phase. The lo phase, which requires sterol to form, has properties intermediate between gel and lcphases. It has been observed in mixtures of cholesterol with lipids whose highly saturated acyl chains gives them a highT m in the pure state (11Ipsen J.H. Karlström G. Mouritsen O.G. Wennerström H. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 12Almeida P.F.F. Vaz W.L.C. Thompson T.E.

Both saturated chain phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelin can form the lophase when mixed with cholesterol (13Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). DRMs have several properties in common with the lo phase. Both are rich in cholesterol, are detergent-resistant, and contain lipids with similar acyl chain mobility (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Because of the complexity of cell membranes, further characterization of the physical properties of cellular DRMs is difficult. As a useful working model, we have proposed that DRMs arise from domains in cell membranes that are in the lo phase or a phase similar to it. It is likely that the saturated acyl chains generally found in GPI-anchored proteins (16McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) mediate the association of these proteins with detergent-insoluble domains. Cerneus et al. (17Cerneus D.P. Ueffing E. Posthuma G. Strous G.J. van der Ende A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3150-3155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that after treatment of mammalian cells with saponin, GPI-anchored proteins could readily be solubilized by Triton X-100. Saponin, like other cardiac glycosides, complexes with membrane cholesterol, sequestering this lipid away from other interactions (18Elias P.M. Goerke J. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 577-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the Triton insolubility of GPI-anchored proteins requires cholesterol. Similarly, Hanadaet al. (19Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) found that the Triton X-100 resistance of PLAP depended on the presence of cholesterol, as well as of sphingolipids. Neither study provided a mechanism for this phenomenon. Based on our model, we propose that the sphingolipid and cholesterol dependence of GPI-anchored protein insolubility does not depend on a specific interaction between the proteins and these lipids. Rather, sphingolipids and cholesterol are required to maintain detergent-insoluble ordered domains in the membranes. In this paper, we used model membranes to test this and other predictions of our model of detergent insolubility. First, we examined the mechanism underlying the requirement of sphingolipids and cholesterol for detergent insolubility of GPI-anchored proteins. We also examined the detergent insolubility of two other GPI-anchored proteins and a transmembrane protein in SCRLs. In addition, we determined how well detergent insolubility reflects membrane properties prior to detergent addition. The results strongly suggest that detergent insolubility is a useful method for investigating cell membrane structure. Brain phosphatidylcholine (brain PC), bovine liver phosphatidylcholine (liver PC), dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), brain sphingomyelin, and brain cerebrosides were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol was from Avanti or Sigma. [3H]Sphingomyelin (80 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). [7-3H]Cholesterol (5–15 Ci/mmol; [3H]cholesterol) andl-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline, 1,2-dipalmitoyl (40–85 Ci/mmol; [3H]DPPC) were from Amersham Corp. N-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside) was from Jersey Lab and Glove Supply (Livingston, NJ). CHAPS, saponin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Acrylamide and bisacrylamide were from Boehringer Mannheim. Nitrocellulose and pre-stained molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. The enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL) was from Amersham Corp., and the Renaissance reagent was from NEN Life Science Products. Rabbit anti-PLAP (IgG fraction, 5 mg/ml) was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Except as noted, all protein-free liposomes were multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). To prepare these, lipids (amounts given in figure legends) were dried under nitrogen gas, redissolved in a small volume of CHCl3, dried under nitrogen and by lyophilization, and resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 60 °C (85 °C for liposomes containing cerebrosides). Lipids were vortexed for 30 s and incubated for 30 min at 60 or 85 °C as appropriate. They were vortexed again for 30 s, incubated for 15 min at 60 or 85 °C, and then allowed to cool to room temperature (at least 30 min.) Where noted, liposomes contained 0.1 μCi of [3H]sphingomyelin, [3H]cholesterol, or [3H]DPPC. SCRLs contained 2:1:1:2 (mole ratio) liver or brain PC:sphingomyelin:cerebrosides:cholesterol. “Low sphingolipid SCRLs” (Fig. 1 A) contained the same lipids in a 56.7:5:5:33.3 mole ratio. All protein-containing liposomes were large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). LUVs containing GPI-anchored proteins were constructed by sonication and freeze-thaw as described (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). LUVs containing bacteriorhodopsin were made by co-dialysis of lipids and purified protein as described below. PLAP was purified from a partially pure preparation from Sigma as described (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Human and bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were purified as described (20Roberts W.L. Kim B.H. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The peak fraction of the human enzyme eluted from the ligand-linked (acridinium) affinity resin was dialyzed against 5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, to remove the eluting ligand (decamethonium) but contained 0.1% Triton X-100. The peak fraction of the bovine enzyme was not dialyzed and contained 2% Triton X-114. The specific activity of both preparations was about 5,000 units/mg, where 1 unit = 1 μmol of acetylcholine hydrolyzed per min. Purple membranes isolated from Halobacterium halobium (21Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) were the kind gift of H. G. Khorana (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Bacteriorhodopsin, essentially the only protein in the membranes, was solubilized in octyl glucoside as described in Ref. 22Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholarjust before incorporation into liposomes. Insoluble bacteriorhodopsin was removed from lysates by pelleting at top speed in an Airfuge for 30 min. PLAP was incorporated as described (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Except as noted, each sample contained 2 mg of lipid and about 100 ng of protein (assuming 50% incorporation of protein into liposomes). For acetylcholinesterase, just before incorporation into liposomes, 7.4 μg of human or 11.6 μg of bovine enzyme were pelleted for 10 min at top speed in an Airfuge to pellet any aggregated protein. The supernatant was mixed with liposomes containing 2 mg of total lipid, in a final volume of 550 μl of PBS with a final concentration of 0.18% CHAPS. The mixture was dialyzed against PBS for 2–3 days at 4 °C. Human acetylcholinesterase was incorporated into SCRLs or control liver PC/cholesterol 7:1 liposomes. The bovine protein was incorporated only in SCRLs and not into PC/cholesterol liposomes, as the Triton X-114 in the purified enzyme sample was sufficient to solubilize the latter. Each sample was then subjected to centrifugation in a Sorvall RC M120 ultracentrifuge at 200,000 × g for 1 h. Pelleted liposomes were resuspended in 2 ml of PBS and washed two more times under the same conditions. After the final wash, liposomes were resuspended in 0.7 ml of PBS. For bacteriorhodopsin incorporation, the solubilized bacteriorhodopsin from purple membranes containing 10 μg of protein was added to 2 mg of lipids in a final volume of 1 ml of PBS containing 120 mm octyl glucoside. The mixture was dialyzed against PBS for 2 days. Liposomes were washed once as for acetylcholinesterase and resuspended in 600 μl of PBS. Except where noted, one-half of each of these samples was extracted with detergent as detailed below; the other half served as an unextracted control. For detergent extraction, except as noted, liposomes were extracted with 0.35–1% Triton X-100 for 20–30 min on ice. Except as noted, lysates or control samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1–2 h at 200,000 × g, and supernatant and pellet fractions were separated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transfer to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting were as described (23Arreaza G. Melkonian K.A. LaFevre-Bernt M. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19123-19127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 16 × 16-cm gels were sometimes run instead of mini-gels, and the Renaissance and ECL reagents were used interchangeably. Ammoniacal silver staining was used (see Ref. 24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 651-652Google Scholar), except that gels were not fixed or treated with glutaraldehyde, but were only incubated for 1 h in 50% methanol before addition of the silver/ammonia solution. Bacteriorhodopsin from supernatant and pellet fractions was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 10 μg of ovalbumin as carrier, resuspended in gel loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. PLAP was either analyzed by the same method or was harvested from supernatant and pellet (after solubilizing in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 with warming to 37 °C for 5 min) by immunoprecipitation as from cell lysates (25Arreaza G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) before SDS-PAGE. PLAP was detected by Western blotting using 1–2 μg/ml antibodies and ECL. Bacteriorhodopsin was detected by silver staining. All bands were quantitated using a Bio-Rad GS-670 scanning densitometer. For acetylcholinesterase, supernatants after ultracentrifugation were adjusted to 1% Triton X-100. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. All samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (26Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and then concentrated using Centricon 50 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a final volume of 50 μl. Enzyme activity was assayed using a previously described modification (27Rosenberry T.L. Scoggin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the colorimetric method of Ellman (28Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21913) Google Scholar). 1 unit of enzyme activity (1 μmol of acetylcholine hydrolyzed per min) corresponds to 3.67 ΔA 412 nm per min. The total activity (supernatant + pellet) in each sample was about 2 units for human acetylcholinesterase and 0.01 units for the bovine protein. Pellets from liposomes containing radioactive tracers were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and radioactivity in both supernatant and pellet fractions was measured in a scintillation counter. DPPC/cholesterol MLVs were prepared and treated with Triton X-100 as described above. The light scattering of each sample before and after Triton X-100 treatment was measured in a 1-cm excitation and 4-mm emission path length quartz cuvette in a Spex 212 Fluorolog spectrofluorimeter, using 0.25-mm excitation and emission slits. Both excitation and emission wavelengths were 550 nm. The cuvette was maintained at 45 °C in a Neslab RTE 100 temperature bath. Samples were incubated in the spectrofluorimeter in the dark for 2 min. Three individual light scattering readings of 1 s each were then made and averaged. The ratio of post-Triton X-100 to pre-Triton X-100 light scattering was calculated. Concentration of solutions is expressed as percent weight/volume for solids and percent volume/volume for liquids. Cerneus et al. (17Cerneus D.P. Ueffing E. Posthuma G. Strous G.J. van der Ende A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3150-3155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that pretreatment of BeWo cells with a low concentration of saponin, which complexes with membrane cholesterol, resulted in solubilization of PLAP upon addition of Triton X-100. We confirmed this finding in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (26Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we asked whether saponin had a similar effect on PLAP in vitro. We have previously shown that PLAP is insoluble in Triton X-100 when incorporated into SCRLs (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). For reasons that will be discussed below, in this experiment we used “low sphingolipid” SCRLs that contained only 10% total sphingolipid. Liposomes were treated with or without saponin and then extracted with Triton X-100. Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation. Proteins isolated from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, saponin pretreatment greatly increased Triton X-100 solubilization of PLAP from these liposomes, as it does from cells. (Average of two experiments: 91% insoluble without saponin and 2% insoluble with saponin.) Fig.1 B will be discussed below. The role of cholesterol in the detergent insolubility of GPI-anchored proteins is not known. According to our model, PLAP is Triton X-100-insoluble because it associates with cholesterol-rich ordered domains. Thus, we predict that the role of cholesterol in insolubility is to maintain lipids in the ordered state. Alternatively, one might imagine that GPI-anchored proteins must interact directly and specifically with cholesterol to be insoluble. Acyl chains in both lo and gel phase lipids are more ordered than those in the fluid lc phase. At least some lipids (including DPPC) are detergent-insoluble when present in the gel phase (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 29Ribeiro A.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 332: 26-35Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as is true for the lo phase (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Thus, if GPI-anchored proteins partition into an ordered, detergent-insoluble environment, as we proposed, then they should associate with cholesterol-free gel phase domains as well as cholesterol-rich ordered domains. Alternatively, if cholesterol is absolutely required for insolubility, then Triton X-100 should solubilize PLAP from gel phase membranes. Gel phase DPPC liposomes containing PLAP were subjected to detergent extraction. As shown in Fig.2 A, the protein was completely insoluble. However, it seemed possible that the protein might be “forced” into the gel phase as it was the only phase available. To test this possibility, we incorporated PLAP into DPPC/DOPC 1:1 liposomes. As the detergent extraction was performed on ice, DPPC (T m = 41 °C) was largely present in the gel phase, and DOPC (T m = −20 °C) was largely present in the lc phase (29Ribeiro A.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 332: 26-35Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PLAP was still completely Triton X-100-insoluble (Fig. 2 B), showing that it associated with the detergent-insoluble gel phase even when a fluid phase was present. PLAP was fully soluble in control fluid phase liver PC/cholesterol 7:1 liposomes (Fig. 2 C). As a control for the specificity of the saponin effect on PLAP in SCRLs (Fig.1 A), DPPC or DPPC/DOPC liposomes were also treated with saponin before addition of Triton X-100 (Fig. 2, D andE). As expected, addition of saponin had no effect on insolubility. This experiment showed that saponin does not interact with liposomes or with Triton X-100 in any unexpected cholesterol-independent manner and that 0.4% saponin by itself does not solubilize PLAP. Together, these results showed that cholesterol is not absolutely required for detergent insolubility of PLAP. Instead, they support our model that detergent insolubility of GPI-anchored proteins results from their association with an ordered lipid phase. Our previous results (10Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1(−Sap) show that PLAP is Triton X-100-insoluble when it is present in detergent-insoluble cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich membranes. The results in Fig. 2 show that the protein is also insoluble when it is in liposomes containing lipids in the gel phase. Lipids with high T m, such as sphingolipids, can form a gel phase at or near physiological temperatures (30Barenholz Y. Suurkuusk J. Mountcastle D. Thompson T.E. Biltonen R.L.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, we might expect that after removal of cholesterol with saponin, sphingolipids in cell membranes or SCRLs would form a detergent-insoluble gel phase and that PLAP could associate with this phase. Why then was PLAP solubilized from SCRLs after saponin treatment (Fig. 1 A, +Sap)? Because formation of an ordered phase by sphingolipids depends on their concentration in the membrane, one possible explanation is that the sphingolipid concentration was too low to form a gel phase after saponin treatment of SCRLs. According to this scenario, cholesterol promotes the formation of an ordered phase, so that a higher concentration of sphingolipid is required to form a gel phase than an lo-like phase. In other words, the small amount of sphingolipid used in Fig. 1 A might be insufficient for gel phase formation after cholesterol removal but enough for formation of an lo phase (or a similar cholesterol-containing ordered phase) in the presence of cholesterol. Consistent with this idea, we have recently found using fluorescence quenching that cholesterol promotes phase separation in phospholipid/sphingomyelin mixtures (31Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To test this model for the lipids used in this study, we examined the effect of cholesterol and sphingolipid levels on the solubilization of liposomes by Triton X-100. We made three series of MLVs, each containing [3H]sphingomyelin as a tracer. The first set of liposomes contained graded mixtures of brain PC and sphingolipids (cerebrosides and sphingomyelin 1:1) and a constant 33 mol % cholesterol. The liposomes were subjected to extraction with 1% Triton X-100, followed by ultracentrifugation. Radioactivity in both supernatant and pellet fractions was measured in a scintillation counter. Results (Fig. 3 A, squares) showed that the percentage of insoluble sphingomyelin increased with increasing sphingolipid. (Results were similar when [3H]cholesterol was substituted for [3H]sphingomyelin (triangles).) We next repeated the experiment, using liposomes that lacked cholesterol. As seen"

An MT1-MMP-independent cell surface receptor for TIMP-2 has also been postulated. To clarify TIMP-2 binding, we have performed 125I-TIMP-2 binding studies on transfected COS-1 cells and endothelial cells.

Treatment of MT1-MMP transfected COS-1 cells with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor of MMPs, CT-1746, but not an inactive stereoisomer, CT-1915, produced dose-dependent inhibition of specific TIMP-2 binding comparable with that noted with excess unlabeled TIMP-2. This result suggests that TIMP-2 binds to the zinc catalytic site of MT1-MMP.

Other investigators reported that high concentrations of soluble forms of MT1-MMP (lacking the transmembrane domain) directly activate progelatinase A (21Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

TIMP-2 does not participate in this activation, but can function as an inhibitor of this process.

In addition to examining the binding of radiolabeled TIMP-2 in HUVEC,125I-labeled TIMP-2 binding was examined in COS-1 cells transfected with MT1-MMP cDNA or pcDNA3 vector in the presence of synthetic inhibitors of MMPs. The results indicate that the functional catalytic site of MT1-MMP serves as the binding site for TIMP-2 in both MT1-MMP transfected COS-1 cells and HUVEC.MATERIALS AND METHODSBovine serum albumin (BSA), polyoxyethylene ethers (W1), and chloramine T were purchased from Sigma.

The cells were washed once with DMEM and incubated for 2 min in 10% Me2SO in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS. Finally, the cells were incubated for 1 day in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. For receptor binding studies, COS-1 cells were propagated to confluence in 24-well dishes (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) and then switched to serum-free conditions. The strategy for generating a truncated form of recombinant TIMP-2 with deletion of the C-terminal region extending from Cys128 to Pro194 (ΔTIMP-2) has been described (27Ko Y.-C. Langley K.E.

For receptor binding studies, HUVEC were propagated in gelatin-coated 24-well dishes and employed in experiments when >90% confluence was achieved. Concanavalin A (40 μg/ml) was added for the final 18 h of HUVEC culture in serum-free M199 or human endothelial serum-free medium.Immunoblotting and Gelatin Substrate ZymographyImmunoblotting was performed using protein A affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to human MT1-MMP as described previously (1Zucker S.

Molecular weights were determined using prestained protein standards.Zymography was performed in 10% polyacrylamide gels that had been cast in the presence of 0.1% gelatin as described previously (1Zucker S.

After electrophoresis, SDS was replaced by Triton X-100, thus renaturing gelatinases, followed by incubation in a Tris-based buffer for 24 h. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and gelatinolytic activity was detected as a clear band in the background of uniform staining.Preparation of Plasma Membrane-enriched Cell FractionsCell membranes were prepared from endothelial cells following nitrogen cavitation as described previously (28Zucker S. Wieman J.M. Lysik R.M. Wilkie D. Ramamurthy N.S. Golub L.M. Lane B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1608-1614PubMed Google Scholar). The post-nuclear supernatant (770 × g × 10 min) was collected, and heavy organelles were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × gfor 15 min. This supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C to recover the plasma membrane enriched lighter cell organelles in the pellet. Cell organelles were characterized by electron microscopy as described previously (28Zucker S. Wieman J.M. Lysik R.M. Wilkie D. Ramamurthy N.S. Golub L.M. Lane B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1608-1614PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental design included incubating cell organelles with either buffer (to determine spontaneous release of membrane-associated gelatinase) or with 72-kDa recombinant progelatinase A for 18 h at 37 °C to determine membrane-induced activation of progelatinase A. After incubating membranes with progelatinase A, conditioned medium was recovered and subjected to gelatin zymography. Protein determinations were made using the bicinchoninic acid reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce BCA protein assay reagent).Cell Surface Binding of TIMP-2Recombinant TIMP-2 (rTIMP-2) was iodinated to a specific activity of 5.5 × 1010dpm/mg by adding 0.25 mCi of Na125I to a tube containing 10 μg of rTIMP-2 and 100 μg of chloramine T. After 5-min incubation at 23 °C, 200 μg of sodium metabisulfite was added, and125I-labeled TIMP-2 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA was separated from free 125I by chromatography over a G-25 Sephadex column (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.). In an independent study using the Nanorange protein quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), this radiolabeling procedure resulted in >95% recovery of125I-TIMP-2. Biological activity of radiolabeled TIMP-2 was confirmed by measuring the ability of 125I-labeled TIMP-2 to inhibit the activation of progelatinase A as compared with unlabeled TIMP-2 (demonstrated by zymography). Binding of125I-labeled TIMP-2 to cells propagated in 24-well dishes (Corning Costar, Wilmington, MA) to >90% confluence was performed in duplicate (∼10% variation between duplicates) as follows. Cells were washed thoroughly and treated with 3 m glycine buffer in 0.9% saline, pH 3, for 3 min to dissociate preformed receptor-ligand complexes. Cells were then washed with cold PBS with 0.1% BSA. For equilibrium binding experiments, dilutions of 125I-labeled TIMP-2 (0.1–16 nm) in PBS-BSA buffer were added to cells in 200 μl of serum-fee medium (total volume) in the presence or absence of excess of unlabeled rTIMP-2 or rTIMP-1 at 4 and 22 °C. After 30–240 min of incubation, supernatant fluid was collected and dishes were washed three times with PBS; washes were collected and added to the unbound 125I-TIMP-2 fraction. Cell monolayers were then lysed in 0.1% SDS in 0.5 m NaOH and collected as the bound fraction. Bound and unbound 125I were measured by γ counting. The residual radioactivity associated with cells in the nonspecific binding experiment (50-fold excess TIMP-2) was subtracted from the total bound fraction (no unlabeled TIMP-2) to give specific binding. Scatchard plot analysis of binding data employed best-fit curves using the Sigma Plot program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). In competition experiments, cells were preincubated with hydroxamic acid inhibitors or TIMPs for 30 min prior to the addition of125I-TIMP-2.Cross-linking ExperimentsThe 100,000 × gplasma membrane-enriched fraction from COS-1 was isolated as described above for HUVEC. Membrane proteins were extracted using 0.25% (final concentration) polyoxyethylene ether (W-1) in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mmCaCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, extracted proteins were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled TIMP-2. Cross-linking was performed in 10 μl of total volume containing indicated amounts of radiolabeled ligand, competing ligand, and detergent-extracted membrane proteins in HEPES buffer. The reaction was incubated with 2 mm BS3 for 1 h at 4 °C to allow cross-linking (covalent amide bond formed when theN-hydroxysuccinimide ester conjugation reagent reacts with primary amines); the cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 1m Tris for 10 min.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23730-23738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h to immunoprecipitate MT1-MMP and MT1-MMP-containing complexes. The mixture was then incubated with protein A-coated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 2 h with constant rocking at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in HEPES buffer five times by centrifugation until release of radiolabeled125I was minimal. Beads were then added to SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were heated for 2 min in a boiling water bath prior to loading on a 8–12% gradient gel. The gels were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have employed radiolabeled recombinant TIMP-2 to demonstrate specific TIMP-2 receptors on MT1-MMP transfected COS-1 cells and human endothelial cells. The absence of specific TIMP-2 binding to pcDNA3 vector transfected COS-1 cells identifies MT1-MMP as the TIMP-2 receptor. The K d of 1.39 and 0.77 nm (derived from Scatchard plot analysis) for the TIMP-2 receptor on COS-1 cells and concanavalin A treated-endothelial cells, respectively, is similar to previous data derived from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated wild-type HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, but the number of receptor sites identified per MT1-MMP transfected COS-1 cell (450,000) and per endothelial cell (183,000) are considerably higher than previously reported with cancer cells (25,000–40,000/cell) (8Strongin A.Y.

Corcoran M.L. Foidart J.-M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These differences may be due to our use of a low pH buffer to strip surface receptors of bound ligand prior to adding 125I-TIMP-2, which would have the effect of increasing the number of available receptor sites per cell. Of note, based on the ∼20–30% efficiency of MT1-MMP transfection in COS-1 cells (data not shown), the actual number of TIMP-2 receptor sites per transfected cell is many fold higher than noted with nontransfected cells (endothelial cells, tumor cells), which reflects the high level of expression of MT1-MMP resulting from transient transfection with MT1-MMP cDNA. In contrast to the above data, Hayakawa et al. (14Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shinagawa A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described two classes of TIMP-2 receptors on Raji cells with the majority of receptors having low affinity with a K d of 35 nm and 140,000 sites/cell; the high affinity receptor had aK d of 0.15 nm and 20,000 sites/cell.To further characterize MT1-MMP as the TIMP-2 receptor,125I-TIMP 2 binding to MT1-MMP transfected COS-1 cells was performed in the presence of CT-1746, a hydroxamic acid inhibitor with greater activity against gelatinases. CT-1746, but not the inactive stereoismomer CT-1915, inhibited 125I-TIMP 2 binding to cells in a dose-dependent fashion that was comparable with that achieved with unlabeled TIMP-2. CT-1847, an MMP inhibitor with broad spectrum activity, likewise readily inhibited125I-TIMP 2 binding to cells. These data are consistent with the concept that TIMP-2 binds directly to the catalytic site of MT1-MMP on the cell surface. The fact that both a general and a more specific hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor displayed approximately equivalent activity in blocking TIMP 2 binding to MT1-MMP suggests that the catalytic site of MT1-MMP differs considerably from other well known MMPs. The N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 that consists of the first three disulfide loops and has an OB barrel-like structure (homologous to that seen in proteins of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding (OB) fold family) (32Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has been shown to behave as a fully active inhibitor of several MMPs, including intestitial collagenase (27Ko Y.-C.

Commun. 1997; 236: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), MMP-7, stromelysin-1, and gelatinase A (33Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These data therefore suggest that the N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 contains the domain interacting with the active catalytic domain of these MMPs. However, in the case of MT-MMP, our data suggest that the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 positively influences the association between the N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 and the catalytic domain of MT-MMP. Of relevance for this possibility is the observation of Nguyen et al. (34Nguyen Q. Willenbrook F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 act to increase the association constant by binding to the C-terminal domains of gelatinase A or the N-terminal domain of stromelysin-2. Additional studies of the C-terminal domain structures of TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 (32Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) will be helpful in explaining their differences in inhibiting MT1-MMP. Of note, competition for binding to active collagenase (soluble) has likewise been observed between TIMP-1 and low molecular weight synthetic inhibitors that are directed at the catalytic zinc of collagenase (35Lelievre Y.

It is postulated that the C-terminal region of pro-IL-16 is cleaved, releasing bioactive IL-16. To characterize IL-16 cleavage, we transfected COS cells with a cDNA encoding a ∼50-kDa form of pro-IL-16. Transfected COS cells released a ∼20-kDa IL-16 cleavage product shown to consist of the 121 C-terminal residues of pro-IL-16 by immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing. Cleaved IL-16, but not pro-IL-16, exhibited lymphocyte chemoattractant activity. A C-terminal ∼20-kDa IL-16 polypeptide was also released when pro-IL-16 was treated with concanavalin A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocyte lysate. Cleavage occurred after an Asp, suggesting involvement of a caspase (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/CED-3) family protease. Using recombinant caspases and granzyme B, we determined that pro-IL-16 cleavage is mediated only by caspase-3. Relevance to pro-IL-16 processing in primary lymphocytes was supported by identifying the p20 subunit of activated caspase-3 in stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes and by inhibition of CD8+lymphocyte lysate-mediated cleavage with Ac-DEVD-CHO.

IL-16 is produced and secreted predominantly by CD8+ T lymphocytes, and it exerts chemoattractant, growth factor, and other activities on lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils by interaction with CD4 (3Center D.M. Kornfeld H. Cruikshank W.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 476-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Biologically active IL-16 is secreted from CD8+ T cells in response to antigen, mitogen, histamine (4Laberge S. Cruikshank W.W. Kornfeld H. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2902-2910PubMed Google Scholar), or serotonin stimulation (5Laberge S. Cruikshank W.W. Beer D.J. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 151: 310-315Google Scholar), but the mechanism of IL-16 secretion remains undefined. Natural biologically active secreted IL-16 has a molecular mass of ∼56 kDa by Sephadex molecular sieve chromatography, which appears to represent noncovalent association of four identical polypeptide chains (2Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2569-2571PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from cDNA cloning indicates that the mature and biologically active secreted IL-16 is derived from the C-terminal region of a larger intracellular precursor protein (pro-IL-16) (7Baier M. Bannert N. Werner A. Lang K. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the predicted amino acid sequence of IL-16 lacks a signal sequence, suggesting that maturation and release of IL-16 does not proceed by conventional mechanisms. Reviewing the predicted pro-IL-16 protein sequence, we identified three potential protease cleavage sites that might be targets for processing to release a C-terminal fragment in the size range of secreted IL-16. In this report we present evidence that COS cells transfected with IL-16 cDNA synthesize and naturally process pro-IL-16 and secrete the biologically active mature IL-16. Based on analysis of this processing in COS cells and experiments with primary lymphocytes, we determined that pro-IL-16 is specifically cleaved by a member of the caspase (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/CED-3 protease) family, caspase-3. We also demonstrated that proteolytic processing of pro-IL-16 was required for the chemoattractant function of mature IL-16. This is the first report of involvement by caspase-3 in the processing of a cytokine precursor protein. A mammalian expression plasmid (pXM-W16) was produced by ligating a 2150-bp IL-16 cDNA (6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) fragment to the COS cell expression vector pXM. This cDNA encodes a pro-IL-16 fragment with a predicted molecular mass of ∼40 kDa. With pXM-W16 as template, recombination polymerase chain reaction was used to generate single amino acid changes as listed in Fig. 4 B. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis of both DNA strands. COS cells were suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Four × 106 cells (0.8 ml) were placed in a cooled electroporation cuvette with a 0.4-cm gap, 10 μg of plasmid DNA was added, and the cells were electroporated at 0.3 kV, 500 microfarads (yielding a time constant of 11–12 ms). Cells were allowed to recover in the cuvette at room temperature for 10 min and were then plated in a 100-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and then changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After an additional 48 h, conditioned medium was collected, cells and debris were removed by centrifugation, and the medium was stored at −20 °C. Conditioned medium from transfected COS cells was concentrated 50-fold using a Centricon-10 device (Amicon) before electrophoresis. Transfected COS cells were washed once with PBS, released by scraping, and lysed in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (protein lysis buffer). Both concentrated conditioned medium and cell lysate were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis through a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-human-recombinant IL-16 antibody (6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) designated mAb 14.1. The secondary antibody, an anti-mouse immunoglobulin labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Visualization of the signal was by electrochemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Known amounts of recombinant human Il-16 (rhIL-16) expressed in Escherichia coli were included in every immunoblot of IL-16 expressed by COS cells. Immunoblots were then analyzed by laser densitometry, and the mass of each COS cell-produced protein was determined by reference to the rhIL-16 standard. The amount of COS cell supernatant or lysate loaded in each lane generated an immunoblot signal within the linear response range of the laser densitometer. Human PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) density centrifugation of freshly drawn venous blood of normal human volunteers. After centrifugation, cells were washed three times and suspended at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml in culture medium 199 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 22 mm HEPES buffer, and 0.4% bovine serum albumin. Nylon Wool nonadherent human T cells were prepared by a modification of the method of Julius et al. (8Julius M.H. Simpson E. Herzenberg L.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1973; 3: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Enriched CD8+ T cells were prepared by negative selection by using magnetic beads (BioMag; Advanced Magnetics, Inc.) conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG. Briefly, 1 × 106 T cells were first incubated with 5 μg of mouse anti-human CD4 monoclonal antibody (Biosource) for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeled T cells were mixed with magnetic beads previously washed three times with cold PBS and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Culture flasks were taped to a strong magnet, and nonadherent cells were collected. Chemotaxis assays were performed with human PBMC in a multiwell chamber fitted with a polycarbonate filter having 5-μm pores as described (9Pilaro A.M. Sayers T.J. McCormick K.L. Reynolds C.W. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 135: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each COS cell supernatant or lysate was tested over a range of dilutions. Unseparated human T cells or CD8+ T cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at a cell density of 3 × 106 cells/ml before incubating with Con A (10−4m). After 4 h of stimulation, lymphocytes were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with cold PBS, and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The total protein content was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human pro-IL-16 cDNA was cloned into the KpnI-EcoRI sites of pCDNAIII vector. Plasmid DNA was translated in the TNT T7 transcription-translation coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 2 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 μl in a methionine-free amino acid mixture supplemented with 35S-labeled methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the reactions were stored at −20 °C. In vitro cleavage reactions were performed in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C with 3 μl ofin vitro translated, 35S-labeled pro-IL-16 and the indicated protease preparations or lymphocyte lysates. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS gel loading buffer and boiling for 4 min. Products of the cleavage reactions were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fixed in 20% MeOH/10% acetic acid, vacuum dried, and detected by autoradiography. Recombinant proteases were prepared by transformation of E. coli with expression vectors for caspase-1, caspase-2, and caspase-3 as described previously (10Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To verify the activity of these protease preparations, 10 μl of bacterial lysate containing recombinant caspase-1 and caspase-3 were determined to cleave >95% of [35S]-pro-IL-1β and [35S]poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, respectively, when incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Monoclonal antibody 14.1 was added to either concentrated COS cell conditioned medium or concentrated CD8+ lymphocyte culture medium at a concentration of 2 μg/100 μl and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h under gentle rotation. Protein A Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h. The beads were washed three times with PBS, then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled, and released material was analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting analysis. For protein sequencing, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and Ponceau-stained staining bands were cut out and stored at −20 °C. Blotted proteins were sequenced on a Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer, using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The released PTH-derivatives were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and identified by comparison with standards. To evaluate intracellular processing of pro-IL-16 to IL-16, a 2150-bp cDNA (6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar,11Bannert N. Baier M. Werner A. Kurth R. Nature. 1996; 381: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) encoding a 374-amino acid form of pro-IL-16 with a predicted molecular mass of ∼40 kDa was subcloned into the COS cell expression vector pXM. Following transfection with this plasmid (pXM-W16), both COS cell lysate and serum-free conditioned medium were tested for IL-16 expression by Western analysis. The blot was probed with mAb 14.1 raised against rhIL-16, which binds to an epitope within the C-terminal 130 amino acids of pro-IL-16 and therefore recognizes both the precursor and mature forms. As shown in Fig.1, a band that migrated at ∼50 kDa was present in both COS cell lysate and conditioned medium. This represents the 374-amino acid product expressed by pXM-W16; its molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE suggests that there is some post-translational modification. In contrast to the COS cell lysate, only the conditioned medium contained a second band that migrated as ∼20 kDa. The appearance of this ∼20-kDa band in the conditioned medium suggested that COS cells may possess a protease capable of cleaving pro-IL-16, with this processing event followed by secretion of mature IL-16. The appearance of the ∼50 kDa IL-16 in the conditioned medium may have resulted from COS cell lysis due to the effects of overexpression of the exogenous protein or culture in serum-free medium. In the cultures we noted abnormal morphology of transfected COS cells by 48 h post-transfection, and the proportion of cells that appeared abnormal increased by 72 h. To determine whether the 374-amino acid pro-IL-16 fragment exhibited any of the activities of mature IL-16 and to test the effects of cleavage on biological activity, COS cell conditioned medium and lysate of cells transfected with the 2150-bp IL-16 cDNA or control vector were tested for chemoattractant activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, conditioned medium of COS cells transfected with pXM-W16-stimulated lymphocyte migration with half-maximal activity at a dilution of 1:27. No activity was detected in supernatant of COS cells transfected with the control vector pXM. As shown in Fig. 1, conditioned medium from pXM-W16-transfected COS cells contains both uncleaved (∼50 kDa) and cleaved (∼20 kDa) forms of IL-16, whereas only the uncleaved form is present in the lysate. To determine if the uncleaved form of IL-16 could contribute to the observed chemoattractant activity, we compared the relative chemoattractant activities of conditioned medium containing ∼20- and ∼50-kDa forms of IL-16 versus COS cell lysate, which contained only the uncleaved ∼50-kDa form. No chemoattractant activity was detected in the lysate of COS cells transfected either with pXM-W16 (Fig. 2 B) or the control vector pXM (data not shown). These results indicate that pro-IL-16 is processed resulting in the release of biologically active mature IL-16 from COS cells. Cleavage of pro-IL-16 is required for the chemoattractant function of IL-16. Previous studies have found that IL-16 release from CD8+ lymphocytes can be stimulated by Con A (2Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2569-2571PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the cleavage of pro-IL-16 in COS cells correlated with the in vivo processing mechanisms of human lymphocytes, the 2150-bp IL-16 cDNA was subcloned into pCDNAIII for in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. When the in vitro translated pro-IL-16 was incubated with a crude lysate from Con A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes, the ∼50-kDa pro-IL-16 was cleaved into two major peptides of ∼20 and ∼30 kDa after 2 h. Incubation of in vitro translated pro-IL-16 with control lysate prepared from unstimulated lymphocytes resulted in minimum production of cleaved IL-16 (Fig.3 A). This suggests that CD8+ lymphocytes have some basal IL-16 processing activity that can be further activated by Con A stimulation, consistent with the previous observation that CD8+ T cells contain trace amounts of preformed biologically active IL-16 in an intracellular compartment (4Laberge S. Cruikshank W.W. Kornfeld H. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2902-2910PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Con A, the secretagogues serotonin and histamine and antigenic stimulation have also been shown to induce IL-16 release from primary lymphocytes (3Center D.M. Kornfeld H. Cruikshank W.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 476-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To provide additional evidence that the processing and secretion of IL-16 by COS cells resembles the mechanism employed by lymphocytes, we compared natural IL-16 released from Con A-stimulated lymphocytes with IL-16 released from pXM-W16-transfected COS cells by immunoblot. As shown in Fig.3 B, transfected COS cells secrete a 20-kDa polypeptide that co-migrates with natural IL-16 released from primary lymphocytes, and the COS cell processed IL-16 has the same immunological reactivity to the anti-rhIL-16 mAb. These data suggest that the ∼20-kDa polypeptide released by transfected COS cells is the same C-terminal region and similar in size to that cleaved from pro-IL-16 by primary lymphocytes. Although it is recognized that IL-16 is derived from the C-terminal region of pro-IL-16, the exact cleavage site has not been established, and the N-terminal sequence of the mature natural protein has not been reported. Having demonstrated that processing is required for the function of IL-16, we next sought to identify the specific cleavage site of pro-IL-16 and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of mature IL-16. Within the amino acid sequence predicted by the IL-16 cDNA, we identified three potential proteolytic cleavage sites based on reported protease recognition sequences that could possibly yield a C-terminal fragment of the expected size from pro-IL-16 (Fig.4 A). These three potential cleavage sites are clustered in a 36-amino acid region (from His218 to Ser254). As shown in Fig.4 A, site 1 and site 3 have putative aspartase cleavage characteristics (12Sleath P.R. Hendrickson R.C. Kronheim S.R. March C.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14526-14528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas site 2 could be a cleavage site for a dibasic processing endoprotease (13Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To determine the exact cleavage site of IL-16 processed by COS cells, we made three mutant IL-16 constructs using Ala to replace Asp219 (site 1) and Asp253 (site 3) and using Leu to replace Arg228and Ile to replace Arg231 (site 2). Immunoblotting of conditioned medium of COS cells transfected with these three mutant constructs (Fig. 4 B) indicated that site 3 is exclusively used for cleavage of pro-IL-16 in these cells. To further confirm the use of this cleavage site, conditioned medium of COS cells transfected with the native pXM-W16 were immunoprecipitated with mAb 14.1, and the secreted ∼20-kDa polypeptide was sequenced. The N-terminal sequence, Ser-Ala-Ala-Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala-Ala-Ser, confirmed that cleavage occurred after Asp253, indicating that an aspartase-specific protease was likely to be involved. Two families of proteases with substrate specificity for aspartate have been identified. One is the caspase (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/CED-3) family of cysteine proteases, and the other is a serine protease, granzyme B, which is involved in cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cell killing (14Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Immunol. Rev. 1988; 103: 53-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and activation of caspase-like cysteine proteases (15Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next determined whether pro-IL-16 could serve as a substrate for any of aspartate-specific proteases. Cleavage of pro-IL-16 by recombinant caspase-1 (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme), caspase-3, and granzyme B was tested using 35S-labeled in vitro translated pro-IL-16 as a substrate. Only caspase-3 cleaved the ∼50-kDa pro-IL-16 into two polypeptides of ∼20 and ∼30 kDa, whereas no cleavage was observed using caspase-1 or granzyme B (Fig.5 A). In a similar experiment, recombinant caspase-2 (ICH-1) did not cleave pro-IL-16 (data not shown). The 20-kDa band released by caspase-3 was immunoprecipitated by mAb 14.1 (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), and cleavage was blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 5 B,lane 4), indicating that caspase-3 digestion released the C-terminal region of pro-IL-16. To confirm the caspase-3 cleavage site, mutant pro-IL-16 with Ala substituted for Asp253 wasin vitro translated and digested with recombinant caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the generation of 20-kDa band was abolished (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). This indicates that caspase-3 cleaves pro-IL-16 after the same Asp residue as COS cells. Taken together, these results suggest that caspase-3 mediates pro-IL-16 cleavage in COS cells, resulting in the release of mature, biologically active IL-16, and that this enzyme might also be responsible for processing IL-16 in primary lymphocytes. An inhibitor sensitivity study was conducted to determine whether the pro-IL-16 is cleaved by caspase-3 in Con A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocyte lysate. Only the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO significantly inhibited cleavage of in vitrotranslated pro-IL-16. Minimal inhibition was observed with the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK (Fig.6 A). The expression of activated caspase-3 in Con A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes was confirmed by Western blot analysis with an antibody against the p20 subunit of caspase-3 (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that caspase-3 is the primary if not the only protease in stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes that cleaves pro-IL-16 to release the mature polypeptide. The IL-16 cDNA was originally cloned from a COS cell expression library, and it was believed to be encode a 393-bp open reading frame. The IL-16 protein isolated in this screening displayed the unique constellation of biological activities of natural IL-16 and the two proteins migrated similarly on SDS-PAGE (6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the predicted sequence contained no signal peptide commonly present in secreted proteins. This inconsistency of function-related structure and our identification of higher molecular weight bands in Western blots of activated lymphocyte lysate probed with anti-rhIL-16 antibodies (16Cruikshank W.W. Kornfeld H. Berman J. Chupp G. Keane J. Center D.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) led us to reexamine the cDNA sequence. Independently, Bazan and Schall (17Bazan J.F. Schall T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and Bannert et al. (11Bannert N. Baier M. Werner A. Kurth R. Nature. 1996; 381: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported findings suggesting that the IL-16 open reading frame in this cDNA extended further in the 5′ direction and could encode a larger precursor protein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼40 kDa. We confirmed a longer open reading frame by repeat DNA sequence analysis of the original cDNA (data not shown). More recently, Baier et al. (7Baier M. Bannert N. Werner A. Lang K. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) described additional 5′ cDNA sequence potentially encoding a ∼67-kDa pro-IL-16, and they identified ∼80- and ∼60-kDa bands in activated PBMC lysate by Western analysis with anti-IL16 antibody. The N-terminal sequences of the natural pro-IL-16 and mature IL-16 produced in primary lymphocytes have not been determined. In this report, we used a 2150-bp IL-16 cDNA (6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 7Baier M. Bannert N. Werner A. Lang K. Kurth R. Proc.

Nature. 1996; 381: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to study pro-IL-16 processing. Expression of this cDNA in COS cells generates a ∼50-kDa intracellular protein, whereas both this form and a ∼20-kDa band are released from these cells into supernatant. It is unclear whether the ∼50-kDa form is actively exported; more likely its appearance in conditioned medium is the result of COS cell lysis. The ∼20-kDa form was not detected by immunoblotting lysate of transfected COS cells or Con A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes, suggesting that the process of cleavage is linked to secretion. By chemotaxis assay and immunoblotting, the ∼20-kDa form was shown to be the mature and biologically active IL-16, which is cleaved from the C-terminal region of pro-IL-16. In retrospect, the constitutive capacity of COS cells to process and release pro-IL-16 was critical for the success of our original effort to clone the IL-16 cDNA from a COS cell expression library screened for bioactivity in transfected cell supernatants (6Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we demonstrated that cleavage of pro-IL-16 in COS cells is mediated by caspase-3. Based on N-terminal sequencing we showed that cleavage occurs at Asp253, at a site that is in a compatible context for caspase-3 recognition and cleavage. Mutation of this site but not of two other nearby potential protease recognition sequences blocked cleavage in transfected COS cells. Furthermore, recombinant caspase-3 but not caspase-1, caspase-2, or granzyme B cleaved in vitro translated pro-IL-16. The relevance of caspase-3 to IL-16 processing in primary cells was confirmed by incubating in vitro translated pro-IL-16 with lysate of Con A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes. Cleavage of ∼50-kDa pro-IL-16 to bands of ∼20 and ∼30 kDa was observed, and this cleavage was specifically and strongly inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO. The presence of active caspase-3 in Con A-stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes was confirmed by immunoblot. It remains possible that a caspase-3-like protease, not caspase-3 itself, is the true IL-16 processing enzyme. Interleukin-16 was originally identified as a lymphocyte chemoattractant factor secreted by CD8+ T cells following stimulation with histamine, serotonin, mitogen, or antigen (3Center D.M. Kornfeld H. Cruikshank W.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 476-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our findings reported here indicate that stimulation of resting lymphocytes activates an IL-16 processing mechanism that involves cleavage of pro-IL-16 by caspase-3, linked to secretion of biologically active IL-16. The mechanism of secretion remains undefined but our data suggest similarities with the processing and secretion of IL-1β. However, there is no significant sequence similarity between pro-IL-16 and pro-IL-1β, and spectra of biological activities are different. Although there is evidence that caspase family proteases are mediators of apoptosis, the definitive roles of each isozyme present in different tissues and the substrates for each enzyme have yet to be clarified. The previously reported substrates for caspase-3, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (18Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Naito M. Fujita N. Noguchi K. Tsuruo T. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been reported that mature biologically active IL-1β is released from murine peritoneal macrophages undergoing apoptosis by lipopolysaccharide stimulation (24Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Although IL-1β itself is not a mediator of apoptosis, its release from apoptotic macrophages could be used as signal that this event has occurred, leading to an appropriate inflammatory response. It is unknown at this time if the processing of pro-IL-16 by caspase-3 in primary lymphocytes is related to apoptosis. The ability of the secretagogues histamine and serotonin to induce IL-16 release suggests that apoptosis is not a requirement for IL-16 release, implying that caspase-3 might be utilized in a nonapoptotic pathway. However, it is possible that the release of IL-16 following mitogen or antigen stimulation could occur in the context of apoptosis. In this regard, caspase-3 could mediate a pro-inflammatory function by processing IL-16, which acts to recruit and activate CD4+ lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils, amplifying the inflammatory response.

This report demonstrates that elevation of extracellular calcium stimulates proliferation-associated signaling pathways in rat fibroblasts and implicates calcium-sensing receptors (CaR) as mediators of this response. Rat-1 fibroblasts express CaR mRNA and protein and respond to known agonists of the CaR with increased IP3 production and release of intracellular calcium. Agonists of the CaR can stimulate increased c-SRC kinase activity and increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Both of the increases in SRC activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation are blocked in the presence of a nonfunctional mutant of the CaR, R796W. Proliferation of wild-type Rat-1 cells is sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium, but expression of the nonfunctional CaR mutant or inhibition of the calcium-dependent increase in SRC kinase activity block the proliferative response to calcium. These results provide evidence of a novel signal transduction pathway modulating the response of fibroblasts to extracellular calcium and imply that calcium-sensing receptors may play a role in regulating cell growth in response to extracellular calcium, in addition to their well known function in systemic calcium homeostasis.

In keratinocytes, breast epithelial cells, and intestinal epithelial cells, increased extracellular calcium promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation (1Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E.

In particular, a mutation of arginine 796 to tryptophan in the third intracellular loop of the CaR was found to cause neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism when homozygous and hypocalciuric hypercalcemia when heterozygous (15Pollak M.R.

In this report we show that Rat-1 fibroblasts express endogenous CaR mRNA and protein and that these cells respond to the CaR agonist Gd3+ with an increase in IP3 production and intracellular calcium release. Proliferation of Rat-1 cells is sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium concentration as shown by a marked increase in thymidine incorporation at 2.0 mm as opposed to 0.3 mm extracellular calcium. Stimulation of Rat-1 cells with the CaR agonist Gd3+ resulted in increased in c-SRC kinase activity and increased ERK1 kinase activity. Each of these responses was significantly inhibited in Rat-1 cells expressing the nonfunctional CaR-R796W mutant. Furthermore, inhibition of the calcium-mediated increases in SRC and ERK1 activity prevented the calcium-stimulated increase in proliferation. Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air in DMEM (1.7 mm Ca2+, BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) and gentamycin (10 mg/ml). New cultures were started from frozen stocks every 4–6 weeks. For experiments where calcium concentration was specified, Hams F-12 medium (0.3 mm Ca2+, BioWhittaker) was used and the calcium concentration was adjusted with calcium chloride as indicated. When calcium concentrations lower than 0.3 mmwere used, calcium levels were buffered with 1 mm EGTA, and additional calcium was added to obtain the desired calcium concentration. Whenever serum was present at extracellular calcium concentrations below 1.7 mm, the serum was pretreated with Chelex to remove divalent cations. Total RNA was purified as described previously (17Rodland K.D. Wersto R.P. Hobson S. Kohn E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), size fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). The hybridization probe was a 3.7-kb XbaI/BamHI fragment from the full-length rat striatal CaR cDNA clone, pCIS:CaR (kindly provided by S. Snyder) (12Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) labeled with 32P by random primer extension. Hybridization was conducted at 42 °C in a 50% formamide hybridization solution. The blot was then washed 2 times in 2 × SSC at 42 °C and 2 times in 2 × SSC at 50 °C. Bound radioactivity was detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) following a 16 h exposure of the phosphorimage screen. Monoclonal anti-GAP antibodies and protein A/G-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-SRC antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and monoclonal anti-Fak antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, Inc. (Lexington, KY). The affinity purified polyclonal anti-CaR antibody was produced in collaboration with Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). The monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was a generous gift from Brian Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University). The monoclonal anti-p62 (2C4) antibody was a generous gift from Richard Roth (Stanford University). Crude plasma membranes were isolated from Rat-1 cells essentially as described by Bai et al. (16Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Cells were scraped in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice. The cells were homogenized with 15 strokes of a 1.5-ml Dounce homogenizer and the nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 43,000 ×g in a TLA 100.3 rotor for 1 h to pellet the plasma membrane fragments. The resulting pellet was resolubilized in homogenization buffer with 1% Triton X-100 added. Proteins were size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% NaN3 for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C in Tween + Tris-buffered saline (0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Membranes were washed 3 times in TTBS, incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for at least 2 h, and washed extensively in TTBS. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). Films from at least three independent experiments were scanned where indicated, and densitometry analysis was performed using NIH Image. Rat-1 cells were harvested 10 min after agonist addition by lysis in M-TG buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mmNa3VO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 6000 × g. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) and 500 μg of protein incubated with primary antibody for at least 4 h and followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for at least 1 h. The immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min; the pellet was washed extensively with M-TG buffer and boiled for 3 min in 1 × Laemmli buffer. Cells were plated on 18-mm dishes containing a central section of optical glass, and grown overnight in the appropriate culture medium containing serum. Two hours prior to Fura-2 measurement, cells were transferred into Hank's buffered salt solution containing 0.5 mm Mg2+ (Mg-HBSS). Cells were exposed to 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, then the Fura-2-containing medium was removed and replaced with Mg-HBSS. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 20–40 min to allow de-esterification of the Fura-2/AM and then subjected to calcium imaging. Intracellular calcium concentrations were determined from the ratio of emissions measured at 510 nm following excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Images were collected in an integrating CCD camera and analyzed with the DoubleWavelength InCa program (software and hardware provided as an integrated system by Intracellular Imaging, Inc., Cincinnati OH). Measurements were collected from 20–30 individual cells per field. Rat-1 cells grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes were transferred into serum-free DMEM containing 3 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol and loaded for 48 h. 16 h prior to stimulation and harvest, the cells were transferred into serum-free myo-[3H]inositol-free Ham's F-12 (0.3 mm Ca2+). Cells were stimulated by the addition of 250 μm Gd3+ in the presence of 100 mm LiCl to inhibit IP3 turnover as described previously (18Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Forsythe M.L. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8529-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 min after the addition of LiCl with or without Gd3+, cells were lysed, and the inositol phosphates were extracted and fractionated on Dowex-formate columns as described previously (18Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Forsythe M.L. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8529-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length 3.7-kb rat kidney CaR clone was excised from pCIS:CaR using XbaI-BamHI (12Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This was subcloned into pBluescript II for ease of manipulations. The full-length 3.7-kb CaR from the pBS:CaR construct was excised withXbaI-XhoI and subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector. The R796W mutation was introduced into a 1.2-kb SphI fragment of the CaR by inverse polymerase chain reaction using the oligomer pair: J5, TTG AAG GCA AAG AAG AAG CAG ATG G; and J3, GTC CTG GAA GTT ACC CGA GAA CTT C. Primer J5 is identical to the published rat CaR sequence. Primer J3 introduces the arginine to tryptophan mutation at amino acid 796 and adds a diagnostic AvaI site. Positive colonies identified byAvaI digests were sequenced and subcloned into the pBS:CaR contruct. Correct orientation was verified by AvaI digests. The full-length mutant CaR-R796W was subcloned into pcDNA3. Rat-1 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 alone, pcDNA3-CaR, or pcDNA3-CaR-R796W using Lipofectin as described previously (19Rodland K.D. Pribnow D. Lenormand P. Chen S.L.Y. Magun B.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 787-796PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected in medium containing 700 μg/ml G418 (BioWhittaker), and stable clones were cultured in 300 μg/ml G418 to maintain selection. New cultures were started from frozen stocks every 6–8 weeks. In vitro kinase assays were conducted on immunoprecipitates as described previously (17Rodland K.D. Wersto R.P. Hobson S. Kohn E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Confluent Rat-1 cells in 10-cm plates were cultured in serum-free Ham's F-12 (0.3 mm Ca2+) for 4 h and then brought to the indicated concentration of Ca2+ or Gd3+. Cells were stimulated for 10 min prior to lysis in 750 μl HEPES-KOH lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm vanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by addition of 10 μl of protein A-agarose and centrifugation. Aliquots of cleared lysates normalized for protein content were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C using either anti-ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-c-SRC (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by addition of protein A-agarose and an additional 2 h of incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed once in HEPES-KOH lysis buffer, once in LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm vanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and once in MOPS assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100). The pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. In ERK1 kinase assays, 3 μg of GST-Elk1 was added as a substrate for phosphorylation. SRC kinase assays measured autophosphorylation of c-SRC. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were dried, and radioactivity was visualized and quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and IP LabGel software. Rat-1 fibroblasts in 12-well plates were grown to 70–80% confluence in DMEM + 10% calf serum. Cells were then changed into serum-free Ham's F-12 medium (0.3 mm Ca2+) for 24 h prior to the addition of either CaCl2 to 2.0 mm or EGF to 1 ng/ml. [3H]Thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml) was added 18 h later, and cells were harvested after a 4-h thymidine incorporation. Thymidine incorporation was determined by precipitation in 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilization in 0.2m NaOH, and liquid scintillation counting. Although the role of extracellular calcium in modulating the proliferation of keratinocytes is well established, less is known about the responsiveness of mesenchymal cell types to extracellular calcium. To determine whether Rat-1 cells resembled human diploid fibroblasts in displaying a positive mitogenic response to increasing extracellular calcium (5Huang S. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Biochem J. 1995; 310: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation in Rat-1 fibroblasts as a function of extracellular calcium concentration. As shown in Fig. 1, changing the extracellular calcium concentration from 0.3 to 2.0 mmproduced an 8.4-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in Rat-1 cells; the extent of the increase was equivalent to that observed when EGF at 0.5 ng/ml was added in the presence of 0.3 mm extracellular calcium (Fig. 1, white bar). Activation of calcium-sensing receptors similar or identical to those expressed in parathyroid cells, neurons, and intestinal epithelial would provide a potential mechanism for inducing proliferative signals in response to changes in extracellular calcium. To detect the presence of CaR protein, we generated a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide representing amino acids 11 through 27 in the extracellular domain of the rat CaR. Antibodies generated against the same region of the rat CaR were effective in both immunohistochemical and immunoblot studies of CaR expression in the brain (12Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The anti-CaR antibody was affinity purified against the synthetic peptide and used in immunoblot experiments with partially purified plasma membrane preparations from rat kidney and Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A). The affinity purified antibodies detected an identical pattern of strongly hybridizing bands at 120–140 kDa in both kidney and fibroblasts. Rat kidney was used as a positive control as both Riccardi et al. (11Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W.-S. Gamba G. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and Ruat et al. (12Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) have shown high levels of CaR expression in rat kidney. Preincubation with the synthetic peptide prevented detection of the putative CaR protein as shown in Fig.2 A. The anti-CaR antibody was also effective in immunohistochemical detection of CaR protein in fixed Rat-1 cells (Fig. 2 B), and specificity was demonstrated by a loss of staining when excess synthetic CaR peptide was present during the antibody incubation (Fig. 2 B). The identity of the CaR immunoreactive protein was confirmed by Northern hybridization analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Two bands of approximately 5.3 and 3.8 kb were observed following hybridization with a full-length CaR probe; CaR mRNA levels were not influenced by extracellular calcium concentration (data not shown). Sequence analysis of an 800-base pair reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product obtained from Rat-1 fibroblasts using primers flanking the conserved transmembrane domain indicated that the Rat-1 CaR was 100% identical to the rat kidney CaR between amino acids 627 and 724 (Ref 11Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W.-S. Gamba G. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar; data not shown). To determine whether the presence of CaR protein in Rat-1 cells represented the presence of functional receptors, we tested the ability of Rat-1 fibroblasts to release intracellular Ca2+ in response to extracellular Gd3+ as used by Nemeth, Brown, and others (10Brown E. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M. Lytton J. Hebert S. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 11Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W.-S.

When Rat-1 cells were exposed to 1.0 mm Gd3+ in Mg-HBSS, many of the cells within a given field responded with an increase in intracellular calcium of at least 3-fold over basal intracellular Ca2+ levels from a resting level of 100 nm to a peak of 250–300 nm (Fig.3 A). The magnitude of this response is similar to that observed following treatment with thapsigargin and is sufficient to promote calcium-dependent gene expression (17Rodland K.D. Wersto R.P. Hobson S. Kohn E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with 1 μmionomycin produced intracellular calcium peaks of 900–1000 nm (data not shown). In six independent experiments on Rat-1 fibroblasts, 25–33% of the cells in a given field responded to extracellular Gd3+ with a release of intracellular Ca2+. Similar results were obtained in response to 2 mm Ca2+ (data not shown). In each of these experiments, no cells responded to addition of Mg-HBSS alone, indicating that the response was specific to the presence of Gd3+ or Ca2+. Activation of the CaR has been demonstrated to result in increased production of IP3 (10Brown E. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M. Lytton J. Hebert S. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 21Brown E.M. Pollak M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Chou Y.-H.W. Riccardi D. Hebert S.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CaR agonist Gd3+ could induce IP3production in rat fibroblasts, we measured IP3 production directly in response to 250 μm Gd3+ as described previously (18Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Forsythe M.L. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8529-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that stimulation with Gd3+ produced a significant increase (p < 0.05, n = 3) in IP3production in the Rat-1 cells, documenting a second aspect of established CaR function in these cells. Elevation of extracellular calcium levels has been associated with increased c-SRC kinase activity in keratinocytes (6Zhao Y. Sudol M. Hanafusa H. Krueger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8298-8302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). If the CaR is responsible for modulating c-SRC activity in response to changes in extracellular calcium, then an increase in SRC kinase activity should be observed in the presence of Gd3+, which binds and activates the CaR without passing through calcium channels. If activation of the CaR is required for Ca2+- and Gd3+-induced activation of SRC, expression of an interfering CaR mutant (such as the R796W mutant associated with severe neonatal hyperparathyroidism; see Refs. 16Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) should inhibit the activation of c-SRC. We tested this possibility by measuring SRC kinase activity in the Rat-1 cells stably transfected with either pcDNA3 alone, pcDNA3-CaR, or pcDNA3-CaR-R796W. A 2- to 3-fold increase in immunoreactive CaR protein was detected in the pcDNA3-CaR and pcDNA3-CaR-R796W clonal cell lines chosen for use in these experiments (data not shown). The Rat-1 cells that were stably transfected with pcDNA3-CaR-R796W failed to increase IP3 production in response to Gd3+ (data not shown). The three stable cell lines were grown in low calcium medium (50 μm Ca2+) for 4 h, and half the plates were then exposed to 250 μm Gd3+ for 5 min prior to harvest. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SRC antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and kinase activity was assessedin vitro. As shown in Fig. 4, Gd3+ treatment produced a 2.5-fold increase in c-SRC autophosphorylation in both vector and CaR-transfected cells, indicating that endogenous levels of CaR are sufficient for activation of c-SRC in response to the dose of Gd3+ tested. The increase in SRC kinase activity was significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) in cells transfected with pcDNA3-CaR-R796W, indicating that the activation of SRC by Gd3+ could be abrogated by an interfering mutant of the CaR. SRC kinase activity was normalized to c-SRC protein levels as determined by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates. Similar results were obtained in three replicate experiments with three different independently derived clones of pcDNA3-, pcDNA3-CaR-, and pcDNA3-R796W-transfected Rat-1 cells (data not shown). The results of these experiments indicate that the endogenous CaR in Rat-1 cells has the potential to activate c-SRC as a consequence of Gd3+ binding and that this ability is disrupted in the presence of the R796W mutant. Increased c-SRC kinase activity in response to elevated extracellular Ca2+ should be accompanied by an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least some c-SRC substrates. If the calcium-sensitive increase in c-SRC activity is mediated by the CaR then Gd3+ should be able to mimic the effects of Ca2+, and expression of the nonfunctional CaR mutant R796W should inhibit calcium-sensitive phosphorylations. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed changes in tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates obtained from Rat-1 cells transfected with either vector, wild-type CaR, or the R796W CaR mutant. As shown in Fig.5 A, increasing extracellular Ca2+ from 0.3 to 1.8 mm was associated with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 125–135, 62–65, and 41 kDa in control and CaR-transfected cells. Stimulation with Gd3+, rather than Ca2+, resulte"

Recent evidence suggests that factors that regulate VEGF expression may partially depend on c-src-mediated signal transduction pathways. The tyrosine kinase activity of Src is activated in most colon tumors and cell lines. We established stable subclones of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 in which Src expression and activity are decreased specifically as a result of a transfected antisense expression vector. This study determined whether VEGF expression is decreased in these cell lines and whether the smaller size and reduced growth rate of antisense vector-transfected cell lines in vivo might result, in part, from reduced vascularization of tumors. Northern blot analysis of these cell lines revealed that VEGF mRNA expression was decreased in proportion to the decrease in Src kinase activity. Under hypoxic conditions, cells with decreased Src activity had a <2-fold increase in VEGF expression, whereas parental cells had a >50-fold increase. VEGF protein in the supernatants of cells was also reduced in antisense transfectants compared with that from parental cells. In nude mice, subcutaneous tumors from antisense transfectants showed a significant reduction in vascularity.

These results suggest that Src activity regulates the expression of VEGF in colon tumor cells. Neovascularization is a critical requirement for tumor growth and metastasis formation. Numerous angiogenic factors that regulate this process have been identified (1Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). Among them is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HT29-P cells, HT29 parental cells; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription. which has been implicated in the neovascularization of a wide variety of tumors (2Takahashi Y.

The gene for this angiogenic factor has ∼20% homology to platelet-derived growth factor and ∼50% homology to placenta growth factor (13Keck P.J. Hauser S.D. Krivi G. Snazo K. Warren T. Feder J.

Recently, several studies suggested that VEGF is the angiogenic factor most closely associated with induction and maintenance of the neovasculature in human colon cancer (2Takahashi Y. Kitadai Y.

In primary tumors, the expression of VEGF mRNA is increased in tumors relative to histologically normal bowel mucosa (8Brown L.F. Berse B. Jackman R.W. Tognazzi K. Manseau E.J. Senger D.R.

We have demonstrated that VEGF expression is greater in colon tumors that have metastasized than in nonmetastatic tumors (2Takahashi Y. Kitadai Y. Bucana C.D. Cleary K.R. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3964-3968PubMed Google Scholar). Using a murine model system for colon cancer, Warrenet al. (16Warren R.S. Yuan H. Matli M.R. Gillett N.A. Ferrara N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody to VEGF inhibits subcutaneous tumor formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and reduces the number and size of liver metastases. Although VEGF has undergone considerable study in recent years, the factors in the tumor environment and subsequent signal transduction pathways that regulate VEGF production have yet to be elucidated fully. One environmental condition known to enhance VEGF expression is hypoxia (18Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 19Shima D.T. Deutsch U. D'Amore P.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). Recently, hypoxia was demonstrated to be mediated, in part, by specific activation of the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of Src (18Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition, cell lines transfected with v-src (a constitutively activated homolog of c-src) have been found to have increased VEGF expression (21Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6161-6165PubMed Google Scholar). These observations may be of particular relevance to colon tumorigenesis and progression because >80% of primary colon tumors have significantly increased Src activity (22Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Cartwright C.A. Meisler A.I. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and further increases in Src activity are observed in the majority of colon tumor metastases (22Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24Termuhlen P.M. Curley S.A. Talamonti M.A. Saboorian M.H. Gallick G.E. J. Surg. Res. 1993; 54: 293-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additionally, most colon tumor cell lines are known to express VEGF (10Ellis L.M. Liu W. Wilson M. Surgery (St. Louis). 1996; 120: 871-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in the HEP3b hepatoma cell line, recent studies have suggested no relationship between Src activation and VEGF production (25Gleade J.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A potential relationship between Src activation and VEGF production in colon tumor cells has yet to be demonstrated. Recently, we established stable subclones of the well characterized human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29 in which Src expression and activity are decreased as a result of a transfected antisense expression vector specific for inhibition of Src (26Staley C.A. Parikh N.U. Gallick G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines demonstrated decreased growth in nude mice proportionately to the reduction in c-src levels (26Staley C.A. Parikh N.U. Gallick G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine whether VEGF expression and associated biologic activity were decreased by specific down-regulation of Src kinase activity and whether the smaller size and reduced growth rate of antisense vector-transfected cell lines in vivo might result, in part, from reduced vascularization of tumors. A construct spanning the translation start site of c-src was generated by annealing two primers, 5′-AGCTTGGACCATGGGTAGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATCCTTGGGCTTGCTCTTGTTGCTACCCATGGTCCA-3′. The sense construct was synthesized in a similar manner with primers 5′-AGCTATCCTTGGGCTTGCTCTTGTTGCTACCCATGGTCCT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGGACCATGGGTAGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGAT-3′. The pcDNAI plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was then digested withHindIII and XbaI, and a ligation reaction was performed to insert the sense and antisense constructs.Escherichia coli was transformed by the plasmids; selected clones were harvested; the bacteria were lysed by alkali treatment; and the plasmids were purified. Confirmation of the correct insert was determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by DNA sequencing. HT29 parental (HT29-P) cells were grown to 70% confluency under the conditions described below. Cells were transfected in serum-free medium for 6 h with 100 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 16 μg of plasmid DNA. The medium was then replenished with medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies resistant to G418 were expanded, and the resulting clones were screened for expression and activity of Src, as described below. HT29 cells, derived from a colon adenocarcinoma (27Fogh J.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1975: 115-141Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with Earle's salts and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Stable HT29 subclones expressing c-src “sense” (HT29-S8 and HT29-S20) and “antisense” (HT29-AS15 and HT29-AS33) constructs were also maintained under these conditions, except that the medium was supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. For experiments examining the effect of tumor cell-conditioned medium on endothelial cell proliferation, HT29-P cells and subclones were grown to 100% confluence in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h. Prior to lysis, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Detergent lysates were made in a standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Cells were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Cell lysates (250 μg of protein) were reacted for 2 h with either monoclonal antibody 327 (Oncogene Science Inc., Cambridge, MA) for immunoprecipitation of Src or monoclonal antibody 1B7 (Wako Bioproducts, Richmond, VA) for immunoprecipitation of Yes. Immune complexes were formed by incubation with 6 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) for 1 h and then with 50 μl of 10% (v/v) Formalin-fixed Pansorbin (Staphylococcus aureus, Cowan strain; Calbiochem) for 30 min. Pellets were washed three times in a buffer consisting of 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate. Immune complex kinase assays were performed by standard procedures as described previously (22Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by adding to each sample 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm Mg2+, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate in 20 mm HEPES. After 10 min at 25 °C, reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. Clarified cell lysates (250 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using standard procedures (22Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 15% skimmed milk in PBS and then incubated with anti-Src or anti-Yes antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Specific binding of antibody was determined using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). Polyadenylated mRNA was extracted from tumor cells grown under confluent conditions in culture using the TRI reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc. Cincinnati, OH). Twenty μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) by capillary elution, and UV-cross-linked at 120,000 μJ/cm2 using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following prehybridization, the membranes were probed for VEGF and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Each cDNA probe was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, recovered using a QIAEX gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and radiolabeled by the random primer technique using a commercially available kit (Amersham Corp.) that utilizes [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.). Nylon filters were washed at 65 °C with 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.2), and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Autoradiography was then performed. A 1.28-kilobase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was used as an internal control. The VEGF probe, a 204-base pair fragment of human VEGF cDNA, was a gift from Dr. Brygida Berse (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (17Berse B. Brown L.F. Van de Water L. Dvorak H.A. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA extracted from HT29-P cells and antisense cell lines (HT29-AS33 and HT29-AS15) by reverse transcription (RT) in a 20-μl reaction containing 0.5 μg of random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.), 200 units of SuperScript™ RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 μg of mRNA, 4 μl of 5 × RT buffer (375 mmKCl, 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at room temperature), and 15 mm MgCl2), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm each dNTP, 20 units of RNasin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Each mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then quick-chilled on ice. Each PCR was performed using a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of RT reaction mixture, 1 × PCR buffer (50 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature), and 1% Triton X-100), 0.2 mm dNTP, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 50 pmol/μl VEGF primers, and 50 pmol/μl β-actin primers. The mixture was overlaid with mineral oil and then amplified with a TemTronic DNA amplification system using the following amplification profile: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 93 °C for 1 min, annealing at 59 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for varying cycle numbers, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were then electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light, and photographed with Polaroid Type 55 positive/negative film. Specific amplification was determined by the size of the product on the gel relative to that of known DNA molecular weight marker V (Boehringer Mannheim). The amount of PCR product was determined by measuring the density of the specific bands on the negative film with a densitometer. RT products were amplified by PCR using specific primers for β-actin (design of primers based on published sequence (GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession number M10277)) (sense, 5′-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACGAGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3′) and for VEGF (28Anthony F.W. Wheeler T. Elcock C.L. Pickett M. Thomas E.J. Placenta. 1994; 15: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-CACATAGGAGAGATGAGCTTC-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCGCCTCGGCTTGTCACAT-3′) in separate reactions for 18–28 cycles under the above conditions, and the products were quantitated by densitometry. Curves depicting product quantity relative to the number of PCR cycles were generated, and the PCR cycle number that generated product quantities representing the up-slope of the curve was selected for quantitative PCR of each specific set of primers. Semiquantitative PCR was performed for β-actin (22 cycles) and VEGF (22 cycles). Protein kinase activity and VEGF mRNA expression were quantitated by densitometry of autoradiograms using the ImageQuant™ software program (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) in the linear range of the film. Semiquantitative PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and after ethidium bromide staining, they were exposed to UV light and photographed with Polaroid Type 55 positive/negative film. The positive bands on the film were quantitated by densitometry using β-actin as an internal control. For these determinations, equal densities as opposed to equal numbers of cells were chosen because of previous experiments in colon tumor cells demonstrating that density affects VEGF expression (29Koura A.N. Radinsky R. Kitadai Y. Takahashi Y. Liu W. Singh R. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3891-3894PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fleming R.Y.D. Ellis L.M. Parikh N.U. Liu W. Staley C.A. Gallick G.E. Surgery. 1997; 122: 501-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, HT29-P cells were seeded at 20 × 106, HT29-AS33 cells at 25 × 106, and HT29-AS15 cells at 40 × 106 cells/100-mm tissue culture plate to compensate for size differences in these cells. Cells were grown for 24 h in DMEM/F-12 (1:1 mixture) supplemented with 10% FBS, washed three times with PBS, and changed to 7.5 ml of DMEM/F-12 (1:1 mixture) supplemented with 1% FBS. Cell supernatants were collected, filtered, and stored at −12 °C, and concomitantly, cell pellets were harvested by trypsinization, and cell number was determined. The amount of VEGF protein in the supernatant was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. VEGF was expressed as pg of VEGF protein/106 cells/24 h. HT29-P and HT29-AS15 cells were grown to confluence in standard medium. The medium was changed, and cells were then transferred to a hypoxia chamber (Proox Model 110, Reming Bioinstruments Co., Redfield, NY). Control cultures were harvested just prior to hypoxic exposure (t = 0), and protein and RNA were harvested. Identical cultures were then incubated for 4, 6, and 24 h, and cells were harvested at these time points for protein and RNA analysis. Cells from clones to be tested were grown in tissue culture to log phase (∼70% confluent), trypsinized, and counted with the aid of a hemocytometer. 1 × 106 cells of each clone were injected subcutaneously in the flank of eight nude mice/cell type. For quantitation of tumor microvasculature, tumors were harvested after 60 days and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections of tissues previously frozen in O.C.T. compound were fixed sequentially (5 min each) with acetone, acetone/chloroform (1:1), and acetone. The sections were washed three times, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 12 min. The samples were washed three times with PBS and incubated with a protein-blocking solution consisting of PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 1% horse serum for 20 min at room temperature. Excess blocking reagent was drained off, and the samples were incubated with the primary antibody (rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody, 1:100 dilution; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (peroxidase-labeled mouse anti-rat antibody, 1:200 dilution; Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h. Sections were washed four times with PBS, rinsed briefly with distilled water, and then incubated with stable diaminobenzadine (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) for 20 min to develop the peroxidase signal. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma), washed, mounted with Universal Mount (Research Genetics), and dried on a 60 °C hot plate. Because heterogeneity in vascularization was observed, the four most vascular areas of each tumor were identified, and vessels were quantitated. Vessel counts in HT29-P and HT29-AS15 tumors were compared by two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. Expression vectors spanning the translation start site of c-src in the sense and antisense orientations were made and transfected into HT29-P cells, and G418-resistant clones were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each clone was then screened for expression and activity of Src. To examine specificity of effects on Src, each clone was also screened for expression and activity of the related tyrosine kinase, Yes. The results with two antisense and two sense transfectants are shown in Fig. 1. When HT29-P cells were compared with the two sense transfectants, HT29-S8 and HT29-S20, no differences were apparent in autophosphorylation (Fig. 1, row A), phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate enolase (row B), or expression of either Src or Yes (row C). In contrast, the antisense clone HT29-AS15 had a 4.0-fold reduction in Src (row C) and 4.5-fold reduction in autophosphorylation (row A) and enolase phosphorylation (row B). Clone HT29-AS33 was intermediate in level and activity of Src, with expression reduced 2.0-fold (row C) and autophosphorylation (row A) and enolase phosphorylation (row B) reduced 2.5-fold. As is also shown in Fig. 1, neither the levels nor protein-tyrosine kinase activities of Yes were altered in the antisense transfectants relative to the sense transfectants or HT29-P cells. Therefore, the effects of the antisense expression vector were specific for Src. Transfection of the parental cell line with the control expression vector (sense) caused a minor increase in VEGF mRNA expression (Fig.2). However, the establishment of cell lines with decreased Src kinase activity demonstrated a decrease in mRNA expression at levels of 54% (HT29-AS33) and 23% (HT29-AS15) of the average of the sense transfected cell lines. This incremental decrease in VEGF mRNA expression correlated with the alteration in Src kinase activity: the transfected cell line that exhibited the greatest decrease in Src kinase activity (HT29-AS15) also exhibited the greatest decrease in VEGF mRNA expression. Semiquantitative PCR of the various isoforms of VEGF demonstrated a decrease in overall VEGF expression in both HT29-AS33 and HT29-AS15 cells (Fig. 3). The most abundant isoform expressed was VEGF-165. There was a relatively equal decrease in the expression of all VEGF isoforms in the antisense clones. The overall decrease in VEGF expression in the antisense clones by semiquantitative RT-PCR confirmed our findings by Northern blotting. To examine directly the amount of VEGF protein produced in the various clones, supernatants from cultures grown to identical confluencies were harvested, and VEGF expression was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A decrease in VEGF protein was observed in the supernatant of cells with decreased Src activity (Fig.4). This decrease was proportional to the decrease in Src activity in the two antisense transfected cell lines. These results demonstrate that decreased expression of mRNA corresponds with decreased VEGF protein expression. The above results demonstrate that the expression of Src in colon tumor cells leads to the constitutive expression of VEGF, a critical factor in tumor cell growth. However, neovascularization of tumors also results from local hypoxia as the tumor volume exceeds its blood supply. As hypoxic stimulation of VEGF in fibroblasts has been associated with activation of Src protein-tyrosine kinase, we examined the response to hypoxia in HT29-P and transfected subclones. Cells were grown to equal densities, transferred to hypoxic chambers, harvested at specific times, and processed for RNA and protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For these studies, HT29 parental cells were compared with HT29-AS15, the antisense transfectant expressing the least Src. The ability of hypoxia to induce VEGF mRNA in these clones is compared in Fig. 5. VEGF mRNA was markedly induced in a time-dependent manner in HT29-P cells, with a >50-fold increase observed after 24 h. In contrast, a <2-fold increase in VEGF mRNA expression was observed in HT29-AS15 cells. These results demonstrate that not only is the constitutive production of VEGF reduced by lowering Src expression, the ability of hypoxia to induce further expression of VEGF is severely impaired. To confirm that induction of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia was Src-dependent, the expression and activity of Src were compared in these clones under identical conditions. In HT29-P cells, Src kinase activity was stimulated in a time-dependent manner, with a maximum stimulation of 4.5-fold occurring 4 h after the onset of hypoxic conditions, whereas only a 1.1-fold increase in activity was observed in HT29-AS15 cells under identical conditions (data not shown). For this determination, HT29-P and HT29-AS15 cells were implanted in the subcutis of nude mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Tumors were harvested when they were ∼1 cm in diameter. Mean vessel counts were determined by counting the most vascularized areas of the respective tumors, after immunostaining with rat CD31 antibody, as described. In tumors grown from HT29-AS15 cells, vessel counts were significantly reduced relative to those tumors grown from HT29-P cells (31.8 ± 2.8 versus 53.0 ± 1.5 (mean ± S.E.), respectively; p < 0.0001) (Fig.6). These results demonstrate that reduction in constitutive and inducible VEGF production in c-src antisense transfected clones corresponds with decreased vascularization of the tumor. However, we cannot rule out that other factors, such as different growth rates and metabolic requirements, contribute to changes in tumor vascularization. Angiogenesis is an essential step in tumor growth and metastasis, and this process is driven by the balance of positive and negative effector molecules (31Fidler I.J. Ellis L.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In human colon cancers and established cell lines, VEGF appears to be the angiogenic factor most closely associated with neovascularization. Several lines of evidence implicate VEGF production as important to colon tumorigenicity and/or metastatic potential. Increases in VEGF are observed in primary tumors relative to normal tissue (7Brown L.F. Berse B. Jackman R.W. Tognazzi K. Manseau E.J. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1255-1262PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brown L.F. Berse B. Jackman R.W. Tognazzi K. Manseau E.J. Senger D.R. Dvorak H.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4727-4735PubMed Google Scholar) and in metastatic tumors relative to nonmetastatic tumors (2Takahashi Y. Kitadai Y. Bucana C.D. Cleary K.R. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3964-3968PubMed Google Scholar, 3Takahashi Y. Cleary K.R. Mai M. Kitadai Y. Bucana C.D. Ellis L.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1679-1684PubMed Google Scholar). Using colon tumor cell lines in mouse models, Warrenet al. (16Warren R.S. Yuan H. Matli M.R. Gillett N.A. Ferrara N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) found that a VEGF antibody greatly inhibits the growth of subcutaneous xenografts and the number and size of experimental metastases. These results suggest that the production of VEGF is important to colon tumor cell growth and progression. However, other factors have also been implicated in the process of colon cancer angiogenesis. Subcutaneous injection into nude mice of several HT29 subclones with varying degrees of differentiation has demonstrated a positive correlation between vessel counts and the ability of the cells to express platelet-derived growth factor-B in vitro(32Hsu S. Huang F. Friedman E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, in different subclones from even the same cell line, different angiogenic factors might be important to induction of neovascularization. The signal transduction pathways by which VEGF is induced remain to be elucidated fully. However, recent experiments have implicated specific activation of the protein-tyrosine kinase activities of thesrc family of proto-oncogenes as important in the induction of VEGF. Mukhopadhyay et al. (18Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) examined the role of activated c-src in hypoxic induction of VEGF. Hypoxia was found to increase VEGF expression in U87 glioma cells and 293 kidney cells, and this induction was inhibited by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. When the effects of hypoxia on src family protein-tyrosine kinases were analyzed, Src activity, but not Yes or Fyn activity, was increased. Transfection of v-src into U87 glioma cells and 293 kidney cells also increased the hypoxic induction of VEGF, whereas transfection of cells with a dominant-negative form of c-src partially inhibited VEGF induction. To examine the potential role of Src in hypoxic induction of VEGF, fibroblasts derived from mice with a c-src disruption were employed. These cells exhibited a 50–70% decrease in hypoxic induction of VEGF mRNA, with a compensatory activation of Fyn. These results strongly suggest a specific role for Src in promoting angiogenesis. In addition, Raket al. (33Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Bayko L. Filmus J. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4575-4580PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that transfection with v-src increased VEGF expression and induced tumorigenicity in an immortalized rat intestinal epithelial cell line. Conditioned media from cells transfected with v-src were able to increase endothelial cell proliferation, and this increase was blocked by the addition of antibodies to VEGF. These results suggest that activation of Src is important to VEGF induction in several cell systems. In contrast, in HEP3b hepatoma cells, hypoxic induction of VEGF did not appear to be Src-dependent (25Gleade J.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several laboratories have demonstrated that the specific activity of Src is greatly increased in the majority of colon tumors and cell lines (22Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Cartwright C.A. Meisler A.I. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 34Bolen J.B. Veillette A. Schwartz A.M. DeSeau V. Rosen N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The importance of this activation to colon cell tumorigenicity has been uncertain. Recently, we developed cell lines from HT29-P cells with reduced c-src expression and activity by transfection with an antisense expression vector specific for c-src (26Staley C.A. Parikh N.U. Gallick G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). These cells proliferate more slowly than parental cells in vitro, and tumorigenicity in nude mice is reduced (26Staley C.A. Parikh N.U. Gallick G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, tumors from antisense transfectants were limited in size, even after >1 year of growth in mice. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine whether limited growth, in part, resulted from reduced expression and/or induction of VEGF in the antisense transfected cell lines. The results in this paper demonstrate that reduction of Src expression and activity, but not those of the related Yes, directly corresponds to decreased levels of VEGF mRNA and decreased biologic activity of VEGF. Furthermore, fewer blood vessels are observed in tumors that form after injection of the cell lines transfected with the Src antisense constructs. These results suggest that in addition to the role of Src in regulating cell proliferation, activation of Src in colon tumorigenesis may promote tumor growth via induction of VEGF, which in turn induces neovascularization. Further evidence for this possibility was derived from studies on the effect of hypoxia on induction of VEGF mRNA expression in HT29 parental cells and the antisense transfected clone HT29-AS15. In the HT29 parental cells, a >50-fold induction of VEGF mRNA was observed. This induction far exceeded that observed by Mukhopadhyay et al. (18Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) in fibroblasts, where hypoxia resulted in a maximum 4.5-fold induction of VEGF mRNA. Our results therefore suggest that the higher expression and specific activity of Src kinase in colon tumor cells can augment the ability of hypoxia to induce VEGF. However, in HT29-AS15 cells, in which c-srcexpression has been reduced 4-fold, the ability of hypoxia to induce VEGF mRNA is severely impaired. These results suggest that in this colon tumor cell system, Src kinase regulates both inducible and constitutive pathways leading to VEGF production. Further confirmation of the ability of Src kinase to regulate inducible VEGF expression was derived from a study of Fleming et al. (30Fleming R.Y.D. Ellis L.M. Parikh N.U. Liu W. Staley C.A. Gallick G.E. Surgery. 1997; 122: 501-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in which the ability of cell density to up-regulate VEGF expression was diminished in the antisense transfected clones relative to HT29 parental cells. While our results suggest that constitutive Src activation may be a primary pathway leading to production of angiogenic factors in colon cancer, other pathways resulting from genetic changes in colon cancer may also be responsible for the induction of angiogenic factors. For example, 40–50% of colon tumors are known to have activatingras mutations (35Forrester K. Almoguera A. Han K. Grizzle W.E. Perucho M. Nature. 1987; 327: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 36Bos J.L. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Verlaan-de Vries M. van Boom J.H. van der Eb A.J. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), and previous studies have demonstrated that Ras activation is sufficient to induce VEGF (33Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Bayko L. Filmus J. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4575-4580PubMed Google Scholar, 37Grugel S. Finkenzeller G. Weindel K. Barleon B. Marme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Additionally, in 293 kidney cells, induction of the promoter of VEGF by transfection of v-src is inhibited by overexpression of wild-type p53 (21Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6161-6165PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 50–60% of colon cancers exhibit p53 mutations (38Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Paraskeva C. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Hamilton S. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7717-7722PubMed Google Scholar), whereas >80% contain activated Src kinase. The relationship between p53 status, Src activation, and VEGF production in colon tumor cells thus requires further study. Nevertheless, the data presented in this paper suggest an important role for Src activation and VEGF expression in the tumorigenicity, progression, and vascularization of human colon tumors.

Extracts prepared from DNA polymerase β (polβ)-proficient mouse fibroblasts repaired AP sites on both circular and linear DNA. However, extracts from the isogenic polβ-knockout cells repaired AP sites on circular DNA but not efficiently on linear DNA. The circularity-dependent repair by the polβ-knockout cell extract was completely inhibited by anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody but fully restored by addition of purified PCNA. Pretreatment of the linear DNA with AP endonuclease did not improve repair, indicating that impairment of AP site repair on linear DNA by polβ-knockout cell extracts is not due to inefficiency of damage incision but rather to deficiency at the subsequent steps. These results indicate that AP sites can be repaired on circular DNA by the PCNA-dependent pathway in addition to the polβ-dependent pathway and that the PCNA-dependent repair mechanism is poorly functional on linear DNA in vitro.

Base excision repair is a major mechanism by which cells correct bases with small modifications, AP 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; polβ, DNA polymerase β; polδ, DNA polymerase δ; polε, DNA polymerase ε; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; cccDNA, covalently closed circular DNA; RF-C, replication factor C. 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; polβ, DNA polymerase β; polδ, DNA polymerase δ; polε, DNA polymerase ε; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; cccDNA, covalently closed circular DNA; RF-C, replication factor C. sites, and single-strand breaks (1Wallace S.S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These types of DNA damage are spontaneously generated through normal cellular metabolism and also are caused by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation and alkylating and oxidizing agents. Thus, they belong to a group of the most abundant lesions in living cells. A typical process for base excision repair consists of five sequential reactions (2Lindhal T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 19: 73-77Crossref Google Scholar): (i) the modified base is removed by a specific DNA-N-glycosylase; (ii) the resultant AP site is incised at its 5′ side by an AP endonuclease; (iii) a deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) is excised from the 5′-incised site; (iv) the gap is filled by DNA synthesis; and (v) the DNA strand is sealed by ligation. Several protein factors responsible for some steps in this process have been identified, including a group of DNA-N-glycosylases and AP endonucleases. Regarding the DNA synthesis step, however, it has not yet been established which enzymes are responsible for this step. Higher eukaryotes have five classes of DNA polymerases in nuclei, α, β, δ, ε, and ζ (3Wood R.D. Shivji M.K.K. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Among them, polβ has long been considered to be involved in base excision repair. Two recent observations strongly support this implication. First, a mouse fibroblast cell line in which both alleles of the polβ gene are disrupted exhibits hypersensitivity to alkylating agents (4Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Second, polβ has beside its DNA polymerase activity, another enzymatic activity for the excision of dRP residues, an indispensable step for base excision repair (5Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). On the other hand, two studies using in vitrorepair systems demonstrated that base excision repair can proceed by another pathway that requires PCNA as an essential factor (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). PCNA plays an essential role in DNA replication (8Prelich G. Kostura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 9Bravo R. Frank R. Blundell P.A. Macdonald-Bravo H. Nature. 1987; 326: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) and in nucleotide excision repair (10Shivji M.K.K. Kenny M.K. Wood R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 11Nichols A.F. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and it has been shown recently to be involved in mismatch repair (12Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It is a protein of approximately 29 kDa that forms a homotrimer with a torus structure. Double-stranded DNA can pass through the inside cavity of the PCNA trimer. Such loading of PCNA onto DNA is facilitated by the replication factor C (RF-C) in an ATP-dependent manner, resulting in a PCNA/RF-C complex known as the PCNA clamp (for review, see Ref. 13Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The formation of the PCNA clamp is a prerequisite to efficient DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase δ (polδ) or polymerase ε (polε). Because PCNA stimulates the activities of polδ and polε but not polymerase α or polymerase β, the alternative pathway for base excision repair should use polδ and/or polε at its DNA synthesis step. In contrast, several studies which also used in vitro repair systems indicated that polβ was the exclusive DNA polymerase responsible for base excision repair (4Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 14Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5842-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We noticed that the studies demonstrating the PCNA-dependent pathway used circular DNA substrates, whereas linear DNA substrates were used in the studies supporting the polβ-dependent pathway in exclusion of the PCNA-dependent pathway. Podust et al. (16Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Floth C. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2970-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that PCNA could be loaded more stably on circular DNA than on linear DNA in vitro. Unstable loading of the PCNA onto linear DNA is due to the falling off of the PCNA clamp from linear DNA ends after sliding along it. If this property of PCNA-DNA binding applies to base excision repair, linear DNA substrates may not support the PCNA-dependent pathway. To test this possibility, we compared the repair efficiencies on circular and linear DNA side by side using extracts prepared from wild-type and polβ-knockout mouse cells. We show here that DNA substrates that do not have free ends are preferable to detect PCNA-mediated in vitro repair. The wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line and the matched littermate polβ-knockout cell line (4Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) were maintained in Glutamax I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 80 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). The cells were cultured in monolayer in a humidified incubator with 10% CO2 at 34 °C. CHO-K1 and its double-strand break repair-deficient derivative, xrs-5, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in 175 cm2 flasks and incubated overnight to reach mid-exponential growth phase. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 106 cells/20 μl in Buffer I (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 200 mm KCl). After the addition of an equal volume of Buffer II (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), the cell suspension was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) which carried either a uridine or a synthetic AP site analog (3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran) was prepared as described previously (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In prelabeled cccDNA, 32P was incorporated at the position several nucleotides away from the lesion. Linear DNA was prepared by digestion of the cccDNA withPvuII, which generated a 382-base pair fragment carrying the AP site in its middle position and a 2.8-kilobase fragment with no AP site. For natural AP site repair assays, the DNA containing a uridine residue was treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (Perkin-Elmer) immediately before the repair reaction as described previously (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) to create a natural AP site. A standard repair reaction was carried out at 25 °C with 10 ng of a DNA substrate (200–1000 cpm, 5 fmol AP sites) and 10 μg of the cell extract protein in a 20-μl reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 135 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm each of four dNTPs, 2 mm NAD, 40 mm phosphocreatine, and 1 unit of creatine phosphokinase). When indicated, repair factors were added to the cell extracts immediately before the reaction was started. In experiments for neutralizing PCNA, the antibody AK specific for PCNA (37.5 μg/ml) (generously provided by Dr. M. Miura, Tokyo Medical and Dental University) was incubated with the cell extracts on ice for 20 min before the repair reaction. At indicated times the reaction was stopped by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to a final concentration of 0.4% and 2 μg of proteinase K followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. The DNA was recovered by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and digested with AP endonuclease and PvuII (for cccDNA only). The DNA was then subjected to electrophoresis on an 8 m urea-containing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Repaired and unrepaired DNA fragments were detected by autoradiography, and the amounts of radioactivities were quantified with a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimager. After the repair reaction, DNA was digested with KpnI and PvuII (for cccDNA only) for 1 h at 37 °C and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8m urea-containing 6% polyacrylamide gel. KpnI can cleave only the repaired DNA substrate but not the unrepaired DNA substrate, which has an AP site in the KpnI restriction site. The 382-nucleotide fragment that carried an intact AP site and the 131-nucleotide and 129-nucleotide fragments which were generated by the AP endonuclease digestion during the repair reaction or by theKpnI digestion of the repaired product were detected by autoradiography, and the amounts of radioactivities were quantified with a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimager. Most of the studies dealing with in vitro DNA repair assays with mammalian cultured cells utilize extracts prepared by the procedures described by Manley et al. (17Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) with some modifications. This technique is time consuming and requires large amounts of cells. We prepared extracts from detergent-lysed cells by the procedures described by Tanaka et al. (18Tanaka M. Lai J.S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) with a few modifications (see under “Experimental Procedures” for details). These procedures allowed us to obtain from a million cells an amount of cell extract sufficient for 30 repair reactions. In a preliminary experiment, we compared the repair activity of cell extracts prepared by this method with that of the extracts prepared as described by Manley et al. (17Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These extracts were made from mouse polβ-knockout cells and their isogenic wild-type cells. Repair assays were conducted on AP site-containing circular DNA. AP sites are common intermediate products generated during base excision repair and are efficiently repaired byXenopus laevis ovarian extracts (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and mammalian cell extracts (7Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated with a reconstituted repair system using X. laevis proteins that a synthetic AP site analog, 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran, is mostly repaired by the PCNA-dependent pathway, whereas the natural AP site is repaired by both the polβ-dependent pathway and the PCNA-dependent pathway (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also compared repair of these two types of lesions. As shown in TableI, both cell extracts prepared from wild-type and polβ-knockout cells were able to repair AP sites, although less efficiently by the latter. This result indicates that AP sites were repaired, at least in part, by a mechanism independent of polβ in these mouse cell extracts. In each case, the extract prepared by the method of Tanaka et al. provided higher repair activity than the extract prepared by the method of Manley et al. Therefore, the subsequent experiments in this study were carried out using cell extracts prepared by the procedure based on the detergent cell lysis.Table IComparison of the repair activity of cell extracts prepared by two different methodsCell lineMethod of extract preparationSynthetic AP site repairNatural AP site repair%%Wild typeI5074II3842polβ −/−I3042II2227 Open table in a new tab To evaluate more accurately the repair activity of each extract, a time course of the repair was measured. On circular DNA, the synthetic AP site analog was repaired at the same rate by both wild-type and polβ-knockout cell extracts (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the natural AP site was more efficiently repaired by wild-type cell extracts (Fig. 1 B), indicating that a portion of repair in the wild-type cell extract was mediated by a polβ-dependent pathway. The initial rate of natural AP site repair by the polβ-knockout cell extract was similar to that observed for the synthetic AP site repair by both extracts. Thus, the difference of the natural AP site repair between the two extracts could be due to preferential repair of the natural AP sites over the synthetic AP sites by the polβ-dependent mechanism. As previously reported, polβ can excise a dRP residue from the 5′-incised AP site by its own dRP lyase activity (5Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, polβ cannot excise a dRP residue from the synthetic AP site analog, because this lesion is resistant to β-elimination. It was observed that synthetic AP sites were not efficiently repaired by the polβ-dependent pathway (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). On linear DNA, however, only the wild-type cell extracts were able to repair efficiently the natural AP site and to a lesser extent the synthetic AP site analog (Fig. 1,C and D). The complete lack of DNA repair with the polβ-knockout cell extracts on linear DNA indicates that only the polβ-dependent pathway is functional on this DNA. Thus, the alternative pathway cannot repair either type of AP sites on linear DNA. The effect of DNA linearization on AP site repair appeared to have an inverse correlation with the length of the linear DNA. Although thePvuII-digested DNA (382 base pairs) was not repaired at all by polβ-knockout cell extracts (Fig. 1), theXmnI-linearized DNA (3.2 kilobases) was repaired by the same extracts with approximately 50% efficiency of that of circular DNA (data not shown). According to the previously reported studies (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), this alternative pathway for base excision repair should proceed through the PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis. To test whether this is the case in the present repair system with mouse cell extracts, we used an anti-PCNA antibody (AK) known to have a neutralizing activity for the PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis (19Cheng-Keat T. Sullivan K. Li X. Tan E.M. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 22: 9299-9308Google Scholar). When incubated for 20 min with the cell extracts prior to the reaction, this antibody completely inhibited the repair reaction carried out by polβ-knockout cell extracts on circular DNA (Fig. 2). Moreover, this repair was fully restored by addition of 500 ng of PCNA to the reaction. These results clearly indicated that PCNA is required for the alternative pathway in the polβ-knockout cell extracts. The repair of the synthetic AP site analog by the wild-type cell extracts was only partially inhibited. This is because this synthetic lesion can be repaired by the polβ pathway, although in a less efficient manner. The synthetic AP site analog cannot be excised by polβ, because this lesion is refractory to β-elimination (5Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, it is reported that FEN1 (also known as DNaseIV) can excise modified AP sites which cannot be removed by β-elimination (20Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Therefore, the excision step of the synthetic AP sites was probably catalyzed by a FEN1-like enzyme present in the cell extracts. Once this step is accomplished, polβ should ensure the completion of the repair. We indeed observed that addition of FEN1 to the reconstituted system for the polβ-dependent AP site repair rescued the repair of synthetic AP sites. 2K. Kim, S. Biade, and Y. Matsumoto, submitted for publication. A similar inefficient repair of the synthetic AP site analog by the polβ-dependent pathway is also shown in Fig.1 C (compare with Fig. 1 D). The AK antibody did not inhibit at all the natural AP site repair by the wild-type cell extracts, because this repair can be catalyzed by the polβ-dependent pathway without restriction. Taken together, the PCNA-dependent AP site repair can proceedin vitro on circular DNA but not efficiently on linear DNA. To confirm further the differential effect of DNA structure between the polβ-dependent pathway and the PCNA-dependent pathway, we stimulated either one of the two pathways by adding purified polβ or PCNA to the repair reactions with the cell extracts. When we added 50 ng of rat polβ, the AP sites were mostly repaired in any combination of the cell extracts and the DNA substrates (Fig.3), indicating that the polβ-dependent pathway was fully functional on both circular and linear DNA substrates. On the other hand, the addition of 50 ng of mouse PCNA increased the repair efficiency on the circular DNA but did not rescue the repair on the linear DNA (Fig.4). Thus, the stimulating effect of additional PCNA on AP site repair was limited to circular substrates. The increase in AP site repair by additional PCNA was relatively small compared with that by additional polβ. This is probably because PCNA may not be the only limiting factor for this repair pathway. Polδ, polε, and RF-C may also be limiting, as such large factors may not be efficiently extracted from the nuclei during our cell extract preparation procedures.Figure 4Effect of additional PCNA on AP site repair.

(21Calsou P. Frit P. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27601-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that nucleotide excision repair was inhibited by double-strand breaks in acis-acting manner, and that this inhibition could be due to the blocking by Ku proteins of the damage-specific incision. Ku proteins which can bind as a heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku86 to double-strand breaks are required for double-strand break DNA repair and V(D)J recombination (22Boubnov N.V. Hall K.T. Wills Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27601-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) observed that linearization of DNA substrates reduced the nucleotide excision repair activity to 50% in the extracts from Ku-proficient CHO-K1 cells but did not affect the repair in the extracts from Ku86-deficient xrs-6 cells. We investigated a possible involvement of Ku proteins in the AP site repair process on linear DNA. Cell extracts were prepared from Ku86-deficient xrs-5 cells and the parental Ku-proficient CHO-K1 cells, and their repair activities were compared on linear and circular DNA carrying either a synthetic or a natural AP site. Because the CHO cell lines were proficient in polβ activity, natural AP sites on linear DNA were repaired in the extracts from these cells (Fig. 5). The repair of the synthetic AP site analog was, in contrast, relatively inefficient on linear DNA. This repair impairment was observed at similar levels in both CHO-K1 and xrs-5 cell extracts. Furthermore, the AP site on linear DNA was incised at the same rate by both cell extracts. The repair reactions with CHO-K1 and xrs-5 cell extracts left 6 and 12% of AP sites on linear DNA uncut (Table II), indicating that 94 and 88%, respectively, of the DNA substrate was incised by AP endonucleases contained in these cell extracts. On circular DNA, the incision rate was higher than 95% for both cell extracts. This result shows that the Ku86 protein did not inhibit the incision step on either circular or linear DNA. We also examined AP site repair of DNA pretreated with AP endonuclease. As shown in Fig.6, preincision of AP sites did not improve the repair of linear DNA by the polβ-knockout cell extracts, indicating that the impairment of PCNA-dependent pathway on linear DNA is not due to inefficient incision of AP sites. These results ruled out the possible role of the Ku86 protein in the inhibition of base excision repair on linear DNA in our system.Table IIDetection of intact AP sites remaining after repair reactionCell lineUncut AP sites on circular DNAUncut AP sites on linear DNA%%CHO-Kl26xrs-5412 Open table in a new tab Figure 6Effect of AP endonuclease pretreatment on DNA repair.

The alternative pathway uses PCNA as one of its essential factors. This PCNA-dependent pathway was functional on circular DNA but not on linear DNA in vitro, whereas the polβ-dependent repair reaction proceeded efficiently on both circular and linear substrates. These results resolve the controversy raised by the studies previously reported (4Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar,6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Frosina G.

In addition, it is clear that circular DNA should be used as a substrate for in vitro repair assays when PCNA may be involved in the reaction. Recently, Klungland and Lindahl (20Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) reported that PCNA enhanced the polβ-dependent repair of modified AP sites by stimulating the FEN-1 activity. They also observed that polβ-neutralizing antibodies decreased this AP site repair to 5%, claiming polβ as the major enzyme for DNA synthesis in base excision repair. Because they used a double-stranded oligonucleotide as a substrate, it is likely that their results may underestimate the contribution of PCNA-dependent DNA polymerases polδ/polε to base excision repair. The study performed withXenopus purified enzymes demonstrated that polδ repaired efficiently AP sites on circular DNA (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The data reported here with polβ-knockout cell extracts also suggest that DNA synthesis for the PCNA-dependent repair should be attributed to polδ or polε. One explanation for the mechanism of in vitro repair inhibition on linear DNA was provided by Calsou et al. (21Calsou P. Frit P. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27601-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for nucleotide excision repair in which the damage-specific incision may be blocked by Ku proteins through their binding to the DNA ends. However, our results with xrs-5 cell extracts and those obtained with the DNA preincised with AP endonuclease indicate that this was not the case for the impairment of AP site repair that we observed on linear DNA. Although the PCNA-dependent base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair use a PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase, either δ or ε, their incision mechanisms of damaged sites are distinct from each other. Nucleotide excision repair requires at least 16 polypeptides for incision of damaged sites (24Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This incision step seems to be rate-limiting in the repair reaction with mammalian cell extracts rather than the DNA synthesis step (25Hansson J. Grossman L. Lindhal T. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, AP endonuclease is sufficient by itself for incision of AP sites in base excision repair. Inability to repair AP sites on linear DNA by the PCNA-dependent pathway results most likely from the property of the PCNA clamp on DNA. Podust et al. (16Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Floth C. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2970-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the RF-C·PCNA complex assembled on gapped circular DNA was easily lost once the DNA was linearized. Consequently, polδ with PCNA and RF-C cannot carry out DNA synthesis on linear DNA as efficiently as on circular gapped DNA. Studies with X. laevis reconstituted systems suggest that RF-C is required in the PCNA-dependent AP site repair (6Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The efficient utilization of circular DNA as a template for PCNA-dependent reactions seems to be due to its structural character, for that circular DNA does not have free ends. In fact, Yaoet al. (26Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cell. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported that blocking of linear DNA ends with a specific DNA-binding protein reduces the dissociation of the PCNA clamp from DNA. This situation resembles the DNA repair reaction in living cells. There is a model for in vivo repair in which DNA repair may be associated with rearrangements in chromatin structure including dissociation of nucleosomes around damaged sites (27Smerdon M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, a free slide of the PCNA clamp could be limited within the unfolded region of the damaged chromosomal DNA. We thank M. Miura for the AK antibody and S. W. Johnson, T. C. Hamilton, and A. T. Yeung for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2166871205,"Members of the erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) multigene family contain three C-terminal zinc fingers, and they are typically expressed in a limited number of tissues. EKLF, the founding member, transactivates the β-globin promoter by binding to the CACCC motif. EKLF is essential for expression of the β-globin gene as demonstrated by gene deletion experiments in mice. Using a DNA probe from the zinc finger region of EKLF, we cloned a cDNA encoding a member of this family from a human vascular endothelial cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis indicated that our clone, hEZF, is the human homologue of the recently reported mouse EZF and GKLF. hEZF is a single-copy gene that maps to chromosome 9q31. By gel mobility shift analysis, purified recombinant hEZF protein bound specifically to a probe containing the CACCC core sequence. In co-transfection experiments, we found that sense but not antisense hEZF decreased the activity of a reporter plasmid containing the CACCC sequence upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter by 6-fold. In contrast, EKLF increased the activity of the reporter plasmid by 3-fold. By fusing hEZF to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, we mapped a repression domain in hEZF to amino acids 181–388. We also found that amino acids 91–117 of hEZF confer an activation function on the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Members of the erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) multigene family contain three C-terminal zinc fingers, and they are typically expressed in a limited number of tissues. EKLF, the founding member, transactivates the β-globin promoter by binding to the CACCC motif. EKLF is essential for expression of the β-globin gene as demonstrated by gene deletion experiments in mice. Using a DNA probe from the zinc finger region of EKLF, we cloned a cDNA encoding a member of this family from a human vascular endothelial cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis indicated that our clone, hEZF, is the human homologue of the recently reported mouse EZF and GKLF. hEZF is a single-copy gene that maps to chromosome 9q31. By gel mobility shift analysis, purified recombinant hEZF protein bound specifically to a probe containing the CACCC core sequence. In co-transfection experiments, we found that sense but not antisense hEZF decreased the activity of a reporter plasmid containing the CACCC sequence upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter by 6-fold. In contrast, EKLF increased the activity of the reporter plasmid by 3-fold. By fusing hEZF to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, we mapped a repression domain in hEZF to amino acids 181–388. We also found that amino acids 91–117 of hEZF confer an activation function on the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. It has been estimated that 10% of the proteins within a cell are DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate important cellular processes such as cell lineage determination, cell growth and differentiation, and temporal or cell type-specific gene expression (1Maniatis T.

After binding to cognate cis-acting elements, these transcription factors either activate or repress initiation of transcription (4Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Transcription factors are grouped into several classes, which include the helix-loop-helix, leucine zipper, homeodomain, and zinc finger protein families (2Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). The zinc finger transcription factors can be classified further into subfamilies on the basis of the sequence and position of amino acid residues important for zinc binding (Cys2-His2, Cys4, or Cys3-His1), the spacing between the zinc-binding amino acids, and the transcription activation or repression domains (glutamine-rich, acidic, or proline-rich domains) (6Berg J.M.

A new zinc finger subfamily was identified recently whose members are characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal region containing three Cys2-His2 zinc fingers and a proline rich N-terminal domain (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 10Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell.

Members of this subfamily include the erythroid (EKLF), 1The abbreviations used are: EKLF, erythroid Krüppel-like factor; LKLF, lung Krüppel-like factor; BKLF, basic Krüppel-like factor; BTEB2, basic transcription element-binding protein 2; GKLF, gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor; EZF, epithelial/endothelial zinc finger protein; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; β-gal, β-galactosidase; bp, base pair(s). lung (LKLF), and basic (BKLF) Krüppel-like factors, and BTEB2 (or placental Krüppel-like factor). All four factors transactivate gene expression after binding to DNA. The founder of this family, EKLF, was originally isolated as an erythroid cell-specific factor by subtractive cloning (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It binds and transactivates via the CACCC site of the β-globin gene promoter (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar,9Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

In vitro, EKLF plays an important role in human γ-globin to β-globin gene switching (11Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with data showing that disruption of the EKLF gene by homologous recombination in mice results in defective hematopoiesis in the fetal liver and lethal β-thalassemia (15Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 16Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The other members of the EKLF family, LKLF, BKLF, and BTEB2, were isolated by homology screening with the zinc finger regions of EKLF, Sp1, and BTEB (a GC box-binding zinc finger protein) (10Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 12Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). LKLF is expressed highly in the lung and the spleen and transactivates the β-globin gene via the CACCC site (10Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although BKLF is also expressed in hematopoietic precursor cells, its expression is less restricted than that of EKLF (13Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Also, even though BTEB2 was isolated from a placental library with a BTEB probe, the BTEB2 zinc finger region is more homologous to the zinc finger region of EKLF than it is to that of BTEB or Sp1 (12Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To identify new members of the EKLF family that may be involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell function, we used the zinc finger region of EKLF to screen a human vascular endothelial cell cDNA library. We isolated a member of the EKLF family and found it to be the human homologue of mouse EZF and GKLF (17Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 18Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Mouse EZF/GKLF has been shown to be a nuclear protein. Its mRNA is expressed highly in quiescent fibroblasts. The growth-arresting nature of EZF/GKLF was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in cells that overexpress the gene (17Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). By in situ analysis, the mouse homologue was shown to be expressed at high levels in epithelial cells of the epidermis, tongue, palate, esophagus, stomach, and colon (18Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We show in this report that the human homologue (hEZF) is expressed in vascular endothelial cells of an endodermal origin, in contrast to the ectodermal origin of the mouse homologue in epithelial cells. We also demonstrate that purified, recombinant full-length hEZF protein binds specifically to a probe containing the CACCC core sequence in gel mobility shift assays. In contrast to other members of the family, which are transcriptional activators, hEZF functions as a transcriptional repressor, as demonstrated by its ability to repress reporter gene activity in transient transfection assays. By gene fusion experiments, we identified both the activation domain and the repression domain within hEZF. A cDNA probe encoding the C-terminal zinc finger region of EKLF (bp 895–1146) was generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (19Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-GAACTTTGGCACCTAAGAGGCAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACGCTTCATGTGCAGAGCTAAGTG-3′) were designed according to the published sequence (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment was labeled by random priming (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as a probe to screen a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library. Approximately 1.6 million phages were plated, transferred to nitrocellulose, and screened according to standard techniques with minor modification (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were washed initially with 0.5 × SSC (75 mmsodium chloride, 7.5 mm sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) at 37 °C and then more stringently with 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. More than 40 clones were obtained that hybridized differentially. Six were isolated, three were sequenced, and one was characterized further. It included the entire coding region of hEZF. The cDNA was mapped by restriction digestion and sequenced from both orientations by the dideoxy chain termination method with Sequenase version 2 (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) or on an automated DNA Sequencer (Licor, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). High molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from cultured human aortic endothelial cells (21Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with several restriction enzymes, fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were then hybridized with a random-primed hEZF cDNA probe. The final membrane wash was in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, after which the membranes were exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −80 °C. To localize the hEZF gene, we performed PCR-based radiation hybrid panel mapping (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Two oligonucleotide primers specific to the hEZF cDNA sequence (5′-CCACCTGGCGAGTCTGACAT-3′ and 5′-CACCGTGTCCTCGTCAGCGT-3′) were used to amplify genomic DNA by PCR. The PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, and the results were analyzed on the worldwide web server at the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (URL:http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/contig/rhmapper.pl). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as described (22Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAEC were passaged every 2–3 days, and cells from passages 5 to 8 were used in all experiments. We used BAEC because they are easy to transfect. Amino acids 2–470 of hEZF were fused in-frame with the N-terminal histidine residues of the pRSET vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). His-tagged hEZF protein was expressed in the BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain ofEscherichia coli and purified with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Recombinant protein was eluted from the resin with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin. The purified protein was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.005% Tween 20, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 0.02 mm oxidized glutathione, 10 μmZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin for 16 h at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C. The sequence of the double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the core CACCC site (5′-AGCTAGCCACACCCTGAAGCT-3′) was derived from the sequence of the β-globin promoter. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described (23Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A typical binding reaction mixture contained 25,000 cpm of probe, 40 ng of purified hEZF protein, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 25 μm HEPES, pH 7.5, 16 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 μm ZnCl2, 0.6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 8% glycerol. The probe and protein were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The sequence of the mutant competitor oligonucleotide was 5′-AGCTAGCCACACCGTGAAGCT-3′. A cDNA fragment containing bp 411 to 1873 of hEZF was amplified by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The product was then digested at theBamHI sites that had been added to the primers. The fragment was ligated into the BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in the sense (pcDNA3-hEZF) and antisense (pcDNA3-hEZF(AS)) orientations. The open reading frame was confirmed by sequencing and by in vitro transcription and translation in a reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pcDNA3-EKLF plasmid was constructed by cloning the EKLF EcoRI (filled in)-BamHI fragment of pSG5/EKLF (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) into theHindIII (filled in)-BamHI sites of pcDNA3. For the GAL4-hEZF fusion constructs, hEZF fragments were fused in-frame to the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) of plasmid pSG424. Segments of hEZF were generated by PCR withPfu DNA polymerase and 5′- and 3′-primers containing theBamHI and XbaI sites, respectively. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pSG424. The authenticity of the fusion constructs was verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Transient transfection assays in BAEC were performed with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Cells were plated at a density of 300,000 per 60-mm dish on the day before transfection. BAEC were transfected with a total of 3 μg of reporter plasmid and expression plasmid. To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, we cotransfected 0.5 μg of pCMV-βgal in all experiments. Each construct was transfected at least three times, and each transfection was performed in triplicate. Cell extracts were prepared by a detergent lysis method (Promega) 48 h after transfection, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was assayed by a modified two-phase fluor diffusion method (22Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (22Lee M.E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of CAT activity to β-galactosidase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized CAT activity. To identify additional members of the EKLF family that may be involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell function, we screened a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library using a DNA probe containing the zinc finger region of EKLF under low-stringency conditions. One of the cDNAs isolated contained 1876 nucleotides and a deduced open reading frame coding for a 470-amino acid protein with an estimated pI of 9.2. Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed three Cys2-His2 Krüppel-type fingers at the C terminus, a proline- and serine-rich N terminus, and a potential nuclear localization signal at amino acids 371–377 (Fig.1). A single transcript of 3.5 kilobases was detected by Northern blot analysis with this 1876-bp cDNA used as a probe in total RNA from both human aortic endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown). By a comparison with sequences in the GenBank™ data base, we found that our cDNA is the human homologue of the recently described mouse EZF and GKLF cDNAs (17Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 18Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We refer to the human gene as hEZF because of its expression in endothelial and epithelial cells. A comparison of the human and mouse EZF sequences revealed 91% identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 1). The three tandem zinc finger motifs (Fig. 1,boxed) are conserved completely in the human and mouse sequences. Hybridization of an hEZF cDNA probe with human genomic DNA that had been digested withBamHI, EcoRI, and PstI revealed a simple pattern of hybridization, indicating that hEZF is a single-copy gene in the human genome. To map the chromosomal location of hEZF, we carried out genomic PCR analysis against a GeneBridge 4 radiation hybrid panel with specific primers from the hEZF cDNA sequence. The results from the genomic PCR experiments were analyzed against a human genome data base of sequence-tagged sites at the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research worldwide web site. The human EZF gene mapped to chromosome 9q31. Thioredoxin and the disease locus TAL2 (T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-2) have been mapped to the same locus. The high degree of sequence conservation among the zinc finger regions of EZF, EKLF, and LKLF suggests that hEZF may also bind to the CACCC sequence. Gel mobility shift analysis was performed with the purified recombinant full-length hEZF protein and an oligonucleotide probe encoding a CACCC site derived from the β-globin gene (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Incubation of hEZF with the probe resulted in a DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2). This complex was specific because it was competed away by an unlabeled identical probe but not by an unrelated probe. Mutation of the core CACCC sequence to CACCG has been shown to obliterate the binding and transactivation of EKLF (9Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our analysis (Fig. 2), an unlabeled probe with this single base mutation failed to compete for binding, indicating that hEZF binds specifically to the CACCC site. All members of the EKLF family identified before hEZF function as transcriptional activators. In particular, EKLF, LKLF, and BKLF have been shown to transactivate reporter plasmids via the CACCC site (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 13Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because hEZF bound to the CACCC site, we decided to determine the effect of hEZF on a CAT reporter plasmid (pCAC-tkCAT) that contains a single copy of the β-globin CACCC site upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of pcDNA3-hEZF decreased the promoter activity of pCAC-tkCAT in a dose-dependent manner in BAEC (Fig.3 A). A 10 to 1 expression plasmid to reporter plasmid ratio resulted in a 6-fold repression. This repression was specific because cotransfection of the antisense plasmid pcDNA3-hEZF(AS) had no effect on activity. In contrast, cotransfection of pcDNA3-EKLF increased CAT activity by 3-fold in BAEC (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that hEZF functions as a transcriptional repressor in our transient transfection system. To identify domains in hEZF that may mediate its transcriptional effect, we generated a series of plasmids containing various fragments of hEZF fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Fig.4 A). The fusion plasmids were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing five GAL4-binding sites in front of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (pGAL45tkCAT). The GAL4-hEZF plasmid containing hEZF amino acids 2–470 had little effect on reporter activity. In contrast, the plasmid coding for amino acids 2–388 (from which the three zinc fingers had been removed) increased transcription by 25-fold (Fig.4 B). These data indicate the presence of a potent activation domain between amino acids 2 and 388 of hEZF that is inhibited by the presence of the zinc finger domain. The ability to transactivate was retained when the N-terminal 90 amino acids were deleted (GAL4-hEZF(91–388)). However, the ability to transactivate was lost with deletion of a further 23 amino acids from the N terminus (GAL4-hEZF(114–388)). The region containing 97 amino acids N-terminal of the zinc fingers (GAL4(292–388)) or the zinc finger region alone (GAL4-hEZF(386–470)) did not affect CAT activity. These N-terminal deletion experiments mapping the hEZF activation domain to amino acids 91–114 (Fig. 4 B) are supported by a series of C-terminal deletion experiments (Fig. 4 B). GAL4-hEZF constructs coding for hEZF amino acids 2–117 or 2–180 were able to increase transcription by more than 40-fold. To determine whether the hEZF activation domain was modular, we made a fusion construct containing amino acids 91–117 of hEZF and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. GAL4-hEZF(91–117) increased transcription by more than 30-fold (Fig. 4 B), indicating that a potent modular activation domain is located between amino acids 91 and 117. The diminished transcriptional activity of GAL4-hEZF(114–388) in comparison with that of GAL4(1–147) (Fig. 4 B) suggested the presence of repression domains C-terminal of amino acid 114. Furthermore, the enhanced activation obtained with deletions GAL4-hEZF(2–180) and GAL4-hEZF(2–117) over that obtained with GAL4-hEZF(2–388) (Fig. 4 B) is consistent with the loss of a domain important for repression. To identify the repression domain(s) in hEZF, we generated additional plasmids and assayed their effect on the pGAL45tkCAT reporter. Plasmids containing hEZF amino acids 140–388, 163–388, and 181–388 repressed transcription by 4–5-fold (Fig. 5). However, plasmids containing segments C-terminal of amino acid 240 showed no repression activity. The region containing the zinc fingers alone (GAL4-EZF(386–470)) or that containing the fingers in conjunction with the 47 amino acids N-terminal of them (GAL4-EZF(342–470)) did not repress transcription. Our data from the N-terminal deletion analysis suggest that hEZF amino acids 181–240 may contain the repression domain. To further define the C-terminal border of this repression domain, we generated GAL4-fusion constructs containing hEZF amino acids 181–325 and 178–244. Neither construct repressed transcription (Fig.5). Thus, the repression domain of hEZF appears to be contained within amino acids 181–388. Using the zinc finger region from EKLF as a probe to screen a human endothelial cell cDNA library, we have isolated hEZF, a new member of the EKLF multigene family. hEZF maps to chromosome 9q31, close to the T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-2 disease locus. Further investigation will be required to determine whether hEZF is related to this disease. Although it has been shown that the zinc finger region of hEZF binds to DNA fragments containing the CACCC motif (18Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), our experiments are the first to show that the full-length hEZF protein binds to this sequence (Fig. 2). It has been shown that all previously known members of the EKLF family function as transcriptional activators: EKLF, LKLF, and BKLF activate transcription via the CACCC site of the β-globin promoter, and BTEB2 activates transcription via the promoter's GC box (8Miller I.J.

The ability of hEZF to function as a transcriptional repressor is similar to that of several other Cys2-His2 zinc finger transcription factors, such as ZNF 174 (24Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M.

By gene fusion experiments, we mapped the repression domain of hEZF to amino acids 181–388. Unlike transactivation domains, repression domains are less well characterized (4Johnson A.D.

Runs of proline residues adopt a single preferred conformation, known as the polyproline II helix, that is important for protein-protein interactions (34Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The repression domains of WT-1, Eve (Even-skipped, a Drosophilahomeodomain protein), and Mig1 (a zinc finger protein that mediates glucose repression in yeast) are also rich in prolines (4Johnson A.D.

Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The hEZF zinc fingers had no effect on transcription when fused with GAL4(1–147). Deletion of the zinc fingers, however, revealed a potent activation domain in the rest of the hEZF molecule (Fig. 4). Further mapping localized a 27-amino acid activation domain rich in leucine, serine/threonine, and acidic residues (with an estimated pI of 3.6). The acidic nature of this activation domain is similar to that of the activation domains of GAL4, GCN4 (2Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar), and EKLF (35Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Cys2-His2 zinc finger protein family (such as Egr-1 (27Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), hEZF contains activation as well as repression domains. The presence of activation and repression domains may allow Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins to alter their function as the situation dictates (38Sauer F. Jackle H. Nature. 1991; 353: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 39Natesan S. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2497-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A potential switch between a positive and negative transcriptional effect could depend on an interaction with other factors that may change the conformation of hEZF to expose either the activation or the repression domain (40Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 41Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y.

Nature. 1994; 371: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, the thyroid hormone receptor binds a corepressor to repress transcription in the absence of thyroid hormone. Hormone binding alters the receptor's conformation and leads to the release of the bound corepressor and recruitment of a coactivator. Thus, the hormone-bound thyroid receptor acts as a transcriptional activator (41Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Under conditions other than those examined here, hEZF may also act as an activator depending on its binding to other factors. We thank Dr. E. Haber for his enthusiasm and support of our work.

https://openalex.org/W2068682899,"The synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α has been suggested to be regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in response to stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, although the relative contribution of these two mechanisms has not been quantitatively evaluated. Here, using the murine monocytic cell line RAW 264.7 as a model system, we show that steady-state TNF-α mRNA levels increase ∼77-fold following treatment with lipopolysaccharide for 2 h and to a maximum of 164-fold after 8 h as measured by an RNase protection assay. The TNF-α gene transcription rate increases ∼5-fold following exposure to lipopolysaccharide for 2 h as measured by a nuclear run-on assay. TNF-α mRNA stability did not change in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. A ribosomal sedimentation assay and an RNA transfection assay revealed that the translation rate of endogenous as well as transiently transfected TNF-α mRNAs increases only ∼2–3-fold after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide for 2 h. Taken together, these results suggest that the large increase in the level of secreted TNF-α protein in RAW 264.7 cells is due primarily to activation of TNF-α gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2087424870,"Na+ channel fast inactivation is thought to involve the closure of an intracellular inactivation gate over the channel pore. Previous studies have implicated the intracellular loop connecting domains III and IV and a critical IFM motif within it as the inactivation gate, but amino acid residues at the intracellular mouth of the pore required for gate closure and binding have not been positively identified. The short intracellular loops connecting the S4 and S5 segments in each domain of the Na+ channel α-subunit are good candidates for this role in the Na+ channel inactivation process. In this study, we used scanning mutagenesis to examine the role of the IVS4-S5 region in fast inactivation. Mutations F1651A, near the middle of the loop, and L1660A and N1662A, near the COOH-terminal end, substantially disrupted Na+ channel fast inactivation. The mutant F1651A conducted Na+ currents that decayed very slowly, while L1660A and N1662A had large sustained Na+ currents at the end of 30-ms depolarizing pulses. Inactivation of macroscopic Na+currents was nearly abolished by the N1662A mutation and the combination of the F1651A/L1660A mutations. Single channel analysis revealed frequent reopenings for all three mutants during 40-ms depolarizing pulses, indicating a substantial impairment of the stability of the inactivated state compared with wild type (WT). The F1651A and N1662A mutants also had increased mean open times relative to WT, indicating a slowed rate of entry into the inactivated state. In addition to these effects on inactivation of open Na+channels, mutants F1651A, L1660A, and N1662A also impaired fast inactivation of closed Na+ channels, as assessed from measurements of the maximum open probability of single channels. The peptide KIFMK mimics the IFM motif of the inactivation gate and provides a test of the effect of mutations on the hydrophobic interaction of this motif with the inactivation gate receptor. KIFMK restores fast inactivation of open channels to the F1651A/L1660A mutant but does not restore fast inactivation of closed F1651A/L1660A channels, suggesting that these residues interact with the IFM motif during inactivation of closed channels. Our results implicate F1651, L1660, and N1662 of the IVS4-S5 loop in inactivation of both closed and open Na+ channels and suggest that the IFM motif of the inactivation gate interacts with F1651 and/or L1660 in the IVS4-S5 loop during inactivation of closed channels.

In neurons and muscle cells, activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels leads to inward Na+ current which initiates the action potential (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland MA1992Google Scholar). Within milliseconds after membrane depolarization, Na+ channels pass through a series of nonconducting closed states, enter an ion-conducting open state, and finally convert into a nonconducting inactivated state. Inactivated channels recover rapidly upon membrane repolarization and are thus available for reactivation by subsequent depolarizing stimuli. As inactivation exerts crucial control over Na+ channel activity, understanding the molecular basis of this process is an important step toward determining how Na+ channels function. Three subunits comprise the brain Na+ channel: α of 260 kDa, β1 of 36 kDa, and β2 of 33 kDa (2Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the α-subunit alone produces functional Na+ channels inXenopus laevis oocytes (3Goldin A.L. Snutch T. Lubbert H. Dowsett A. Marshall J. Auld V. Downey W. Fritz L.C. Lester H.A. Dunn R.

Nature. 1986; 322: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the β1- and β2-subunits yields Na+ channels with kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation more closely resembling those found in neurons (5Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Patton D.E.

Reber B.F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The α-subunit has four homologous domains (I-IV), each with six α-helical transmembrane domains (S1 through S6) (7Noda M. Ikeda T. Kayano T. Suzuki H. Takeshima H. Kurasaki M. Takahashi H. Numa S.

Neuron. 1988; 1: 449-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The S4 segments in each domain are thought to serve as voltage sensors, and the S5 and S6 segments and the short SS1-SS2 segments between them are thought to form the walls of the transmembrane pore (reviewed in Ref. 9Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Treatment of the intracellular surface of Na+ channels with proteolytic enzymes prevents inactivation, implicating cytoplasmic components of the Na+ channel in the inactivation process (10Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Rojas E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 11Armstrong C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 644-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Site-directed antibodies against the intracellular loop connecting domains III and IV (LIII-IV) block inactivation (12Vassilev P.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 241: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 13Vassilev P. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8147-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and expression of the α-subunit as two proteins cleaved in LIII-IV greatly slows inactivation (14Stühmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Mutations of a cluster of three hydrophobic residues within this loop-Ile1488, Phe1489, and Met1490(IFM)-prevents fast inactivation (15West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10910-10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) primarily by destabilizing the inactivated state of the channel (16Kellenberger S. West J.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Small peptides containing the IFM sequence are sufficient to restore fast inactivation to Na+ channels with mutations in LIII-IV, leading to the hypothesis that the IFM motif binds within the pore of the Na+ channel and blocks it during inactivation (17Eaholtz G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This model is supported by recent results showing that a cysteine residue substituted in the IFM motif becomes inaccessible to reaction with cysteine-specific reagents during the inactivation process (18Kellenberger S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30971-30979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This hypothesis for inactivation implies the presence of amino acid residues in the intracellular mouth of the pore of the Na+channel that are involved in conformational change(s) which couple activation to inactivation and bind the IFM motif in the inactivated state. For example, mutations of Phe1764 and Val1774 at the intracellular end of segment IVS6 strongly destabilize the inactivated state and increase the rate of recovery of the channel from inactivation (19McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although these studies define a region of the Na+ channel required for conformational coupling and formation of a stable inactivation gate receptor, it is unlikely that these residues are fully responsible for these functions. The S4-S5 intracellular loops in each Na+ channel domain are good candidates for a role in the fast inactivation process. They are located near the intracellular mouth of the pore and are thus ideally situated to form part of the receptor for the pore-blocking inactivation gate. In addition, they are directly connected to the S4 segments which serve as the voltage sensors of Na+ channels and move outward under the influence of the electric field to initiate channel activation (14Stühmer W.

The S4-S5 intracellular loop has been implicated in inactivation of Shaker K+ channels (22Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but its role in the inactivation of Na+ channels is unknown. In these experiments, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the role of residues in the S4-S5 loop of domain IV (IVS4-S5) of the rat brain type IIA Na+ channel using a combination of deletion/insertion and scanning mutagenesis, expression inXenopus oocytes, and analysis by whole cell and single-channel recording methods. Our results reveal several amino acid residues in IVS4-S5 which are required for fast Na+ channel inactivation. A preliminary report of these results has been published in abstract form (24McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): A318Google Scholar). All experimental procedures were performed as described (19McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In brief, mutants were created using oligo-directed mutagenesis in an M13mp18 construct containing a portion of the α-subunit of the rat brain IIa Na+ channel that included the IVS4-S5 intracellular loop. The full-length, mutant Na+ channel was produced by subcloning the mutant cassette into the full-length α-subunit in one of the following vectors: ZemRVSP6 (25West J.W. Scheuer T. Maechler L. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), pVA2580 (8Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Marshall J. Dunn J.M. Catterall W.A. Lester H.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Each vector contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter and the rest of the RIIa Na+ channel gene. mRNA was produced in vitro from these mutant constructs and then coinjected with β1-subunit mRNA into X. laevis oocytes for channel expression (19McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 50 nl of a 2:1 (w/w) mixture of rat brain Na+ channel β1 RNA and α-subunit RNA containing 5–50 ng/μl α-subunit RNA were injected. Injected oocytes were maintained for 2–5 days prior to electrophysiological recording. Two-microelectrode voltage clamp recording was used to record whole cell currents. Macropatch and single channel data were collected from cell-attached patches except for the excised macropatch experiments with the KIFMK peptide. Pulses were applied and data acquired using a personal computer-based data acquisition system (Basic-Fastlab, Indec Systems, Sunnyvale, CA). Single channel openings were detected using standard half-amplitude threshold analysis after filtering the data at 2 kHz and omitting overlapping events in multichannel patches (27Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum, New York1995: 483-587Google Scholar). Open times, closed times, and first latencies were analyzed using PSTAT software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Conductance (g) was calculated from peak current (I) during depolarizations asI/(V-V rev), where V was the test pulse potential and V rev was the reversal potential. Normalized conductance-voltage and inactivation curves were fit with a Boltzmann relationship, A/[1 + exp[(V-V½)/k)]] + (1 − A), where V½ is the voltage of half-maximal conductance, g½, or the voltage of half-maximal inactivation, h½, and A is the fraction of g or h that varies with voltage. To determine whether the IVS4-S5 region of the α-subunit has a role in the fast inactivation of rat brain type IIA Na+ channels, we examined the effects of one deletion and one insertion mutation in this region (Fig.1). WT 1The abbreviation used is: WT, wild type. or mutant α-subunit RNA was co-expressed with β1-subunit RNA in X.laevis oocytes, and Na+ currents were analyzed via two-microelectrode voltage clamp recording as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Deletion Δ4Na45, which deletes the Leu, Met, Met, and Ser residues in positions 1653–1656, and insertion I4Na45, which inserts four alanine residues between Met1654and Met1655, both disrupt fast inactivation. Upon depolarization, the WT Na+ channels rapidly activate and then inactivate within a few milliseconds (Fig. 1). In contrast, I4Na45 channels inactivate very slowly, and both these and Δ4Na45 channels inactivate incompletely during the pulse, leaving a sustained current at the end of the 30-ms depolarization. These results implicate IVS4-S5 in the inactivation process. The S4-S5 loop contains four Leu and Ile residues spaced at seven-residue intervals (8Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Marshall J.

Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). A similar repeat in the Shaker K+ channel S4-S5 loop plays a role in voltage-dependent gating (30McCormack K. Tanouye M.A. Iverson L.E. Lin J.W. Ramaswami M. McCormack T. Campanelli J.T. Mathew M.K. Rudy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The double mutations L1639A/I1646A and L1653A/L1660A each disrupt half of this heptad leucine repeat. As observed for the deletion mutation Δ4Na45, both L1639A/I1646A and L1653A/L1660A channels inactivate incompletely during the pulse, and a substantial sustained current remains at the end of the 30-ms depolarization (Fig. 1). Evidently, the integrity of the leucine heptad motif is essential for normal fast inactivation. To examine the role of individual amino acid residues in the IVS4-S5 segment in fast inactivation, we substituted each amino acid in this region (Scheme 1) with alanine except for the charged residues in this region which were mutated to glutamine. Substitution of alanine residues is expected to alter the chemical characteristics of each residue without causing substantial conformational change because alanine is found with high frequency in both α-helices and β-sheets and has limited hydrophobic and hydrophilic character (31Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, 32Zhang X.J. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W.

While most of these mutations had no effect on Na+ channel function, four of them caused slow and/or incomplete inactivation during depolarizing test pulses to −10 mV in two-microelectrode voltage clamp. L1639A had slowed inactivation, L1660A had incomplete inactivation, and F1651A had both dramatically slowed and incomplete inactivation (Fig.2 A). No inactivation could be observed during 30-ms test pulses with the N1662A mutant (Fig.2 A). The double mutant combination of F1651A and L1660A also completely prevented inactivation (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that the transition between the open state and the inactivated state and/or the stability of the inactivated state is impaired by these mutations. For the single mutants which retained significant inactivation, we also measured the voltage dependence of inactivation during 100-ms prepulses to a range of negative membrane potentials (Fig. 2 B). This protocol measures primarily inactivation from closed states which are predominant at potentials more negative than −20 mV. For WT channels, 100-ms prepulses to potentials more positive than −30 mV cause nearly complete inactivation, leaving only 3 ± 0.3% noninactivating current. The L1639A mutant also is nearly completely inactivated at positive voltages, although its voltage dependence of inactivation is shifted to more positive potentials (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the steady state inactivation curves for F1651A and L1660A approach non-zero asymptotes of 18 ± 1% and 29 ± 4%, respectively (Fig. 2 B), indicating that inactivation is incomplete at positive potentials for these mutants as expected from their large sustained currents at the end of depolarizing test pulses (Fig.2 A). These inactivation curves also reveal that the voltage dependence of inactivation is shifted to more positive membrane potentials for F1651A and L1660A (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with the positively shifted inactivation curves, recovery from inactivation at negative membrane potentials was accelerated in these mutants (Fig.2 C). Thus, these mutations have important effects on inactivation from both open and closed states. Although these selected mutations had large effects on Na+channel inactivation, most of the mutations of amino acid residues in IVS4-S5 had little or no effect. The relative effects of all of the scanning mutations on the fraction of noninactivating Na+current at the end of the test pulse are illustrated in Fig.3 A. Of 26 single residue mutations analyzed, only 3 caused a significant increase in the fraction of noninactivating current. Evidently, the effects of the mutations at positions 1651, 1660, and 1662 on the fraction of noninactivating current are highly specific, suggesting that these residues have an important role in determining the stability of the inactivated state. Although the mutations in IVS4-S5 caused large and specific effects on the rate and extent of inactivation, their effects on the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation were smaller and less specific (Fig. 3, B and C). Of the IVS4-S5 mutations discussed above, only N1662A caused a large (+12 mV) shift in the potential for half-maximal activation. As illustrated in Fig.2 B, the L1639A, F1651A, and L1660A mutants each had small positive shifts in the half-maximal steady state inactivation curves of 8, 9, and 5 mV, respectively. Other mutations in the IVS4-S5 loop affected the voltage dependence of steady state activation or inactivation without producing sustained or slowly decaying Na+ currents (Fig. 3, B and C). The mutant with the most dramatic effect (S1656A) had a large negative shift of 14 mV in both the steady state activation and inactivation curves, but no effect on the rate or extent of inactivation during test pulses. The results show that the effects on the kinetics and extent of fast inactivation observed for L1639A, F1651A, L1660A, and N1662A are not secondary to changes in the voltage dependence of channel gating. In contrast to the mutants that disrupted inactivation, mutation of 3 residues at the COOH terminus of this region enhanced closed state inactivation as revealed by large negative shifts in steady state inactivation curves (I1663A, G1664A, and L1666A; Fig. 3 C). Mutant G1664A differed from the other two mutants in that activation (Fig. 3 B) and inactivation (Fig. 3 C) are shifted to similar extents compared with WT and recovery from inactivation (Fig. 2 C) was indistinguishable from WT. Because inactivation is coupled to activation, the negative shifts inh½ for G1664A and S1656A are probably secondary to negative shifts in activation. In contrast, the shifts of inactivation curves for mutants I1663A and L1666A occurred without concomitant shifts in the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 3 B), suggesting a specific effect on inactivation. In addition, recovery from inactivation was greatly slowed in these two mutants (Fig.2 C). Thus, inactivation of closed Na+ channels is stabilized in mutants I1663A and L1666A in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the IVS4-S5 loop. To examine the inactivation properties of selected IVS4-S5 mutants in more detail, we recorded macroscopic currents from cell-attached macropatches. Recordings from macropatches give better time resolution and voltage control than two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings. Fig.4 A shows typical records obtained during depolarizations to +20 mV. At this voltage, activation is fast relative to inactivation, so the decay of currents reflects mainly the rate of channel inactivation from the open state (35Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1983; 306: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 36Aldrich R.W. Stevens C.F. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 418-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants L1639A, F1651A, and L1660A all inactivate more slowly than WT, and all cause a detectable level of noninactivating Na+current at the end of the 11-ms test pulse (Fig. 4 A). The alterations of the Na+ currents conducted by mutant and WT channels are similar in the macropatch and two-microelectrode voltage clamp measurements, except that a small noninactivating current is observed in the macropatch recordings for L1639A. We could detect no N1662A current in macropatches, consistent with the relatively poor expression of this mutant observed in two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings. Comparison of the Na+ current records during test pulses to potentials from −40 to +40 mV showed substantial impairment of inactivation of L1639A, F1651A, and L1660A at a wide range of potentials (Fig. 4, C-E) compared with WT (Fig.4 B). At potentials more positive than 0 mV at which most Na+ channels are fully activated, the impairment of inactivation increased with depolarization, as illustrated by the increased fraction of noninactivating current at the end of the test pulse (Fig. 4 F). These results imply that the stability of the inactivated state is progressively impaired with increasing depolarization in these mutant channels. Each of the IVS4-S5 mutants having impaired inactivation was analyzed by single-channel recording methods as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Na+ channel gating can be described simply by the reaction pathway illustrated in SchemeFS2 (16Kellenberger S. West J.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F.

Upon depolarization, Na+ channels undergo voltage-dependent transitions through multiple closed states (states C n through C0), open (state O), and then inactivate (state I). The inactivated state can be reached from the open state and also from one or more closed states. For WT Na+ channels, inactivation is essentially irreversible at depolarized potentials, indicating that the O-I transition strongly favors inactivation at those potentials. In response to 40-ms depolarizations to −20 mV, WT Na+channels generally opened once or twice at the beginning of the depolarization and then inactivated and did not reopen (Fig.5 A). Most depolarizations of mutant L1639A channels showed similar behavior to WT (Fig. 5 B, top trace). However, occasionally one channel in a multichannel patch generated sustained bursts of openings and had delayed inactivation (Fig. 5 B, bottom trace). In contrast, nearly all F1651A channels had long openings and an increased frequency of reopenings relative to WT (Fig. 5 C). L1660A channels had short openings like WT, but had a high frequency of reopenings throughout the depolarizing pulse (Fig. 5 D). The ensemble currents for these mutants recreated the slow decay and significant level of non-inactivating current observed in macropatch recordings (Fig. 5, B, C, and D, bottom traces). Patches containing the N1662A mutant channel were rare due to its low expression at the whole cell level; therefore, we used large patches suitable for macropatch recording to obtain single channel data. The openings of the N1662A mutant channels are long, and reopenings occur at a high frequency for this mutant relative to WT (Fig.5 E). The ensemble average currents show no appreciable inactivation during the test pulses, as observed in two-microelectrode voltage clamp recordings of this mutant channel. Total channel activity can be estimated as the integrated probability (P o) of opening for the duration of the 40-ms depolarizing sweeps. The value of P o for the WT channels is low, <0.5%. For each of the three IVS4-S5 mutants with substantial noninactivating current, the P o was higher than WT: F1651A, 11.2%; L1660A, 8.4%; and N1662A, 57.0%. Thus, this quantitative measure of increased channel activity also shows the substantial impairment of inactivation in these mutants. No significant effects on the single channel conductance were observed for any of the IVS4-S5 mutants. The WT single channel current at −20 mV was 1.05 ± 0.005 pA. The single channel currents for the F1651A, L1660A, and N1662A mutants were: 1.1 ± 0.06 pA, 1.03 ± 0.04 pA, and 1.06 ± 0.06 pA, respectively. Many depolarizations of single Na+channels produce “null” sweeps containing no single channel activity (35Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F.

This behavior results from direct inactivation of the single channel from a closed state (Scheme FS2) (19McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

We have disrupted myosin light chain 2v gene in mice and monitored in vivo cardiac function in living myosin light chain 2v −/− embryos. The mutant embryos die at approximately embryonic day 12.5. In mutant ventricles, the myosin light chain 2a protein level is increased and reaches levels comparable to the myosin light chain 2v in the ventricles of wild type littermates and is appropriately incorporated into the thick filaments of mutant embryonic hearts. However, despite the substitution of myosin light chain 2a, ultrastructural analysis revealed defects in sarcomeric assembly and an embryonic form of dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in mutant embryos compared with wild type littermates. We conclude that myosin light chain 2v may have a unique function in the maintenance of cardiac contractility and ventricular chamber morphogenesis during mammalian cardiogenesis and that a chamber-specific combinatorial code for sarcomeric assembly may exist that ultimately requires myosin light chain 2v in ventricular muscle cells.

The phosphorylation of a single serine residue (Ser-19) of smooth muscle MLC-2 is the switch for turning on the actin-activated myosin ATPase and hence, contraction. However, the acto-myosin interaction in vertebrate striated muscle is mainly regulated through the troponin-tropomyosin complex, and MLC-2 is thought to have only a modulatory effect (5Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown in anin vitro motility assay that removal of MLC-2 from myosin markedly reduces actin filament sliding velocity without significantly reducing myosin ATPase activity (6Lowey S.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the precise in vivo physiological function of myosin light chains in vertebrate striated muscle is unclear. Furthermore, there is no direct evidence that the highly conserved structure of individual MLC-2 isoforms reflects a unique functional requirement in distinct muscle cell types. Recently, alterations in MLC-2 expression have been correlated with the onset of cardiac morphogenetic defects during embryogenesis (9Sucov H.M. Dyson E. Gumeringer C.L. Price J. Chien K.R.

Our efforts have been directed toward understanding the biological and physiological roles of the MLC-2v, which is the ventricular isoform of MLC-2, by disrupting the gene through homologous recombination in mice. A 12-kilobase genomic mlc-2vfragment was isolated from a mouse 129svj genomic DNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla). PCR-based mutagenesis was used to convert the 1.4-kilobase pair fragment between three base pairs 5′ of translational start codon ATG and intron 2 BamHI site into anXhoI site (see Fig. 1 a). The deleted 1.4-kilobase fragment contained part of exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and part of intron 2. Cre recombinase cDNA (15Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K.

Mice pregnant at E11.5 and 12.5 were intraperitoneally anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg), the trachea was intubated, and ventilation was provided with a respirator. Fetuses were visualized using intravital microscopy (11Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P.

In brief, each embryo was delivered individually from the uterus with the umbilical circulation intact, placed on a heated stage with superfusion, and imaged by transillumination. The left ventricular chamber area (including the left ventricular wall, which is thin at this age) and the chamber long axis were measured using NIH IMAGE software. Left ventricular (LV) elliptical volumes were then calculated using the single plane area-length method (25Sandler H. Dodge H.T. Am. Heart J. 1968; 75: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The LV ejection fraction was calculated as (LVEDV − LVESV)/LVEDV, where LVEDV is the left ventricular end diastolic volume and LVESV is the end systolic volume. The riboprobes for RNase protection assays were generated as described previously (26Gruber P.J. Kubalak S.W. Pexieder T. Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Chien K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1332-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Ventricular samples were dissected from individual day 12 embryonic hearts, and RNase protection assays were performed per manufacturer recommendations using the Direct Protect Lysate Ribonuclease protection assay kit from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Themlc-2v gene targeting construct is depicted in Fig.1. The linearized targeting construct was electroporated into J1 ES cells, and the cells were selected with G418. Of a total of 47 colonies screened, 3 were identified as homologous recombinants by Southern blot hybridization analysis of genomic ES cell DNA. Two of the three colonies were injected into C57BL/B6 blastocysts, both resulting in the generation of chimeras, one of which displayed germ-line transmission. Heterozygous (MLC-2v+/−) offspring appeared normal in all respects and were crossed to generate MLC-2v homozygote (MLC-2v −/−) mice. Southern blot and PCR analyses were used to genotype offspring (Fig. 1, b and c). The absence of MLC-2v proteins in MLC-2v −/− embryos was confirmed by Western blot analysis, utilizing a polyclonal anti-MLC-2v antibody (Fig.1 d). No viable MLC-2v −/− offspring were obtained in litters from MLC-2v +/− intercrosses (TableI), indicating that the MLC-2v −/− null mutation was embryonic lethal. To investigate the timing of the lethality, mice from E9.5 to 13.5 were genotyped. All of the MLC-2v −/− mutants were viable at E11.5; however, 30% of MLC-2v −/− mutants lost viability by E12.5, and all MLC-2v −/− died by E13.5 (Table I), thereby indicating that the MLC-2v −/−embryos die at approximately E12.5.Table IOffspring of MLC-2v heterozygous crossesStagesLitters+/++/−−/−days post-coitum9.53514710.5614221011.51224482812.5388216874 (22)13.55132510 (10)New born1228610 Open table in a new tab All MLC-2v −/− embryos that died just before dissection displayed massive cardiac enlargement, wall thinning, chamber dilation, and pleural effusions. Histologic examination revealed hepatic congestion and an engorged vena cava consistent with congestive heart failure (data not shown). No significant abnormalities in other organs were found. Analysis of global cardiac function revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction of MLC-2v −/− embryos averaged 33%, which was significantly reduced when compared with wild type and heterozygous littermates at E11.5 (46%, 49%) and at E12.5 (50%, 53%) (Fig.2 a). Left ventricular end diastolic volumes were similar among the three groups at E11.5, but by E12.5, were significantly elevated in MLC-2v −/− embryos (Fig.2 b). Collectively, these results suggest that global cardiac function is already severely impaired by E11.5 in MLC-2v −/− embryos and that cardiac dysfunction results in progressive embryonic heart failure around E12.5. The resulting phenotype is similar to mid-gestational embryonic heart failure seen in a wide variety of other gene-targeted murine embryos (14Fishman M.C. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 2099-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis of comparable areas from the left ventricular free walls of wild type and mutant mice revealed abnormalities in sarcomeric assembly in the MLC-2v −/− embryos (Fig.3). Myocytes from E12.5 MLC-2v −/− embryonic hearts displayed prominent interruptions and myofibrillar disorganization of the normal parallel alignment of thick and thin filaments (Fig. 3, b and c). Additionally, total fiber width was narrower within mutant ventricular myocytes, and overall distances between Z-bands was greater than in wild type specimens. There were also several areas in mutant hearts where the organization and alignment of Z-bands between sarcomeres was not conserved (Fig. 3 c). These observations could also be observed in ventricular samples from younger MLC-2v −/− embryos (E10.5 and E11.5) during earlier stages of myofibrillogenesis (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that there is a selective requirement for MLC-2v in the normal development of ventricular cardiac myocyte structure and function. The observed disruption of myofibrillar organization in the absence of MLC-2v leads to reduced myocyte contractility and cardiac function that results in death at approximately E12.5 and suggests a specific requirement of MLC-2v in the interaction between thick and thin filaments during sarcomere assembly. In this regard, in vitro motility assays have previously shown that removal of MLC-2 reduces actin filament sliding velocity by about 63% without significantly reducing the myosin ATPase activity (6Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Lowey S. Trybus K.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 120-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that MLC-2 can act to stiffen the myosin neck (3Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 4Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). If each head of the thick filament is responsible for the arrangement of proper hexagonal packing of the thick filament and thin filament during myogenesis, then the disorganized and improperly functioning myosin head due to the lack of MLC-2v would result in improper packing and organization of thick and thin filaments during cardiac sarcomere assembly. Two different myosin light chain 2 genes, mlc-2v andmlc-2a, are abundantly expressed in the ventricular chamber at early stages of murine cardiogenesis, raising the issue as to whether there is a unique role for MLC-2v versus MLC-2a during the maintenance of heart function and morphogenesis.mlc-2v is initially expressed at about E8 and continues to be restricted to the ventricular chamber throughout embryonic development and into adulthood (27O'Brien T.X. Lee K.J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5157-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Ross R.S. Navankasattusas S. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1996; 122: 1799-1809PubMed Google Scholar). The expression ofmlc-2a is uniform in the E8 linear heart tube and then becomes down-regulated at the RNA level in the ventricular chamber by E12.5 (29Kubalak S.W. Miller-Hance W.C. O'Brien T.X. Dyson E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16961-16970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether MLC-2a can compensate for MLC-2v in mutant embryos, we examined MLC-2a mRNA and protein levels in MLC-2v −/− embryos at E12. Although there were no significant differences in the MLC-2a mRNA levels between wild type and MLC-2v −/− embryos (Fig. 4 a), Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 b) demonstrated that MLC-2a protein content in the ventricular chamber was dramatically increased in both total cellular protein and myofibril protein extracts of these embryos. A quantitative study of myofilament proteins isolated from E12 embryonic ventricles indicated that levels of MLC-2a protein in MLC-2v −/− ventricles were comparable to the MLC-2v protein levels in wild type litter mates (Fig. 4 c). This result is consistent with the findings in a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of cardiac MLC-2v does not result in an increase in ventricular MLC-2v protein levels despite a significantly higher level of MLC-2v mRNA in these transgenic mice (30Palermo K. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In both cases, the MLC-2 protein level appears to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Thus, the current study indicates that during early stages of cardiac chamber development, MLC-2a protein levels increase in the ventricles of mutant animals, implying that MLC-2a may partially replace MLC-2v in the developing ventricular myocyte. In this regard, immunohistochemical analysis by confocal microscopy of MLC-2a expression in MLC-2v −/− embryos demonstrated that MLC-2a protein was indeed elevated in the ventricles of mutant embryos (Fig. 4 g) and incorporated into nascent myofibrils (Fig. 4 i). However, MLC-2a cannot completely compensate for the deficiency of MLC-2v, as shown by the lack of sarcomeric structure (Fig. 3) and depressed cardiac contractility (Fig. 2). We conclude that there is an important qualitative difference between MLC-2v and MLC-2a proteins, reflecting a unique requirement for MLC-2v during functional maturation of the ventricular chamber, thereby underscoring the potential importance of MLC-2 in the in vivo regulation of cardiac contractility. Furthermore, these studies provide the first direct evidence that alterations in MLC-2v can directly lead to overt heart failure, which will become of interest to explore in the post-natal setting of the adult heart.

https://openalex.org/W2042786900,"To study transporters involved in regulating intracellular Ca2+, we isolated a full-length cDNA encoding a Ca2+-ATPase from a model plant,Arabidopsis, and named it ACA2( A rabidopsis Ca2+-ATPase, isoform2). ACA2p is most similar to a “plasma membrane-type” Ca2+-ATPase, but is smaller (110 kDa), contains a unique N-terminal domain, and is missing a long C-terminal calmodulin-binding regulatory domain. In addition, ACA2p is localized to an endomembrane system and not the plasma membrane, as shown by aqueous-two phase fractionation of microsomal membranes. ACA2p was expressed in yeast as both a full-length protein (ACA2-1p) and an N-terminal truncation mutant (ACA2-2p; Δ residues 2–80). Only the truncation mutant restored the growth on Ca2+-depleted medium of a yeast mutant defective in both endogenous Ca2+ pumps, PMR1 and PMC1. Although basal Ca2+-ATPase activity of the full-length protein was low, it was stimulated 5-fold by calmodulin (50% activation around 30 nm). In contrast, the truncated pump was fully active and insensitive to calmodulin. A calmodulin-binding sequence was identified within the first 36 residues of the N-terminal domain, as shown by calmodulin gel overlays on fusion proteins. Thus, ACA2 encodes a novel calmodulin-regulated Ca2+-ATPase distinguished by a unique N-terminal regulatory domain and a non-plasma membrane localization.

Calcium (Ca2+) appears to function as an important second messenger in all eukaryotes (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar, 2Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also plays an important role in regulating the processing of proteins in the secretory pathway (3Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.I. Moir D.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 133-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 4Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, cells require transport systems to carefully regulate Ca2+ concentrations in different cellular compartments. In plants, high affinity Ca2+-translocating ATPases are thought to function in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, tonoplast, plastid inner membrane, and plasma membrane (5Hwang I. Ratterman D.M. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Gilroy S. Trewavas T. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 677-682Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Evans D.E.

In addition, plants have low affinity Ca2+/H+ antiporters (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, little is known at the molecular level about the genes which encode different Ca2+ transporters, or the specific functions of different Ca2+-transport pathways. Ca2+ pumps are members of a large superfamily of P-type ATPases and have been classified as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TEV, tobacco etch virus; GFP, green fluorescence protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SC-URA, synthetic medium minus uracil; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TEV, tobacco etch virus; GFP, green fluorescence protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SC-URA, synthetic medium minus uracil; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. or plasma membrane (PM)-type Ca2+-ATPases (type IIA and IIB, respectively), based on enzymes first identified in animal systems (10Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In plants,ECA1/ACA3 was the first cloned ER-type pump to be shown to have a localization and enzymatic activity analogous to an animal homolog (11Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). At present only two plant genes encoding homologs of “PM-type” Ca2+-ATPases have been identified,ACA1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (12Huang L. Berkelman T. Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10066-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) andBCA1 from Brassica oleracea (13Malmstrom S. Askerlund P. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these plant pumps differ from animal homologs not only in subcellular localization, but also in their structural arrangement. ACA1p is thought to be targeted to a plastid inner membrane (12Huang L. Berkelman T. Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10066-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), while BCA1p appears to be localized to the tonoplast (13Malmstrom S. Askerlund P. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of ACA1p has not been investigated. However, BCA1 appears to encode a calmodulin-stimulated Ca2+ pump, based on correspondence between the peptide sequence obtained from a Ca2+-ATPase preparation and the predicted sequence of BCA1p (13Malmstrom S. Askerlund P. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Askerlund P. Evans D.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 110: 1670-1681Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A notable feature of both ACA1p and BCA1p is the absence of a long C-terminal regulatory domain, which is required for calmodulin activation in a typical PM-type Ca2+-ATPase (15Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2115-2118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ishii T. Takeyasu K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The structural divergence of these pumps raises two important questions: 1) does calmodulin still regulate members of this subfamily, and 2) how does calmodulin activation occur without a C-terminal calmodulin binding regulatory domain? Here we report the predicted primary structure for ACA2p, a Ca2+-ATPase most similar to ACA1p and BCA1p. We provide direct evidence that ACA2-like pumps constitute a novel subfamily of calmodulin-regulated Ca2+-ATPases, distinguished by a unique N-terminal regulatory domain and their presence in non-plasma membrane locations. ACA2p is the first homolog of this family to be functionally expressed in yeast. We show that a truncation of the N-terminal domain results in a constitutively active pump that can complement a yeast strain harboring a disruption of its endogenous Ca2+ pumps. These biochemical and genetic studies are significant for two reasons. First, they show that P-type ATPases can be regulated by autoinhibitors at either the N- or C-terminal end. Second, they establish a yeast expression system to genetically dissect the autoinhibitory mechanism of a calmodulin-regulated P-type ATPase. A. thaliana Columbia was used for plant material. DNA cloning was done in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) or DH10α (a derivative of DH5α, Stratagene). Unless otherwise noted, standard molecular techniques were performed according to Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A λ-Zap (Stratagene)-based cDNA library constructed from A. thaliana 3-day-old seedlings (18Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckmann H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was screened under moderate stringency (19Harper J.F. Manney L. DeWitt N.D Yoo M.H. Sussman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a genomic fragment of ACA2 as a hybridization probe. This genomic fragment was generated by PCR using degenerate DNA oligomers (see “Results”). The “PEGL” 20-mer primer had the sequence dGC(G/C/T)GT(G//C/T)CC(G/C/T)GAGGG(G/C/T)(C/T)T(G/C/T)CC. One full-length cDNA was identified after screening approximately 100,000 phage. The insert was subcloned into the vector pBlueScript II SK(−) and named pACA2. Standard PCR reactions and subcloning procedures were used to modify ACA2 sequences in clones described below. PCR was performed using Ampli-Taq (Perkin-Elmer) or PanVera X-Taq (PanVera Corporation) for 15 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. All PCR-derived sequences were sequenced to ensure the absence of PCR mistakes. pACA2-wt encodes a full-length ACA2p and was derived from pACA2 by deletion of the 5′-untranslated region. The resulting sequence at the 5′ end is GTC GAC ATG (SalI underlined, followed by the codon for M1). Two restriction sites were also introduced as silent mutations in the coding region: CTT CG AAA CC TAT GAA GCC GCG GCG (BstBI and SacII underlined) corresponding to the peptide sequence LSKRYEAAA-52. pACA2-ΔP80 encodes an N-terminally truncated ACA2p and was derived from pACA2 by a deletion of DNA sequence corresponding to residues 2–80. The resulting sequence at the 5′ end is GTC GAC ATG AGT (SalI underlined, followed by codons for M1 and “S81”). pYX112-TEV was derived from pYX112 (Novagen) by the insertion into theEcoRI/BamHI site of a 5′-untranslated sequence from tobacco etch virus (TEV) (20Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the polylinker is shown in Fig. 1. pYX-ACA2-1 encodes a full-length ACA2p and was subcloned from pACA2-wt as a SalI/XbaI fragment into theXhoI/NheI site of pYX112-TEV. pYX-ACA2-2 encodes an N-terminal deletion of ACA2 and was subcloned from pACA2-ΔP80 as a SalI/XbaI fragment into the XhoI/NheI of pYX112-TEV. pMC2(1–72) encodes the first 72 residues of ACA2p as a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein. It was constructed by the insertion of a PCR fragment into the SalI/PstI site of the vector pMAL-CR1 (New England Biolabs). pGC2(1–58) encodes the first 58 residues of ACA2p as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase at the N-terminal end and a green fluorescence protein (GFP)/6 × histidine tag at the C-terminal end. It was constructed in the vector pGEX-KG (21Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) as aSalI/HindIII insert. The sequence at the fusion site between ACA2 and GFP is CAG GCC GCA GAT CTA AAG ATG (first codon = Gln58 from ACA2, BglII site underlined, last codon = M1 from GFP). The sequence at the 3′ end of the GFP reads ATG GAT GAA CTA GAC CCG GGA ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC GGA TCC TGA coding for mdelDPGMHHHHHHGS* (GFP sequence shown in italic lowercase letters). All deletion clones, pGC2(1–9) to pGC2(1–58) were made by an ExoIII nuclease deletion using the parent clone pGFP-ACA2-NL-1 (not described). pGL10 encodes residues Val119–Phe161 of ACA2p as a fusion with an N-terminal maltose binding protein and a C-terminal end 6 × histidine tag (Phe161-PGMHHHHHHGS* encoded by the DNA sequence TTC CCG GGA ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC GGA TCC TGA). It was constructed from a PCR-amplified fragment cloned into a modified version of vector pMAL-CR1. The insert can be subcloned as aSalI/PstI fragment. pACA2-Ns encodes the same sequence (Val119–Phe161) encoded by pGL10, except that it has an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) affinity tag instead of maltose-binding protein (MBP). It was derived by subcloning the SalI/PstI fragment from pGL10 into the XhoI/PstI site of pGEX-KG (ampicillin resistance gene was reformed). DNA sequencing was done in the Scripps Biochemistry Core Facility using an automated ABI Prism373XL sequencer. All cDNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing both strands. Fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli DH10α. Fusion proteins constructed as an affinity sandwich with an N-terminal GST or MBP tag and a C-terminal 6 × histidine tag were purified by sequential affinity purification for the 6 × histidine tag then GST or MBP (22Harper J.F. Huang J.F. Lloyd S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7267-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Purifications based on single affinity tag selections were done with minor modifications of standard procedures (New England Biolabs and Invitrogen). Anti-ACA2 (number 1471) rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced at the Scripps Animal Resource Facility. Anti-ACA2 was raised against a fusion protein, encoded by the plasmid pACA2-Ns, containing residues Val119–Phe161. Purified fusion protein samples were injected into New Zealand White rabbits with RIBI adjuvant as recommended by the manufacturer (RIBI ImmunoChem Research). In some cases affinity-purified antibodies were used. Serum was first precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate and redissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-GST antibodies were removed using a column with GST-coupled protein. Anti-ACA2 antibodies were then allowed to bind to a column containing the fusion protein encoded by pACA2-Ns. Columns were made using cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B according to manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Anti-ACA2 antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Control preimmune serum was purified over a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma). Leaves, flowers, and siliques were obtained from soil-grown plants grown in a growth room at 22 °C. Roots were obtained from 3-week-old plants grown in liquid culture consisting of Gamborg's B5 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2% sucrose and 0.5% (w/v) MES, pH 5.7. Cultures were grown on a shaker at approximately 125 rpm under constant illumination at 22 °C. Tissue samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, and total protein was extracted in homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 35 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The protein extract was clarified by a 5-min centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Plant microsomal membranes were prepared by modifications of a previously described procedure (23Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All manipulations were conducted on ice or in a cold room, with prechilled buffers. Membranes were prepared from roots of plants grown in liquid culture. Roots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized with mortar and pestle or ground with dry ice in a coffee grinder. Pulverized tissues were mixed with an equal weight of extraction buffer (290 mm sucrose, 25 mm EDTA, 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 76 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Homogenates were filtered through cheesecloth to remove large debris and then centrifuged at 5,000 × g to remove intact organelles and cell walls. Supernatants were spun at greater than 40,000 × g for at least 40 min to pellet microsomal membranes. The resulting supernatants were used as the soluble protein fraction. Membrane pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.33 msucrose, 4 mm KCl, 5 mm KHPO4, pH 7.8). Plasma membranes were partially purified by aqueous two-phase partitioning (24Schaller G.E. DeWitt N.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each fractionation was conducted with 5–10 g of fresh weight tissue (liquid-grown plants) with yields around 75 μg of upper phase membrane protein. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) assays using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For SDS-PAGE, samples were mixed with 3 × loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.7% (w/v) SDS, 5% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) sucrose or glycerol, 0.3% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. Transfer buffer consisted of 192 mmglycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.02% (w/v) SDS. Blots were blocked for at least 2 h in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Tween-20 (TBS-T) with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk. Primary antisera were normally diluted in blocking buffer at the following concentrations: anti-ACA2 at 1:1000 and anti-CTF2 (26DeWitt N.D. Hong B. Sussman M.R. Harper J.F. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) at 1:5000. The secondary antibody used for immunodetection was a donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.), and was diluted at 1:5000 in blocking buffer. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were for 1 h at room temperature, and were followed by four 15-min washes in TBS-T. Secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and exposure to x-ray film. Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrains used for complementation studies were W303-1A (MAT a , leu2, his3, ade2, ura3) and K616 (MAT a pmr1::HIS3 pmc1::TRP1 cnb1::LEU2, ura3) (27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). For protein expression and ATPase assays we used strain G19 (MATα ura3, his3, leu2, trp1, ade2, ena1Δ::His3::ena4Δ) (28Quintero F.J. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar) (generously provided by A. Rodriguez-Navarro and J. Schroeder). For transformations W303-1A and K616 were grown in standard YPD media supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2 for K616 cells; G19 cells were grown in synthetic medium minus histidine. Yeast were transformed with either pYX112 vector alone, pYX-ACA2-1, or pYX-ACA2-2 by the LiOAc/PEG methods (29Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 186-187Google Scholar, 30Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar) and selected for uracil prototrophy by plating on synthetic medium minus uracil (SC-URA): 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2 g/liter of drop-out mix without uracil, 2% glucose or sucrose as a carbon source, and 1.5% agar (31Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The Ura+ colonies were picked and grown for 2–3 days on SC-URA agar plates. For complementation studies, colonies were streaked again on SC-URA agar plates containing 10 mm EGTA, pH 6.0, and incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C as described previously (11Liang F. Cunningham K.W.

Yeast cells were homogenized and fractionated on a continuous gradient of 20–60% sucrose with modifications of Villalba et al. (32Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 500-ml culture of yeast was grown to late log phase with shaking at 30 °C, harvested, washed with cold H2O, and processed for a single sucrose gradient. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C until use. ATPase assays were conducted with modifications of Baginsky et al. (33Baginsky E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 15: 155-158Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Samples (10–15 μl) were assayed at 22 °C in a buffer of 20 mm MOPS, 8 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KNO3, 0.25 mm K2MoO4, 5 mmNaN3, and 1 mm EGTA (to chelate free Ca2+). Ca2+ stimulation was tested by the addition of 1.1 mm CaCl2. Vanadate was added to some reactions at 0.1 mm. Calmodulin (bovine brain or spinach) was obtained from Sigma. ACA2 was identified as a full-length cDNA in a λ-Zap-based cDNA library (18Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckmann H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and subcloned as a plasmid pACA2 (Fig. 2). To identify this cDNA we used a partial genomic fragment ofACA2 as a hybridization probe. This genomic fragment was obtained by two sequential rounds of PCR amplification (i.e.nested PCR) using degenerate primers. In both reactions the 3′ primer corresponded to a sequence conserved in all P-type ATPases (MTGDGVNDA) (primer number 1025) (34Harper J.F. Manney L. Sussman M.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 572-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the first reaction the 5′ primer (PEGL) corresponded to a sequence conserved in Na+ and Ca2+ pumps (A(I/V)PEGLP). In the second reaction we used a nested 5′ primer corresponding to a more generally conserved sequence (CSDKTGTLT) (34Harper J.F. Manney L. Sussman M.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 572-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A critical feature of our strategy was the PEGL primer which biased reactions into amplifying putative Ca2+ pumps. Without such a bias, the primary reaction products were fragments of proton pump genes, perhaps reflecting the large size of this gene family in Arabidopsis (34Harper J.F. Manney L. Sussman M.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 572-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows the predicted 110-kDa protein encoded by ACA2. The cDNA sequence contained a single long open reading frame with an in-frame stop codon upstream of the predicted start codon. ACA2p shows greatest identity to a subfamily of PM-type Ca2+-ATPases, including ACA1p/PEA1p fromArabidopsis (12Huang L. Berkelman T. Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10066-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (78% identity), BCA1p fromBrassica (13Malmstrom S. Askerlund P. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (62% identity) (shown aligned in Fig. 3). ACA2p shows approximately 44% identity to a mammalian PM-type Ca2+-ATPase, but less than 32% identity to ER-type Ca2+-ATPases, including the rabbit SERCA1p (35Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) orArabidopsis ACA3p/ECA1p (11Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Ten transmembrane domains are predicted for ACA2p based on programs predicting hydropathy and topology (Predict Protein and PSORT programs) (36Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 37Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal ends of ACA2p are predicted on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, the N-terminal domain contains an additional 19-residue hydrophobic segment from Ile63 to Ser82, which may provide an 11th transmembrane domain. The C-terminal end does not show a putative ER retention motif (KXKXX) (38Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 39Townsley F.M. Pelham H.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar) as seen for the plant ER-type Ca2+-ATPases. In comparison to animal homologs the most distinct feature of ACA2p is the absence of a long C-terminal regulatory domain. Instead, there is a unique, relatively long N-terminal domain of 160 residues, compared with 94 residues for a typical mammalian pump (e.g. hPMCA2p) (40Heim R. Hug M. Iwata T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is possible to align ACA2p with hPMCA2p starting around position Glu87, but the identity up to the first transmembrane remains poor (22%). To determine the relative tissue distribution of ACA2p, we produced a polyclonal antibody (anti-ACA2) against a 43-residue sequence in the N-terminal domain (Val119–Phe161). This region shows high variability, with only 56% identity to ACA1p. This variable region was used in hopes of generating an isoform specific antibody. Fig. 4 shows a Western blot analysis of total proteins extracted from different tissues. Anti-ACA2 specifically detected a 110-kDa protein, most abundant in roots and flowers. Cross-reaction of anti-ACA2 with other Arabidopsis isoforms (e.g. ACA1p) has not been tested. However, no cross-reaction was observed with proteins extracted from tobacco or onions (data not shown), suggesting that this antiserum is highly specific. To test the hypothesis that ACA2p is a plasma membrane pump, we fractionated microsomal membranes by an aqueous two-phase partitioning procedure (Fig.5). Plasma membranes partitioned to the upper phase, as shown by immunodetection of a plasma membrane H+-ATPase marker. In contrast, ACA2p partitioned to the lower phase, indicating an endomembrane localization. In controls, an ER-type Ca2+-ATPase (ACA3p/ECA1p) also partitioned to the lower phase (not shown). Endomembrane localization was confirmed by showing immunodecoration of subcellular structures using confocal microscopy on root tip cells (not shown). To genetically test for Ca2+ pump activity, ACA2p was expressed in a mutant yeast strain, K616. K616 (pmr1 pmc1 cnb1) has a disruption of three genes involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, PMR1, PMC1, and CNB1. PMR1 and PMC1 encode Ca2+-ATPases in the yeast vacuole and Golgi apparatus, respectively (41Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 42Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CNB1 encodes a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase (calcineurin), which regulates a H+/Ca2+ exchanger (43Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Due to the disruption of the yeast Ca2+ pumps, this strain displays poor growth on Ca2+-depleted medium (+10 mmEGTA, pH 6.0). ACA2p was expressed as a full-length protein, ACA2-1p (construct pYX-ACA2-1), and an N-terminally truncated mutant, ACA2-2p (construct pYX-ACA2-2). Both ACA2-1 and -2 were cloned in a yeast vector (pYX112) to provide a moderate level of constitutive expression from a triose phosphate isomerase promoter (Novagen). In controls, wild type yeast transformed with vector alone grew on Ca2+-depleted medium, while the K616 mutant transformed with the vector alone did not (Fig. 6). When the K616 host was transformed with pYX-ACA2-1 or -2, only the truncation mutant was able to restore growth. The expression levels for both ACA2-1p and ACA2-2p were comparable, as indicated by immunodetection of a 110- and 102-kDa polypeptide, respectively, using anti-ACA2 antiserum (not shown). To biochemically determine the activity of ACA2p, we used sucrose gradients to fractionate yeast microsomal membranes containing either ACA2-1p or ACA2-2p. As a control we fractionated membranes from yeast transformed with a vector only. Sucrose gradients were analyzed for ATPase activities in four separate experiments with equivalent results. Approximately equal amounts of protein were loaded on each gradient. Results from a typical set of fractionations are shown in Fig.7. All gradients showed a peak of vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity (Ca2+-independent) at approximately 48% sucrose, consistent with the expected position of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (23Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the vector-only control, there was very little Ca2+- or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ATPase, consistent with the reported low levels of endogenous Ca2+ pump activity in yeast (41Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In contrast to the vector-only control, gradients containing ACA2-1p and -2p always showed a broad peak of Ca2+-stim"
https://openalex.org/W2088129765,"Cell adhesion kinase β (CAKβ/PYK2) is the second protein-tyrosine kinase of the focal adhesion kinase subfamily. We identified a cDNA that encodes a CAKβ-binding protein. This cDNA clone encodes the human homologue of Hic-5, the cDNA of which was cloned in 1994 as transforming growth factor β1- and hydrogen peroxide-inducible mRNA. We found that Hic-5 exclusively localized at focal adhesions in a rat fibroblast line, WFB. This localization of Hic-5 was confirmed in WFB cells expressing Myc-tagged Hic-5.

CAKβ was coimmunoprecipitated with Hic-5 from the WFB cell lysate. The coimmunoprecipitation of CAKβ with Hic-5 was markedly inhibited by the addition of the extreme C-terminal region of CAKβ. Coimmunoprecipitation of Hic-5 with CAKβ, which was shown in COS-7 cells doubly transfected with cDNA constructs of CAKβ and Myc-tagged Hic-5, was lost when the CAKβ amino acid residues 741–903 were deleted. Hic-5 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in Src-transformed 3Y1 cells and in cells treated with pervanadate. Hic-5 associated with CAKβ was selectively tyrosine-phosphorylated in WFB cells exposed to hypertonic osmotic stress. These results indicate that Hic-5 is a paxillin-related component of focal adhesions and binds to CAKβ, implying possible involvement of Hic-5 in the downstream signaling of CAKβ.

Tumor Res. 1995; 30: 37-46Google Scholar). The human gene of CAKβ was mapped to chromosome 8 at p21.1 (7Inazawa J. Sasaki H. Nagura K. Kakazu N. Abe T. Sasaki T. Hum. Genet. 1996; 98: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).CAKβ and FAK are closely related in their overall structures and have sequence similarity over their entire length except for the extreme N-terminal regions and 10 C-terminal residues. The 88 N-terminal residues of CAKβ are markedly different from the corresponding 81 N-terminal residues of FAK (1Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). FAK is important as a docking protein. Four regions of the FAK sequence have been identified as the ligand sequences (8Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). All these ligand sequences are at least partly conserved in CAKβ. Tyrosine residue 397 of FAK and the corresponding residue 402 of CAKβ are sites of autophosphorylation and also ligand sites to the SH2 domains of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases with conserved ligand sequence, YAEI (9Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar); this binding activates the Src family kinases (9Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The second ligand sequence in FAK for SH2, Y925ENV of the mouse FAK, is known to be the ligand site for Grb2 (11Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and is also functionally conserved in residues 881–884 of CAKβ, YHNV of rat CAKβ, and YLNV of human CAKβ. The third ligand sequence in FAK, EAPPKPSR, participates in the binding to the SH3 domains of pp130 cas and related proteins (12Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 13Ishino M. Ohba T. Sasaki H. Sasaki T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar) and is functionally conserved in CAKβ residues 712–719, EPPPKPSR. A weak coimmunoprecipitation of pp130 cas with CAKβ was shown (14Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). There is one more proline-rich sequence in the C-terminal domain (C-domain) of FAK, PAAPPKKPPRPGAP (residues 869–882). An SH3-containing GTPase-activating protein for Rho and Cdc42, named Graf by Hildebrand et al. (15Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), was identified as a protein with specific affinity to this sequence. CAKβ also has a proline-rich sequence at the corresponding region, PPQKPPR (residues 855–861).CAKβ in cultured epithelial cells is mainly found in the perinuclear region and the cytoplasm in addition to the cell-to-cell border. In rat tissues, CAKβ is present in association with microvilli, cilia, and axons (16Mitaka T. Shindoh M. Mochizuki Y. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Matsuya M. Ninomiya T. Sasaki T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). FAK mediates signaling through integrins. A complex assembly of proteins is formed at focal adhesions in association with FAK (8Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 17Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). It has been shown that paxillin and talin bind to the C-domain of FAK (18Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.-T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Two short stretches of 17 and 9 amino acid residues were identified as the FAK sequences participating in the binding to paxillin (18Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These sequences are highly conserved in CAKβ. Paxillin binding to CAKβ was recently shown (20Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E.

FAK is also activated by stimulation of receptors coupled to phospholipase C activation such as neuropeptide receptors and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (21Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This second mode of activation is also found in CAKβ (2Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylation of CAKβ is markedly enhanced when the cytoplasmic free Ca2+concentration is increased (2Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) and when cells are stressed by osmotic shock (5Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D.

Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The differences in the subcellular and tissue distributions of CAKβ and FAK indicate different functions for these two protein-tyrosine kinases.In a study to elucidate the upstream and downstream signaling pathways of CAKβ, we used an expression cloning technique to identify binding partners for the C-domain of CAKβ. We report here the identification of a cDNA that encodes a CAKβ-binding protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of this cDNA indicated that the protein was the human homologue of Hic-5, the cDNA of which was described by Shibanuma et al. (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a transforming growth factor β1- and hydrogen peroxide-inducible mRNA. Hic-5 is closely related to paxillin in its amino acid sequence. Immunocytochemical staining of rat fibroblast line WFB with a specific anti-Hic-5 antibody revealed that Hic-5 localized exclusively at focal adhesions as paxillin did, a result in disagreement with the original identification of Hic-5 as a nuclear protein (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation as well as direct binding of Hic-5 and CAKβ. Hic-5 associated with CAKβ was preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated, implying a functional interplay between CAKβ and Hic-5.DISCUSSIONWe identified Hic-5 in a search for CAKβ-binding proteins by cDNA expression cloning. Hic-5 had an amino acid sequence highly similar to paxillin. The results shown in this paper demonstrated that Hic-5 was a component of focal adhesions. This finding disagrees with the original identification by Shibanuma et al. (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that Hic-5 is localized in nuclei. A binding of the Hic-5 LIM domain to certain DNA sequences was postulated (24Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We consider that their assumption that Hic-5 is a nuclear protein was drawn from weak evidence obtained by the use of a less specific anti-Hic-5 antibody (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a possible function of Hic-5 in the nucleus cannot be excluded at present. In this paper, we have confirmed the Hic-5 localization at focal adhesions by immunostaining with anti-Myc in WFB cells expressing the Myc-tagged Hic-5 from a cDNA construct. The cell biological functions of Hic-5 should be reevaluated from the standpoint that Hic-5 is a component of focal adhesions. Recently, Brown et al.(38Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) showed that LIM domains are responsible for targeting paxillin to focal adhesion. They identified the LIM3 domain as the principal determinant of paxillin localization at focal adhesions. The four contiguous LIM domains of Hic-5 are most similar to those of paxillin among the known LIM domains (42Dawid I.B. Toyama R. Taira M. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1995; 318: 295-306PubMed Google Scholar); the highest similarity is found in each corresponding domain. Among the corresponding four LIM domains of Hic-5 and paxillin, the LIM3 domains of these proteins are most highly conserved with an identity of 70.6% in the amino acid sequences. In addition to a novel role of the LIM domain as protein dimerization motifs (36Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the LIM domain recognizes a tyrosine-containing tight turn (37Wu R. Durick K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15934-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The identity of the protein recognized by the LIM3 domains of paxillin and Hic-5 is most interesting because Hic-5 may also be targeted to focal adhesions through its LIM3 domain.We found that the Hic-5 N-domain directly associated in vitro with the C-terminal regions of CAKβ and FAK (Figs. 5 and6). Moreover, the association of Hic-5 with CAKβ was shown in the lysates of WFB cells and of those COS-7 cells that were doubly transfected with CAKβ and Hic-5 cDNA constructs. Brown et al. (38Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) localized on paxillin the binding sites of FAK and vinculin to small stretches of amino acid sequences, which they named LD motifs. They pointed out high sequence similarity between paxillin and Hic-5 in the LD motifs. The paxillin-binding sites on FAK and vinculin have also been identified by Tachibana et al. (18Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and named paxillin-binding subdomains 1 and 2 (PBS1 and PBS2). These subdomains are also found in CAKβ at amino acid residues 875–891 (PBS1) and 990–998 (PBS2). The PBS1 and PBS2 of FAK and CAKβ are highly conserved, being 58.8% identical in PBS1 and 77.8% identical in PBS2. The Hic-5 N-domain bound to the CAKβ C-domain and its fragment containing both PBS1 and PBS2 (Figs. 5 and 6).The presence of Hic-5 in association with CAKβ in the WFB and COS-7 cell lysates (Figs. 7, 8, and 11) suggested that Hic-5 was a component in signaling pathways downstream of CAKβ. The results shown in Figs.7 and 8 are consistent with the prediction that the CAKβ amino acid residues containing both PBS1 and PBS2 are essential for the binding of CAKβ to Hic-5. In the deletion mutant of CAKβ, dl 741–903, PBS2 was present, but PBS1 was deleted. In addition to the association of Hic-5 with CAKβ, the association of paxillin with CAKβ and that of Hic-5 with FAK were also found. It is possible that there are differences in affinities of the associations between FAK/CAKβ and paxillin/Hic-5. In this relation, we noted that the GST fusion protein of the full-length CAKβ, GST-CAKβ(fl), had much less affinity to paxillin than to Hic-5 (Fig. 6, lane 4). Moreover, the results in Fig. 6 suggest less binding of Hic-5 to GST-FAK-CdomB than to GST-CAKβ-CdomB.A high sequence similarity was found between the first LD motif of paxillin and the Hic-5 amino acid sequence translated from the “5′-untranslated region,” which was presumed on mouse Hic-5 cDNA by Shibanuma et al. (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of human Hic-5 cDNA,cbp-1 (Fig. 1). The published mouse Hic-5 amino acid sequence (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains only three LD motifs lacking the one corresponding to the first LD motif of paxillin. The translational initiation site of the Hic-5 cDNA presumed by Shibanuma et al. (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not fit to the sequence context for translational initiation (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar) and may not be the true translational initiation site of the Hic-5 mRNA. The level of Hic-5 protein expression in the cDNA transfected cells has not been shown by these authors (23Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The expression of Hic-5 from constructs of the original human Hic-5 cDNA, cbp-1, was quite low in the transfected cells (data not shown). We will continue our efforts to identify the N-terminal methionine and to sequence further 5′-upstream region of Hic-5 cDNA by isolating other Hic-5 cDNA clones.Although Hic-5 is almost exclusively localized at focal adhesions in WFB cells (Fig. 3) and CAKβ has specific affinity to Hic-5 and paxillin, only a limited, small fraction of CAKβ localized at focal adhesions in WFB cells (Fig. 12). This subcellular localization of CAKβ was different from that of FAK, a large portion of which was found at focal adhesions in WFB cells (Fig. 3). The major portion of CAKβ in WFB cells is present in the perinuclear region and cytoplasm (Fig. 12). In cultured epithelial cells, CAKβ was also found at the cell-to-cell borders in addition to the perinuclear regions and cytoplasm. A small amount of CAKβ present at focal adhesions in WFB cells was found only by careful examination and was not immunostained in images of typical components of focal adhesions such as paxillin, vinculin, Hic-5, and FAK (Fig. 12). This intracellular localization of CAKβ was compatible with our finding that CAKβ is present in association with microvilli, cilia, and axons in rat tissues (16Mitaka T. Shindoh M. Mochizuki Y. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Matsuya M. Ninomiya T. Sasaki T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar). Tachibana et al. (18Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) showed that FAK localizes at focal adhesions through its binding to paxillin. It was shown that the C-domain of CAKβ exclusively localized at focal adhesions when this domain was singly expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts from a designed recombinant cDNA construct (43Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is obvious that CAKβ has an intrinsic property of localizing at focal adhesions via its C-domain. In most cells, however, the major portion of CAKβ does not localize at focal adhesions. The reason for this subcellular localization of CAKβ at sites other than focal adhesions is a focus of our current study. The regulatory mechanism of CAKβ localization might be important in understanding the unique functions of CAKβ different from FAK. We (1Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) previously showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of CAKβ is not enhanced in response to plating rat 3Y1 fibroblasts onto fibronectin. Thereafter, different results have been reported on the changes of the CAKβ tyrosine phosphorylation in response to integrin signaling (14Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T.

The subcellular localization of CAKβ shown in Fig. 12 may explain our finding that the tyrosine-phosphorylation was not regulated by cell-to-substratum adhesion at focal adhesions.Although the amino acid sequences of Hic-5 and paxillin are similar at the LIM domains and also at the LD motifs, the other portions of the Hic-5 N-domain are not similar to those of the paxillin N-domain. Paxillin has a role as a signal-integrating protein or a docking protein. It was shown that the Src family protein kinases associate with paxillin by their SH3 domains (46Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that the transforming protein v-Crk binds with its SH2 domain to the phosphorylated sequences at tyrosine residues 31 and 118 of the paxillin N-domain (47Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 48Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17437-17441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although Hic-5 does not share these ligand sequences, the proline-rich sequence found at amino acid residues 14–20 and some tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences of Hic-5 may also have ligand specificities to some SH3 and SH2 domains. A tyrosine residue at position 43 of Hic-5, which is not found in paxillin, is in a sequence context indicative of a possible phosphorylation site. The Hic-5 coimmunoprecipitated with CAKβ from the lysate of WFB cells stimulated by osmotic stress was selectively tyrosine-phosphorylated as compared with the total cellular Hic-5 (Fig. 11). This result indicates functional coupling of CAKβ and Hic-5. However, it remains unanswered which tyrosine kinase, CAKβ, Src, or another one, is responsible for the phosphorylation of Hic-5. Thus, the portion of the Hic-5 N-domain outside the LD motifs is probably the site important in signal transduction. It seems important to study whether the cell biological effects of Hic-5 reported by Shibanuma et al. (24Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) are related to unique downstream signals, which are possibly generated from Hic-5 but not from paxillin. Because Hic-5 and paxillin have several properties in common, related but different roles are expected for their functions.

CAKβ and FAK are closely related in their overall structures and have sequence similarity over their entire length except for the extreme N-terminal regions and 10 C-terminal residues. The 88 N-terminal residues of CAKβ are markedly different from the corresponding 81 N-terminal residues of FAK (1Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol.

This includes the stimulation of protein synthesis and the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins among which is JAK2. The present study was aimed at characterizing in detail the pattern of activation by GM-CSF of the JAK/STAT pathway in human neutrophils. The results obtained show that the stimulation of human neutrophils by GM-CSF specifically led to tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and had no effect on JAK1, JAK3, or TYK2. Furthermore, GM-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 but not of STAT1, STAT2, STAT4, or STAT6. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was transient reaching its maximum at 15 min. STAT5 presented a different pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation. The anti-STAT5 antibodies identified two proteins at 94 and 92 kDa. The 94-kDa STAT5 was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and showed no change upon GM-CSF stimulation. On the other hand, the 92-kDa STAT5 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 1 min of GM-CSF treatment and this was maintained for at least 30 min. By the use of specific antibodies, it was determined that only STAT5B, and not STAT5A, was tyrosine phosphorylated in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils. Furthermore, GM-CSF treatment induced an increase in the ability of STAT3 and STAT5B, but not STAT5A, to bind DNA probes. The specificity of the pattern of activation of the JAK/STAT pathway suggests that it may be directly linked to the modulation of the functions of mature nondividing, human neutrophils by GM-CSF.

Although most of these activities are well documented, the intracellular mechanisms by which they are mediated are poorly, or incompletely, understood. Neutrophils express a low number of a high affinity GM-CSF receptor. The receptor is made up of two subunits, termed α and β (17Rapoport A.P. Abboud C.N. Dipersio J.F. Blood Rev. 1992; 6: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The α-subunit, which is unique to the GM-CSF receptor, acts mainly as a binding site for GM-CSF (17Rapoport A.P. Abboud C.N. Dipersio J.F. Blood Rev. 1992; 6: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Polotskaya A. Zhao Y.M. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its short cytoplasmic tail, its role in signal transduction is thought to be limited (18Polotskaya A. Zhao Y.M. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). The β-subunit, on the other hand, possesses a large cytoplasmic tail which has been shown to be critical to the mediation of the GM-CSF signal (19Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).

These kinases are involved in the signaling pathways of several cytokines, the prototype of which is interferon-γ (20Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.S. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D.

The Jak family functions upstream of a family of transcription factors called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) (29Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends. Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 30Ihle J.N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Eight different members of the STAT family have been identified so far (STAT1α, β, STAT2–4, STAT5A, B, and STAT6). STAT proteins exist in latent cytoplasmic forms which, upon stimulation, become tyrosine phosphorylated and form homo- as well as heterodimers which translocate to the nucleus and bind specific DNA motifs. Little has been done to identify the specific combinations of members of the Jak and STAT families activated by GM-CSF in different cell lines in general, and more specifically in neutrophils. The available reports in neutrophils document the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 in GM-CSF-stimulated cells (14Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1996; 89: 1035-1044Crossref Google Scholar, 15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activation of STAT5 in certain cell lines has been reported (31Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 32Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Blood. 1996; 88: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in human neutrophils upon treatment with GM-CSF has been described (15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to provide a comprehensive examination of the involvement of the Jak and STAT family members in the mediation of the effects of GM-CSF in human neutrophils. The results show that the stimulation of human neutrophils by GM-CSF leads to a specific activation profile of the Jak/STAT pathway and only results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and of STAT3 and STAT5B. GM-CSF was generously provided by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Nonidet P-40 was obtained from Sigma. Sephadex G-10, protein A, dextran T-500, and Ficoll-Paque were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Dorval, Québec, Canada). The monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody UB 05-321 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies to Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, Tyk2, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT4, STAT5B, and STAT6 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibodies to STAT1 and STAT5 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The Affini-pure rabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L) antibody was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system was obtained from Amersham Corp. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Blood was collected from healthy adult volunteers into heparinized tubes. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm to remove platelet-rich plasma. After 2% dextran sedimentation of erythrocytes for 30 min, neutrophils were purified under sterile conditions by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque cushions. Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis and the cells were suspended in magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1.6 mm CaCl2 at a final count of 40 × 106 cells/ml. The entire procedure was carried out sterilely at room temperature (34McColl S.R. DiPersio J.F. Caon A.C. Ho P. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1991; 78: 1842-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final cell preparation comprised at least 97% neutrophils and less than 0.2% monocytes. Neutrophil suspensions (1 ml of 40 × 106 cells/ml) were either stimulated with the indicated agonists or treated with the same volume of the appropriate diluents for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. For lysates prepared under reducing conditions, 500 μl of the cell suspensions were added to equal amounts of denaturing buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm NaVO4, 20 mmNaP2O4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% SDS, and 0.6% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentrations) preheated to 100 °C and incubated for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were then filtered through Sephadex G-10 columns to remove the denaturing agents. To prepare the columns, 3 g of Sephadex/sample were suspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 137 mm NaCl (final concentrations) for at least 3 h at room temperature with occasional shaking before use. Nonidet P-40 (1%) and bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) were added to the eluates which were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation. This procedure was described previously in detail (35Al-Shami A. Gilbert C. Barabé F. Gaudry M. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lysates (1 ml) obtained as described above were incubated with 5 μg of free antibodies for 5 h at 4 °C on an oscillating platform. In case of immunoprecipitates of STAT1 and STAT5, this was followed by the addition of 1 μl of Affini-pure rabbit anti-mouse IgG, IgM (H+L) which was added and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. 20 μg of protein A-Sepharose were then added and left for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and were washed twice with modified buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 but no SDS or β-mercaptoethanol, and twice with LiCl buffer (LiCl 0.5m, Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.4). The supernatants were removed carefully, 45 μl of 2 × boiling Laemmli's buffer (1 × is 62.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8.5% glycerol, 2.5 mmNaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.025% bromphenol blue) was then added and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 100 °C. Immunoprecipitates of STAT1 and STAT5 were divided into equal aliquots before separation on the SDS-PAGE as described below. Samples were electrophoresed on 7.5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. Electrophoretic transfer cells (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, Canberra Packard, Ontario, Canada) were used to transfer proteins from the gels to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Western blotting was performed as described previously (34McColl S.R. DiPersio J.F. Caon A.C. Ho P. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1991; 78: 1842-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nonspecific sites were blocked using 2% gelatin in TBS-Tween (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 190 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37 °C. The first Western blot was conducted using anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) antibodies, anti-STAT1, or STAT5 antibodies as indicated. These were incubated with the membranes for 1 h at 37 °C at a final dilution of 1/4,000 (anti-pY) and 1/1,000 (anti-STAT5 or STAT1), respectively, in fresh blocking solution. The membranes were washed three times at room temperature in TBS-Tween for a total duration of 30 min, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C at a final dilution of 1/20,000 in fresh blocking solution. Except for those containing STAT1 and STAT5 immunoprecipitates, the membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween and the protein bands were revealed using the ECL Western blotting detection system following the manufacturer's directions. To ensure the presence of equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins under each condition, the membranes were routinely reblotted with the respective immunoprecipitating antibody. Reprobing was conducted as follows. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was treated with TBS buffer containing 1% H2O2 for 5 min at room temperature. This was followed by extensive washing with TBS buffer containing no H2O2. Western blot was conducted as described above but this time the second antibody was a donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham, Oakville, Canada). The immunoprecipitates concerning STAT1 and STAT5, were divided in two equal aliquots, one was blotted with anti-pY antibodies while the others were blotted with the respective immunoprecipitating antibody. This allowed reprobing the membranes with polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT5B. Two DNA probes were synthesized: an acute phase response element probe (GATCCTTCTGGGAATTC CTAGATC) (36Zhang D. Sun M. Samols D. Kushner I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9503-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and a FcγRIGAS (GTATTTCCCAGAAAAGGAAC) (37Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The probes were biotinylated using a 3′-terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Québec, Canada) before they were hybridized with their complementary strands. They were subsequently incubated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with the binding buffer as described by the manufacturer. Cells were treated with GM-CSF for 15 min at 37 °C. To test the DNA binding of STAT3, cells were solubilized in KCl whole protein extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 400 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmvanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate). They were kept at 4 °C for 10 min before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. The KCl concentration was then diluted to 133 mm (33Rosen R.L. Winestock K.D. Chen G. Liu X.W. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid degradation of STAT5, cells were suspended in a 600 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate). The cells were vortexed for 15 s, kept on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 300 ×g. The resulting pellets were treated with KCl whole protein extraction buffer as described above. Lysates were precleared with 10 μg of agarose for 1 h at 4 °C before they were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the biotinylated probes. The beads were subsequently washed 4 times with the lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 before the addition of boiling sample buffer. The first set of experiments was designed to identify the members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases which were activated in human neutrophils treated with GM-CSF. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with GM-CSF (4 nm) or an equal volume of diluent (0.01% bovine serum albumin) for 15 min. They were subsequently lysed by direct transfer to an equal volume of lysis buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol preheated to 100 °C and boiled for at least 10 min. After removing the denaturing agents as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the different members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases were immunoprecipitated using specific polyclonal antibodies. The denaturing lysis conditions were necessary for optimal and reproducible preservation of the proteins and their phosphorylation levels. The immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE gradient gels and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated Jak kinases was examined by immunobloting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1(panel A), and previously reported (14Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1996; 89: 1035-1044Crossref Google Scholar, 15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), GM-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. On the other hand, none of the other members of the Jak family, namely, Jak1, Jak3, or Tyk2 showed any evidence of increases in their level of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to GM-CSF. Similar results were observed using the reverse protocol (i.e. immunoprecipitating with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and immunoblotting for the different members of the Jak family) (data not shown). The increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was not seen in lysates prepared under nondenaturing conditions (data not shown). Subsequent blotting with the respective antibodies demonstrated that equal amounts of the kinases were loaded in each pair of lanes (Fig. 1, panel B). To examine the kinetics of phosphorylation of Jak2 in neutrophils treated with GM-CSF, cells were stimulated for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min before lysis under denaturing conditions as described above. After the removal of the denaturing agents, Jak2 was immunoprecipitated and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation at each time point was examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 2, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was detected as early as 1 min after stimulation. This phosphorylation reached its maximum within 5 min (lane 3) and declined thereafter. Subsequent blotting with anti-Jak2 antibodies demonstrated that equal amounts of Jak2 immunoprecipitates were loaded in each lane (data not shown). We next examined which members of the STAT family was tyrosine phosphorylated upon treatment of human neutrophils with GM-CSF. Cells were treated with GM-CSF (4 nm) or equal volumes of diluent for 15 min at 37 °C. This was followed by lysis under denaturing conditions. After the removal of the denaturing agents, immunoprecipitation was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” using specific antibodies directed against different members of the STAT proteins. The immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE gradient gels and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the different STAT proteins were examined by immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As illustrated in Fig.3 (panel A), treatment of human neutrophils with GM-CSF increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and of the faster mobility isoform of STAT5. STAT1 and the lower mobility isoform of STAT5 constitutively expressed a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation and this remained unchanged upon treatment by GM-CSF. No tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2, STAT4, or STAT6 was detected in control or in GM-CSF-stimulated cells. Reprobing these membranes with their respective immunoprecipitating antibodies showed the presence of equal amounts of proteins in each pair of lanes (Fig.3, panel B). The kinetics of the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 were examined next. Cells were stimulated for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min before lysis under denaturing conditions as described above. After the removal of the denaturing agents, STAT3 and STAT5 were immunoprecipitated and their levels of tyrosine phosphorylation examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was evident after 5 min of stimulation and reached its maximum after 15 min of treatment with GM-CSF. After 30 min, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was no longer detected. Equal amounts of STAT3 immunoprecipitates were present in each lane (data not shown). A different pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was observed (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, panel A, and previously described in other cells (31Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 38Meinke A. Barahmandpour F. Wohrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), two isozymes of STAT5 are present in neutrophils. These, most likely, correspond to STAT5A and STAT5B as the antibodies used in this experiment recognize both STAT5 isozymes. Stimulation of the cells with GM-CSF led to a time-dependent upward shift of the lower STAT5 band. This decreased mobility is characteristic of phosphorylation. This possibility was directly tested by blotting the immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and these data are shown in Fig. 5, panel B. The upper STAT5 band was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and this was unaltered by GM-CSF treatment. On the other hand, the lower band was undetectable in unstimulated cells, became tyrosine phosphorylated within 1 min of stimulation, and maintained its level of tyrosine phosphorylation for up to 30 min (the longest time point examined). In addition, the lower STAT5 band detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies exhibited the exact same shift in migration observed with the anti-STAT5 antibodies (Fig. 5, panel A). Since STAT5 has two isoforms, STAT5A (94 kDa) and STAT5B (92 kDa), we investigated whether the lower band was STAT5B. The membranes were reprobed using specific anti-STAT5B antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented in Fig. 5, panel C, indeed identified the lower band as STAT5B. This was further confirmed by the following experiment in which immunoprecipitation was conducted using agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine from control as well as GM-CSF-treated neutrophils as described before. The immunoprecipitates were divided before separation on SDS-PAGE gradient gel and immunoblotted with anti-STAT5A (Fig. 6,panel A) or anti-STAT5B (Fig. 6, panel B) antibodies. These results showed an agonist-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5B upon treatment with GM-CSF.Figure 5Time-dependent increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the lower band of STAT5 in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils. Cells were treated with GM-CSF for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min before lysis under denaturing conditions. STAT5 was immunoprecipitated and the membranes were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (panel A), anti-STAT5 (panel B), and anti-STAT5B (panel C) antibodies.

Wb, Western blot;Ipp, immunoprecipitation; pY, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After establishing that STAT3 and STAT5B are tyrosine phosphorylated in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils, the DNA binding ability of these proteins was examined next. Cellular proteins were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated with biotinylated acute phase response element probe (for STAT3) or biotinylated FcγRIGAS (for STAT5) bound to streptavidin-conjugated agarose. The precipitated proteins were separated on gradient gels and identified by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Treatment of neutrophils with GM-CSF induced a significant increase in the ability of STAT3 and STAT5B to bind the DNA probes (Fig.7, panels A and C, respectively). No increase in STAT5A ability to bind DNA was observed (Fig. 7, panel B). Signal transduction through the GM-CSF receptor, neither subunit of which possesses intrinsic enzymatic activity nor is linked to G proteins, is thought to be mediated by the recruitment of cytosolic tyrosine kinases. Accordingly, one of the prominent effects of GM-CSF in neutrophils is an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins (16Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyanatheall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 34McColl S.R. DiPersio J.F. Caon A.C. Ho P. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1991; 78: 1842-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the activation of some tyrosine kinases, namely Lyn (16Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyanatheall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Fes (23Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and Jak2 (28Zhao Y.M. Wagner F. Frank S.J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13814-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The latter is of particular importance because it is believed to function upstream of the STAT family of transcription factors and GM-CSF induces the transcription-dependent synthesis of a variety of proteins in human neutrophils. Although a few studies have addressed the subject of the activation of the Jak-STAT pathway by GM-CSF (15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), little work has been done concerning this issue in neutrophils (14Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1996; 89: 1035-1044Crossref Google Scholar, 15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The generality of the results concerning the Jak/STAT pathway is further complicated by the apparent differences in GM-CSF signaling between various cell types. For example, GM-CSF has been reported to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in human neutrophils (15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) while only stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (both A and B) but not STAT 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 in OTT1 cells (31Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GM-CSF was reported to activate STAT5, but not STAT1, in human monocytes (33Rosen R.L. Winestock K.D. Chen G. Liu X.W. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar variations between different cell types were observed in the case of stimulation by interleukin-3, a cytokine which shares a common signaling pathway, including a common receptor subunit with GM-CSF (39Dandrea R. Rayner J. Moretti P. Lopez A. Goodall G.J. Gonda T.J. Vadas M. Blood. 1994; 83: 2802-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Dorsch M. Hock H. Diamantstein T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the role that other members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases may play in GM-CSF signaling had not been addressed as of yet. The present study was therefore designed to identify the members of the Jak-STAT pathway that are involved in mediating GM-CSF signaling in human neutrophils. The first set of experiments identified the members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases involved in GM-CSF signaling. Lysis of the cells under denaturing conditions proved to be necessary to maintain the integrity and level of tyrosine phosphorylation of neutrophil proteins (35Al-Shami A. Gilbert C. Barabé F. Gaudry M. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the Jak family members using their specific antibodies and the subsequent examination of their levels of tyrosine phosphorylation demonstrated that only Jak2 but not Jak1, Jak3, or Tyk2, was tyrosine phosphorylated upon GM-CSF treatment. While stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 had previously been observed in neutrophils (15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), this is the first report documenting the specificity of the effects of GM-CSF on the Jak family of tyrosine kinases. This result is significant in view of the reported differences in the signaling pathways used by GM-CSF in different cell systems. For example, the association of Jak2 with GM-CSF receptor has been described (20Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.S. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while other investigators have observed the activation of Tyk2 by interleukin-3, a cytokine that shares the common βc-receptor chain and several of its signaling pathways with GM-CSF (39Dandrea R. Rayner J. Moretti P. Lopez A. Goodall G.J. Gonda T.J. Vadas M. Blood. 1994; 83: 2802-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Dorsch M. Hock H. Diamantstein T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nature of the Jak family tyrosine kinase stimulated by GM-CSF in various cell types may be related to specific responses elicited in the latter. It is worth mentioning that a report had shown that the Abl tyrosine kinase may play a role in the activation of certain members of the STAT family in a Jak-independent pathway in GM-CSF dependent cell lines (41Ilaria Jr., R.L. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31704-31710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). While immunoblots demonstrated the presence of Abl in neutrophils, the experiments we conducted failed to detect any activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of Abl in human neutrophils upon stimulation with GM-CSF (data not shown). An approach similar to that used to identify the GM-CSF-responsive members of the Jak family was then directed toward the STAT proteins. The results obtained show that STAT1 has a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation which was unaltered by stimulating the cells with GM-CSF. On the other hand, STAT1 was actively tyrosine phosphorylated in response to interferon-γ (data not shown). These results differ from those reported by Brizi et al. (15Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) who described an activation of STAT1 in human neutrophils treated with GM-CSF. The discrepancies between this report and our results might be accounted for by the differences in the detection and cell manipulations techniques. Neither STAT2, STAT4, nor STAT6 were activated by GM-CSF stimulation. On the other hand, GM-CSF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5. The kinetics of the activation of STAT3 and STAT5 differed, however. The phosphorylation of STAT3 was relatively slow (when compared with that of other cellular proteins known to be activated by GM-CSF in human neutrophils (13Yuo A. Kitagawa S. Azuma E. Natori Y. Togawa A. Saito M. Takaku F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1156: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Al-Shami A. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1996; 89: 1035-1044Crossref Google Scholar)), and transient reaching its maximum after 15 min and becoming undetectable after 30 min. The kinetics of phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to GM-CSF treatment differed from that of STAT3. The antibodies to STAT5 detected 2 bands, an upper band which was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated irrespective of GM-CSF stimulation and showed no shift in migration, and a lower band which was tyrosine phosphorylated (within 1 min of stimulation) and showed a marked shift in migration characteristically associated with protein phosphorylation. Since STAT5 has two isoforms, STAT5A (94 kDa) and STAT5B (92 kDa), it seemed likely that the lower band being activated was STAT5B. Reprobing the membranes with specific anti-STAT5B antibodies as well as immunoprecipitation with the latter (data not shown), positively identified STAT5B as the STAT5 isoform phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF treatment in human neutrophils. STAT5B tyrosine phosphorylation was maintained for at least 30 min of GM-CSF stimulation. A similar prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was reported in human monocytes (33Rosen R.L. Winestock K.D. Chen G. Liu X.W. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5B, but not STAT5A, correlated with an increase in the ability of these proteins to bind DNA. Differences in the responsiveness of the two STAT isoforms has been reported in other cell systems (38Meinke A. Barahmandpour F. Wohrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 42Moriggl R. Gouilleuxgruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X.W. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In these previous reports, however, it was mainly STAT5B which was inert and STAT5A which was activated. Furthermore, both antiphosphotyrosine and anti-STAT5 antibodies but not anti-STAT5B detected a faint band at around 80 kDa that was unaltered by GM-CSF treatment. Whether this band is a degradation product of the 94-kDa STAT5A or whether it corresponded to the reported 80-kDa STAT5A (33Rosen R.L. Winestock K.D. Chen G. Liu X.W. Hennighausen L. Finbloom D.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) remains to be determined. In conclusion, the results presented in this study show that the Jak-STAT pathway stimulated by GM-CSF in human neutrophils is mediated exclusively by Jak2 and involves STAT3 and STAT5B. Furthermore, the pattern and kinetics of the activation of the STATs proteins in human neutrophils by GM-CSF differ from that previously reported in other cell lines, possibly reflecting the specialized, terminally differentiated, nature of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001032837,"Recently we have described a splice variant of the L-type Ca2+ channel (α1C,86) in which 80 amino acids (1572–1651) of the conventional α1C,77 were substituted by another 81 amino acids due to alternative splicing of exons 40–42. Ba2+ current (IBa) through α1C,86 exhibited faster inactivation kinetics, was strongly voltage-dependent, and had no Ca2+-dependent inactivation. An oligonucleotide-directed segment substitution and expression of the mutated channels in Xenopus oocytes were used to study the molecular determinants for gating of the channel within the 80-amino acid domain. Replacement of segments 1572–1598 or 1595–1652 of the “slow” α1C,77 channel with the respective segments of the “fast” α1C,86 gave rise to rapidly inactivating α1C,86-like channel isoforms. We found that replacement of either motifs 1572IKTEG1576 or1600LLDQV1604 of α1C,77 with the respective sequences of α1C,86 caused strong but partial acceleration of I Ba inactivation. Replacement of both sequences produced an α1C,86-like fast channel which had no Ca2+-dependent inactivation. These results support the hypothesis that motifs 1572–1576 and 1600–1604 of α1C,77 contribute cooperatively to inactivation kinetics of α1C and are critical for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel.

These results support the hypothesis that motifs 1572–1576 and 1600–1604 of α1C,77 contribute cooperatively to inactivation kinetics of α1C and are critical for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel. The voltage-gated class C (“cardiac”) L-type Ca2+channel is composed of the pore-forming α1C subunit, containing the high affinity binding sites for dihydropyridines and other organic Ca2+ channel blockers, and the auxiliary β- and α2δ-subunits (1Catterall W.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1499-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Unlike dihydropyridine-insensitive Ca2+ channels, which exhibit voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca2+ current (ICa), L-type Ca2+-channels are in addition inactivated by Ca2+, but not Ba2+ ions permeating through the channel (3Eckert R. Chad J.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 215-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding site responsible for the Ca2+-induced inactivation of the class C Ca2+ channel is thought to be located near the inner mouth, but outside the electric field of the pore (4Neely A. Olcese R. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1895-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Substituting a small 142-amino acid segment of the Ca2+-insensitive α1E channel with a homologous segment of the cytoplasmic tail of α1C, confers Ca2+ sensitivity on the α1E channel (5Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Alternative splicing of the human α1C subunit generates multiple isoforms of the channel (6Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), including those with structurally altered carboxyl-terminal tail (7Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently two splice variants of the principal 2138-amino acids pore-forming α1C subunit, α1C,86 and α1C,77, exhibiting strong differences in their gating properties were described (8Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The α1C,86 channel has 80 amino acid residues (1572–1651) in the second quarter of the 662-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of the conventional channel (α1C,77), replaced with 81 non-identical amino acids (Fig. 1) due to alternative splicing of exons 40–42 (7Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Both splice variants retained high sensitivity toward dihydropyridine blockers, but I Ba through α1C,86 inactivated 10 times faster than α1C,77 at +20 mV. The inactivation rate of α1C,86 was strongly voltage-dependent but essentially Ca2+-independent suggesting that the segment 1572–1651 of the carboxyl-terminal tail of α1C is critical for the kinetics as well as for voltage and Ca2+dependence of inactivation of α1C channel. Extended segment-substitution studies, reported here, show that amino acid residues 1572–1576 and 1600–1604 of α1C,77 contribute in a cooperative manner to the Ca2+-binding motif(s) responsible for the feedback inhibition of α1C channel by Ca2+ and the kinetics of decay of I Ba in the absence of Ca2+.DISCUSSIONUnlike Ba2+ current, the magnitude of inactivation ofICa depends on the size ofICa so that the time constant of inactivation exhibits a U-shaped voltage dependence. Ca2+ accelerates inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ channel by reducing its open probability by interacting with the α1C subunit (4Neely A. Olcese R. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1895-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,14Zong X.G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in equimolar ratio (15Höfer G.F. Hohenthanner K. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1857-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding site for Ca2+-dependent inactivation has been postulated to be very close to the internal opening of the pore (4Neely A. Olcese R. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1895-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but outside of the conduction pathway (16Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent inactivation was thought to be linked (17de Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to a 29-amino acid domain (1506–1534) with homology to Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif (18Babitch J. Nature. 1990; 346: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent experiments using mutation analysis (5Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), however, have excluded amino acids 1506–1534 from this function. Other observations (5Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) suggest that the location of the site for Ca2+-dependent inactivation may be at least 40 amino acids toward the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide chain.None of the mutations described in this paper have caused appreciable changes in the kinetics of ICa inactivation. However, the kinetics of I Ba decay was changed in a gradual manner (Table II). Since τ f decreases in the following order among the mutants: α1C,77 ≈ α1C,77M2 ≈ α1C,77M5 > α1C,77M1 > α1C,77M3 > α1C,77K ≈ α1C,77L ≈ α1C,77M1,3 ≈ α1C,86, it is likely that retardation of inactivation can be eased through specific structural changes not requiring Ca2+. The values of τ f for the decay of I Ba through the fast mutants are almost identical to those for ICa through the slow channel, suggesting that both modes of inactivation may be thermodynamically similar.It would be reasonable to assume that mutations leading to faster decay rates of I Ba disrupt intraprotein interactions responsible for retardation of inactivation, which otherwise may be achieved through interaction with Ca2+. First, inactivation time constants of I Ba through fast channels (α1C,77K, α1C,77L, α1C,77M1,3, and α1C,86) do not exhibit a U-shaped voltage dependence, and therefore Ba2+ does not influence inactivation in a current-dependent manner. Second, all fast channels are deprived of Ca2+-dependent inactivation.At least two partially overlapping sequences, 1572–1598 in α1C,77L and 1572–1576 plus 1600–1604 in α1C,77M1,3, can transform a conventional slow α1C,77 channel into the fast (α1C,86-like) one. The motif in the 77L mutation can apparently be narrowed to 1572–1587 because its partial mutants, α1C,77M2 and α1C,77M5, exhibit properties of the slow channel.It is the 77M1 motif (1572–1576, Fig. 1) that is common to both fast mutants. However, when each motif is introduced alone, it causes only partial disruption of Ca2+ sensitivity and acceleration ofI Ba. Therefore, for the full effect to occur, M1 must be supplemented with another determinant. The latter may be mobilized either from the adjacent sequence (1577–1587) of the 77L motif or from a distant 77M3 motif. These segments in α1C,77 channel are responsible for Ca2+-dependent inactivation and, in the absence of Ca2+, for the accelerated kinetics ofI Ba inactivation. Thus, these motifs are involved in the gating function of the channel possibly through a direct interaction with the pore.It is possible that 8 out of 11 amino acids (1574–1584, Fig. 1) of α1C,77 represent residues that may form coordination bonds with Ca2+. However, disruption of this motif by insertion of 19 additional amino acids at position 1576 neither changed the kinetics of I Ba decay, nor the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of otherwise invariant channel isoform, α1C,72 (8Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, α1C,77M1 mutant retained some Ca2+-induced inactivation property. Since segment 1577–1584 in both the slow α1C,72 and the fast α1C,77M1,3 channels is intact (Fig. 1), the remaining segment (1572–1575) is apparently critical for gating. Coordination of Ca2+ in Ca2+-binding sites involves seven bonds that are spatially distributed as an octahedron (19Nakayama S. Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 34: 416-448Google Scholar) and can be separated into two vertices. Our data suggest that either of the two motifs, 1577–1587 or 1600–1604, may serve as the second critical element for the channel gating. Additional point mutation analysis is needed to make a final judgment about critical amino acids in the proposed Ca2+-coordination motif responsible for the channel gating.Our data point to the complexity of molecular determinants for Ca2+ dependence of inactivation. In addition to motifs discussed above, there may be other sequences which determine fast inactivation kinetics and loss of Ca2+-induced inactivation of α1C,77K channel. Investigation of these motifs is in progress.

The Ca2+-binding site for Ca2+-dependent inactivation has been postulated to be very close to the internal opening of the pore (4Neely A. Olcese R. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Biophys.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent inactivation was thought to be linked (17de Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X.

Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to a 29-amino acid domain (1506–1534) with homology to Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif (18Babitch J. Nature. 1990; 346: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent experiments using mutation analysis (5Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), however, have excluded amino acids 1506–1534 from this function. Other observations (5Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) suggest that the location of the site for Ca2+-dependent inactivation may be at least 40 amino acids toward the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide chain. None of the mutations described in this paper have caused appreciable changes in the kinetics of ICa inactivation. However, the kinetics of I Ba decay was changed in a gradual manner (Table II). Since τ f decreases in the following order among the mutants: α1C,77 ≈ α1C,77M2 ≈ α1C,77M5 > α1C,77M1 > α1C,77M3 > α1C,77K ≈ α1C,77L ≈ α1C,77M1,3 ≈ α1C,86, it is likely that retardation of inactivation can be eased through specific structural changes not requiring Ca2+. The values of τ f for the decay of I Ba through the fast mutants are almost identical to those for ICa through the slow channel, suggesting that both modes of inactivation may be thermodynamically similar. It would be reasonable to assume that mutations leading to faster decay rates of I Ba disrupt intraprotein interactions responsible for retardation of inactivation, which otherwise may be achieved through interaction with Ca2+. First, inactivation time constants of I Ba through fast channels (α1C,77K, α1C,77L, α1C,77M1,3, and α1C,86) do not exhibit a U-shaped voltage dependence, and therefore Ba2+ does not influence inactivation in a current-dependent manner. Second, all fast channels are deprived of Ca2+-dependent inactivation. At least two partially overlapping sequences, 1572–1598 in α1C,77L and 1572–1576 plus 1600–1604 in α1C,77M1,3, can transform a conventional slow α1C,77 channel into the fast (α1C,86-like) one. The motif in the 77L mutation can apparently be narrowed to 1572–1587 because its partial mutants, α1C,77M2 and α1C,77M5, exhibit properties of the slow channel. It is the 77M1 motif (1572–1576, Fig. 1) that is common to both fast mutants. However, when each motif is introduced alone, it causes only partial disruption of Ca2+ sensitivity and acceleration ofI Ba. Therefore, for the full effect to occur, M1 must be supplemented with another determinant. The latter may be mobilized either from the adjacent sequence (1577–1587) of the 77L motif or from a distant 77M3 motif. These segments in α1C,77 channel are responsible for Ca2+-dependent inactivation and, in the absence of Ca2+, for the accelerated kinetics ofI Ba inactivation. Thus, these motifs are involved in the gating function of the channel possibly through a direct interaction with the pore. It is possible that 8 out of 11 amino acids (1574–1584, Fig. 1) of α1C,77 represent residues that may form coordination bonds with Ca2+. However, disruption of this motif by insertion of 19 additional amino acids at position 1576 neither changed the kinetics of I Ba decay, nor the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of otherwise invariant channel isoform, α1C,72 (8Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, α1C,77M1 mutant retained some Ca2+-induced inactivation property. Since segment 1577–1584 in both the slow α1C,72 and the fast α1C,77M1,3 channels is intact (Fig. 1), the remaining segment (1572–1575) is apparently critical for gating. Coordination of Ca2+ in Ca2+-binding sites involves seven bonds that are spatially distributed as an octahedron (19Nakayama S. Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 34: 416-448Google Scholar) and can be separated into two vertices. Our data suggest that either of the two motifs, 1577–1587 or 1600–1604, may serve as the second critical element for the channel gating. Additional point mutation analysis is needed to make a final judgment about critical amino acids in the proposed Ca2+-coordination motif responsible for the channel gating. Our data point to the complexity of molecular determinants for Ca2+ dependence of inactivation. In addition to motifs discussed above, there may be other sequences which determine fast inactivation kinetics and loss of Ca2+-induced inactivation of α1C,77K channel. Investigation of these motifs is in progress. We are grateful to F. Hofmann and V. Flockerzi for a gift of clones of β1- and α2δ-subunits."

In studies reported here, we demonstrate that binding of both lipoprotein and non-lipoprotein ligands to MSR-A induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity leading to up-regulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression. Specifically, the binding of acetylated low density lipoprotein and fucoidan to MSR-A in human THP-1 macrophages triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins including phospholipase C-γ1 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinase dramatically reduced MSR-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and PKC activity. Moreover, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and PKC reduced uPA activity expressed by THP-1 macrophages exposed to MSR-A ligands. The intracellular signaling response for tyrosine phosphorylation following ligand binding was further demonstrated by using the stable MSR-transfected Bowes cells that express surface MSR-A. These findings establish for the first time a signaling pathway induced by ligand binding to MSR-A and suggest a molecular model for the regulation of macrophage uPA expression by specific ligands of the MSR-A.

Several recent studies have demonstrated alterations in macrophage function following incubation with MSR-A ligands (2Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Vergilio J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Palkama T. Immunology. 1991; 74: 432-438PubMed Google Scholar, 4Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). For example, various MSR-A ligands including Ac-LDL, fucoidan, poly(I), and dextran sulfate have been shown to up-regulate the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) by murine RAW264.7 macrophages (2Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Vergilio J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of uPA expression by fucoidan was protein kinase C-dependent and required protein and RNA synthesis (2Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Vergilio J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the enhanced expression of uPA by RAW264.7 macrophages following Ac-LDL challenge leads to plasmin-dependent extracellular matrix degradation and the release of matrix-bound growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β (29Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Garcia M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of specific ligands to the MSR-A may transmit a signaling response in the cell. However, direct evidence for MSR-mediated signal transduction event has not been demonstrated. In studies reported here, we demonstrate for the first time MSR ligands can trigger signal transduction pathways involving protein kinases in the macrophage. In addition, we demonstrate that macrophage uPA secretion following incubation with lipoprotein and non-lipoprotein ligands of the MSR-A is indeed dependent on MSR-mediated signaling. Finally, using transfection approaches, we confirm that the observed signal transduction is dependent on expression of the MSR-A.

Afterward, membranes were further washed in washing buffer once for 15 min followed by two washes for 5 min. Protein visualization on each immunoblot was developed and performed with Renaissance®, DuPont Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (30Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). THP-1 macrophages were treated with several agonists as described in Fig. 4. At the indicated time, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS (without Ca2+, Mg2+), harvested, and pelleted at 325 × g, 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in TE (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA), containing 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. The assay for total PKC activity was performed as described previously (31Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with the use of the Amersham Protein Kinase C enzyme assay system (Amersham Corp.). The cell pellet prepared was similar to the above PKC assay. To assay the PKA activity in the cell, we followed methods described previously (31Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or used the Life Technologies, Inc., protein kinase A enzyme assay system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human LDL (d 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared as described (32Hajjar D.P. Falcone D.J. Fabricant C.G. Fabricant J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6124-6128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL preparations were occasionally screened for peroxides (33Marshall P. Warso M. Lands W. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (34Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5894-5898Crossref Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses were performed as described (31Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Davis L. Dibner M. Battery J. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 143-146Crossref Google Scholar). The cDNA for the human uPA (36Roldan A.L. Cubellis V.M. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Dano K. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The cDNA for human 28 S ribosomal RNA was a gift from Dr. Iris L. Gonzalez, Hahnemann University, PA. RNA from Northern blots was quantified using a PhosphorImager® (Molecular Dynamics, CA) and normalized by comparison to mRNA of 28 S ribosomal RNA, a constitutively expressed gene. The expression vectors pcDNA3-NMSR representing human normal macrophage scavenger receptor cDNA (N-MSR) was derived from the human MSR type A-I cDNA (37Matsumoto A. Naito M. Itakura H. Ikemoto S. Asaoka H. Hayakawa I. Kanamori H. Aburatani H. Takaku F. Suzuki H. Kobari Y. Miyai T. Takahashi K. Cohen E.H. Wydro R. Housman D.E. Kodama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9133-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The orientation and sequence of this construct were verified and confirmed by both restriction enzyme-digestion mapping and DNA sequencing using Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems model 373 DNA Stretch Sequencer. Bowes cells were sub-passaged the day before transfection by using calcium phosphate transfection method as described (31Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the protocol provided in calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3-NMSR expression vector was transfected into 60% confluent Bowes. The next day, fresh medium was added, and selection began 24 h later with the addition of Geneticin, G418 sulfate (potency 500 μg/ml) to the medium. Transfected cells were then maintained continuously in Geneticin-containing media. On days 14–16, the surviving 60 colonies were picked and subsequently grown into mass transfectant cultures and for other experiments. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human MSR-A antibody (hSRI-2 anti-macrophage scavenger receptor peptide antibody) was used in the flow cytometric analysis. Bowes cells (wild type or transfected) were removed from culture dishes with a rubber policeman, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS containing 1.0% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then aliquoted into 50-μl volumes containing 106 cells and incubated with the hSRI-2 antibody (150 μg/ml) or control rabbit IgG, purified immunoglobulin from serum, for 30 min rotated at 4 °C. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed two times with PBS, 1.0% BSA. Cells were then resuspended in PBS, 1.0% BSA with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and rotated for 30 min and at 4 °C. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and immediately analyzed with a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter Inc.) Protein amounts were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the Bio-Rad protein assay. The effect of lipoprotein and nonlipoprotein ligands of the MSR-A on uPA expression by macrophages was determined. For these studies, we utilized phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-treated human THP-1 monocytes. Following PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into macrophage-like cells, MSR-A expression was up-regulated, and the cells became adherent (30Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Following a 12-h incubation with Ac-LDL or fucoidan, the steady state levels of uPA mRNA in THP-1 macrophages were dramatically increased compared with control cells or cells incubated with LDL. When examined at 24 h, Ac-LDL and fucoidan-induced increase in uPA mRNA levels remained elevated relative to control. In contrast, neither Ac-LDL nor fucoidan altered uPA mRNA levels in THP-1 monocytes, which are devoid of MSR-A activity (30Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We next determined whether the observed increase in uPA mRNA levels (Fig. 1) was reflected by an increase in the expression of uPA activity by THP-1 macrophages. Cells were incubated overnight in media alone or media supplemented with LDL, Ac-LDL, or fucoidan. As seen in Table I, there was a small increase (2-fold) in uPA activity expressed by THP-1 macrophages incubated with LDL. In contrast, incubation with the MSR-A ligands Ac-LDL and fucoidan stimulated uPA activity 5- and 10-fold, respectively. Taken together, these data corroborate and extend our earlier observations utilizing murine RAW264.7 macrophages (2Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Vergilio J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IMSR-A ligands stimulate THP-1 macrophage uPA expressionConditionuPAIncreasemU/5 × 10 5 cells-foldControl172 ± 9LDL378 ± 232.2Ac-LDL767 ± 204.5Fucoidan1697 ± 379.9 Open table in a new tab To determine whether MSR-A ligands trigger specific signal transduction pathways in THP-1 macrophages, tyrosine phosphorylation was determined following incubation with Ac-LDL and fucoidan. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine IgG. As seen in Fig.2 A, incubation of THP-1 macrophages with Ac-LDL and fucoidan induced the appearance of many phosphotyrosyl proteins when compared with cells incubated with media alone or native LDL. MSR-A ligands did not alter the expression of phosphotyrosyl proteins in THP-1 monocytes (data not shown). To investigate further the induction of phosphotyrosyl proteins by ligand binding to the MSR-A, we used the specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A. As shown in Fig. 2 B, preincubation of THP-1 macrophages with herbimycin A blocked the protein tyrosine phosphorylation observed in control cells following the addition of Ac-LDL or fucoidan. Cell lysates derived from THP-1 macrophages incubated with MSR-A ligands contained 150-kDa (pp150) and 85-kDa (pp85) proteins that were prominently identified with anti-phosphotyrosine IgG (Fig.2 A). To explore further the identities of these two phosphotyrosyl proteins, cell lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) IgG or polyclonal anti-phosphoinositol-3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) IgG. Immune complexes were recovered via incubation with protein A/G plus agarose. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine IgG. As seen in Fig.3, the 150-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein was immunoreactive with anti-PLC-γ1 IgG and the 85-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein was immunoreactive with anti-PI 3-kinase IgG. Taken together, these data suggest that MSR-A ligands trigger signal pathways in THP-1 macrophages leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and PI 3-kinase. We have previously demonstrated that inhibitors of PKC were able to decrease the MSR-A ligand-induced uPA activity in RAW264.7 macrophages (2Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Vergilio J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22726-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ac-LDL or fucoidan stimulates uPA expression and protein tyrosine phosphorylation in THP-1 macrophages (Figs. 1 and 2), we next determined whether the observed increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation following incubation with MSR ligands can lead to an activation of PKC in THP-1 macrophages. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, incubation of THP-1 macrophages with Ac-LDL, fucoidan, or PMA (a positive control) quickly increased the PKC activity. In contrast, MSR-A ligands had no effect on PKA activity in THP-1 macrophages (data not shown)."
https://openalex.org/W2083161103,"Earlier studies from our laboratory demonstrated an insulin-mediated increase in cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. In this report, we show that insulin stimulates both CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activation in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cell lines, models of insulin-sensitive tissues. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133, the protein kinase A site, and mutation of serine 133 to alanine blocked the insulin effect.Many of the signaling pathways known to be activated by insulin have been implicated in CREB phosphorylation and activation. The ability of insulin to induce CREB phosphorylation and activity was efficiently blocked by PD98059, a potent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1), but not significantly by rapamycin or wortmannin. Likewise, expression of dominant negative forms of Ras or Raf-1 completely blocked insulin-stimulated CREB transcriptional activity. Finally, we demonstrate an essential role for CREB in insulin activation of fatty-acid synthase and fatty acid binding protein (FABP) indicating the potential physiologic relevance of insulin regulation of CREB.In summary, insulin regulates CREB transcriptional activity in insulin-sensitive tissues via the Raf → MEK pathway and has an impact on physiologically relevant genes in these cells.

Insulin binding to its cell surface receptor results in alterations in the expression of many genes for cellular growth, differentiation, and proliferation.

Open table in a new tab Cyclic AMP regulates the transcription of target genes primarily through the phosphorylation of the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) by protein kinase A (PKA) on serine 133 (of CREB-341 or serine 119 of CREB-327) of the CREB molecule (20Gonzalez G.A.

Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). We demonstrated an analogous response to insulin and identified that this increase in phosphorylation was at least in part due to a decrease in nuclear protein phosphatase-2A activity. These experiments were the first to show a transient increase in CREB phosphorylation and regulation of a nuclear, serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase in response to activation of a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor. Simultaneously, Ginty et al. (24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) described a similar increase in CREB phosphorylation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), which binds to another tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, in PC12 cells. It was stated in this paper that CREB phosphorylation alone by NGF was not sufficient to activate a Gal-4 CREB reporter. Since the time of these initial observations, an explosion of new data on growth factor, Ca2+, and cytokine regulation of CREB has emerged, and a number of post-receptor signaling pathways including ERK 1/2 pathway, pp70 S6 kinase pathway, p38 pathway, and PI-3 kinase pathway have been implicated in CREB regulation. The kinases responsible for serine 133 phosphorylation of CREB in addition to PKA have been in the rsk or MAP KAP kinase family, specifically RSK2, MAP KAP2, MAP KAP3, and MNK.In this report, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 and thereby enhances CREB transcriptional activity in the HepG2, human hepatoma cells, and in mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. CREB phosphorylation and activation increased rapidly following the addition of physiological concentrations of insulin, but no change in CREB DNA binding activity was observed. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI-3 kinase or pp70 S6 kinase did not significantly inhibit insulin-stimulated CREB phosphorylation and activity. However, inhibition of the MAP kinase signaling pathway through the expression of a dominant negative Ras and Raf-1, or with the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, blocked the effects of insulin on CREB. These studies indicate that the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 in response to insulin requires the MAP kinase pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dominant negative CREB, K-CREB, will disrupt insulin activation of transcription from the promoters of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fatty-acid synthetase (FAS), and fatty acid binding protein (FABP) genes indicating a plausible physiologic role for CREB in adipocyte function.DISCUSSIONInsulin is primarily a metabolic hormone that also regulates the proliferation and differentiation of a number of cells and tissues. One of the mechanisms by which insulin regulates transcription is through the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of CREB in Rat-1A cells, hepatoma cells, preadipocyte, and adipocyte cell lines. Since our initial observations that insulin enhanced CREB phosphorylation in primary adipocytes and HIRc cell lines (18Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Klemm D. Hoeffler J. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Bhuripanyo P. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2464-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a number of groups have seen a similar response to other growth factors including NGF and fibroblast growth factor, via the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways (4Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

For these growth factors, both studied in neuronal cell lines, Rsk2 and MAPKAP2, rsk family kinases have been implicated in CREB regulation (4Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 39Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC, elevated intracellular Ca2+, and IgG (via pp70 S6 kinase) can phosphorylate CREB on serine 133. Whether these phosphorylations lead to CREB transactivation appears to depend on cell type and whether the cells are exposed to other factors, such as cAMP agonists simultaneously (40Nakajima T.

This was an unexpected finding since insulin's actions classically oppose cAMP which, at that time, was felt to be the primary regulating agent for CREB (21Lamph W.W. Dwarki V.J. Ofir R. Montminy M.

Subsequently, we demonstrated that this enhanced CREB phosphorylation occurred in Rat-1A fibroblasts overexpressing normal human insulin receptors (HIRc cells) (18Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Klemm D. Hoeffler J. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The relevance of these observations to CREB transcriptional activity was assessed using multiple promoter constructs including the somatostatin CRE reporter and a truncated PEPCK CRE reporter, each of which would be regulated by endogenous CREB and other CRE binding transcription factors. Also, to assess CREB specifically and exclude other CRE binding transcription factors, the Gal4TKLUC reporter system, a Gal4-CREB responsive transcription system was employed. In this system, either insulin or Bt2cAMP stimulated transcription to a similar extent in HIRc cells. Thus, insulin-mediated CREB phosphorylation appeared to be transcriptionally relevant.CREB was initially characterized as a substrate of PKA. Activation of PKA by increases in intracellular cAMP results in the increase of CREB transcriptional transactivation activity through the phosphorylation of CREB serine 133 (22Lee C.Q. Yun Y.

We have shown here that the treatment of hepatoma, fibroblast, and adipocyte cells with insulin also results in the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133. The importance of CREB serine 133 phosphorylation following insulin treatment was further highlighted by experiments in which mutation of serine 133 to alanine completely blocked the insulin responsiveness of a chimeric Gal4-CREB protein in transfection assays. Mutation of other individual CREB serine residues to alanines had no significant effect on insulin responsiveness. These observations were consistent with data from other groups regarding the commonality of serine 133 for CREB transcriptional regulation by cAMP, NGF, fibroblast growth factor, and calcium (21Lamph W.W.

E.-B. Reusch and D. J. Klemm, unpublished data. This is consistent with the observations from other groups (33Armstrong R. Wen W. Meinkoth J. Taylor S. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) wherein cAMP stimulation led to a refractory period for subsequent activation. This effect was thought to be mediated by a non-kinase-dependent binding of RSK kinase to CREB binding protein (CBP) and a subsequent disruption of CREB-CBP-induced transcription (40Nakajima T.

Our data support the hypothesis that multiple signaling pathways leading to CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activation may not be synergistic.Deciphering the pathway activated by insulin responsible for CREB phosphorylation and activation is important because the multiple post-receptor pathways activated by insulin presented a number of possibilities. The data presented in this paper strongly support the role of Ras → Raf-1 → MEK → ERK1/2 kinase pathway which is analogous to the observations of Ginty et al. (24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

The relevance of CREB regulation by insulin is highlighted by our demonstrating that activation of transcription from the PEPCK, FAS, and FABP gene promoters is blocked by dominant negative CREB in adipocytes. It will be interesting to define the phenotypic consequences of this novel mechanism of insulin-modulated gene expression. Insulin binding to its cell surface receptor results in alterations in the expression of many genes for cellular growth, differentiation, and proliferation. Specific insulin responsive elements have been identified in the promoters of several genes (1Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol.

Previously, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of CREB was stimulated by insulin in primary rat adipocytes and HIRc cells (18Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Klemm D. Hoeffler J. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Bhuripanyo P. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B.

This observation posed an important question regarding the impact of insulin-mediated CREB phosphorylation on CREB transactivation and the post-receptor pathways activated by insulin responsible for this effect. Cyclic AMP regulates the transcription of target genes primarily through the phosphorylation of the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) by protein kinase A (PKA) on serine 133 (of CREB-341 or serine 119 of CREB-327) of the CREB molecule (20Gonzalez G.A.

Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). We demonstrated an analogous response to insulin and identified that this increase in phosphorylation was at least in part due to a decrease in nuclear protein phosphatase-2A activity. These experiments were the first to show a transient increase in CREB phosphorylation and regulation of a nuclear, serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase in response to activation of a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor. Simultaneously, Ginty et al. (24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) described a similar increase in CREB phosphorylation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), which binds to another tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, in PC12 cells. It was stated in this paper that CREB phosphorylation alone by NGF was not sufficient to activate a Gal-4 CREB reporter. Since the time of these initial observations, an explosion of new data on growth factor, Ca2+, and cytokine regulation of CREB has emerged, and a number of post-receptor signaling pathways including ERK 1/2 pathway, pp70 S6 kinase pathway, p38 pathway, and PI-3 kinase pathway have been implicated in CREB regulation. The kinases responsible for serine 133 phosphorylation of CREB in addition to PKA have been in the rsk or MAP KAP kinase family, specifically RSK2, MAP KAP2, MAP KAP3, and MNK. In this report, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 and thereby enhances CREB transcriptional activity in the HepG2, human hepatoma cells, and in mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. CREB phosphorylation and activation increased rapidly following the addition of physiological concentrations of insulin, but no change in CREB DNA binding activity was observed. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI-3 kinase or pp70 S6 kinase did not significantly inhibit insulin-stimulated CREB phosphorylation and activity. However, inhibition of the MAP kinase signaling pathway through the expression of a dominant negative Ras and Raf-1, or with the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, blocked the effects of insulin on CREB. These studies indicate that the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 in response to insulin requires the MAP kinase pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dominant negative CREB, K-CREB, will disrupt insulin activation of transcription from the promoters of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fatty-acid synthetase (FAS), and fatty acid binding protein (FABP) genes indicating a plausible physiologic role for CREB in adipocyte function. DISCUSSIONInsulin is primarily a metabolic hormone that also regulates the proliferation and differentiation of a number of cells and tissues. One of the mechanisms by which insulin regulates transcription is through the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of CREB in Rat-1A cells, hepatoma cells, preadipocyte, and adipocyte cell lines. Since our initial observations that insulin enhanced CREB phosphorylation in primary adipocytes and HIRc cell lines (18Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Klemm D. Hoeffler J. Draznin B.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2464-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a number of groups have seen a similar response to other growth factors including NGF and fibroblast growth factor, via the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways (4Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

For these growth factors, both studied in neuronal cell lines, Rsk2 and MAPKAP2, rsk family kinases have been implicated in CREB regulation (4Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 39Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC, elevated intracellular Ca2+, and IgG (via pp70 S6 kinase) can phosphorylate CREB on serine 133. Whether these phosphorylations lead to CREB transactivation appears to depend on cell type and whether the cells are exposed to other factors, such as cAMP agonists simultaneously (40Nakajima T.

Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The importance of the work presented in this paper is the observation that in cell line models of classic, insulin-sensitive tissues, hepatocytes and adipocytes, insulin regulates this ubiquitous transcription factor that has been demonstrated to have a pivotal role in cellular differentiation (24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 40Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R.

This was an unexpected finding since insulin's actions classically oppose cAMP which, at that time, was felt to be the primary regulating agent for CREB (21Lamph W.W. Dwarki V.J. Ofir R. Montminy M.

Subsequently, we demonstrated that this enhanced CREB phosphorylation occurred in Rat-1A fibroblasts overexpressing normal human insulin receptors (HIRc cells) (18Reusch J.E.-B. Hsieh P. Klemm D. Hoeffler J. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The relevance of these observations to CREB transcriptional activity was assessed using multiple promoter constructs including the somatostatin CRE reporter and a truncated PEPCK CRE reporter, each of which would be regulated by endogenous CREB and other CRE binding transcription factors. Also, to assess CREB specifically and exclude other CRE binding transcription factors, the Gal4TKLUC reporter system, a Gal4-CREB responsive transcription system was employed. In this system, either insulin or Bt2cAMP stimulated transcription to a similar extent in HIRc cells. Thus, insulin-mediated CREB phosphorylation appeared to be transcriptionally relevant. CREB was initially characterized as a substrate of PKA. Activation of PKA by increases in intracellular cAMP results in the increase of CREB transcriptional transactivation activity through the phosphorylation of CREB serine 133 (22Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the treatment of hepatoma, fibroblast, and adipocyte cells with insulin also results in the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133. The importance of CREB serine 133 phosphorylation following insulin treatment was further highlighted by experiments in which mutation of serine 133 to alanine completely blocked the insulin responsiveness of a chimeric Gal4-CREB protein in transfection assays. Mutation of other individual CREB serine residues to alanines had no significant effect on insulin responsiveness. These observations were consistent with data from other groups regarding the commonality of serine 133 for CREB transcriptional regulation by cAMP, NGF, fibroblast growth factor, and calcium (21Lamph W.W.

Interestingly, although insulin or Bt2cAMP alone stimulates CREB activity, the simultaneous addition of both agents produced only a minimal increase in CREB transcriptional activity in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, rather than an additive or synergistic stimulation. 3J. E.-B. Reusch and D. J. Klemm, unpublished data. This is consistent with the observations from other groups (33Armstrong R. Wen W. Meinkoth J. Taylor S. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) wherein cAMP stimulation led to a refractory period for subsequent activation. This effect was thought to be mediated by a non-kinase-dependent binding of RSK kinase to CREB binding protein (CBP) and a subsequent disruption of CREB-CBP-induced transcription (40Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our data support the hypothesis that multiple signaling pathways leading to CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activation may not be synergistic. Deciphering the pathway activated by insulin responsible for CREB phosphorylation and activation is important because the multiple post-receptor pathways activated by insulin presented a number of possibilities. The data presented in this paper strongly support the role of Ras → Raf-1 → MEK → ERK1/2 kinase pathway which is analogous to the observations of Ginty et al. (24Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) with NGF. The relevance of CREB regulation by insulin is highlighted by our demonstrating that activation of transcription from the PEPCK, FAS, and FABP gene promoters is blocked by dominant negative CREB in adipocytes. It will be interesting to define the phenotypic consequences of this novel mechanism of insulin-modulated gene expression. We acknowledge Elizabeth Millard for technical assistance.

Based on Northern hybridization, mRNA for GC-G was predominantly expressed in lung, intestine, and skeletal muscle.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but disruption of the GC-C gene has not resulted in an adverse phenotype when mice are raised in a disease-free environment. In fact, GC-C null mice are resistant to STa- or enterotoxigenic bacteria-induced diarrhea (16Schulz S. Lopez J.A. Kuhn M. Garbers D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1590-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The three orphan guanylyl cyclase receptors are expressed in sensory tissues, two in the retina (17Yang R.-B. Foster D.C.

GC-D, the olfactory-specific guanylyl cyclase is a marker for an apparently unique subset of olfactory neurons that also express phosphodiesterase type 2 (21Julifs D.M. Fülle H.-J. Zhao A. Houslay M.D. Garbers D.L. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3388-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The number of mammalian guanylyl cyclase receptors is not known, but the recent work of Yu et al. (22Yu S. Avery L. Baude E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), showing the existence of 29 or more guanylyl cyclases in Caenorhabditis elegans, many or most of which are expressed in distinct sensory neurons, raises the question of whether a significant number of orphan guanylyl cyclase receptors remain to be identified in the mammal. In 1990, Schulzet al. (12Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) obtained a PCR product from intestinal cDNA that was unique compared with the known mammalian cyclases described above. Within a short period of time, a partial length clone that included the cyclase catalytic and protein kinase-like domains was obtained from an intestinal cDNA library, but the full-length cDNA clone proved difficult to isolate, possibly due to mRNA secondary structure. Here, the sequence for the full-length cDNA clone is presented. The novel plasma membrane guanylyl cyclase receptor (GC-G) retains Cys residues conserved in the guanylyl cyclase-A receptor but is not activated by natriuretic peptides. The apparent receptor is expressed in highest amounts in lung, intestine, and skeletal muscle where it likely interacts with a unique class or subclass of ligands that signal through cGMP. Poly(A)+RNA prepared from small intestinal mucosa of the rat was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on conserved sequences within the catalytic domains of membrane and cytoplasmic forms of guanylyl cyclase (23Yuen P.S.T. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into M13 and sequenced. In addition to several known guanylyl cyclases, a unique sequence was amplified that was later shown to be GC-G. When the unique PCR product, designated SIM3, was used to screen a small intestine cDNA library, a clone corresponding to GC-C, the heat-stable enterotoxin receptor, was obtained (12Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sequence of SIM3 was extended using 3′-RACE (24Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The sense guanylyl cyclase primer and an oligo(dT) antisense primer were used in the PCR, and a single product of 550 base pairs was obtained and sequenced. This PCR product encoded the 3′-end of GC-G and was subsequently used as a probe to screen the same library from which GC-C was obtained (12Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Two partial length clones were obtained, both of which contained unspliced introns. Numerous cDNA libraries constructed in various manners were screened, and the longest cDNA clone obtained extended no further than about 300 base pairs 5′ of the putative transmembrane segment; this is the beginning of exon 6 based on other guanylyl cyclase sequences. A combination of 5′-RACE and genomic sequence information yielded exons 1–5. Predicted exon 1 was joined to exon 2 by splice overlap PCR and then assembled with exons 2–5 and the cDNA clone encoding exon 6 through the poly(A)+ tail. The final construct was sequenced. For detection of GC-G mRNA, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde-1% agarose gel, then transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was probed with a radioactively labeled cDNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of GC-G (a part of the extracellular coding region; see Fig.6 B) or to part of the catalytic domain (see Fig.6 C). Following hybridization overnight at 42 °C, the membrane was washed at 60 °C in 0.5 × SSC, and mRNA corresponding to GC-G was visualized by autoradiography for 7 days at −80 °C (see Fig. 6 B). For detection of GC-G mRNA in rat lung, the membrane was washed at 60 °C in 1 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA and exposed to a film for 3 days at −80 °C (see Fig. 6 C). For detection of mRNA in H293 cells expressing GC-G, 2.5, 4.5, or 7.0 μg of total RNA were fractionated on a formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel and processed as described above except for washing conditions. The membrane was washed for 10 min at 65 °C with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, for 20 min at 65 °C with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and for 1 min at room temperature with 0.1 × SSC. The mRNA corresponding to GC-G was visualized using a phosphoimager (Fuji Biosystems). The full-length GC-G cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. For transient transfections, COS-7 cells were grown on 100-mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method with 5 μg of plasmid (pCMV5, GC-G/pCMV5, or GC-A/pCMV5) per 100-mm plate. For stable expression, H293 cells were cotransfected with a pCMV5/GC-G construct and a pCMV5 construct containing a oubain-resistance gene using lipofection. H293 cells were grown in Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for the first 24 h, which was then replaced with DMEM supplemented as described for COS-7 cells. For selection of ouabain-resistant clones, 0.5 μm ouabain was included in the medium. After several rounds of amplification, isolated oubain-resistant clones were tested for expression of GC-G by Western blot analysis. COS-7 cells expressing GC-G were harvested 48 h after transfection; GC-G/H293 cells were grown to confluency before harvest. For preparation of membranes, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged for 20 min at 2 °C and 100,000 × g. The membrane pellet was washed twice with homogenization buffer, and membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer by sonication. Assays were performed in a total volume of 100 μl with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm IBMX, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm NaN3, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm GTP, 0.5 μCi/100 μl assay [α-32P]GTP (NEN, 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), and 5 mm MnCl2 or MgCl2 as well as 0.1% Triton X-100 as indicated. Reactions were started by the addition of membrane fraction to the assay mix and tubes were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with zinc acetate/sodium carbonate and radiolabeled [α-32P]cGMP was isolated and quantified as described in Ref. 25Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. For determination of cGMP accumulation in COS-7 cells transiently expressing GC-G, 100-mm plates were washed twice with 2 ml of DMEM medium (see above, without additives) and incubated with DMEM containing 0.25 mm IBMX at 37 °C. After 10 min, this medium was exchanged with DMEM containing 0.25 mm IBMX without additives or with 1 μm ANP, 1 μm BNP, 1 μm CNP, or 1 μm STa and incubated for an additional 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of 1 N perchloric acid, and cGMP concentrations were estimated as described (25Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membranes from control or GC-G stably expressing H293 cells were prepared as described above.125I-ANP binding was basically assayed as described previously with the exception that Whatman GF/C filters were used for filtration (26Wong S.K.F. Ma C.-P. Foster D.C. Chen A.-Y. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30818-30822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with 200 pm125I-ANP in the absence or presence of 0.1 μmcompeting unlabeled ANP for 1 h at room temperature. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of GC-G (EEEAKVPEIL) was conjugated to PPD (2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole, Serumstaaten Institute) using glutaraldehyde. The purified conjugate was used to raise a polyclonal antiserum in rabbits. For Western blotting, 25–50 μg of membrane protein of GC-G expressing COS-7 or H293 cells was separated on 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and nonspecific protein-binding sites of the membranes were blocked by incubation with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:1,000 dilution of primary antibody. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of a horseradish-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) in TBST. After washing the membranes three times with TBST, protein bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL, Amersham Corp.). The chromosomal location of the gene encoding GC-G was determined by the use of a DNA panel derived from 94 progeny of an interspecific backcross (C57BL/6J ×Mus spretus) of females with C57BL/6J males (Jackson BSB, Jackson Lab Backcross DNA Panel Map Service; Ref. 27Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Eppig J.T. Ko M.S. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). A sense primer (5′-TCTCAGAACTCAGAAGGAAAACTGC) in intron 1 (based on the rat genomic sequence) was used with an antisense primer in exon 2 (5′-ATGCTGGCAGTGATGTTGAAATGGA). A size polymorphism was detected (1 kb for M. spretus and 1.2 kb for C57BL/6). Backcross progeny DNA was typed using a standard PCR containing 125 ng of genomic DNA with 25 pmol of each primer in a total volume of 25 μl. DNA was denatured in an initial 5-min incubation at 95 °C followed by 5 min at 72 °C, during which time Taq polymerase was added. Thermal cycling was for 40 cycles (45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) followed by a 20-min incubation at 72 °C. Reaction products were separated on an 0.8% agarose gel with parental samples for comparison. The cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence for GC-G are given in Fig. 1. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 1100 amino acids containing a putative signal peptide of 43 amino acids. GC-G is similar to the other membrane forms of guanylyl cyclase (Fig.2) in that a single transmembrane domain divides the protein approximately in half, separating an extracellular region from two prominent intracellular domains (protein kinase-like and cyclase catalytic). Of seven cysteine residues within the extracellular domain of GC-G, five align with five of six found in GC-A (Fig. 3). These cysteine residues are also conserved in other guanylyl cyclases (Fig. 3; Ref. 22Yu S. Avery L. Baude E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The ANP clearance receptor binds natriuretic peptides and contains an extracellular domain whose primary amino acid sequence is 30–40% identical to GC-A or GC-B (2Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.-S.

Recent mapping of the disulfide bonding pattern of this receptor demonstrates that the first two Cys and second two Cys residues (from the amino terminus) form internal disulfide bonds (29Stults J.T.

The site of ANP binding has been mapped just to the amino-terminal side of the second disulfide loop (31McNicoll N. Gagnon J. Rondeau J.J. Ong H. DeLean A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12950-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region is critical for ligand binding. Limited sequence information from genomic clones of GC-G also demonstrates that intron/exon boundaries are at the same positions in the GC-G gene as in the GC-A and the ANP clearance receptor genes (32Yamaguchi M. Rutledge L.J. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20414-20420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Saheki T. Mizuno T. Iwata T. Saito Y. Nagasawa T. Mizuno K.U. Ito F. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11122-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intron/exon boundaries are different in GC-C and in the sensory guanylyl cyclases (34Yang R.-B. Fülle H.-J. Garbers D.L. Genomics. 1996; 31: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 2S. Schulz, unpublished results. and thus GC-G appears more closely related evolutionarily to the natriuretic peptide receptors than to other guanylyl cyclases (Fig. 2). A comparison of the extracellular domains of GC-G with the ANP clearance receptor, and a grouping of amino acids according to major chemical properties, shows that the two extracellular domains are more than 40% similar (Fig. 4).Figure 2Dendrogram comparing mammalian guanylyl cyclases. Shown is the similarity of the extracellular domains of guanylyl cyclases A-G (GC-A-G) and of the ANP-clearance (ANP-C) receptor. GC-G appears most closely related to the family of natriuretic peptide receptors (GC-A, GC-B, and ANP-C receptor).

The high degree of similarity of GC-G with the natriuretic peptide receptor family within the putative ligand binding domain, as well as an apparent conservation of gene structure when compared with the GC-A or ANP clearance receptor genes, furthermore suggests that the putative ligand for GC-G may resemble a natriuretic peptide-like structure. To confirm that GC-G encodes guanylyl cyclase activity and to facilitate searches for a putative ligand, the cDNA was expressed in either COS-7 or H293 cells. Cyclic GMP concentrations in either COS-7 or H293 cells were much higher than that seen when GC-A or GC-B are overproduced in the same cells (2Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.-S. Lowe D.G. Chin H. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 35Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cells do not effectively regulate GC-G activity (Fig. 5). Guanylyl cyclase activity was estimated in membranes prepared from H293 cells stably expressing GC-G (Fig. 5 A). The addition of high concentrations (1 μm) of ANP, BNP, CNP, or STa had little, if any, effect on cell cGMP concentrations in COS-7 cells transiently expressing GC-G (Fig. 5 B). Since cGMP concentrations appeared poorly regulated by either COS-7 or H293 cells transfected with GC-G, direct binding assays were designed to determine whether GC-G might bind such a peptide with high affinity but fail to demonstrate regulation. However, no detectable 125I-ANP binding to the GC-G overproducing cells was detected (data not shown). Based on Northern hybridization, mRNA for GC-G is most prominent in lung, intestine, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 6, B andC). Various cell lines have been examined by reverse transcription-PCR and also contain detectable GC-G mRNA (data not shown). Multiple sized mRNAs were observed in the various tissues using a cDNA probe encoding the extracellular domain or the catalytic domain. A cDNA probe to the apparent intracellular region of GC-G also yielded three positive-hybridizing mRNA species (36Kojima M. Hisaki K. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, when the mRNA of H293 cells stably expressing GC-G was examined, only mRNA at the size of the predicted product was detected (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, the multiple sized mRNAs in the various tissues likely reflects alternative splicing. That GC-G is in various peripheral tissues raises the possibility that the ligand for GC-G circulates. Its expression in skeletal muscle is particularly provocative since a role for cyclic GMP in muscle has been largely ignored. Conceivably, however, GC-G is a component of the smooth muscle vasculature in skeletal muscle as opposed to skeletal muscle itself. If so, then possibly GC-G stimulation would lead to increased blood flow to the muscle in certain physiological states, such as in response to exercise. Our attempts to identify cells in which GC-G is expressed byin situ hybridization, however, have so far not been successful. Based on these analyses, the gene for GC-G (gucy2g) maps to the distal region of mouse chromosome 19 and close to the anchor locus D19Mit1. This region is syntenic with human chromosome 10 q24–26. There do not appear to be genetic diseases in the human that have been mapped to the GC-G locus (Fig. 7). GC-G represented a particularly difficult full-length cDNA to isolate. The recently reported sequence of a soluble guanylyl cyclase that contains a partial protein kinase homology domain (KsGC; Ref. 36Kojima M. Hisaki K. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) appears to represent a partial-length GC-G cDNA clone. The reported open reading frame for KsGC contains only a few differences from GC-G. However, the 3 base pairs upstream of the suggested initiation Met diverges from that of GC-G at a position identical to that of intron 12 of the GC-A gene (32Yamaguchi M. Rutledge L.J. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20414-20420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the ksGC mRNA may contain an unspliced intron. That KsGC represents a splice variant of GC-G is not ruled out even though the proposed initiation Met does not coincide with an ideal Kozak consensus sequence (36Kojima M. Hisaki K. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

Its catalytic region (γ-B) comprises two complement control protein (CCP) modules, a short activation peptide (ap), and a serine protease domain (SP). A baculovirus-mediated expression system was used to produce recombinant truncated fragments from this region, deleted either from the first CCP module (CCP2-ap-SP) or from both CCP modules (ap-SP). The aglycosylated fragment CCP2-ap-SPag was also expressed by using tunicamycin. The fragments were produced at yields of 0.6–3 mg/liter of culture, isolated, and characterized chemically and then tested functionally by comparison with intact C1s and its proteolytic γ-B fragment. All recombinant fragments were expressed in a proenzyme form and cleaved by C1̄r to generate active enzymes expressing esterolytic activity and reactivity toward C1 inhibitor comparable to those of intact C1̄s. Likewise, the activated fragments γ-B, CCP2-ap-SP, and ap-SP retained C1̄s ability to cleave C2 in the fluid phase. In contrast, whereas fragment γ-B cleaved C4 as efficiently as C1̄s, the C4-cleaving activity of CCP2-ap-SP was greatly reduced (about 70-fold) and that of ap-SP was abolished. It is concluded that C4 cleavage involves substrate recognition sites located in both CCP modules of C1̄s, whereas C2 cleavage is affected mainly by the serine protease domain. Evidence is also provided that the carbohydrate moiety linked to the second CCP module of C1̄s has no significant effect on catalytic activity.

The first component of complement comprises two homologous, yet distinct modular serine proteases C1r 1The abbreviations used are: the nomenclature of complement proteins is that recommended by the World Health Organization; activated components are indicated by an overbar,e.g. C1̄s; the nomenclature of protein modules is that defined by Bork and Bairoch (1Bork P.

C1r is responsible for intrinsic C1 activation, a two-step process first involving autolytic C1r activation and then C1̄r-mediated cleavage of proenzyme C1s. The active enzyme C1̄s is a highly specific protease with trypsin-like specificity that mediates limited proteolysis of C4 and C2, the two protein substrates of C1̄, thereby triggering activation of the classical pathway of complement in response to infection by various microorganisms (2Cooper N.R.

C4 cleavage occurs in the fluid phase and generates fragment C4b, which has the transient ability to bind covalently to the surface of the target. Cleavage of the second substrate C2, in contrast, takes place after prior formation of a C4b-C2 complex and yields C4b-C2a, the protease responsible for cleavage of complement protein C3 (5Müller-Eberhard H.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 5: 21-42Google Scholar). This double proteolytic activity of C1̄ is controlled by C1 inhibitor, a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family, which reacts stoichiometrically with both C1̄r and C1̄s to form covalent protease-inhibitor complexes, resulting in disruption of the C1̄s-C1̄r-C1̄r-C1̄s tetramer (2Cooper N.R. Adv. Immunol. 1985; 37: 151-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Human C1s is synthesized as a 673-residue single chain zymogen which, upon activation by C1̄r, is cleaved between Arg422 and Ile423 to yield two disulfide-linked polypeptides, the N-terminal A chain comprising a series of five protein modules and the serine protease B domain (6Tosi M.

Limited proteolysis of C1̄s with plasmin yields a C-terminal fragment γ-B, comprising two contiguous complement control protein (CCP) modules, a 15-residue intermediary segment homologous to the activation peptide in chymotrypsinogen, and the serine protease domain (9Villiers C.L. Arlaud G.J. Colomb M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4477-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The CCP modules (originally known as short consensus repeats) are structural motifs of about 60 residues homologous to those mostly found in various complement regulatory proteins known to interact with components C3b and/or C4b (10Reid K.B.M. Bentley D.R. Campbell D.R. Chung L.P. Sim R.B. Kristensen T. Tack B.F. Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 230-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The C-terminal CCP module of C1s bears a heterogeneous, complex-typeN-linked oligosaccharide with both biantennary and triantennary species (11Pétillot Y. Thibault P. Thielens N.M. Rossi V. Lacroix M. Coddeville B. Spik G. Schumaker V.N. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on chemical cross-linking and three-dimensional homology modeling, it was shown recently that this module closely interacts with the serine protease domain on the side opposite to both the active site and the Arg422-Ile423 bond cleaved upon activation (12Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From a functional point of view, the fact that the proteolytic fragment γ-B retains a functional active site (9Villiers C.L. Arlaud G.J. Colomb M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4477-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and studies based on the use of monoclonal antibodies indicating that the γ segment may be involved in C4 binding (13Matsumoto M. Nagaki K. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2907-2912PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsumoto M. Nagaki K. Kitamura H. Kuramitsu S. Nagasawa S. Seya T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2743-2750PubMed Google Scholar) together suggest that γ-B may represent the catalytic region of C1̄s. However, no precise information is available yet on the respective role of the serine protease domain and CCP modules in the various aspects of C1̄s catalytic activity. The present study provides identification of the domains of C1s involved in its activation by C1̄r, proteolytic activity toward C4 and C2, and reactivity toward C1 inhibitor, based on baculovirus-mediated expression of truncated recombinant fragments from the γ-B region.

The absorption coefficients (A (1%, 1 cm) at 280 nm) used for the recombinant fragments ap-SP (17.0) and CCP2-ap-SP (16.4) were calculated from their amino acid composition by the method of Edelhoch (26Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar), and their molecular weights were determined by mass spectrometry analysis (see “Results”). The following primers were obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) and used to amplify the desired human C1s cDNA sequences in a polymerase chain reaction using VentR polymerase, according to established procedures: GAAGATCTTGACTGTGGCATTCCT (sense for CCP2-ap-SP); GGAATTCTTAGTCCTCACGGGGGGT (antisense for CCP2-ap-SP and ap-SP); andGAAGATCTTCCAGTCTGTGGAGTC (sense for ap-SP). The underlined sequences represent bases introduced either at the 5′ end of the C1s cDNA to create a BglII site for in-frame cloning into the pNT-Bac expression vector or at the 3′ end to create anEcoRI site. The pNT-Bac vector was constructed from the baculovirus expression vectors pVT-Bac (27Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Laliberté F. Khouri H.E. Vernet T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and pFast Bac1TM (Life Technologies Inc.). Briefly, the segment comprised between the EcoRV and KpnI sites was excised from plasmid pVT-Bac and introduced between theSnaBI and KpnI sites in pFast Bac1. The resulting vector contains the polyhedrin promoter and the multiple cloning site region of pVT-Bac (Fig. 1). It also encodes the melittin signal peptide previously used to enhance secretion of the papain precursor (27Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Laliberté F. Khouri H.E. Vernet T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and is therefore adapted to the production in a secreted form of fragments derived from the C-terminal end of proteins. The amplified DNAs were designated CCP2-ap-SP, encoding residues 343–673 in mature human C1s, and ap-SP, encoding residues 408–673. These were purified and cloned into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) intermediate vector (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Both fragments were excised with BglII and EcoRI and introduced into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pNT-Bac vector by means of the T4 DNA ligase to create the plasmids pNT-Bac/CCP2-ap-SP and pNT-Bac/ap-SP. Clones containing the insert were identified by restriction enzyme analysis and checked for the absence of mutations introduced by polymerase chain reaction by double-stranded DNA sequencing using theT7SequencingTM kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The insect cells, Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21), were provided by Dr. Jadwiga Chroboczek (Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble). The cells were maintained in TC100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by using the Bac-to-BacTM system (Life Technologies, Inc.) based on site-specific transposition of an expression cassette carried by the pNT-Bac-based recombinant plasmids into a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) propagated in Escherichia coli (28Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transposition of the pNT-Bac/CCP2-ap-SP and pNT-Bac/ap-SP plasmids into DH10Bac E. coli cells and selection of recombinant bacteria were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The recombinant bacmids were purified using the Qiagen midiprep DNA purification system (Qiagen S.A., Courtaboeuf, France) and transfected into Sf21 cells with cellfectin in Sf900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The transfection supernatant was decanted 4 days later, centrifuged, and stored at 4 °C until use. The recombinant viruses, designated rCCP2-ap-SP andrap-SP, were titered by virus plaque assay and amplified as described by King and Possee (29King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London1992: 111-114Google Scholar). Sf21 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml in spinner flasks or 2 × 107 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with the recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2–3 in Sf900 II SFM medium containing 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) was added for the production of the aglycosylated form of the CCP2-ap-SP fragment. After 96 h at 28 °C, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation, and diisopropylphosphorofluoridate was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. The culture supernatant was dialyzed against 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.6, and loaded at 2 ml/min onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer containing 1 mmdiisopropylphosphorofluoridate. Elution was carried out with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 350 mm in 30 min. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were identified by Western blot analysis and dialyzed against 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Further purification was achieved by high pressure hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a TSK-Phenyl 5PW column (Beckman) equilibrated in the same buffer containing 1 mm diisopropylphosphorofluoridate. Elution was carried out by decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration from 1.5m to 0 in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Both recombinant fragments were dialyzed against 50 mmtriethanolamine HCl, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, concentrated to 0.2–0.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration on MicrosepTMmicroconcentrators (molecular weight cut-off = 10,000) (Filtron), and stored at −20 °C. N-terminal sequence analyses were performed either on soluble proteins or after SDS-PAGE analysis and electrotransfer, using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer as described previously (12Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) technique was used for mass spectrometry analysis of the recombinant proteins, using a Voyager Elite XL instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA), under conditions described previously (30Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Activation of proenzyme C1s and the recombinant fragments CCP2-ap-SP and ap-SP was tested by incubation of the proteins (6.5 μm) in the presence of active C1̄r (C1̄r/protein molar ratio = 0.045) for various periods at 37 °C, in 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. In the case of C1s and CCP2-ap-SP, activation was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions and subsequent quantification by gel scanning of the two-chain structure characteristic of the active state of the proteins (see Fig. 2). Activation of the smaller fragment ap-SP was measured by its ability to cleave the synthetic substrateN α-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester. The proteolytic activity of C1̄s and its activated fragments γ-B, CCP2-ap-SP, and ap-SP toward C2 and C4 was measured by incubation of the protein substrates in the presence of the enzymes for various periods at 37 °C followed by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions and quantification by gel scanning of the fragments characteristic of the C1̄s-mediated cleavage (respectively, C2a and C2b, and the C4α′ chain of the C4b fragment) (31Kerr M.A. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 171: 99-107Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Schreiber R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For determination of the kinetic parameters, the C2 and C4 concentrations ranged from 0.5 × 10−6m to 4 × 10−6m, with fixed enzyme concentrations of 2 × 10−9m and 1.2 × 10−9m, respectively. All experiments were conducted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, whereas enzyme dilutions were performed in 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, 145 mmNaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin. The esterolytic activity of C1̄s and its various activated fragments was measured againstN α-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester, using an alcohol dehydrogenase/NAD-coupled spectrophotometric test, as described previously (33Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reactivity of the activated proteases toward C1 inhibitor was assessed by incubation in the presence of equimolar amounts of C1 inhibitor for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions of the formation of the covalent C1 inhibitor-serine protease B chain complexes (20Reboul A. Arlaud G.J. Sim R.B. Colomb M.G. FEBS Lett. 1977; 79: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously (12Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the recombinant proteins after SDS-PAGE was performed by electrotransfer to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocking of unoccupied sites with 5% non-fat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. The immobilized proteins were visualized by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-C1̄s antiserum, followed by a goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin fraction conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. The modular structures of human C1s and of the various truncated fragments used in the present study are depicted in Fig. 2. Construction of the recombinant baculoviruses, transposition of the pNT-Bac/CCP2-ap-SP and pNT-Bac/ap-SP plasmids into DH10BacE. coli cells, and transfection of the corresponding recombinant bacmids into Sf21 cells were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The virus titer of the transfection supernatants after amplification was about 107plaque forming units/ml in both cases. Infection of Sf21 cells by the supernatants was conducted for various periods at 28 °C, and the amount of recombinant proteins secreted into the culture medium was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Under normal culture conditions, protein bands with the expected apparent molecular weights (see below) became detectable at 48 h, their intensity increasing progressively to reach a plateau at 96 h. In contrast, secretion of the CCP2-ap-SP fragment in the presence of tunicamycin reached a maximum at 72 h and decreased considerably after 96 h. Analysis of protein production in the cell pellets showed kinetic profiles similar to those observed for the supernatants. Under optimal production conditions, the amounts of recombinant protein secreted into the culture medium were estimated to be approximately 0.6 μg/ml for ap-SP, 3 μg/ml for CCP2-ap-SP, and 1.5 μg/ml for the aglycosylated fragment CCP2-ap-SP (CCP2-ap-SPag) produced in the presence of tunicamycin. The recombinant fragments were initially purified by fractionation of the culture supernatants by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia). Both fragment CCP2-ap-SP and CCP2-ap-SPag yielded visible peaks at 280 nm eluting during the ascending salt gradient, slightly later than the C1̄s γ-B fragment produced by limited proteolysis. Fragment ap-SP, in contrast, was not retained on the column and eluted in the large flow-through fraction. Final purification was achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. As illustrated in Fig.3, fragment CCP2-ap-SP eluted as a single peak at the end of the descending ammonium sulfate gradient, slightly later than the whole C1̄s γ-B fragment. Its aglycosylated form eluted essentially at the same position, whereas the shorter fragment ap-SP eluted at the middle of the gradient and was therefore significantly more hydrophilic. The amounts of purified proteins produced were typically about 0.4, 1.5, and 0.5 mg per liter of culture for fragments ap-SP, CCP2-ap-SP, and CCP2-ap-SPag, respectively. The recombinant fragments were essentially pure as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4). Each yielded a single band under both non-reducing and reducing conditions, indicating that they were in the proenzyme form, with apparent molecular weights of about 30,000 (ap-SP), 40,000 (CCP2-ap-SP), and 38,000 (CCP2-ap-SPag), consistent with the predicted values. No sign of proteolytic degradation was observed on the gels upon storage of the recombinant proteins for several months at −20 °C. Edman degradation of the purified fragments CCP2-ap-SP and CCP2-ap-SPag yielded a single sequenceAsp-Leu-Asp-(Cys)-Gly-Ile-Pro-Glu-Ser-Ile … in both cases, corresponding to the segment Asp343-Ile350 of human C1s preceded by the two residues Asp-Leu expected to be added at the N terminus, due to the introduction of bases at the 5′ end of the cDNA to create aBglII site (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the same way, fragment ap-SP yielded a single sequenceAsp-Leu-Pro-Val-(Cys)-Gly-Val-Pro-Arg-Glu … derived from the segment Pro408-Glu415 of C1s, corresponding to the N-terminal end of the activation peptide. Analysis of fragment ap-SP by MALDI mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass of 29,627 ± 15 Da, consistent with a sequence comprising residues Asp-Leu followed by the C-terminal segment Pro408-Asp673 of C1s (calculated mass = 29,634 Da). In the same way, as shown in Fig.5 A, fragment CCP2-ap-SPag yielded a mass value of 36,701 ± 18 Da, in full agreement with that predicted for the sequence Asp-Leu-(Asp343 … Asp673) (36,707 Da). Analysis of the glycosylated fragment CCP2-ap-SP consistently yielded a wide, heterogeneous peak, centered on mass values ranging from 37,824 ± 19 Da to 38,389 ± 19 Da (as illustrated in the mass spectrum shown in Fig. 5 B), depending on the preparation. Thus, the corresponding deduced masses for the oligosaccharide attached to Asn391 ranged from 1,114 ± 19 Da to 1,682 ± 19 Da. Considering that glycoproteins expressed in baculovirus/insect cells systems mainly bear high mannose oligosaccharides (34Yeh J.-C. Seals J.R. Murphy C.I. van Halbeek H. Cummings R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11087-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and in keeping with our previous studies (11Pétillot Y. Thibault P. Thielens N.M. Rossi V. Lacroix M. Coddeville B. Spik G. Schumaker V.N. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the above values are consistent with the occurrence of short, heterogeneous oligosaccharides comprising twoN-acetylglucosamine residues and a variable number of mannose residues ranging from 4 to 8 (calculated masses of the carbohydrate moiety = 1,055 and 1,704, respectively). The significantly high differences between the experimental and calculated values likely arise from the fact that the former are average figures which do not necessarily correspond to a round number of mannose residues (see Fig. 5 B). In summary, N-terminal sequence and mass spectrometry analyses clearly showed that the recombinant proteins had the expected sequences and that a heterogeneous high mannose oligosaccharide was attached to Asn391 of fragment CCP2-ap-SP. As judged from SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions, fragments CCP2-ap-SP, CCP2-ap-SPag, and ap-SP retained a monochain structure upon prolonged incubation at 37 °C, indicating that the preparations were free of contaminating proteases. To test their activation by C1̄r, i.e. their ability to be split at the Arg422-Ile423 bond cleaved upon activation of intact C1s, each fragment was incubated for various periods at 37 °C in the presence of C1̄r. SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions indicated that all three fragments were cleaved by C1̄r: (i) in the case of CCP2-ap-SP and CCP2-ap-SPag, a two-chain structure became clearly visible, as shown by the appearance of bands corresponding to the serine protease domain and to the CCP2-ap moieties; (ii) the apparent molecular weight of ap-SP was slightly decreased, suggesting removal of the short N-terminal activation peptide. Edman degradation of the C1̄r-treated fragments gave evidence for a second sequence 423Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly-Ser-Asp-Ala …, in addition to the single N-terminal sequence yielded upon analysis of the monochain fragments (see above), confirming C1̄r-mediated cleavage of the 422Arg-Ile423 bond in all cases. A comparative kinetic analysis of the activation of proenzyme C1s and the recombinant fragments CCP2-ap-SP and ap-SP by C1̄r showed that all three proteins were activated"

The consensus sequence of ITIM is (V/I)-X-Y-X-X-(L/V) (7Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M. Wagtmann N. Rajagopalan S. Berrada K. Yi T. Kinet J.-P. Long E.O.

In B cells, when F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-membrane immunoglobulin antibody induce cross-linkage of the surface B cell antigen receptors, a signal transduction cascade is elicited through the receptor that results in B cell proliferation and differentiation into antibody-producing cells. In contrast, stimulation with intact anti-membrane Ig antibody results in co-cross-linkage between the B cell antigen receptor and FcγRIIB, in attenuated B cell signal transduction due to the phosphorylation of ITIM of FcγRIIB, and binding of src homology 2 (SH2)-containing proteins, which inhibit calcium signaling pathway (2Amigorena S.

The importance of the inhibitory nature of FcγRIIB in the humoral immune response in vivo was demonstrated in the FcγRIIB-deficient mice generated by gene targeting (8Takai T. Ono M. Hikida M. Ohmori H. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The proteins to be associated with the phosphorylated ITIM sequence of FcγRIIB was verified to be an SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1 (9D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and an SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, SHIP, in B cells, whereas in mast cells SHIP was shown to be preferentially recruited (10Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human and mouse NK cells express two kinds of inhibitory molecules containing ITIMs. One of which, human killer cell inhibitory receptor (KIR), is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to Ig superfamily (6Wagtmann N.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 2306-2310PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, human CD94 and mouse Ly-49 molecules are type II transmembrane glycoprotein with C-type lectin structure (13Chang C. Rodriguez A. Carretero M. Lopez-Botet M. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2433-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Despite these quite different structures, both Ly-49 and KIR recognize allelic groups of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on target cells. Engagement of these inhibitory receptors results in a dominant negative signal that prevents lysis of the target cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of their ITIMs and recruitment of SHP-1 was shown to be critical for the inhibitory function (7Burshtyn D.N. Scharenberg A.M. Wagtmann N. Rajagopalan S. Berrada K. Yi T.

LeBlanc P.A. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of gp49 molecules is unknown, it was demonstrated that the co-ligation of gp49B1 and a high affinity IgE receptor FcεRI on the surface of mast cells suppresses FcεRI-mediated exocytosis, suggesting that this molecule possibly functions as an inhibitory receptor (19Katz H.R. Vivier E. Castells M.C. McCormick M.J. Chambers J.M. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10809-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfection experiments have indicated that the cytoplasmic tail of gp49B1 inhibits lysis of major histocompatibility complex class I-negative cell line by mouse and human NK cell lines, showing the inhibitory nature of the gp49B1 molecule in NK cells (20Rojo S. Burshtyn D.N. Long E.O. Wagtmann N. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 9-12PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the physiological ligand for gp49 as well as the biochemical characteristics of the inhibitory cascade of the molecule should be valuable for understanding the mode of action that regulates activating and inhibitory signaling in cells of the immune system. We report here that both of the phosphorylated ITIM-like sequences of gp49B1 bind SHP-1 and SHP-2, whereas the phosphotyrosyl second ITIM-like sequence associates with SHIP from RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, we found that the gp49B gene and the cognate gp49A gene are co-localized on the B4 region of mouse chromosome 10, which is apparently not a syntenic position of human chromosome 19, where genes for the KIR family are present (6Wagtmann N.

After the PCR amplification and digestion with HindIII and BamHI, the gp49B cDNA was cloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pUC19. The cDNA insert was labeled with random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Otsu, Japan) and [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, ∼3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.), and was used to screen a 129/Sv mouse genomic library (Stratagene): 8.3 × 105 plaques were screened under stringent conditions (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting two positive clones were plaque-purified, and they were subcloned into the plasmid pUC19 or pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bone marrow-derived mast cells from C57BL/6 or B10.A mice were prepared as described previously (25Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V.

RBL-2H3 cells (obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Tokyo) were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum. For the detection of cellular proteins that bind to two ITIM-like sequences found in the cytoplasmic portion of gp49B, four biotinylated peptides were synthesized: the sequences are DPQGIVYAQVKP-amide (in one-letter code, designated as Y1, corresponding to amino acid residues 294–305, see Ref. 17Castells M.C. Wu X. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8393-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DPQGIV(pY)AQVKP-amide (pY1), ETQDVTYAQLCI-amide (Y2, residues 316–327), and ETQDVT(pY)AQLCI-amide (pY2), where each N-terminal residue is biotinylated, and (pY) denotes a phosphotyrosine residue. RBL-2H3 cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells were solubilized by adding extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm disodium EDTA, 10% glycerol) to the cell pellet. The extract was then incubated on ice for 10 min, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. The soluble extract was precleared with 1.0 ml of avidin-Sepharose FF beads/107 cell eq (Pharmacia) in extraction buffer. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the extract was then incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of the biotinylated peptide avidin-Sepharose beads/107 cell eq, followed by precipitation. The pelleted beads were washed four times by centrifugation in extraction buffer containing 0.1% gelatin and devoid of aprotinin and leupeptin, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 1 min to liberate immunoprecipitated materials, and centrifuged. The affinity-isolated materials or cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation using 7.5% gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.) using a Milliblot electroblotting system. The blot was first blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with 0.5 μg/ml rabbit anti-SHP-1 or anti-SHP-2 IgG (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or rabbit anti-SHIP antiserum (generously provided by Dr. K. M. Coggeshall, Ohio State University) and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. The blot was then treated with the peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (clone RG-16, Sigma) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). The direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization method was used for chromosomal assignment of the mouse gp49B gene. Preparation of R-banded chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed as described by Matsuda et al. (26Matsuda Y. Harada Y.-N. Natsuume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and Matsuda and Chapman (27Matsuda Y. Chapman V.M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The chromosome slides were hardened at 65 °C for 2 h, denatured at 70 °C in 70% formamide in 2 × SSC, and dehydrated in cold ethanol (5 min each in 70 and 100%). The mouse 6.7-kb genomic DNA fragment inserted in SacI site of pBluescript were labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled DNA fragment was ethanol-precipitated with a 10-fold excess of mouse Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), sonicated salmon sperm DNA and E. coli tRNA, and then denatured at 75 °C for 10 min in 100% formamide. The denatured probe was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization solution to make final concentration of 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The mixed probe was placed on the denatured chromosome slides and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The slides were washed in 50% formamide in 2 × SSC at 37 °C for 20 min and in 2 × SSC and 1 × SSC for 20 min each at room temperature. After rinsing in 4 × SSC, they were incubated under coverslips with fluoresceinated avidin (Vector Laboratories) at a 1:500 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4 × SSC for 1 h at 37 °C. They were washed sequentially with 4 × SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4 × SSC and 4 × SSC for 10 min each on a shaker, rinsed with 2 × SSC, and stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Excitation at wavelength 450–490 nm (Nikon filter set B-2A) and near 365 nm (UV-2A) was used for observation. Kodak Ektachrome ASA 100 films were used for microphotography. Recombinant mice used in this study were generated by mating male feral-derived mouse stocks, Mus spretus, with female C57BL/6J, and backcrossing the F1 female with male M. spretus (28Matsuda Y. Imai T. Shiomi T. Saito T. Yamauchi M. Fukao T. Akao Y. Seki N. Ito T. Hori T. Genomics. 1996; 34: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA derived from kidneys of each backcross mouse was digested with restriction endonucleases. The resulting fragments were separated on 0.8% agarose gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The DNA was used to determine the genotype of each animal by Southern blot hybridization following the standard protocol. According to the result obtained by the cytogenetic mapping using fluorescence in situ hybridization, microsatellite DNA markers (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) for linkage analysis were chosen. All PCR reactions were performed in a total 15-μl reaction mixture containing 125 ng genomic DNA and 15 pmol oligonucleotide primers. Amplification conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized under UV light with ethidium bromide staining after separation on polyacrylamide gel. gp49B has two possible ITIM sequences in its 74-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (17Castells M.C. Wu X. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8393-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Katz H.R. Austen K.F. J.

A. 1996; 93: 10809-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One is IVYAQV, and the other is VTYAQL: they are separated by 18 amino acid residues. On the other hand, its cognate molecule gp49A has a short cytoplasmic region comprised of 42 amino acid residues, and has no such inhibitory sequences within this region (16Arm J.P. Gurish M.F. Reynolds D.S. Scott H.C. Gartner C.S. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15966-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection experiments have shown that the whole cytoplasmic portion of gp49B is sufficient for the inhibitory nature of the gp49B molecule in NK cells (20Rojo S. Burshtyn D.N. Long E.O. Wagtmann N. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 9-12PubMed Google Scholar). A question arises whether the possible ITIM sequences of gp49B actually function as inhibitory motifs that interact with any cellular component or not. To address this issue, we attempted to detect cellular proteins associating with these sequences. Cellular proteins of RBL-2H3 cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells were lysed and then incubated with tyrosine-phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated synthetic peptide matching each ITIM-like sequence found in the cytoplasmic portion of gp49B. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig.1, both anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2 antibodies detected a ∼65- and ∼70-kDa protein, respectively, bound to pY1 and pY2 but not to the corresponding nonphosphotyrosyl peptides. Unexpectedly, we found that anti-SHIP antiserum clearly detected a ∼145-kDa protein associating with pY2 but not with pY1 and the corresponding nonphosphotyrosyl peptides. Detection of possible association of Syk kinase using anti-Syk antiserum was not successful (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that each phosphorylated ITIM-like sequence mainly binds SHP-1 and SHP-2, whereas the second possible ITIM also associates with SHIP from RBL-2H3 extract. Inhibition of cellular activation signal by SHP-1 is associated with inhibition of early tyrosine phosphorylation events, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and secondary influx of extracellular Ca2+. On the other hand, SHIP inhibits only the secondary influx of extracellular Ca2+. Thus, we postulate that the two possible ITIM sequences in gp49B can function as inhibitory motifs within the cells. Since the recruitment of SHP-1, SHP-2 and SHIP is dependent on the presence of the phosphotyrosine residue, the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in ITIM-like sequences of gp49B should be prerequisite for recruitment of SHP-1 and SHIP in stimulated cells such as mast cells. Since the gp49-specific antibody is not available at present, we cannot verify that the cytoplasmic tail of gp49B is tyrosine-phosphorylated within the cells. Possible candidates that phosphorylate the tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of gp49B are a src family kinase or a Syk/Zap-70 family kinase such as Lyn or Syk, but this issue remains to be clarified. A possibility remains that the preference of the association with SHP-1 or SHIP could be dependent on the cell type. As mentioned above, two related genes have been identified for mouse gp49, gp49A and gp49B, by cloning of cDNA for each molecule (16Arm J.P. Gurish M.F. Reynolds D.S. Scott H.C. Gartner C.S.

Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15966-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several groups of genes with almost the same structural characteristics but different in their cytoplasmic regions are revealed. One example is a group of KIR that comprises inhibitory KIR molecules and the molecules with nearly the same extracellular domains but with no inhibitory cytoplasmic domains such as some of the NK-associated transcripts (for review, see Refs. 29Leibson P.J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 655-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Long E.O. Burshtyn D.N. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 31Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 86-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 32Raulet D.H. Held W. Cell. 1995; 82: 697-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The genes for them have been found to be clustered in human chromosome 19q13 (22Baker E. D'Andrea A. Phillips J.H. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Chromosome Res. 1995; 3: 511Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is interesting to test a hypothesis that gp49 genes also locate in a limited area of a mouse chromosome. The first step toward this issue, we have isolated the genomic clones for gp49B using a gp49B cDNA fragment as a probe. We initially characterized the exon/intron structures of one of the positive clones (clone 1, harboring a 16-kb insert and containing all of the exons for gp49B). Unexpectedly, we found that this genomic clone 1 also contained a 3′ part of the gene for gp49A as shown in Fig.2. An overlapping clone, clone 2, was also shown to contain all of the gp49A exons and a 5′ part of the gene for gp49B by sequencing analysis. Thus, we found that gp49A and gp49B genes are in the juxtaposition and in the same orientation: they are apart by 4.4 kb (Fig. 2). In addition, sequencing analysis of the gp49A and gp49B genes from 129/Sv mouse revealed that there is no nucleotide substitution in the exon sequences when compared with the respective genes from BALB/c and C3H mice, respectively (data not shown), supporting the notion that gp49 genes are not polymorphic within a species. The chromosomal assignment of the mouse gp49B gene was performed by direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization using a mouse genomic DNA fragment as a biotinylated probe. As shown in Fig.3, the signals of the gp49B gene were detected on the R-band-positive B4 band of mouse chromosome 10 (33Evans E.P. Lyon M.F. Rastan S. Brown S.D.M. Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1446-1448Google Scholar). For fine linkage mapping of the mouse gp49B gene, genomic DNAs of C57BL/6J, M. spretus and their F1 were digested with six different restriction endonucleases to find the restriction fragment length variants using Southern blot hybridization. The restriction fragment length variant with HindIII, 6.1 kb in C57BL/6J and 5.4 kb in M. spretus, was used to examine the concordance of segregation of the restriction fragment length variant with the segregation of microsatellite markers, D10Mit3,D10Mit38, D10Mit20, D10Mit31, andD10Mit7. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of multiple recombinations among the loci on the same chromosome. Comparative pairwise loci analyses showed the gene order and recombination frequency for gp49B on mouse chromosome 10 (genetic distance in centimorgan ± S.E. and the number of recombinations in parentheses) as follows: centromere, D10Mit3, 3.5 ± 2.0 (3/86), D10Mit38, 3.5 ± 2.0 (3/86),gp49B, 1.2 ± 1.2 (1/86), D10Mit20, 3.5 ± 2.0 (3/86), D10Mit31, 10.5 ± 3.3 (9/86),D10Mit7, telomere (Fig. 4). It should be emphasized that the conserved linkage homology to human chromosome 19, where KIR genes have been localized, has not been identified in this region. Recent progress in structural and functional aspects of KIR have proposed an intriguing hypothesis that there may be several unidentified groups of molecules with positive and negative regulatory functions in human as well as in mouse. In fact, human immunoglobulin-like transcript-1, -2, and -3 (34Samaridis J. Colonna M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 35Cella M. Dohring C.

In this report, we showed that the cytoplasmic ITIM sequences of gp49B1 are able to recruit SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP upon tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that the inhibitory function of gp49B1 is due to the recruitment of these phosphatases to the phosphorylated ITIM and inhibiting the activation signaling such as the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Studies on the ligand and activatory/inhibitory signaling cascades of gp49 molecules will facilitate the understanding of the mode of regulation of cells in the immune system."

The heme complexes of heme oxygenase isoforms-1 and -2 have similar O2 and CO binding properties. The O2 affinities are very high,K O2 = 30–80 μm−1, which is 30–90-fold greater than those of mammalian myoglobins. The O2 association rate constants are similar to those for myoglobins (k O2′ = 7–20 μm−1 s−1), whereas the O2 dissociation rates are remarkably slow (k O2 = 0.25 s−1), implying the presence of very favorable interactions between bound O2 and protein residues in the heme pocket. The CO affinities estimated for both isoforms are only 1–6-fold higher than the corresponding O2 affinities. Thus, heme oxygenase discriminates much more strongly against CO binding than either myoglobin or hemoglobin. The CO binding reactions with the ferrous α-hydroxyheme complex are similar to those of the protoheme complex, and hydroxylation at the α-meso position does not appear to affect the reactivity of the iron atom. In contrast, the CO affinities of the verdoheme complexes are >10,000 times weaker than those of the heme complexes because of a 100-fold slower association rate constant (k CO′ ≈ 0.004 μm−1 s−1) and a 300-fold greater dissociation rate constant (k CO ≈ 3 s−1) compared with the corresponding rate constants of the protoheme and α-hydroxyheme complexes.

Heme oxygenase (HO) 1The abbreviation used is: HO, heme oxygenase. 1The abbreviation used is: HO, heme oxygenase. is an amphipathic microsomal protein that catalyzes the regiospecific oxidative degradation of iron protoporphyrin IX (heme hereafter) to biliverdin, CO, and iron in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase as an electron donor (1Tenhunen R.

In the catalytic cycle the enzyme first binds 1 equivalent of hemin. This binding results in the formation of the heme-enzyme complex, which exhibits spectral properties similar to those of ferric myoglobins and hemoglobins (4Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4224-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4487-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first electron donated from the reductase reduces the hemin iron to the ferrous state, and then O2 binds rapidly to form a metastable oxy complex (6Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron donation to the oxy form initiates the three-step conversion of oxyheme to the ferric iron-biliverdin complex through α-hydroxyheme and verdoheme intermediates (Scheme FS1). The final step involves electron donation from the reductase to convert the ferric iron-biliverdin complex to ferrous iron and biliverdin (7Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, heme participates both as a prosthetic group and as a substrate, a property unique to heme oxygenase (5Yoshida T.

HO-1, an inducible form with a molecular mass of 33 kDa, is distributed mainly in reticuloendothelial cell-rich tissues such as spleen and liver. HO-2, with a molecular mass of 36 kDa, is expressed constitutively and is distributed mainly in the brain and testis. The amino acid sequence similarity between HO-1 and HO-2 is about 40%. However, both isoforms display the same enzymatic activity, active site structure, and heme iron coordination and electronic structures, hence the molecular mechanism of enzyme action is considered to be analogous between the two isoforms (8Ishikawa K.

The heme-HO complex appears to have an axial ligand coordination structure that is similar to that in myoglobins and hemoglobins. Resonance Raman studies on the oxy form of the heme-HO complex show that the bound oxygen molecule assumes a highly bent configuration because of strong interactions with the residues in the distal pocket (14Takahashi S.

(Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have shown that CO can inhibit the HO enzyme activity by binding to either the ferrous heme- and verdoheme-HO complexes. Yoshida and his co-workers (19Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that when a single turnover enzyme reaction is carried out using an 80% air and 20% CO gas mixture, the CO complex of the verdoheme-HO is generated. This shows that in the presence of 80% air, 20% CO does not completely inhibit the first two mono-oxygenase cycles of HO catalysis, but the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin may be inhibited. However, a quantitative assessment of CO inhibition requires accurate determinations of the O2 and CO affinities of the ferrous heme-HO complex. A low CO affinity was reported for verdoheme-myoglobin (20.Fujii, H., Studies on the Electronic Structure and Reactivities of Catalytic Intermediates in Heme EnzymesPh.D. thesis, 1990, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.Google Scholar), but the affinity of verdoheme-HO for CO has not been determined.To this end, we have examined the reactions of O2 and CO with the heme, α-hydroxyheme, and verdoheme complexes of heme oxygenase. The heme-HO complex has an extremely high O2affinity because of a very slow O2 dissociation reaction. However, the CO affinities of the heme and α-hydroxyheme complexes are very similar to those of mammalian myoglobins and hemoglobins. In contrast, the verdoheme-HO complexes have extraordinary low affinities for CO. We attribute the low CO affinity of the verdoheme-HO complex to the partial ferric character of the verdoheme iron atom. The high O2 affinity of the heme-HO complex and the low CO affinity of the verdoheme-HO effectively prevent product inhibition by CO that is generated during catalysis of hemin degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTruncated water-soluble forms of recombinant rat HO-1 (30 kDa) and human HO-2 (28 kDa) and the corresponding heme, α-hydroxyheme, and verdoheme complexes were prepared as described previously (8Ishikawa K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The CO forms of the heme-, α-hydroxyheme-, and verdoheme-HO complexes were prepared by diluting the ferrous forms of the complexes into the anaerobic buffer solutions containing known CO concentrations. The oxy form of the heme-HO complexes was made as follows. First, the ferric heme-HO complex was reduced by sodium dithionite in deoxygenated buffer. Then the reduced form of the complex was passed through a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with buffer containing the known O2 concentrations. Formation of the complex was confirmed by optical absorption measurements.O2 and CO binding reactions were measured using stopped-flow and flash photolysis techniques as described previously (21Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3168-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sample integrity was confirmed by the optical absorption spectra measured before and after the flash photolysis measurements. All the measurements were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 20 °C.RESULTSThe association and dissociation rate constants for O2and CO binding to ferrous forms of the heme-HO-1 and HO-2 complexes are listed in Table I. The kinetic traces for bimolecular rebinding of O2 to the heme-HO complex after flash photolysis are monophasic, and the observed rates depend linearly on O2 concentration (Fig. 1). The association rate constants,k′ O2, are similar to those of mammalian myoglobins. However, the O2 dissociation rate constants, k O2, of the heme-HO complexes are ∼0.25 s−1, about 100 times slower than the dissociation rat constants of myoglobins (15 s−1) (22Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The O2 equilibrium constants,K O2, are 28 and 77 μm−1 for the HO-1 and HO-2 complexes, respectively, 30–90 times greater than the equilibrium constant of myoglobin. The O2 affinity of the heme-HO complexes is equal to or higher than that of leghemoglobin, which has one of the highest known O2 affinities.Table IParameters for O 2 and CO binding to the heme-HO complexes, human myoglobin, and leghemoglobin in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7, 20 °CProteinO2 bindingCO bindingRatioK CO/K O2k′O2kO2KO2k′COkCOKCOμm −1 s −1s −1μm −1μm −1 s −1s −1μm −11.3 (50 ± 10%)1505.4HO-16.90.25280.0090.31 (50 ± 10%)341.23.0 (50 ± 10%)4205.5HO-2200.26770.00720.64 (50 ± 10%)891.2Myoglobin19220.860.760.0223541Leghemoglobin1305.623170.00782,20095 Open table in a new tab Figure 1The observed rate (k obs) dependence of the O2concentration for the O2 reaction with the ferrous heme-HO complex after the flash photolysis measured in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7, measured at 20 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The CO association reactions of both the HO-1 and HO-2 heme complexes are biphasic with the faster phase showing a bimolecular rate that is about 4∼5 times larger than that of the slower phase. The amplitudes of the two phases are independent of CO concentrations (between 0.1 and 1 mm). The association rate constants,k′CO, for the slower phases are between 0.3 and 0.6 μm−1 s−1, which are similar to those of myoglobin (0.5–0.8 μm−1s−1) (22Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The kinetic traces for CO dissociation from the heme-HO complexes are monophasic. The dissociation rate constants,k CO, (0.007–0.009 s−1) are slightly smaller than those of myoglobin (∼0.02 s−1) (22Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Because of the biphasic nature of the CO association reactions, the overall CO equilibrium association constants,K CO, can only be estimated as between 34 and 150 μm−1 and 89 and 420 μm−1 for the HO-1 and HO-2 complexes, respectively. It should be noted that the ratios of CO and O2 affinities,K CO/K O2, are between 1.2 and 5.6 for the heme-HO complex. These ratios are much smaller than those for myoglobin (∼40) and hemoglobin (∼200) (23Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobins and Myoglobins and Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). Thus, O2 binding to the ferrous heme iron in HO is inhibited to a much lesser extent by CO than it is in myoglobin and hemoglobin.The reaction of CO with the ferrous α-hydroxyheme-HO-1 complex is also biphasic (Table II), and the association rate constants for the fast and slow phases are similar to those of the heme-HO-1 complex. Again, CO dissociation is monophasic, and the dissociation rate constant is essentially the same as that of the heme-HO complex. Thus, the hydroxyl group at the α-meso position does not affect the reactivity of the ferrous iron toward CO. The oxy form of the α-hydroxyheme-HO complex is unstable (17Matera K. Takahashi S.

The rebinding reaction is monophasic after flash photolysis. Plots of the dependence of the observed pseudo-first order rate constant, k obs, on CO concentration are shown in Fig.2 A for the verdoheme-HO-1 complex. The slope and the y axis intercept of this plot yield association and dissociation rate constants equal to 0.0054 μm−1 s−1 and 2.9 s−1, respectively, and a CO equilibrium association constant equal to 0.0018 μm−1. Thus, the CO affinity of the verdoheme-HO-1 is more than 10,000 times weaker than that of the protoheme complex (Table II). Low CO affinity is confirmed by the CO equilibrium curve generated by plotting the absorption changes induced by the flash photolysis as a function of the CO concentration (Fig. 2 B). Because the quantum yield of the CO form of the verdoheme-HO complex is almost 1 (15Takahashi S. Mansfield Matera K. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the absorption changes after photolysis are proportional to the equilibrium fraction degree of saturation with this ligand. The experimental points are compared with a CO equilibrium curve calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants. The agreement between the calculated and observed results is excellent. The verdoheme HO-2 complex has the CO binding parameters similar to those of the corresponding HO-1 complex. As in the case of α-hydroxyheme-HO, an oxy form of the verdoheme-HO complex cannot be obtained for kinetic measurements. Verdoheme-myoglobin also shows a large CO dissociation rate, but the association rate and equilibrium constants of the myoglobin complex are about 10 times greater than those of the HO complex (20.Fujii, H., Studies on the Electronic Structure and Reactivities of Catalytic Intermediates in Heme EnzymesPh.D. thesis, 1990, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.Google Scholar) (TableII).Figure 2Panel A, observed rate (k obs) dependence of the CO concentration for the CO reaction with the verdoheme-HO complex after the flash photolysis measured in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.Panel B, absorbance changes at 636 nm induced by the flash photolysis of the CO-bound verdoheme-HO complexes.

Barry J.K. Brucker E.A. Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Arredondo-Peter R. Dean J.M. Klucas R.V. Srath G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for the extraordinarily high O2 affinity for the heme-HO complex is different from that for leghemoglobin. The high O2 affinity of leghemoglobin is caused by a very large association rate constant that is determined by enhanced reactivity of the heme iron toward O2 (24Hargrove M.S. Barry J.K. Brucker E.A. Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Arredondo-Peter R. Dean J.M. Klucas R.V. Srath G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the heme-HO complex, high O2 affinity is caused by a very slow O2 dissociation rate constant. Decreases in O2dissociation rate constants for myoglobins and related heme proteins are associated with increases in hydrogen bonding or other favorable electrostatic interactions between bound oxygen and surrounding amino acids. For example, replacing the distal valine [E11] with an asparagine residue in sperm whale myoglobin decreasesk O2 from 15 s−1 to 0.5 s−1 presumably by creating a second hydrogen bond with the bound ligand (22Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The presence of strong interactions between distal residues in heme oxygenase and bound O2 has already been proposed based on resonance Raman studies (14Takahashi S. Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6002-6006Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and on cobalt EPR work (25Ikeda-Saito M. Fujii H. Mansfield Matera M. Takahashi S. Migita C.T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ishimura Y. Shimada H. Suematsu M. Oxygen Homeostasis and Dynamics. Springer-Velag, Tokyo, 1998: 304-314Google Scholar).The CO association reactions with the heme- and α-hydroxyheme-HO complexes are biphasic. One of the possible origins of the biphasic reaction is heme orientational disorder around the porphyrin α-γ axis, which has been reported for the heme-HO complex (26Hernandez G. Wilks A. Paoless R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, if this were the case, the O2 association reaction would also be expected to be biphasic, but this is not the case. In addition, the ligand binding properties of myoglobin are independent of the heme orientation disorder (27Light W.R. Rohlfs R.J. Palmer G. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 46-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the structural origin of the biphasic CO association reactions with the heme- and α-hydroxyheme-HO complex is not clear.There are subtle differences in the kinetic parameters between the HO-1 and HO-2 complexes. The neutral imidazole form of histidine is the proximal ligand in both isoforms (8Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the hemin-enzyme complex, the pK a value of the acid-base transition of the HO-1 complex (pK a 7.6) is 0.9 unit lower than that in the HO-2 complex (pK a 8.5) (8Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the polarities of the distal pockets appear to be different between the isoforms, which might explain the small difference in kinetic parameters.As shown in Scheme FS2, α-hydroxyheme undergoes a redox-linked transition between ferric oxophlorin and ferrous α-hydroxyheme (17Matera K. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the ferrous form, the prosthetic group assumes a porphyrin macrocycle structure with a hydroxyl group at the α-meso position (structure 2 of Scheme FS2). The α-hydroxyl group should be electron-donating, and electron withdrawal or electron donation from heme side chains has been shown to affect the reactivity of the heme iron (23Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobins and Myoglobins and Their Reactions with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 28Sono M. Smith P.D. McCray J.A. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1418-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CO binding properties of the α-hydroxyheme-HO complex are similar to those of the heme complex, indicating that the α-meso hydroxyl group does not affect either heme iron reactivity or iron-CO bond strength. The porphyrin π-electron spin density at the α-meso carbon could be so low that the electron donation at this position does not affect the iron reactivity appreciably. The Raman results show that the Fe-CO and C-O stretching frequencies of the CO-bound α-hydroxyheme-HO complex are similar to those of the heme-HO complex (15Takahashi S. Mansfield Matera K. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This implies that the electronic states of the Fe-CO unit and the Fe-C bond strengths are similar in these complexes, which is consistent with our kinetic results.Figure FS2Top, the iron redox state-linked conversion between ferric oxophlorin (structure 1) and ferrous hydroxyheme (structure 2) (17Matera K.

The resonance Raman studies show that a significant contribution fromstructure 3 is present in ferrous verdoheme-HO (15Takahashi S. Mansfield Matera K. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because CO binds only to ferrous iron, the presence of a significant amount of a ferric character will reduce the reactivity of verdoheme-HO toward CO significantly.The Fe-CO stretching frequency of the CO verdoheme-HO complex is 474 cm−1, whereas those for the heme- and α-hydroxyheme-HO complexes are 503 and 508 cm−1, respectively (10Takahashi S.

Clearly, the Fe-CO bond order in verdoheme-HO is lower than that in the heme- and α-hydroxyheme complexes.

Here we have investigated the role of this loop in the oligomerization of chromogranin A. Reduction of the disulfide bond or the addition of an excess of an N-terminal chromogranin A fragment containing the loop (CgA1–60) resulted in the dissociation into monomers of the chromogranin A dimer found at pH 7.4 and 6.4 and of the chromogranin tetramer found at pH 5.4. The addition of an excess of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the conserved C-terminal domain of chromogranin A (CgA406–431) had no effect on the chromogranin dimers at pH 7.4 and 6.4 and resulted in the dissociation of the chromogranin A tetramers at pH 5.4 into dimers. Fluorescence energy transfer experiments using fluorescently labeled CgA1–60 showed that the N-terminal disulfide-bonded loop has a high affinity for homodimerization (K D = 20 nm at pH 6.4), which was sufficient to mediate dimerization of full-length chromogranin A. Association and dissociation of loop-mediated chromogranin A dimerization approached completion within a few seconds. Our results imply that chromogranin A homodimerizes shortly after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and that the loop-mediated homodimeric state is an essential prerequisite for its sorting, in the trans-Golgi-network, to secretory granules.

Protein secretion is a fundamental cellular function. Virtually all eukaryotic cells secrete proteins in parallel with their synthesis via the constitutive pathway. Certain cells such as exocrine cells, endocrine cells, and neurons in addition secrete proteins via the regulated pathway; they store a subset of their secretory proteins in a specialized vesicular organelle, the secretory granule, and release them upon appropriate stimulation. The regulated pathway of protein secretion diverges from the constitutive pathway at the level of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; CgA, chromogranin A; CgB, chromogranin B; DTT, dithiothreitol; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; FIU, fluorescence intensity units. , where two distinct types of secretory vesicles are formed, constitutive secretory vesicles and immature secretory granules. In the course of their conversion to mature secretory granules, immature secretory granules give rise to vesicles thought to mediate constitutive-like secretion. Protein sorting takes place at both the level of the TGN and the level of immature secretory granules (1Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev.

Concerning the sorting of secretory proteins at the level of the TGN, two important features have been elucidated. One is the selective aggregation of regulated secretory proteins in the lumen of the TGN, which is a means of segregating them from constitutive secretory proteins (4Gerdes H.-H. Rosa P. Phillips E.

In the case of pro-opiomelanocortin, the N-terminal disulfidebonded loop has been shown to bind to the membrane-associated form of carboxypeptidase E (14Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F.-S. Chen H.-C.

Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of CgB, reduction of the disulfide bond is sufficient to cause complete missorting to constitutive secretory vesicles (11Chanat E. Weiß U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying this missorting requires determination whether or not the disulfide-bonded loop participates in an intermolecular interaction and, if so, the identification of the interacting molecule. Chromogranin A (CgA), another member of the granin family, contains an N-terminal disulfide-bonded loop highly homologous to that of CgB (17Benedum U.M. Lamouroux A. Konecki D.S. Rosa P. Hille A.

Taking advantage of the bovine adrenal medulla as a suitable source for the purification of CgA, we demonstrate here that the disulfide-bonded loop plays the crucial role for oligomerization of CgA, strongly suggesting a link between chromogranin oligomerization and sorting. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Chromaffin granule pellets, obtained from bovine adrenals as described by Bartlett and Smith (21Bartlett S.F. Smith A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.4, 20 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin and lysed by freeze-thawing and sonication. The acidic pH and the high calcium concentration were chosen to maintain CgB, secretogranin II, and other soluble proteins in an aggregated state, while most of the CgA was found to be soluble under these conditions. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (80 ml, 10 mg/ml protein) was supplemented with 40 mm EDTA and brought to pH 7.4 with NaOH. After extensive dialysis against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, proteins were bound to an anion exchange column (Pharmacia Q-Sepharose, 26 × 100 mm) and eluted using a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The fractions containing CgA (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, and CgA was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR, 10 × 300 mm, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA). CgA was concentrated by chromatography on a small anion exchange column (MONO Q, 5 × 50 mm, elution by a gradient of 0–1m NaCl in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), which typically yielded ∼2 ml containing ∼10 mg of virtually pure CgA (see top panel of Fig. 2). Unless otherwise indicated, all steps were performed at 4 °C. Chromaffin granule pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.4, and 20 mm CaCl2 and lysed by repeated freeze-thawing. The lysate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and supplemented with 40 mm EDTA. Following extensive dialysis against 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.9, and 1 mm EDTA, the dialyzed solution (80 ml, 5 mg/ml protein) received 200 μg of S. aureus V-8 protease. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarol (100 μl of 10 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) was added to inhibit the protease. The solution was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane filter and loaded onto an anion exchange column (Q-Sepharose, 26 × 100 mm). The column was washed with 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 7.9, and eluted using a linear 500-ml gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 7.9, and collecting 3-ml fractions upon starting the gradient. Fractions 40–44 (corresponding to the leading shoulder of the first protein peak as determined by the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar)) were pooled, acidified to pH ∼2 with trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a Pharmacia PepRPC 15-μm HR 10/10 column, which was eluted using a gradient of 10–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions containing the major protein peak as determined by the Bradford assay were lyophilized and subjected to a second round of reverse phase chromatography. This yielded ∼10 mg of peptide, which was found to be >97% pure as determined by densitometric scanning of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The identity of the peptide as CgA1–60 was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (m/z= 6766) and N-terminal sequencing (LPVNSP). Purified CgA (1 mg) was dissolved in 900 μl of 50 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0. FITC was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, ethanolamine (1 μl) was added (18.5 mmfinal concentration). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the FITC-CgA was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR, 10 × 300 mm, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The stoichiometry of labeling was calculated from the extinction at 494 nm and was found to be 3.5 mol of FITC/mol of CgA. The same protocol was used for labeling of CgA with TRITC (554 nm, stoichiometry of 2.8). CgA1–60 (1 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0) was reacted with 1 mm TRITC for 2 h at room temperature. Ethanolamine was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After 1 h, the peptide was isolated by gel filtration as above. TRITC-CgA1–60 was separated from the unlabeled peptide by reverse phase chromatography as above. Several peaks of fluorescent CgA1–60 were obtained. The peak containing TRITC-CgA1–60 modified in a 1:1 stoichiometry, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry, was used for the experiments. FITC-CgA1–60 was prepared accordingly. Gel filtration of purified CgA was performed at 4 °C using an FPLC system (Pharmacia) equipped with a Superdex 200 HR column (10 × 300 mm) run with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The buffers used for the preincubation and incubation of the samples prior to FPLC and for the FPLC itself were 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and either 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4 and 6.4) or 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.4) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. DTT and CgA peptides were added to the buffer as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. The elution of proteins was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm. A solution (150 μl) containing either purified TRITC-CgA or a mixture of TRITC-CgA plus CgA1–60 was layered on top of a 4-ml linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor for 15 h at 60,000 rpm. Both sample and sucrose gradient contained 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and either 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.4 for CgA, pH 7.4 for marker proteins) or 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.4 for CgA). In the case of centrifugation of the TRITC-CgA/CgA1–60 mixture, the sucrose gradient in addition contained 30 μm CgA1–60. Fractions (170 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed in a Shimadzu FR 1502 spectrofluorometer (for TRITC-CgA) or by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (for marker proteins). TheS values and molecular masses of the marker proteins (23Smith M.H. Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Cleveland, OH1970: C3-C25Google Scholar) were plotted as a function of their migration from the top of the sucrose gradient in a linear and semilogarithmic plot, respectively. For each condition, the apparent S value and apparent molecular mass of TRITC-CgA was calculated using linear regression. The FITC-CgA or FITC-CgA1–60 donor and the TRITC-CgA or TRITC-CgA1–60 acceptor were dissolved in FRET buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 or 6.4, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA). The molar ratio between donor and acceptor was usually 1:4 (see figure legends). The total concentration of donor plus acceptor ranged from 10 nm to 3 μm. For the unquenched controls, the TRITC-CgA or TRITC-CgA1–60 was replaced by the corresponding amounts of unlabeled CgA or CgA1–60 plus TRITC-ethanolamine. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Shimadzu FR 1502 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence was excited at a wavelength of 485 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded from 450 to 650 nm. The intensity of the fluorescein emission peak at 516 nm was used for subsequent analysis of the data. The relative amount of energy transfer (E) is given by the difference between unquenched (U) and quenched (Q) donor fluorescence intensity, normalized to the unquenched donor fluorescence intensity at the same total concentration, according to the equation, E=(U−Q)/UEquation 1 The concentration dependence of the energy transfer from a donor X to a homologous acceptor in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, X+ X ⇌ X 2 is given by the equation, E=Etransfer/fstat×XD/XTEquation 2 where E transfer is the transfer efficiency for a donor-acceptor pair X 2,X D is the amount of X in dimeric form, and X T is the total amount ofX. Accordingly,X D/X T gives a value between 0 (100% monomeric) and 1 (100% dimeric). f stat is a factor accounting for the statistics of formation of donor-donor, donor-acceptor, and acceptor-acceptor pairs, considering that the fluorescence of donor-donor pairs is not quenched. f stat is calculated according to the equation, fstat=(n+1)/nEquation 3 with n corresponding to the molar ratio of acceptor to donor. The term X D/X T can be expressed as a function of the dissociation constantK D and the total concentration XDXT=1−1/2KD(XT+1/8KD)−1/4KDXTEquation 4 which gives the equation, E=Etransferfstat×1−1/2KD(XT+1/8KD)−1/4KDXTEquation 5 Equation 5 was used to obtain the values for the FRET efficiencyE transfer and the dissociation constant of the dimer K D from the energy transfer valuesE (Eq. 1), using least square fitting. A relatively concentrated mixture of FITC-CgA and TRITC-CgA (ratio 1:4, total concentration 9 μm in FRET buffer), present in a cuvette placed in the spectrofluorometer, was rapidly mixed with 50–200 volumes of FRET buffer. The dissociation of the dimer was immediately monitored at 25 °C by measuring the time-dependent increase of the donor fluorescence at 516 nm. The total increase in donor fluorescence intensity caused by dimer dissociation is given as the difference between the donor fluorescence intensity I eq in the equilibrium and the donor fluorescence intensity I 0 measured immediately after mixing. The kinetics of the increase in donor fluorescence and hence the dissociation of the dimer can be described by a first order rate equation, Ieq−It=(Ieq−I0)×e−k1tEquation 6 expressed alternatively as the equation, ln(Ieq−It)=ln(Ieq−I0)−k1tEquation 7 with I t being the donor fluorescence intensity at the time t. The experimental data were plotted according to Equation 7, and the first order rate constant of dissociation, k 1, was determined by linear regression of the data points obtained during the first six seconds after mixing. A mixture (1.39 ml) of FITC-CgA and TRITC-CgA (ratio 1:1, total concentration 70–210 nm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, 0.5 mg/ml BSA) was pipetted into a cuvette placed in the spectrofluorometer. This solution was rapidly mixed with 110 μl containing 0.5 mNaH2PO4 and 0.5 mg/ml BSA, yielding a final buffer composition of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4. The formation of dimers was immediately monitored at 25 °C by measuring the time-dependent decrease in the donor fluorescence intensity at 516 nm. The slope dI/dt of the curve obtained is proportional to the reaction rate v. The initial dI/dt was used to calculate the rate of consumption of monomeric donor, which equals the rate of formation of donor-acceptor dimer, according to the equation, v=dI/dt×[donor]0/I0×fstat/EtransferEquation 8 where [donor]0 is the concentration of FITC-CgA after mixing. The second order rate constant of dimer formation,k 2, was calculated according to the equation, k2=v/([donor][acceptor])Equation 9 Protein in solution was determined by the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using BSA as a standard. Proteins fixed and Coomassie Blue-stained in gels were quantitated by densitometric scanning. To investigate a possible role of the N-terminal domain of CgA in homo-oligomerization, we used full-length CgA and CgA1–60, which extends 22 amino acid residues beyond the disulfide-bonded loop (24Benedum U.M. Baeuerle P.A. Konecki D.S. Frank R. Powell J. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Iacangelo A. Affolter H.-U. Eiden L.E. Herbert E. Grimes M. Nature. 1986; 323: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). CgA obtained from bovine chromaffin granules by lysis at pH 6.4 in the presence of 20 mm calcium (which removes CgB by precipitation) was either purified to homogeneity by sequential anion exchange and gel filtration FPLC or subjected to limited proteolysis by V-8 protease (which cleaves the protein at Glu60) followed by purification of CgA1–60 by sequential anion exchange and reverse phase FPLC. The identity of CgA1–60 was verified by N-terminal sequencing (LPVNSP) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (m/z = 6766, which corresponds well to the predicted mass of disulfide-bonded CgA1–60 of 6767). We first investigated the effect of CgA1–60 on the oligomeric state of full-length CgA as revealed by gel filtration. In line with previous observations (26Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), full-length CgA, which has been shown to be a homodimer at pH 7.5 (27Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), behaved anomalously upon gel filtration at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1,A–D, dashed lines) or pH 6.4 (the lumenal pH of the TGN (10Anderson R.G.W. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1, E–H, dashed lines), eluting at the position corresponding to a globular protein of 550 kDa, although the molecular mass of a single CgA polypeptide without post-translational modifications is 48 kDa (24Benedum U.M. Baeuerle P.A. Konecki D.S. Frank R. Powell J. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). At pH 7.4 (Fig.1 B, solid line), and even more so at pH 6.4 (Fig.1 F, solid line), the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of CgA1–60 caused a shift in the peak of full-length CgA toward larger elution volumes, corresponding to a 2-fold reduction in apparent molecular mass. Analysis of the eluted material by SDS-PAGE showed that the shifted peak contained both full-length CgA and CgA1–60 (Fig.2). SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions of full-length CgA alone and of a mixture of full-length CgA plus CgA1–60 identical to that subjected to gel filtration indicated the absence of any disulfide-linked homo- or hetero-oligomers (data not shown). We conclude that the addition of CgA1–60 reduced the amount of homodimeric CgA and resulted in the formation of a heterodimer between full-length CgA and CgA1–60. We then examined whether the single intramolecular disulfide bond in the N-terminal domain of CgA (17Benedum U.M. Lamouroux A. Konecki D.S. Rosa P. Hille A. Baeuerle P.A. Frank R. Lottspeich F. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was required for the dimerization of CgA. After treatment with the thiol-reducing agent DTT (Fig. 1,A and E, solid lines), full-length CgA became monomeric, eluting from the gel filtration column at a position very similar to that of the heterodimer between full-length CgA and CgA1–60. Given that the dimers of full-length CgA (27Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not due to intermolecular disulfide bridges (17Benedum U.M. Lamouroux A. Konecki D.S. Rosa P. Hille A. Baeuerle P.A. Frank R. Lottspeich F. Mallet J. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (data not shown), we conclude that the disulfide-bonded loop plays a crucial role in the noncovalent dimerization of CgA. Upon gel filtration at pH 5.4 (the lumenal pH of mature secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells (28Johnson Jr., R.G. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 493: 162-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1, I–L, dashed lines), full-length CgA eluted earlier than at pH 6.4 and 7.4, consistent with CgA being a homotetramer at pH 5.5 (27Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of full-length CgA with DTT at pH 7.4 followed by gel filtration at pH 5.4 resulted in the appearance of a second peak (Fig. 1 I, solid line). By comparison with monomeric CgA at pH 6.4 (Fig. 1 E,solid line), this second peak was likely to correspond to monomeric full-length CgA, indicating a tetramer-monomer equilibrium at pH 5.4. No peak was detected in a position expected of a CgA dimer. Similar observations were made after the addition of CgA1–60 at pH 5.4. Here, the second peak was likely to correspond to the heterodimer between full-length CgA and CgA1–60 (Fig. 1 J, solid line), indicating a homotetramer-heterodimer equilibrium at pH 5.4. No peak was detected in a position expected of a (CgA-CgA1–60)2 heterotetramer. We conclude that the disulfide-bonded loop is of critical importance in maintaining the homotetrameric state of CgA that exists at pH 5.4. When gel filtration of full-length CgA at pH 5.4 was performed in the presence of the synthetic peptide CgA406–431, which corresponds to the C-terminal domain of CgA, a protein complex of smaller size was eluted (Fig. 1 K,solid line). This complex, however, was larger than the CgA-CgA1–60 heterodimer and presumably corresponded to the (CgA-CgA406–431)2 heterotetramer. Upon the addition of both CgA1–60 and CgA406–431, full-length CgA was recovered as a peak with a shoulder, which reflected an equilibrium between the (CgA-CgA406–431)2 heterotetramer and a CgA1–60-CgA-CgA406–431 heterotrimer, respectively (Fig. 1 L, solid line). No effect of the CgA406–431 peptide, alone or in combination with CgA1–60, was detected at pH 6.4 (Fig. 1, G andH, solid lines) and pH 7.4 (Fig. 1, Cand D, solid lines). We conclude that at pH 5.4, the C-terminal domain of CgA mediates the assembly of CgA homotetramers from CgA homodimers; assembly of the latter depends on the disulfide-bonded loop. In addition to the above changes in the oligomeric state of CgA, we noticed that the apparent size of full-length CgA in any given oligomeric state decreased upon reduction in pH from pH 7.4 to 5.4. Similar pH-induced shifts in elution volume were observed when full-length CgA was present as monomer (obtained after DTT treatment; Fig. 1, A, E, and I, solid lines), CgA-CgA1–60 heterodimer (Fig. 1,B, F, and J, solid lines), CgA1–60-CgA-CgA406–431 heterotrimer (Fig. 1,D, H, and L, solid lines), or (CgA-CgA406–431)2 heterotetramer (Fig. 1,C, G, and K, solid lines). To corroborate the changes in the oligomeric state of full-length CgA caused by the addition of CgA1–60 and by the reduction of the pH to 5.4, we analyzed the sedimentation of purified full-length CgA upon sucrose gradient centrifugation, using the TRITC-CgA prepared for the FRET analyses described below. At pH 6.4, full-length CgA sedimented with an apparent S value of 4.0, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass for a globular protein of 44 kDa (Fig.3 A, open circles). Upon centrifugation in the presence of excess CgA1–60, full-length CgA sedimented more slowly, with an apparent Svalue of 3.5, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass for a globular protein of 34 kDa (Fig. 3 A, solid circles). This change in sedimentation was consistent with the conversion of full-length CgA homodimers into CgA-CgA1–60heterodimers upon the addition of CgA1–60 observed in gel filtration (Fig. 1 F). At pH 5.4, most (67%) of the full-length CgA sedimented significantly faster than at pH 6.4, being recovered in the pellet and the bottom three fractions of the gradient (apparent S value ≥7.2, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass for a globular protein of ≥169 kDa; Fig. 3 B,open circles). This was in line with most of the CgA being a homotetramer at pH 5.4 (27Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 J, dashed line). A small peak (18% of the TRITC-CgA) was observed in the position of the CgA homodimer (Fig. 3 B, open circles), consistent with the presence of a small shoulder of homodimeric CgA observed in gel filtration (Fig. 1 J,dashed line). The addition of excess CgA1–60reduced the proportion of homotetrameric CgA at the bottom of the gradient from 67 to 54% of total and resulted in the appearance of a peak of full-length CgA in the position of the CgA-CgA1–60heterodimer, which contained 26% of the total full-length CgA in the gradient (Fig. 3 B, solid circles). This was in line with the conversion of a portion of homotetrameric full-length CgA to the CgA-CgA1–60 heterodimer upon the addition of CgA1–60 observed in gel filtration, which resulted in a 2:1 ratio between these two oligomers (Fig. 1 J, solid line). The above gel filtration studies showed that the N-terminal domain of CgA containing the disulfide-bonded loop is necessary for the dimerization of CgA but did not provide information as to the underlying mechanism. Two possibilities were most likely: (i) the binding of two N-terminal domains to each other or (ii) the binding of one N-terminal domain to another domain of CgA. To investigate the first possibility directly, we used FRET (29Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). In this method, the fluorescence energy of an excited donor fluorophore is transferred to an appropriate acceptor if"
https://openalex.org/W2092734188,"Overlapping cDNA clones encoding the two largest subunits of rat RNA polymerase I, designated A194 and A127, were isolated from a Reuber hepatoma cDNA library. Analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that A194 and A127 are the homologues of yeast A190 and A135 and have homology to the β′ and β subunits of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase I. Antibodies raised against the recombinant A194 and A127 proteins recognized single proteins of approximately 190 and 120 kDa on Western blots of total cellular proteins of mammalian origin. N1S1 cell lines expressing recombinant His-tagged A194 and FLAG-tagged A127 proteins were isolated. These proteins were incorporated into functional RNA polymerase I complexes, and active enzyme, containing FLAG-tagged A127, could be immunopurified to approximately 80% homogeneity in a single chromatographic step over an anti-FLAG affinity column. Immunoprecipitation of A194 from 32P metabolically labeled cells with anti-A194 antiserum demonstrated that this subunit is a phosphoprotein. Incubation of the FLAG affinity-purified RNA polymerase I complex with [γ-32P]ATP resulted in autophosphorylation of the A194 subunit of RPI, indicating the presence of associated kinase(s). One of these kinases was demonstrated to be CK2, a serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2024390477,"The 14-3-3 protein family has been implicated in growth factor signaling. We investigated whether 14-3-3 protein is involved in insulin signaling in 3T3L1 adipocytes. A significant amount of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) was immunodetected in the immunoprecipitate with anti-14-3-3β antibody at the basal condition. 100 nm insulin increased the amount of IRS-1 in the immunoprecipitate 2.5-fold. The effect of insulin was abolished by 100 nm wortmannin. An in vitro binding study revealed that glutathione S-transferase-14-3-3β fusion protein directly associates with recombinant IRS-1. Pretreatment of recombinant IRS-1 with alkaline phosphatase clearly decreased this association. Because the recombinant IRS-1 was not phosphorylated on its tyrosine residues, the results suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is responsible for the association. When the cells are treated with insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) is supposed to complex either 14-3-3β-IRS-1 or IRS-1. The 14-3-3β-IRS-1-PI3K and IRS-1-PI3K complexes were separately prepared by a sequential immunoprecipitation, first with anti-14-3-3β and then with anti-IRS-1 antibodies. The specific activity of the PI3K in the former was approximately half of that in the latter, suggesting that 14-3-3β protein bound to IRS-1 inhibits insulin-stimulated lipid kinase activity of PI3K in 3T3L1 adipocytes. The 14-3-3 protein family has been implicated in growth factor signaling. We investigated whether 14-3-3 protein is involved in insulin signaling in 3T3L1 adipocytes. A significant amount of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) was immunodetected in the immunoprecipitate with anti-14-3-3β antibody at the basal condition. 100 nm insulin increased the amount of IRS-1 in the immunoprecipitate 2.5-fold. The effect of insulin was abolished by 100 nm wortmannin. An in vitro binding study revealed that glutathione S-transferase-14-3-3β fusion protein directly associates with recombinant IRS-1. Pretreatment of recombinant IRS-1 with alkaline phosphatase clearly decreased this association. Because the recombinant IRS-1 was not phosphorylated on its tyrosine residues, the results suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is responsible for the association. When the cells are treated with insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) is supposed to complex either 14-3-3β-IRS-1 or IRS-1. The 14-3-3β-IRS-1-PI3K and IRS-1-PI3K complexes were separately prepared by a sequential immunoprecipitation, first with anti-14-3-3β and then with anti-IRS-1 antibodies. The specific activity of the PI3K in the former was approximately half of that in the latter, suggesting that 14-3-3β protein bound to IRS-1 inhibits insulin-stimulated lipid kinase activity of PI3K in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Insulin promotes the rapid autophosphorylation of its receptor β-subunits and tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoplasmic proteins such as Shc, pp60, Gab-1, and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; difluoroPmp, difluorophosphonometyl phenylalanine; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; difluoroPmp, difluorophosphonometyl phenylalanine; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1 and 2. IRS-1 plays a central role in insulin signaling. The protein contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a phosphotyrosine-binding domain that binds to NPXY motif of the insulin receptor β-subunit and multiple tyrosine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites. The tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 associates with several Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins including Grb-2, SHP-2, Nck, Fyn, and the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K). Associations of these molecules with IRS-1 are believed to further activate downstream signaling systems, including mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K cascades, that promote mitogenic and metabolic effects of insulin (for review see Refs. 1Cheatham B.

At least nine mammalian isoforms have been identified, and six are expressed ubiquitously (3Watanabe M. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Kondo H. Inoue Y. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Originally, 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to be functional as regulators of tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylases as well as protein kinase C (for review see Ref. 4Aitken A. Trends Biochem.

Moreover, the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in signal transduction is suggested by the reports that 14-3-3 protein interacts with PI3K (16Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C.

However, both the mechanism and the physiological role of protein-protein interactions mediated by 14-3-3 proteins are still unclear. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the 14-3-3 protein is involved in the insulin signaling pathway. We showed that 14-3-3β protein directly binds to IRS-1 and that insulin increases this binding via a wortmannin-sensitive pathway in 3T3L1 adipocytes. We also demonstrated that the 14-3-3β protein negatively regulates insulin-stimulated activity of PI3K. Anti-IRS-1 (SC559), anti-phosphotyrosine (SC508), anti-14-3-3β (SC628), and anti-GST (SC459) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat recombinant IRS-1 (number 12-128) and anti-p85PI3K antibodies (numbers 05-217 and 06-195) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP was from New England Nuclear (Wilmington, DE). Oligonucleotides were made by ABI 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Foster City, CA). Biosynthetic human insulin was kindly provided by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and Pfu DNA polymerase were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively. pGEX-2T vector and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). pCRII vector was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). 14-3-3β cDNA was kindly gifted from Dr. Watanabe (Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan). Difluorophosphonometyl phenylalanine (difluoroPmp) was kindly gifted from Dr. Burke, Jr (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Fetal calf serum and cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and ECL chemiluminescent kit were from Amersham Corp. Other reagents were from Sigma and Attest, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). 3T3L1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and were grown and differentiated as described previously (18Kosaki A. Yamada K. Kuzuya H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1744-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After 6 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated with insulin for 3 min at 37 °C and then immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. For some experiments, cells were preincubated with 100 nm wortmannin for 20 min. Total cell lysates were prepared by a solubilization in 0.5 ml/10-cm dish of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 30 min at 4 °C. The insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C). Cytosolic fractions were prepared by a suspending the cells in ice-cold lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and homogenizing with a Teflon homogenizer for several strokes. The membrane fractions were removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C). To prepare GST fusion protein, full-length rat 14-3-3β cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using sense primer added to the BamHI site and antisense primer added to the EcoRI site and cloned into pCRII vector. The insertion was restricted with both BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pGEX-2T vector in-frame. The plasmid was subcloned into DH5α cells. Fusion proteins were affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein is designated GST-14-3-3β. GST protein alone was also prepared for a negative control. YMXM-containing peptide, YZPZSGSYZPZS (nonphosphorylated form), was synthesized by an Fmoc-based strategy. Norleucines (Z) were used instead of methionines (M) as described previously (19Herbst J.J. Andrews G. Contillo L. Lamphere L. Gardner J. Lienhard G.E. Gibbs E.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9376-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Boc-based techniques were utilized for the preparation of the phosphopeptide possessing substitution of phosphotyrosine (pY) or difluoroPmp for tyrosine in the two YZPZ motifs (20Otaka A. Miyoshi K. Kaneko M. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Nomizu M. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3967-3974Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Burke Jr., T.R. Smyth M.S. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 4125-4128Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC. Analysis of the purified products by mass spectroscopy and analytical HPLC demonstrated homogeneity and sequence accuracy of the synthesized peptides. 2 mg of total cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of the antibody indicated for 16 h at 4 °C in an end-over-end mixer, followed by the addition of protein A/G-Sepharose for the last hour. The Sepharose-bound immune complexes were then collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 1 min) and washed four times in ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once in phosphate-buffered saline. The immune complexes were denatured in Laemmli's sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and then subjected to immunoblotting. To see whether 14-3-3β protein associates with IRS-1 in vitro, either 2 mg of total cell lysate of 3T3L1 adipocytes or 400 ng of rat recombinant IRS-1 protein was incubated with 50 pmol of either GST alone or GST-14-3-3β fusion protein in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer for 1 h and then with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for another hour at 4 °C. The Sepharose-bound complexes were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 1 min) and washed four times in ice-cold washing buffer and once in phosphate-buffered saline. The complexes were denatured in Laemmli's sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 antibody. To study whether PI3K associates with 14-3-3β protein in vitro, 1.5 mg of cytosolic fraction of untreated cells was incubated with 10 μm of YMXM-, pYMXM-, or difluoroPmpMXM-containing peptide for 20 min at 25 °C, and the total mixture was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-p85 antibody followed by the addition of protein A/G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated PI3K was further phosphorylatedin vitro in 50 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mmMnCl2, and 10 μm ATP) for 10 min at 25 °C and then incubated with GST-14-3-3β fusion protein in 250 μl of lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose-bound immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 1 min) and washed four times in ice-cold washing buffer and once in phosphate-buffered saline. The immune complexes were denatured in Laemmli's sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. 400 ng of rat recombinant IRS-1 protein was incubated with 15 units of active or heat-inactivated calf intestine alkaline phosphatase in 20 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 25 °C and then heat-inactivated for 10 min at 70 °C. The recombinant IRS-1 proteins were then subjected to in vitro association study. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with the antibody indicated for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed in T-TBS (TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 30 min, incubated with donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibody in T-TBS for 60 min, and washed for 60 min in T-TBS, and then the proteins were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescent kit. The band densities were quantified using an image analyzer Quantity One System (PDI, Sunnyvale, CA). PI3K activity was measured as described previously with slight modifications (22Suga J. Yoshimasa Y. Yamada K. Yamamoto Y. Inoue G. Okamoto M. Hayashi T. Shigemoto M. Kosaki A. Kuzuya H. Nakao K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Lamphere L. Carpenter C.L. Sheng Z. Kallen R.G. Lienhard G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; : E486-E494PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the Sepharose-bound immune complexes with the indicated antibody were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mmMgCl2, 10 μl of 1 mg/ml of phosphatidylinositol, and 10 μl of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼20 μCi). After 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, the reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plate followed by a BAS-2000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) detection. To measure the PI3K activity in Fig. 4, 2 mg of total cell lysate was first immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-14-3-3β antibody, and then half of the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-IRS-1 antibody. To eliminate the influence of each antibody on the activity of PI3K, 2 μg of anti-IRS-1 and anti-14-3-3β antibody were added to the first and the second immunoprecipitate, respectively, before the assay. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. All comparisons were made using a two-tailedt test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate whether 14-3-3β protein is involved in the insulin signaling pathway, total cell lysates of 3T3L1 adipocytes were immunoprecipitated with anti-14-3-3β antibody, and the immune complexes were subjected to immunoblots with antibodies against molecules implicated in insulin signaling. We found that a significant amount of IRS-1 was immunodetected in the immunoprecipitate at the basal condition. 100 nm insulin increased 2.5-fold (basalversus insulin-stimulated condition; 5.30 ± 0.41versus 13.57 ± 1.16 arbitrary units, n = 6,p < 0.01) the amount of IRS-1 in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2). The increase was detected very rapidly after insulin treatment, reaching to the plateau at 1 min (data not shown). The effect of insulin was abolished when the cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). However, wortmannin did not affect the amount of immunoprecipitated IRS-1 at the basal condition (data not shown). To confirm these results, the total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody, and the immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-14-3-3β antibody (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the former results, 14-3-3β proteins were immunodetected in the immunoprecipitate at the basal condition. Insulin increased the amount of immunoprecipitated 14-3-3β proteins. The effect of insulin was reduced by wortmannin pretreatment. To ensure that 14-3-3β protein associates with IRS-1, in vitro association experiments were performed using a GST-14-3-3β fusion protein. GST-14-3-3β protein was incubated with total cell lysates of 3T3L1 adipocytes treated with or without insulin, followed by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads precipitation. The precipitates were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-IRS-1 antibody (Fig.2 A). The GST-14-3-3β protein (but not GST alone) associated with endogenous IRS-1 in the cell lysates at the basal condition. Insulin increased the association by 2-fold. These results are in agreement with the data obtained fromin vivo studies (Fig. 1). To further address whether the direct association of 14-3-3β protein with IRS-1 can occur, in vitro reconstitution experiments were performed using recombinant IRS-1 and GST-14-3-3β fusion protein. We found that the GST-14-3-3β protein directly associates with recombinant IRS-1 (Fig. 2 B). Recently, it has been determined that 14-3-3 protein binds to phosphoserine (pS)-containing motifs by the peptide binding and peptide mapping analysis (24Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 25Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether phophorylated residues of recombinant IRS-1 are involved in the association with 14-3-3β protein, effects of alkaline phosphatase on the association were determined. Pretreatment of the recombinant IRS-1 with alkaline phosphatase clearly decreased this association (Fig. 2 C). The results indicate that 14-3-3β protein directly binds to IRS-1 via its phosphorylated residues, probably phosphorylated serine/threonine residues, because the recombinant IRS-1 that was used for the experiment was not phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These in vitroreconstitution experiments could explain the association of 14-3-3β protein with IRS-1 at the basal condition. However, mechanisms of the insulin-induced increase in the association of 14-3-3β protein with IRS-1 remains unknown. It was shown that RSXpSXP, RXRXXpS and a cluster of serine residues in the α-helix are the binding motifs for 14-3-3 proteins (24Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 25Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 26Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IRS-1 contains six RXRXXS motifs (but no RSXSXP motifs) in its amino acid sequence. Four of them are in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and the others are located in the region containing the YXXM motifs. Moreover, it was reported that IRS-1 is a substrate for serine kinase of PI3K activated by insulin (27Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with our results, it is tempting to speculate that IRS-1 binds to 14-3-3β protein via its phosphorylated serine residues such as RXRXXpS motif, and insulin treatment results in the activation of serine kinase of PI3K, which in turn further phosphorylates the serine residues of IRS-1, leading to more association with 14-3-3β protein. This could be a reason why wortmannin inhibits insulin-induced increase of the IRS-1–14-3-3β complex (Fig. 1). Of course, other molecules downstream from PI3K, for example, protein kinase B, which is another serine/threonine kinase, may be involved in the insulin-induced increase of the IRS-1–14-3-3β complex (28Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Further study will be necessary to clarify this point. An alternative possibility is that insulin-stimulated association of 14-3-3β proteins with IRS-1 is mediated by PI3K. It is well known that tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 upon insulin stimulation associates directly with the p85 subunit of PI3K through pYMXM and pYXXM motifs, resulting in the activation of PI3K (2Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been reported that insulin induces serine-phosphorylation of p85 by PI3K itself (27Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry J.M. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). As expected, p85 was detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-14-3-3β antibody mainly upon insulin treatment and little in the basal condition. This band was decreased in the presence of wortmannin (Fig.3 A). If 14-3-3β protein associates with PI3K directly, insulin apparently increases the amount of IRS-1 immunoprecipitated with 14-3-3β antibody via PI3K. Therefore, to explore this possibility, we activated PI3K in vitro without the insulin receptor-IRS-1 system. pYMXM- or difluoroPmpMXM-containing peptide was incubated with the cytosolic fraction of untreated 3T3L1 adipocytes, and the mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody (20Otaka A. Miyoshi K. Kaneko M. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Nomizu M. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3967-3974Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26000-26005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The immunoabsorbed PI3K was further phosphorylated by adding ATP and manganese and then subjected to in vitro association experiments with GST-14-3-3β protein. Although both pYMXM- and difluoroPmpMXM-containing peptide activated the lipid kinase activity of PI3K (Fig. 3 B) and also increased phosphorylation of p85 (Fig. 3 C), neither pYMXM- nor difluoroPmpMXM-containing peptide increased the association of GST-14-3-3β protein with PI3K in the absence of IRS-1 molecule (Fig. 3 D, upper panel). It is thus unlikely that 14-3-3β protein directly associates with PI3K in 3T3L1 adipocytes, accounting for the insulin-stimulated increase of IRS-1 in the immunoprecipitates with anti-14-3-3β antibody. Recently, it was reported that 14-3-3τ protein directly binds to PI3K in human T lymphocytes (16Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The difference from our results may be due to the tissue, 14-3-3 isoform, or species specificity. It is of interest to note that human but not mouse p85 of PI3K contains RSXSXP motif in the breakpoint cluster region homologue domain. Because less than half the amount of total IRS-1 associates with 14-3-3β protein when the cells are treated with insulin (Fig.1 A), PI3K may complex either 14-3-3β-IRS-1 or IRS-1. To address the physiological significance of the 14-3-3β-IRS-1-PI3K complex, the 14-3-3β-IRS-1-PI3K and IRS-1-PI3K complexes were separately prepared by a sequential immunoprecipitation (Fig.4). The total cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-14-3-3β antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2), and then half of the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 3and 4). The lipid kinase activity upon insulin stimulation in the former (14-3-3β-IRS-1-PI3K complex; Fig. 4 A,lane 2) was about 25% of that in the latter (IRS-1-PI3K complex; Fig. 4 A, lane 4, and TableI). A part of each sample in Fig.4 A was also subjected to immunoblots with anti-IRS-1 (Fig.4 B), anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4 C), anti-p85PI3K (Fig. 4 D), or anti-14-3-3β (Fig.4 E) antibody. After insulin stimulation, the amounts of IRS-1, tyrosine-phosphorylated p185, and p85PI3K in the first immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, B, C, andD, lanes 2) were about 50% of those in the second immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, B, C, andD, lanes 4, and Table I). When normalized by the amount of p85, insulin-induced lipid kinase activity was significantly lower in the first immunoprecipitate compared with that in the second immunoprecipitate. Both the tyrosine phosphorylation state of IRS-1 and the association of p85 with IRS-1 were similar in the first and the second immunoprecipitates. Thus 14-3-3β protein appeared to be a negative regulator for PI3K in insulin signaling system. Here, the question is raised as to how 14-3-3β protein regulates PI3K. In preliminary studies using immunoblots with anti-p110αPI3Kantibody, we found that the ratio of p110α catalytic subunit to p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K was decreased in the first immunoprecipitate compared with that in the second immunoprecipitate. 2A. Kosaki, K. Yamada, and H. Kuzuya, unpublished observation. Because the antibody against the p110α subunit was low in the affinity, this finding must be further confirmed using different antibodies that work well in the immunoblotting. However, at this point, it should be emphasized that PI3K activity is reduced in the 14-3-3β-IRS-1-PI3K complex when normalized by the amount of p85 subunit.Table ILipid kinase activity of PI3K bound to the IRS-1-14-3-3β complexLipid kinase or immunoblotFirst IP anti-14–3-3βSecond IP anti-IRS-1%Lipid kinase24.9 ± 7.41-ap < 0.02 versus the values of IRS-1, pTyr, and p85 in the first IP.100IRS-156.6 ± 4.7100pTyr50.1 ± 2.8100p8551.4 ± 3.110014–3-3β1001.4 ± 0.31-a p < 0.02 versus the values of IRS-1, pTyr, and p85 in the first IP. Open table in a new tab The physiological role of protein-protein interactions mediated by 14-3-3 proteins is still under investigations. Recently, 14-3-3 protein has been shown to be a modulator of kinases including Raf-1, protein kinase C, and PI3K (4Aitken A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 16Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an importance of 14-3-3 protein as a chaperone as well as an adapter molecule has recently been proposed (31Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was reported that 14-3-3 protein mediates the interaction of Bcr and Raf and the interaction of A20 protein and c-Raf by functioning as a bridging adapter molecule (13Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20029-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether 14-3-3β protein is acting as an adapter molecule in between IRS-1 and Raf-1. Total cell lysates of 3T3L1 adipocytes treated with or without insulin were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody, and the immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Raf-1 antibody. However, the results did not support the presence of interaction between IRS-1 and Raf-1 via 14-3-3β protein in the 3T3L1 adipocytes, despite the fact that the interaction between 14-3-3β and Raf-1 protein was clearly observed.2 In conclusion, in this study we showed that the 14-3-3 protein is another molecule bound to IRS-1 that modulates PI3K in insulin signaling system in 3T3L1 adipocytes.

To investigate the structural requirements for ER retrieval, we have constructed mutants of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) protein with cytoplasmic tails of different lengths and containing a KK motif at the −3 and −4 positions. Such proteins were found to be retained intracellularly when the signal was located 18 amino acids or more away from the membrane spanning domain. The retrieval signal was found to be functional even when placed at the distal end of the wild-type SIV Env protein with 164 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail, as shown by the lack of proteolytic processing and lack of cell surface expression of the mutant proteins. However, proteins with a cytoplasmic tail length of 13 amino acids or less having the di-lysine motif at the −3 and −4 positions were not retrieved to the ER since they were found to be processed and transported to the cell surface. The surface-expressed proteins were found to be functional in inducing cell fusion, whereas the proteins retained intracellularly were defective in fusion activity. We also found that the KK motif introduced near an amphipathic helical region in the cytoplasmic tail was not functional. These results demonstrate that the ability of the KK motif to cause protein retrieval and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum depends on the length and structure of the cytoplasmic domain. The ER retrieval of the mutant proteins was found to correlate with increased intracellular binding to β COP proteins."

We have now performed alanine substitutions of individual Cys residues in βc to identify the Cys residues involved and their contribution to activation of the IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 receptors. We found that substitution of Cys-86, Cys-91, and Cys-96 in βc but not of Cys-100 or Cys-234 abrogated disulfide-linked IL-3 receptor dimerization. However, although Cys-86 and Cys-91 βc mutants retained their ability to form non-disulfide-linked dimers with IL-3Rα, substitution of Cys-96 eliminated this interaction. Binding studies demonstrated that all βc mutants with the exception of C96A supported high affinity binding of IL-3 and GM-CSF. In receptor activation experiments, we found that βc mutants C86A, C91A, and C96A but not C100A or C234A abolished phosphorylation of βc in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, or IL-5. These data show that although Cys-96 is important for the structural integrity of βc, Cys-86 and Cys-91 participate in disulfide-linked receptor heterodimerization and that this linkage is essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of βc. Sequence alignment of βc with other cytokine receptor signaling subunits in light of these data shows that Cys-86 and Cys-91 represent a motif restricted to human and mouse β chains, suggesting a unique mechanism of activation utilized by the IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 receptors.

Cytokine receptor dimerization is a common theme in receptor activation (1Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Following the binding of the cognate ligand to cytokine receptors, a sequential process takes place whereby receptor subunits associate and recruit cytoplasmic signaling molecules leading to receptor activation and cellular signaling (2Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The general process of receptor dimerization exhibits variations among the cytokine receptor superfamily and may involve homodimerization or heterodimerization events depending on receptor subunit composition (3Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 4Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the growth hormone receptor, growth hormone binds initially to one receptor subunit and induces its homodimerization with a second, identical subunit (5Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). A similar process probably takes place with erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, leading, in both cases, to receptor homodimerization and activation (6Miura O. Ihle J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Ota Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With cytokine receptors that comprise multiple subunits, receptor activation is accompanied by homodimerization or heterodimerization of the signaling subunits. For example, in the IL-6 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSFR, GM-CSF receptor; IL-2R, IL-2 receptor; βc, common β chain; CRM, cytokine receptor module; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wt, wild type; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; CNTF, ciliary neutrotrophic factor; CNTFR, CNTF receptor. receptor system, IL-6 induces dimerization of IL-6Rα with gp130 (8Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), homodimerization of gp130, and receptor activation (9Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding of CNTF to CNTFRα induces its association with gp130 and the LIF receptor, and the heterodimerization of gp130 and the LIF receptor is accompanied by receptor activation (10Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Similarly, heterodimerization of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ subunits is necessary for IL-2 receptor activation (11Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 12Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in these cases, each receptor α chain constitutes the major binding subunit but does not seem to form part of the signaling receptor complex. The mechanism of activation of the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor system exhibits features similar to the mechanism employed by the above receptors, although some unique features are becoming evident. One of the most important differences is the contribution that each receptor α chain makes to signaling. This is manifested in two ways: first, unlike IL-6Rα, CNTFRα, and the IL-2Rα, the cytoplasmic domains of GM-CSFRα, IL-3Rα, and IL-5Rα are all required for full receptor activation and signaling (13Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Rapoport A.P. Luhowskyj S. Doshi P. DiPersio J.F.

Shikama Y. Naugle C. Druker B. Sieff C.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 3298-3306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, IL-3Rα and GM-CSFRα form disulfide-linked dimers with the common β chain (βc) of their receptor (4Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Goodall G.J. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disulfide-mediated dimerization of IL-3Rα with βc and of GM-CSFRα with βc is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of βc (4Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these cases, however, tyrosine phosphorylation is observed in the disulfide-linked dimers as well as in the monomeric molecules, and hence it is not clear which is the critical species for receptor activation. Furthermore, the location of the cysteines involved in disulfide linkage is not known, nor is it apparent whether they constitute a functionally conserved motif in the cytokine receptor superfamily. We have now performed single alanine substitutions of candidate cysteine residues in the N-terminal cytokine receptor module (CRM) of the IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 receptor βc and examined their contribution to disulfide-linked receptor dimerization, high affinity ligand binding, and receptor activation. Cysteine residues were substituted with alanines in the human β chain cDNA using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Altered-sites, Promega, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) as described previously (18Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Tavernier J. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, and the mutant βc cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA1(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The IL-3R, GM-CSFR, and IL-5R α chain cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectorpCDM8 (Invitrogen) for transfection (18Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Tavernier J. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). COS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation. Routinely, 2 × 107COS cells were co-transfected in 0.8 ml of PBS at 0 °C with 25 μg of wild type or mutated βc cDNA together with 10 μg of GM-CSFR and 10 μg of IL-3R α chain cDNA at 500 microfarads with 300 V. After electroporation, cells were centrifuged through a 1-ml cushion of fetal calf serum, and cells were plated in either 25 ml of medium/150-cm2 flask or 24-well plates for binding analysis. Transfectants were incubated for 2 days prior to cytokine treatment (18Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Tavernier J. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The HEK293T cell line, derived from the adenovirus type transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cell line and containing the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (19DuBridge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal calf serum. On the day before transfection, 1.4 × 106 cells were plated into 6-cm tissue culture dishes to adhere overnight. Four hours after a medium change, 6 μg of wild type or mutated βc cDNA together with 4 μg of GM-CSFRα, 4 μg of IL-3Rα, or 4 μg of IL-5Rα cDNA and 0.5 μg of JAK-2 cDNA were added to cells in the form of a calcium phosphate precipitate (20Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar), and the cells were placed in an incubator for 4 h to permit the uptake of the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate. The cells were then washed, replated in 4 plates/150 cm2, and placed in the incubator for 48 h prior to cytokine treatment. Recombinant human IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 were produced in Escherichia coli essentially as described before (21Barry S.C. Bagley C.J. Phillips J. Dottore M. Cambareri B. Moretti P. D'Andrea R.

Cytokine purity and quantitation was determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The unit activity of the cytokines based on the ED50 values in a proliferation assay (23Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki K. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazano K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell.

Recombinant IL-3 and GM-CSF were radioiodinated by the iodine monochloride method (24Contreras M.A. Bale W.F. Spar I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 277-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of about 36 mCi/mg. Routinely, 4 μg of protein was iodinated and separated from iodide ions on a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), eluted with PBS containing 0.02% v/v Tween 20, and the iodinated proteins were stored at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks. Binding assays were performed on confluent monolayers in 24-well plates over a concentration range of 10 pm to 10 nm125I-labeled GM-CSF or IL-3 in binding medium (RPMI containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA/0.1% (w/v) sodium azide) essentially as described previously (25Woodcock J.M. Bagley C.J. Zacharakis B. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25999-26006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, radioligand was removed, and the cells were briefly washed twice in binding medium. Specific counts were determined after lysis of the cell monolayer with subsequent transfer and counting on a γ counter (Cobra Auto Gamma; Packard Instruments Co., Meridien, CT). Dissociation constants were calculated using the EBDA and LIGAND programs (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Monoclonal antibodies directed against GM-CSFRα, IL-3Rα, IL-5Rα, or βc were generated as described previously (27Sun Q. Woodcock J.M. Rapoport A. Stomski F.C. Korpelainen E.I. Bagley C.J. Goodall G.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1996; 87: 83-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified and characterized as detailed elsewhere (17Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J.

The monoclonal antibodies 8E4, 4H1, 9F5, and A14 were selected for their ability to specifically immunoprecipitate βc, GM-CSFRα, IL-3Rα, and IL-5Rα, respectively. The monoclonal antibody 1C1 conjugated to biotin was used for immunoblotting βc, and 8E4, 4H1, 9F5, and A14 were used for cell surface expression staining for βc, GM-CSFRα, IL3Rα, and IL5Rα, respectively. The monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascites as described (27Sun Q. Woodcock J.M. Rapoport A. Stomski F.C. Korpelainen E.I. Bagley C.J. Goodall G.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1996; 87: 83-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) against phosphorylated tyrosine was the peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 3-365-10 (Boehringer Mannheim). Cell surface expression of transfected receptor subunits was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining using anti-receptor α and β chain specific monoclonal antibodies. Staining was performed as described previously (17Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Goodall G.J. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed with a EPICS Profile II flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). COS cells were cell surface-labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (28Walsh F.S. Crumpton M.J. Nature. 1977; 269: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Approximately 108cells were washed twice in PBS and then labeled with 1 mCi of125I (NEN Life Science Products and AMRAD Pharmacia) in PBS. Cell were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 137 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and 2 mm sodium vanadate for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation of the lysate for 15 min at 12,000 g 4 °C. Following a 1-h preclearance with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated for 18 h with 5 μg/ml antibody. Protein-immunoglobulin complexes were captured by incubation for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose followed by six subsequent washes in lysis buffer. Samples were boiled for 10 min in SDS sample load buffer either in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol (i.e.reducing or nonreducing) before separating immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation from HEK293T cells was carried out similary except the cells were not surface labeled. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide gels. Samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer for 5 min prior to loading. Molecular weights were estimated using SeeBlueTM prestained standards (Novex French's Forest, New South Wales, Australia). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using an ImageQuant PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoprecipitated proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Routinely, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in a solution of PBS/0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 containing 1% (w/v) blocking reagent 1096 176 (Boehringer Mannheim) and probed with either peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 3-365-10 (Boehringer Mannheim) or anti-βc (1C1-biotin) followed by Streptavidin-POD (Boehringer Mannheim). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. To study the molecular events involved in the activation of the IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 receptors, we replaced several extracellular cysteine residues of βc by alanine residues. So as to target Cys available for intermolecular interactions, we sought to avoid Cys involved in structurally important intramolecular disulfide bonds. By homology with other cytokine receptors, domains one and three are expected to possess two disulfide bonds each. This is clearly the case with domain three, which contains only four Cys residues. However, domain one βc possesses seven Cys, of which only Cys-34, Cys-45, and Cys-75 could be aligned readily with equivalent Cys residues in other receptors (Fig.1). Of the remaining Cys residues, Cys-86, Cys-91, and Cys-96 are conserved in murine βc. Of these, Cys-96 is followed by an Ile at position 98, which aligns with conserved hydrophobic residues in other cytokine receptors, suggesting that this Cys is part of the second conserved disulfide bond. Cys-96 and Cys-91 are proposed to lie in an extended loop between the D and E beta strands of the first domain. Although Cys-86 and Cys-91 were favored candidates for intermolecular disulfide bond formation, we chose to also mutate the nearby Cys-96 and Cys-100 and the single Cys residue in domain 2 at position 234. Expression plasmids encoding IL-3R α and wild type (wt) or C86A, C91A, C96A, C100A, and C234A mutant βc were co-transfected into COS cells. After 48 h, the cells were 125I surface-labeled and either left unstimulated or stimulated with IL-3. IL-3Rα and βc were then immunoprecipitated with specific MAbs 9F5 and 8E4, respectively, and the proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing or reducing conditions. We found that the βc mutants C100A and C234A behaved very similarly to wt βc. Both mutants allowed the formation of two high molecular weight complexes in response to IL-3 (Fig.2 A), which, as with wt βc, contain IL-3Rα and βc (Ref. 17Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J.

These two complexes were immunoprecipitated by both anti-IL-3Rα mAb 9F5 and anti-βc mAb 8E4 (Fig.2 A). In the absence of IL-3, the anti-IL-3Rα mAb 9F5 immunoprecipitated only monomeric IL-3Rα, whereas the anti-βc mAb 8E4 immunoprecipitated monomeric βc as well as the high molecular weight complex corresponding to disulfide-linked βc homodimers (4Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Goodall G.J. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). As with the disulfide-linked dimers, the noncovalent IL-3Rα and βc heterodimers were not affected by mutating Cys-100 or Cys-234 because both the anti-IL-3Rα mAb and the anti-βc mAb co-immunoprecipitated both IL-3Rα and βc, and they did so only in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the mutants C86A, C91A, and C96A had a profound effect on disulfide-linked receptor dimerization. In the presence of IL-3, anti-IL-3Rα mAb 9F5 and anti-βc mAb 8E4 did not immunoprecipitate the high molecular weight complexes corresponding to IL-3Rα and βc heterodimers (Fig. 2 A). In fact, under nonreducing conditions, very little or no monomeric βc was immunoprecipitated by either mAb; most of the label was observed in the high molecular weight region, probably representing aggregated βc. With the anti-IL-3Rα mAb 9F5, a nonspecific band migrating slightly faster than βcwas seen (Fig. 2 A). Under reducing conditions, however, monomeric βc could be detected (Fig. 2 B). An important difference was noted between the C86A and C91A mutants on one hand and the C96A mutant on the other hand. Anti-IL-3Rα mAb 9F5 co-immunoprecipitated C86A and C91A in the presence of IL-3 but did not co-immunoprecipitate C96A (Fig. 2). Reciprocally, in the presence of IL-3, the anti-βc mAb co-immnunoprecipitated IL-3Rα with C86A and C91A but not with C96A (Fig. 2). This was more clearly seen under reducing conditions (Fig. 2 B) than under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 A), where an overall lower signal was observed. To verify that the surface expression levels of the individual βc mutants was similar to βc wt, COS cells transfected with the various constructs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the surface expression of wt βc and the Cys → Ala βcmutants was very similar both in terms of percentage of transfected cells expressing the different receptor subunits and in absolute levels (Fig. 3), suggesting that the mutations did not affect subunit transport and expression at the cell surface. We next examined the ability of Cys mutants of βc to support high affinity IL-3 or GM-CSF binding. COS cells were transfected with IL-3Rα and GM-CSFRα and either wt βc or the Cys → Ala βc mutants and subjected to saturation binding studies with 125I-IL3 and 125I-GM-CSF. Scatchard transformation of the saturation binding curves were performed and the K d and receptor numbers determined using the Ligand program. We found that βc bearing Cys → Ala substitutions at positions 86, 91, 100, and 234 were able to form high affinity binding sites (Fig.4 and TableI). The range of affinities for IL-3 high affinity binding of these Cys → Ala βc substitution mutants varied from 31 to 280 pm, compared with 330 pm for wt βc, whereas GM-CSF high affinity binding ranged from 27 to 230 pm, compared with 120 pm for wild type βc. In contrast, COS cell transfectants expressing the C96A βc showed no detectable high affinity binding (Fig. 4 and Table I).Table IEffect of alanine substitutions of Cys-86, Cys-91, Cys-96, Cys-100, and Cys-234 of β c on IL-3 and GM-CSF high affinity bindingIL-3GM-CSFkd1Number/cellkd1Number/cellWt βc Exp 11-aExp, experiment.330 ± 25.37230 ± 409119 ± 44.54700 ± 1570 Exp 2261 ± 29.67110 ± 66240.9 ± 6.02770 ± 265C86A Exp 141.9 ± 15.5289 ± 6063 ± 18723 ± 169 Exp 245.6 ± 3.51325 ± 7128.5 ± 11.01108 ± 313C91A Exp 131.0 ± 8.9530 ± 7927.4 ± 3.9421 ± 42 Exp 235.8 ± 5.11040 ± 9444.6 ± 123.11340 ± 1610C96A Exp 100 Exp 200C100A Exp 1277 ± 15.77830 ± 241230 ± 43.38790 ± 1450 Exp 2270 ± 36.013500 ± 133725.6 ± 5.43310 ± 374C234A Exp 1279.2 ± 22.010100 ± 566164 ± 30.59270 ± 1450 Exp 2193 ± 19.311800 ± 71090 ± 8.12650 ± 1561-a Exp, experiment. Open table in a new tab Although βc mutants C86A and C91A were able to support high affinity binding of IL-3 and GM-CSF, a reduction in the number of high affinity receptors was observed compared with wild type βc and the C100A and C234A analogues (Fig. 4 and TableI). This is probably a reflection of the tendency of C86A and C91A βc analogues to oligomerize as observed in the immunoprecipitations under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 A), thereby reducing the amount of free βc available for interaction with α chain. It has been previously established that stimulation of cells with IL-3 leads to the formation of disulfide-linked heterodimers of IL-3 receptor α and βcchain, which is associated with phosphorylation of βc(17Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Goodall G.J. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the case of the GM-CSF receptor, receptor heterodimerization occurs upon stimulation with GM-CSF, and this is accompanied by βc phosphorylation (4Bagley C.J. Woodcock J.M. Stomski F.C. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that in addition to the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors, the IL-5 receptor forms disulfide-linked complexes that are similarly accompanied by βc phosphorylation (Fig.5). The relative proportion of phosphorylated βc in the disulfide-linked heterodimer and in monomeric βc varied between the three receptors. This may be due to kinetic differences in receptor assembly or in the stability of each receptor heterodimer. We have now taken advantage of the inability of βc mutants to form disulfide-linked heterodimers to determine whether the formation of these is necessary for receptor activation or whether noncovalent dimerization is sufficient for activation as measured by βcphosphorylation. We transfected wt βc and the different βc mutants in HEK293T cells together with JAK-2 and either IL-3Rα, GM-CSFRα, or IL-5Rα chain cDNA. After 48 h, the cells were either not treated or treated with IL-3, GM-CSF, or IL-5, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with mAb 8E4 anti-βc.The immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and Western blotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Mutants C100A and C234A and wt βc, which heterodimerize with the receptor α chain in a disulfide-linked manner in response to ligand, showed phosphorylation of βc. In contrast, mutants C86A, C91A, and C96A, which have lost the ability to heterodimerize in a disulfide-linked manner in response to ligand, have lost the potential to be phosphorylated in response to IL-3, GM-CSF, or IL-5 (Fig. 6).Figure 6Alanine substitutions Cys-91, Cys-96, and Cys-100 of βc abolish IL-3-, GM-CSF-, and IL-5-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of βc. HEK293T cells transfected with either IL-3Rα (A), GM-CSFRα (B), or IL-5Rα (C) together with wild type or mutant βc were incubated either with medium alone (−) or with medium containing 6.5 nm IL-3 (+IL-3), 6.5 nm GM-CSF (+GM-CSF), or 6.5 nm IL-5 (+IL-5) for 5 min at 4 °C. After cell lysis, proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-βc mAb 8E4, and the immunoprecipitates were separated under reducing conditions on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 3-365-10 (A–C). To control for the amount of βc present, the filters were also probed with anti-βc, mAb, 1C1 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of all mutants compared with wt was monitored by flow cytometry and by Western blot analysis with antibodies to βc and indicated that the levels were very similar between all the mutants.(Figs. 3 and 5 D). Because the number of high affinity sites for mutants C86A and C91A was decreased, the lack of phosphorylation with these two mutants could have been the result of a decrease in sensitivity due to less mutant βcbeing heterodimerized compared with the total amount of mutant βc expressed. To address this possibility, we have examined only βc heterodimerized to the IL-3Rα by immunoprecipitating with IL-3Rα antibody and Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The results were identical to those seen when the βc was directly immunoprecipitated, indicating that cysteines in position 86 and 91 are essential for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7). We show here that disulfide-linked heterodimerization of the GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors is essential for receptor activation by the cognate ligand. Furthermore, we have identified Cys-86 and Cys-91 in the N-terminal domain of βc as the key Cys residues involved in heterodimerization with the α chain of each receptor. Comparison with other cytokine receptors indicates that these Cys residues constitute a conserved motif present only in human and mouse βc and in βIL-3, suggesting that it subserves a specia"

We have now explored the contributions of several regulatory elements to this specificity. Deletion of the neuron-restrictive silencer element partially relieved the suppression of promoter activity in C6 glioma and HeLa cells. An overlapping G(C/G)G/tandem Sp1-containing region crucial for both basal and nerve growth factor (NGF)-regulated promoter activity specifically bound nuclear proteins on its purine-rich sense strand. A faster migrating complex, single-stranded binding protein complex 1 (SBPC1), was highly enriched in HeLa cells, whereas a slower migrating complex, SBPC2, was enriched in PC12 cells. A high ratio of 2/1 complex correlated with a high level of promoter activity. NGF treatment of PC12 cells reduced SBPC1 but increased SBPC2. Competition experiments showed that the SBPC1 binding required a dG4sequence and the SBPC2 needed a core of TG3A plus a 5′-flanking sequence. Single-stranded DNA encompassing TG3A and/or dG4 specifically suppressed cotransfected NMDAR1 promoter activity. UV cross-linking studies indicated that a 31.5-kDa protein mainly formed SBPC1, whereas SBPC2 contained several larger proteins. Our results suggest that neuron-restrictive silencer factor and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins may both play a role in cell-type specificity of the NMDAR1 gene, and the latter may also be involved in basal and NGF-regulated activity.

For example, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K specifically binds to a cytosine-rich single-stranded DNA of the human c-MYC promoter and transactivates a heterogeneous promoter containing this binding sequence only when this promoter is present in a circular, supercoiled conformation and not in a linearized construct (19Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The supercoiled structure is thought to provide a single-stranded region of DNA due to negative supercoiling of the circular plasmid. Another example is a cellular nucleic acid binding protein (22Michelotti E.F. Tomonaga T. Krutzsch H. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9494-9499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This cellular nucleic acid binding protein is a ∼19–20-kDa zinc finger protein that recognizes a purine-rich single strand sequence GTGCGGTG in the sterol regulatory element (21Rajavashisth T.B.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) identified a protein complex that recognizes a G-rich strand of an NGFI/Egr binding element (20Taira E. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Proteins in this complex are enriched in the rat brain. Their results suggested that the NGFI/Egr element may be a convergence point for double and single-stranded binding transcription factors. The proximal 356-bp promoter of the NMDAR1 gene contains a GC-rich sequence encompassing GSG and Sp1 elements. The sense strand of this region also is purine-rich (15Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that a disruption of these sequences eliminating GSG and Sp1 binding decreased the basal and growth factor-regulated promoter activities (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of an NRSE and the interactions of nuclear proteins with a purine-rich single (sense) strand of GSG/Sp1 region in the control of cell-type-specific expression of the NMDAR1 promoter. Plasmids of the NMDAR1 promoter/luciferase reporter gene were constructed as described previously (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

Deletion of the NRSE in the NMDAR1 promoter construct, pNRL356, was prepared using deletion PCR (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Primers were designed and used as follows. For the upper fragment in the first round of PCR, primer GB46 (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was paired with a downstream primer GB126, 5′-GAGCGCGGCGGATG‖GCGTGTTTGGCGCT. The lower fragment was generated with GB40 (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with an upstream primer, GB125, 5′-AGCGCCAAACACGC‖CATCCGCCGCGCTC. A “‖” indicates a deletion of a 17-bp NRSE-containing sequence in both GB126 and GB125. The second round of PCR was performed with agarose gel-purified products from the first round of PCR under the conditions as described before (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The final PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T and subcloned into a luciferase expression vector as reported previously (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

A plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase gene was used to correct for transfection efficiency. In some experiments, G-25 Sephadex-purified oligonucleotides were added to transfection mixtures together with promoter/reporter plasmids. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured PC12, C6, and HeLa cells using a modified Dignam method (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

In some experiments, PC12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for different times before harvesting for nuclear extraction. DNA probes or competitors used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) are as follows. Single strand DNA probes encompassing the GSG/Sp1 element are GB59 (sense), 5′-GCGTCAGGAAGCGGGGGCGGTGGGAGGGGTAGAACGCGTAGGT, and GB60 (antisense), 5′-ACCTACGCGTTCTACCCCTCCCACCGCCCCCGCTTCCTGACGC; double-stranded oligonucleotide probe for the NMDAR1 promoter was formed by annealing GB59 and GB60. Sequences of all competitors are listed in Fig. 5,A and C. Single-stranded sense and antisense Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides (22-mer) were synthesized following the sequence of Briggs et al. (33Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). EMSA experiments were done as described before (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude nuclear proteins at 4.5–9 μg/reaction were preincubated with poly(dI:dC) and in some experiments with the addition of competitors at 50-fold excess of probe. Synthesized double or single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase. Radiolabeled probes were purified by G-25 Sephadex chromatography, and single-stranded probes were freshly denatured by heating for each experiment. 10–50 fmol of probe were used in each reaction. In supershift EMSAs, a polyclonal Sp1 antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was added to reaction mixtures 20 min after the addition of the probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), and dried gels were exposed to x-ray film or quantitatively analyzed on a PhosphorImager SI system as described before (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking experiments were carried out using a method described by Chodosh (34Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 12.5.1-12.5.6Google Scholar). A modified sense strand probe, GB59–2, was synthesized by replacing the deoxyguanine at position 23 in GB59 with a 8-bromo-deoxyguanine and purified by a reverse-phase chromatographic column at Paragon Biotech, Inc. (Baltimore, MD). Radioactive32P labeling of GB59–2 and its reaction with nuclear extracts were performed as described for EMSAs. Reaction mixtures were then irradiated with UV light at 254 nm for 15 min on ice. Irradiated samples were mixed with one volume of 2 × sample buffer and denatured at 85 °C for 3 min. DNA/protein cross-linked products were fractionated on SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA) and visualized by exposing dried gels to x-ray film. The apparent molecular weight of each complex was estimated based on protein molecular weight markers, SeeBlue pre-stained standard (Novex), run simultaneously on the same gel. Using a luciferase reporter gene assay in a transient transfection system, we observed that activity of the 356-bp NMDAR1 promoter showed a 309-fold induction over a promoter-less plasmid in PC12 cells but only 2-fold and 8.5-fold induction in HeLa and C6 glioma cells respectively (TableI). This reporter activity is consistent with the endogenous NMDAR1 mRNA levels that are easily measurable by RNase protection assay in PC12 cells but not detectable in C6 and HeLa cells (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A similar activity for the 3-kb promoter was seen in each cell line (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that elements important for the cell-type-specific expression reside in this proximal promoter region. As reported previously (12Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 18Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), a NRSE/RE1-like sequence was found in the NMDAR1 5′-untranslated region encoded by exon 1 and is part of the 356-bp promoter construct (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test its functional role in silencing NMDAR1 promoter activity in nonneuronal cells, we deleted the 17-bp core sequence of the NRSE in the 356-bp promoter and examined the activity of the mutated promoter in both HeLa and C6 cells. Fig. 1 shows that deletion of the NRSE had no effect on activity in PC12 cells but increased activity in C6 cells 4.6-fold and in HeLa cells 2.7-fold when compared with the wild-type promoter activity in each cell line. This result strongly suggested that NRSE participates in the cell-type-specific expression of the NMDAR1 gene. However, after the NRSE/RE1 deletion, the fold increase in activity of the NMDAR1 promoter over promoter-less plasmid was only 40-fold in C6 cells and 5.4-fold in HeLa cells. This is in contrast to a 309-fold induction over promoter-less plasmid in PC12 cells. This lack of a similar fold induction in C6 and HeLa cells suggests the possibility that additional factors, particularly activators, may participate in the control of the NMDAR1 promoter in PC12 cells. This assumption prompted us to search for other nuclear factors involved in this control.Table IActivity of the NMDAR1 promoter in different cellsPromoter activity relative to vectorpNRL3029pNRL356pNRL239PC12 cells305.7 ± 8.3307.9 ± 8.58.9 ± 1.1C6 cells5.6 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.1HeLa cells1.7 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, deletion of a 117-bp 5′ sequence (−356/−240) from the 356-bp promoter abolished activity of the reporter gene. An overlapping GSG/tandem Sp1 element in this deleted sequence was previously shown to be important for promoter activity (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, it is well known that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1 and inducible NGFI/Egr proteins interact with this element. Therefore, we tested the binding activity of this sequence in an EMSA. Results in Fig.2 A show that a 43-bp double-stranded DNA encompassing the GSG/Sp1 region formed complexes with nuclear extracts similar to those reported previously using a 112-bp fragment as probe (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we also observed single-stranded DNA binding activity with both sense and antisense oligonucleotides of the same region as the 43-bp dsDNA. One complex was formed on the antisense strand and showed more binding in PC12 nuclear extracts than in HeLa extracts. The nuclear extracts of HeLa cells formed only one band with the sense strand. We named this band single-stranded binding protein complex 1, SBPC1. Interestingly, in addition to SBPC1, PC12 cell extracts formed a second, slower migrating band. We named this band as SBPC2. We quantified the binding activities of SBPC1 and SBPC2 by phosphorimaging. Interestingly, a high SBPC2/SBPC1 ratio as shown in Fig. 2 B correlated with a strong promoter activity in PC12 cells, whereas a low ratio was observed in HeLa cells corresponding to a low promoter activity. This suggests that both SBPC1 and SBPC2 may participate in the regulation of NMDAR1 promoter activity. To confirm this possibility, we performed two types of experiments: cotransfecting single-stranded DNA as competitor with the NMDAR1 luciferase reporter gene and testing the effect of NGF treatment of PC12 cells on the formation of these complexes. 22-mer oligonucleotides were cotransfected with pNRL356 into PC12 cells. Those single-stranded oligonucleotides known to compete with formation of SBPC (see below results) dramatically reduced reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, an oligonucleotide known not to compete for SBPC complex formation did not have an inhibitory effect (Fig.3). PC12 cells treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 30, 60, and 120 min showed a significant ∼65% reduction in SBPC1 and an ∼80% increase in SBPC2 complex formation (Fig.4). These results suggest that single-stranded binding proteins may contribute to both basal and trophic factor-induced NMDAR1 promoter activities.Figure 4Differential effects of NGF treatment on SBPC1 and 2 binding in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 30, 60, and 120 min, and nuclear extracts were prepared for EMSAs. Nuclear extracts from nontreated PC12 cells served as a control. Two different amounts of nuclear extracts, 4.5 and 9 μg/reaction, were used. Binding activities in SBPC1 and 2 were quantitated as in Fig. 2 B and expressed as a percentage of control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an experiment to define the binding elements of SBPC1 and SBPC2, EMSAs were performed with multiple competing 22-mer oligonucleotides overlapping the sense strand probe and flanking sequences shown in Fig.5 A. A typical binding pattern is shown in Fig. 5 B. Using phosphorimaging, we quantitated SBPC1 and SBPC2 formation in the presence of each competitor and compared the remaining complex to a control without competitor. Oligonucleotides containing dG4 sequence effectively reduced SBPC1 binding to <15% control (competitors 3–7), whereas competitor 4 containing a core sequence of TG3A with a 15-nucleotide-flanking region reduced SBPC2 binding to only 23% control. Competitor oligonucleotides at the 3′ end of the probe (competitors 7–10), resulting in the loss of 5′ sequence, reduced the competition compared with competitors 4–6. This competition study suggests that SBPC1 and SBPC2 protein complexes may recognize slightly different elements located within this region. This concept was further supported by experiments with other oligonucleotide competitors (Fig.5, C and D). Competitor 12 containing dG4 but lacking TG3A sequence competed SBPC1 but not SBPC2. Competitor 14 containing TG3A in addition to all of the sequence of competitor 12 was able to compete for both SBPC1 and SBPC2. However, removing the sequence 5′ to TG3A (competitors 14–17) resulted in a loss of SBPC2 competition. Competitor 17 lacking dG4 failed to compete any complexes although it contains a TG3A core sequence. Considering that the Sp1 element (TGGGAGGGG) in the NMDAR1 promoter overlaps the apparent SBPC1 and SBPC2 binding sequence, we performed experiments to clarify whether these complexes contained Sp family members. In an EMSA, neither SBPC1 nor SBPC2 was changed by a Sp1 antibody, which we previously showed was able to supershift Sp1 binding on the double-stranded probe (Fig.6). A 70-fold excess of double-stranded Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide failed to compete for the SBPC1 binding. Only the sense strand of Sp1 consensus competed for SBPC1 binding. This sense consensus contains a multiple dG sequence, also present in oligonucleotides that competed for SBPC1 binding (Fig. 5). Furthermore, both SBPC1 and SBPC2 showed a faster migration than complexes detected with either a 24-bp Sp1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide (data not shown) or a 43-bp double-stranded probe of the NMDAR1 promoter (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, these data suggest that the Sp1 protein is not involved in the single strand binding complexes seen on the NR1 promoter. To obtain evidence of direct nuclear protein interactions with the sense strand of the GSG/Sp1 region in the NMDAR1 promoter, we modified the oligonucleotide probe GB58 shown in Fig.5 A by replacing residue 23, guanidine, with a bromo-guanidine. After 5′-radiolabeling of this modified probe and incubating it with nuclear extracts, reaction mixtures were irradiated with UV light to cross-link the DNA-protein complexes. As shown inthe right-most lane of Fig.7 A, the DNA probe itself migrated as approximately 6.5 kDa in a SDS-PAGE gel. HeLa cells showed a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa, corresponding to a 31.5-kDa protein after subtracting the contribution of the probe (6.5 kDa) based on one probe per protein molecule stoichiometry. This band is relatively weak in PC12 cells and C6 cells. The same band disappeared after adding oligonucleotide that removed only SBPC1 in both PC12 or HeLa nuclear extracts (data not shown). These results along with those in Fig. 2 B suggest that this 31.5-kDa protein may be the major component of the SBPC1 complex. The SBPC2 complex contains several proteins with larger molecular masses (P, Fig. 7 B). Neurons express many genes in common with other cell types and in addition express their own unique set of genes important in determining neuron-specific functional characteristics (11Chong J.A. Tapia R.J. Kim S. Toledo A.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 14Treacy M.N.

One of these genes is the NMDAR1 gene, which is an important subunit of all NMDA receptors (4Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

A factor important in determining the distribution pattern of proteins is the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Our previous work and the results reported here suggest that the NMDAR1 gene proximal promoter is able to confer neuronal-specific expression. This region of the promoter contains GSG and overlapping tandem Sp1 elements that we previously showed were important for both basal and neurotrophic factor-induced promoter activities. Strong activity was observed in neuronal-like PC12 cells but not in C6 glioma and HeLa cells. In addition, theNMDAR1 gene contains a consensus NRSE in the 5′-untranslated region. Deletion of this element relieved the suppression of promoter activity in C6 and HeLa cells without having any effect on PC12 cell activity, suggesting that this element plays an important role in neuron-specific expression of the NMDAR1 gene. Nonneuronal cells express a factor, neuron-restrictive silencer factor/REST, that binds to NRSEs located in several neuronal-specific genes and represses their expression (11Chong J.A. Tapia R.J. Kim S. Toledo A.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 12Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells, including PC12 cells, do not express this repressor, thus allowing cell-specific gene expression. Deletion of the NRSE in the NMDAR1 gene relieved suppressed activity in C6 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1), but the resulting elevation in activity of the deleted construct was between 8 and 60 times less than that observed with wild-type promoter in PC12 cells. This is similar to results reported by Li et al. (36Li L. Suzuki T. Mori N. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with the synapsin I gene promoter and suggested to us that other factors, present in PC12 cells, may be responsible for the more efficient expression in this cell line. We showed previously that a GC-rich region of the NMDAR1 promoter encompassing a GSG and overlapping Sp1 sites was protected in DNase footprinting experiments and was able to form several complexes with double-stranded oligonucleotides in EMSAs (16Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since this region is also critical for efficient expression of activity, we further examined this region for other interacting factors that might be important in transcriptional regulation. Until recently, the importance of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins in regulating gene expression has been under-appreciated. Several groups now have identified proteins that selectively bind to single-stranded DNA transcriptional elements (19Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We found that nuclear extracts from several cell types were able to form complexes with single-stranded oligonucleotides derived from the proximal GC-rich region of the NMDAR1 promoter. Complexes were formed on both sense and antisense oligonucleotides (Fig.2 A). These complexes were different from those that formed when a double-stranded probe from the same region was used (Fig.2 A). PC12 cell extracts contained more of a slower migrating complex, SBPC2, on the sense strand than C6. In contrast HeLa cell extracts lacked this complex but contained more of the faster migrating complex, SBPC1. An approximately 20-nucleotide G-rich region of the promoter sequence appeared to be critical for complex formation, since a series of competitors containing at least a G3 sequence effectively competed for the binding at both sites (Fig. 5). In UV cross-linking studies, an ∼31.5-kDa protein formed the faster migrating complex and larger, >∼64-kDa proteins formed the slower complex. Although the components of these complexes are unknown, the SBPC1 complex may be somewhat similar to the GS1 (complex binding selectively to the G-rich strand of the Egr response element) protein complex recently described by Taira and Baraban (20Taira E. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They reported that this complex, enriched in rat brain extracts, contains proteins of 36 and 30 kDa and is effectively competed by G-rich DNA and, less effectively, by RNA oligonucleotides. The composition of the SBPC2 complex is not known. Our data suggest that these single-strand complexes may be important in modifying the activity of the NMDAR1 promoter. When single-stranded oligonucleotides known to compete with complex formation (competitors 3 and 5, See Fig. 5 A) were cotransfected with reporter plasmid, the reporter activity was dose-dependently reduced (Fig. 3). Another single-stranded oligonucleotide (competitor 1, see Fig. 5 A) derived from the NMDAR1 gene promoter 5′ of the GC-rich region that did not compete for complex formation did not interfere with reporter activity. In separate experiments, SBPC2 complex was increased when PC12 cells were treated with NGF, a treatment known to increase NMDAR1 promoter activity (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas SBPC1 was dramatically decreased. Thus two treatments, one inhibiting reporter activity (competitive oligonucleotide) and one increasing reporter activity (NGF), also influence the amount of single-stranded complex formation. We have yet to determine the exact relationship between the changes in complex 1 and 2 upon NGF treatment and changes in promoter activity. In any case, this GC-rich region of the NMDAR1 promoter apparently plays an important role in regulating gene expression. Several genes lacking a TATA-box motif in the proximal promoter region contain a GC-rich region similar to the NMDAR1 gene. These types of gene promoters were thought to be responsible for constitutive expression. It is now becoming apparent that these promoters also may be under regulatory control and induced by various treatments (37Minowa T. Minowa M.T. Mouradian M.M.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is possible that multiple transcription factors may be competing for the same DNA elements and that activation of transcription may involve displacement of one group of factors in favor of another that leads to more efficient transcription (41Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yeung C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 42Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Likely candidates on the NMDAR1 promoter might be Sp1 and Egr transcription factors, which efficiently bind to GC-rich double-stranded DNA elements. In addition, the current work suggests that other distinct factors interacting exclusively with single-stranded oligonucleotides of the same region also may form complexes and play a role in regulation. In fact, we showed by competition experiments and supershift EMSAs that Sp1 protein does not interact with the single-stranded probes. Thus the GC-rich region of the NMDAR1 gene promoter may be a target for multiple transcription factors whose interactions with both double-stranded and single-stranded forms of the promoter region ultimately determine the transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2021314839,"We have cloned human dymple, a novel dynamin family member. The full-length cDNA sequence encodes a protein composed of 736 amino acids with a molecular mass of 80 kDa. This amino acid sequence most resembles yeast DNM1P and VPS1P. Dymple lacks a proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain through which dynamin binds to SH3 domains to be activated. Northern blot analysis revealed two transcript sizes of 2.5 and 4.2 kilobases with alternative polyadenylation at the highest levels in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. It was further established that there are three patterns of alternative splicing producing in-frame deletions in the coding sequence of dymple in a tissue-specific manner. When overexpressed, wild-type dymple exhibited a punctate perinuclear cytoplasmic pattern, whereas an amino-terminal deletion mutant formed large aggregates bounded by a trans-Golgi network marker. Since dynamin participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis through a well-characterized mechanism, the existence of a dynamin-like molecule in each specific vesicle transport pathway has been predicted. Our findings suggest that dymple may be the first example of such a subfamily in mammalian cells other than dynamin itself, although its precise role and membrane localization remain to be resolved.

Different forms of Mx, first identified as a murine gene that confers selective resistance to influenza viruses related to interferon (IFN-α/β), have been cloned in vertebrates, including a nuclear protein murine Mx1 (6Meier E.

The yeast VPS1, one of more than 50 genes that are required for soluble vacuolar protein sorting (9Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), encodes an Mx-like protein (3Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara P.J. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) shown to play a direct role in the trafficking of vacuolar and Golgi membrane proteins from the late Golgi apparatus to the prevacuolar compartment (10Nothwehr S.F. Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). VPS1 was also found to be the same gene as SPO15 in mutated yeasts not able to sporulate because of a defect in meiotic spindle pole separation (11Yeh E. Driscoll R. Coltrera M. Olins A. Bloom K. Nature. 1991; 349: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two dynamin family genes have been identified in yeast: MGM1required for mitochondrial genome maintenance (12Jones B.A. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and DNM1, involved in endosomal trafficking (13Gammie A.E. Kurihara L.J. Vallee R.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Both the primary sequence and function of Mgm1p are least similar to those of other dynamin family members. Although DNM1P shares high sequence homology with VPS1P, its function is distinct, since it participates in endocytosis at a novel step after internalization and before delivery to the vacuole (13Gammie A.E. Kurihara L.J. Vallee R.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In plant cells, the dynamin-like protein phragmoplastin is associated with the formation of cell plates, disc-like membrane-bound structures, by fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles (14Gu X. Verma D.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Dynamin has been isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans,Drosophila, and a number of mammals with almost 68% identity across species and appears to function in vesicular transport during endocytosis elucidated from analysis of the shibire phenotype ofDrosophila in which a temperature-sensitive mutation renders the flies paralyzed because of an inability to recycle synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals (15Chen M.S.

The most pronounced diversity between the sequences of dynamin isoforms and other dynamin-related proteins resides in the carboxyl-terminal span, where a basic proline-rich domain exists. Through this region, dynamin GTPase activity is stimulated by various factors in vitro such as the binding of microtubules and SH3 domains (22Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B.

Recent findings have shown that interaction of the dynamin proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain with SH3 domains is responsible for in vivo function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (25Shpetner H.S.

Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies revealed that the necks of invaginated clathrin-coated pits are collared by dynamin oligomers and that pinching-off of vesicles requires dynamin GTPase activity (28Takei K.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Within the emerging superfamily of high molecular weight GTPases, VPS1P and DNM1P in yeast cells resemble dynamin in their involvement with protein sorting. Thus dynamin/VPS1P-like molecules also might be expected to exist in vertebrates. Human autoantibodies have proven to be useful reagents in elucidating the structure and function of eukaryotic cellular components. Several nuclear and cytosolic proteins have been identified as autoimmune antigens (32Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), and recently we isolated a novel mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MAPKK6, using serum from a Behçet patient (33Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In the present study, we aimed to identify the antigen targeted by the serum of a scleroderma patient and screened by a HeLa cell cDNA library. We obtained a human cDNA clone for dymple, a dynamin family member lacking a proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain that exhibits overall homology to yeast VPS1P and DNM1P. Primary characterization of this novel gene was also performed. Autoimmune serum 114 was taken from a scleroderma patient. Anti-γ-adaptin mAb and brefeldin A were purchased from Sigma, and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb was from Boehringer Mannheim. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human IgG were obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-human IgG were obtained from Southern Biotechnologies (Birmingham, AL). The mouse Mx1 plasmid (pMxMN12) (34Nakayama M. Nagata K. Kato A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21404-21408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. K. Nagata (Tokyo Institute of Technology). The UNI-ZAP HeLa cDNA expression library was screened with serum 114 by standard procedures as described previously (33Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) with more than 300,000 plaques included in the first screening. The 20 positive clones obtained were then subcloned into pBlueScriptII SK(−) with the in vivoexcision system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Inserted cDNA sequences were determined by the dye termination method with an ABI 373S DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Using oligo-DNA 5′-TATCATCCACGGGTTCACCG-3′ (1096–1077 bp) and 5′-GCCTCTGATGTTGCCATATC-3′ (698–679 bp), respectively, as gene-specific primers 1 and 2, 5′-RACE was carried out following manufacturer protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 700-bp major band was recovered from 1% SeaKem agarose gels and subcloned into a pCRII TA cloning vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The insert cDNA sequence, determined as above, showed overlap with the original clone, being 300-bp longer at the 5′ end. RACE and original clones were ligated using the internalHindIII (408 bp) site to give a full-length clone. The dymple and murine Mx1 full-length inserts were amplified as SalI-NotI fragments having aSalI site before the initial codon and a NotI site after the stop codon and subcloned into the mammalian transfection vector pME-HA (33Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) or the bacterial expression vector pGEX 5X-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Induction and batch purification of recombinant dymple and murine Mx1 as GST fusion proteins were performed as detailed in manufacturer protocols. The amino-terminal deletion mutant N246 was created by the deletion of the HincII fragment (1–245 amino acids) of the dymple insert in pBlueScriptIISK(−) and subcloned as aXhoI-NotI fragment into theSalI-NotI site of the pME-HA vector. A site-directed point mutation was introduced into dymple cDNA at serine 39 to give isoleucine, and the resultant clone S39I was subcloned into the pME-HA vector. For polyclonal antibody preparation, the coding sequence of 570 amino acids to the carboxyl terminus (736 amino acids) of dymple were amplified as aBamHI-PstI fragment and subcloned into the pQE31 vector (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA). His-tagged protein was purified in the native condition following manufacturer protocols and used to immunize a Japanese White rabbit. The assays of GTPase activity were performed at 37 °C for 1 h in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 130 μm cold GTP, 13 nm [α-32P]GTP (1 μCi, 3,000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), and 0.1 μg of purified GST fusion proteins. Aliquots (1 μl each) of the reaction products were resolved by chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates in 1.6m LiCl (34Nakayama M. Nagata K. Kato A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21404-21408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS7 cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (33Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13675-13679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared by the cesium chloride ultracentrifugation method. Cells were grown to 40–60% confluence, washed once with PBS, and incubated in the transfection medium (80 μl of 20 mg/ml DEAE-dextran + 20 μg of plasmid DNA/4 ml of serum-free medium) for 4 h. Cells were then incubated in 10% Me2SO/PBS for 1 min, washed with PBS, and re-fed in complete medium until the assay. Approximately 48 h after transfection, COS7 cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, collected, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycolate, 1 μm EDTA, 0.1 μm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C. 10 μl aliquots of 1-ml-lysed samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. For visualization, blots were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5% skim milk, PBS, briefly rinsed with Tween 20/TBS, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-HA mAb at a dilution of 1/1,000 or with human serum 114 at a dilution of 1/200 in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS and then washed four times each for 15 min with Tween 20/TBS. Bound antibodies were detected using AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-human IgG. For immunofluorescence, anti-dymple pAb and anti-γ-adaptin mAb were diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS to 1/2,000 and 1/100, respectively. Fluorescent second antibodies were used at 1/100 dilution. COS7 cells were plated out on coverslips, transfected, and cultured for 36 h. They were then washed twice with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 4 min at 4 °C, and washed twice with PBS. The coverslips were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with primary antibody, washed twice with PBS for 5 min, incubated at room temperature for 30 min with fluorescent (Texas red or fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated second antibody, and washed twice again with PBS for 5 min. The coverslips were then dried, mounted onto glass slides, and viewed by MRC-1024 confocal microscopy (Bio-RAD). A 607-bp fragment (1564–2171 bp) of dymple was amplified by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Labeled probe was hybridized to multiple tissue Northern blot in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). As a control, the same multiple tissue Northern blot was rehybridized with the 2.0-kb β-actin cDNA control probe supplied with the kit. The blot was exposed to an imaging plate overnight and analyzed with a BAS-2000 Image Analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Total RNAs were isolated from ICR mouse brain, skeletal muscle, and testis using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). RT reactions were performed on 1 μg of total RNA in 12 μl of 1 × PCR buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 250 ng of oligo(dT) primer (Promega), 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan), and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). RT reactions were conducted at 70 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 40 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. To terminate the reaction, 0.5 μl of RNase H (Toyobo) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by incubation for 15 min at 55 °C. The primers used were 5′-TTAGTGGCAATTGAACTGGC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGCCAATTAGCTTGAAG-3′. A 1-μl aliquot of RT reaction solution was used for the amplification of dymple cDNA by PCR cycling in a 40-μl reaction solution containing 1 × EX-Taq buffer (Takara; Tokyo, Japan), 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mmdNTPs, and 0.3 μl of EX-Taq polymerase (Takara). The PCR involved denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min for a total of 38 cycles. Amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T TA cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A 607-bp fragment was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse brain as described above and subcloned into the pGEM-T TA cloning vector (Promega). A digitonin-labeled antisense mRNA probe was produced by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase using the NcoI-linearized plasmid as the template, and a sense mRNA probe was made with SpeI digest and T7 RNA polymerase using the same plasmid. The preparation of samples and hybridization were performed as described previously (35Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Maruyama H. Kawakami H. Nagai Y. Hagiwara M. Ohkubo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More than 300,000 plaques of UNI-ZAP HeLa cDNA expression library was screened with serum 114 taken from a scleroderma patient to obtain 20 positive clones. Partial sequence analysis showed seven of these to be overlapping (03, 04, 14, 31, 33, 51, and 61 in Fig. 1 A). These clones had significant homology with dynamin family GTPases in the 5′ sequence. To obtain an extended 5′ sequence, 5′RACE was carried out. The obtained 699-bp-length fragment (D1) had a 308-bp overlap with clone 04 and extended 391 bp beyond its 5′ end. D1 and 04 were ligated using an internal HindIII site, resulting in a full-length clone (D104, 2524 bp) with an open reading frame of 2208 bp (736 amino acids). The initiation codon was found 84 bp downstream of the in frame stop codon. A putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) was found at bp 2502 of this clone. A homology search in the GenbankTM data base revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the clone shares high homology with dynamin family GTPases, especially yeast DNM1P and VPS1P (Fig.1 B). The sequence similarity was pronounced in the amino-terminal half around the three conserved GTP binding domains (indicated as I, II, and III in Fig. 1 B) but less so in the carboxyl-terminal remainder. The most remarkable difference from known dynamin isoforms was found to be the lack of proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain, so we named this clone dymple for dynamin family member proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain less. This carboxyl-terminal region is known to regulate dynamin GTPase activity (22Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is also absent in all other dynamin-related proteins. Other marked discrepancies in the sequences between dymple and known dynamin-related proteins were found in two regions, downstream of the first consensus GTP binding domain and in the region corresponding to the PH domain (37Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The former involves an insert of unique sequences of about 44 amino acids and 16 amino acids in the yeast DNM1P/VPS1P and dymple, respectively (Fig. 1 C). This corresponds to region 2 of the self-assembly motif found in Mx family proteins (Fig. 7 in Ref.7Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and region 1 of the same motif is perfectly identical among mammalian Mx proteins and is also highly conserved among the dynamin superfamily members. The divergence in the PH domain was even greater, dymple most resembling yeast DNM1P, but actually no sequence similarity was evident with the primary homology searches. To examine tissue-specific expression of dymple mRNA, human multiple tissue Northern blots were hybridized with the carboxyl terminus of clone 04 (Fig. 1 A) as a specific probe. As shown in Fig. 2 (upper panel), dymple demonstrated two major transcript sizes of 2.5 and 4.2 kb. Ubiquitous expression of both of them at low level was found with high level, the smaller one in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis. The larger form also proved to be abundant in the testis. Because the middle size of the 3′ sequence in multiple overlapping cDNA clones (clone 14 and 51 in Fig. 1 A) appeared to arise from mis-annealing of the oligo-(dT) primer during the library synthesis, the two transcript sizes correspond well to the alternative polyadenylation found in the cDNA clones described above. The 111-bp in-frame deletion in the coding sequence (described below) could not be analyzed in this experiment. HA-tagged dymple and mouse Mx1 were transiently expressed in COS7 cells, and the expressed proteins were detected with anti-HA mAb and the human serum 114 on nitrocellulose membranes. Both gave bands at 80 kDa, corresponding to their deduced amino acid sequences (Fig.3). Only dymple was visualized by the human serum 114, suggesting that this recognizes a nonconserved region of dynamin-related proteins. Because high molecular weight GTPases are known to have relatively high basal GTP hydrolysis activity (5Vallee R.B. J. Muscle. Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Nakayama M. Nagata K. Kato A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21404-21408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), bacterially expressed GST fusion dymple was purified, and its GTPase activity was examined. Like the murine Mx1 protein, dymple could hydrolyze GTP without additive modifications or coactivators (Fig.4). The anti-dymple pAb raised against a carboxyl-terminal 166-amino acid peptide of human dymple allowed investigation of the distribution of wild-type and mutant forms by confocal beam scanning laser fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). The wild type, a form with a point mutation in the first consensus GTP binding domain and an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking the entire GTP binding domain were transiently expressed in COS7 cells and detected with the anti-dymple pAb. To address the question of whether the TGN counterpart of dynamin is dymple, cells were double-labeled with γ-adaptin, a component of the AP1 complex (39Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Overexpressed wild-type dymple localized to the perinuclear zone with a punctate cytoplasmic pattern, but neither interference nor obvious overlapping were observed with γ-adaptin, as seen in a similar experiment with dynamin (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A serine 39 to isoleucine mutation in the first consensus GTP binding domain (S39I) resulted in decreased signal in the perinuclear region with no alteration in the localization of γ-adaptin. The amino-terminal deletion mutant (N246) lacking the entire GTP binding domain, however, made large aggregates surrounded by γ-adaptin-labeling with quite little overlapping, although weak uniform cytoplasmic staining also remained. An analogous dynamin mutant (N272 construct) also forms aggregates but throughout the cytoplasm (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A treatment altered the localization of γ-adaptin as shown previously (39Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but no changes in the staining pattern for the overexpressed wild-type and dymple mutants were detected when used in the present study (data not shown). Endogenous dymple protein in COS7 cells can be recognized with this pAb in Western blots (data not shown) but was not visualized in immunofluorescence at the applied dilution. We found two types of “in-frame deletions” within multiple overlapping cDNA clones. As indicated in Fig. 1 B, clones 14 and 31 had 87- and 111-bp deletions, resulting in 29- and 37-amino acid deletions, respectively. This was also proved by RT-PCR analysis of the carboxyl terminus of dymple (1564–2171 bp) using mRNA prepared from murine brain, testis, and skeletal muscle (Fig.6 A). Sequence analysis of the cDNAs recovered from the major product bands (a 607-bp band for brain, a 529-bp band for testis, and a 496-bp band for skeletal muscle) revealed their deduced amino acid sequences to be almost identical to the corresponding parts of clones 04, 14, and 31, respectively, with exactly the same splicing patterns (summarized in Fig. 6 Band C). These results indicate that these variants are caused by natural 3′ alternative splicing and are not a cDNA synthesis artifact, strongly suggesting the existence of tissue-specific alternative splicing. Dynamin isoforms also have alternative exon use of the middle region that is identical in both dynamin I and II, whereas these two have alternative termination and an in-frame"
https://openalex.org/W1988765502,"A new mild experimental approach for isolation of peptide membrane receptors and subsequent analysis of post-translational modifications is described. Endothelin receptors A and B were isolated on oligo(dT)-cellulose usingN-(ε-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide endothelin coupled to a protected (dA)-30-mer. This allowed a one-step isolation of the receptor from oligo(dT)-cellulose via variation solely of salt concentration. The identity of the receptor was confirmed by direct amino acid sequencing of electroblotted samples or by using antibodies against ETA and ETB receptors. The method used here is very fast, requires only very mild elution conditions and, for the first time, gave both ETA and ETB receptors concurrently in very good yield. Following enzymatic in-gel digestion, MALDI, and electrospray ion trap mass spectrometric analysis of the isolated endothelin B receptor showed phosphorylation at Ser-304, -418, -438, -439, -440, and -441. Further phosphorylation at either Ser-434 or -435 was observed. The endothelin B receptor is also palmitoylated at Cys residues 402 and 404. Phosphorylation of Ser304 may play a role in Hirschsprung's disease.

Although it is clear that post-translational modifications of G-protein-coupled receptors are intimately involved in the physiological function of these signal transduction systems, there is as yet relatively little direct evidence for the specific modifications and the relationship of the different modifications to signal transduction processes. These types of processes are not easily amenable to analysis by genomic methods, i.e. there is a need for efficient methods to directly analyze these processes at the proteome level. We report here new, efficient methods for rapid isolation of the endothelin B receptor and for highly sensitive analysis of its post-translational modifications via mass spectrometry. Endothelin, the strongest vasoconstrictor yet known, is a 21-amino acid peptide with physiological effects on cellular development, differentiation, vasoconstriction, and mitogenesis (1Yanagisawa M.

The consensus ET receptor topology includes three extracellular domains, three intracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic COOH-terminal tail, separated by seven hydrophobic helical regions thought to span the lipid bilayer. In addition it has been presumed that ET receptors are post-translationally modified by glycosylation of the NH2 terminus and by phosphorylation and palmitoylation of the cytoplasmic surface.

However, as yet there is very little direct evidence for attributes such as the sites and the roles of glycosylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation, the location of the endothelin-binding site and the basis for discrimination among the three different endothelin isoforms. A role of endothelin in disease has recently been demonstrated by the finding that mutated ETB receptor is associated with Hirschsprung's disease (17Puffenberger E.G. Hosoda K. Washington S.S.

In addition, mice lacking the ET-1 gene display severe malformation of large blood vessels, stressing the importance of endothelin during development (22Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Suzuki H. Kodama T.

The signaling pathway by which ET-1 promotes cell proliferation involves activation of intracellular kinase cascades and transcription factor stimulation. Recently it was suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of ETB receptor is involved in activation of three distinct mitogen-activated signal transduction pathways requiring extracellular-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 kinases (25Aquilla E.

Studies conducted by site-directed mutagenesis of ETA receptor suggested that the third intracellular loop and the COOH-terminal tail are also important for receptor-G-protein coupling (26Hashido K.

We report here a new method for isolation of endothelin receptor using oligo(dA) covalently linked to endothelin via a specially developed bifunctional cross-linker. Affinity chromatography has been carried out using oligo(dT) columns with mild elution using only changes in salt concentration analogous to methods used for isolation of eukaryotic mRNA. In-gel digestion of electrophoretically purified receptor, subsequent peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF or electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry, and fragment analysis by tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry have been used to characterize post-translational modifications of this receptor. Fresh bovine lungs were obtained at a local slaughterhouse and immediately frozen with liquid N2. Digitonin, pepstatin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, triethylammonium acetate, 1,4-dithiothreitol (Microselect for deprotecting the modified oligonucleotide), tetrabutylammoniumhydrogensulfate (Bu4NHSO3), and chymostatin were from Fluka Chemie; 1,10-phenanthroline was from Merck; Hepes,N-(ε-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Chaps, Ellman's reagent, bacitracin, bovine serum albumin, and MES were from Sigma; the Aquapore RP-300A HPLC column and chemicals for sequencing were from Applied Biosystems; human125I-endothelin-1 (74 TBq/mmol) was from Amersham Corp.; DNase-free RNase A was from Boehringer Mannheim; (dA)30-homomer with and without 5′-modification with 1-O-dimethoxytrityl hexyldisulfide was from BioTeZ (Berlin). Other chemicals (Merck and Roth) were of the best grade available. Trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Endothelin-1 was synthesized with Fmoc chemistry as described previously (28Stewart J.M.

Bovine lung (1.4 kg) was homogenized in a Heavy Duty Blender in 3 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, which contained 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer A). The homogenized lungs were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, the membrane pellets were suspended in 3 volumes of buffer A and washed 3 times by centrifugation. Afterward the membranes were washed twice in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, which contained 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the same amount of protease inhibitors as in buffer A (buffer B). The membrane preparations were stored at −70 °C. The binding activity of the solubilized endothelin receptor was tested with 125I-endothelin-1. 10–20 μg of total protein were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with125I-endothelin-1 (15,000 cpm) in a total volume of 100 μl of NaCl/Pi, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmEDTA and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Binding was terminated by gel filtration through Whatman GF/B glass filter sheets precoated with 0.3% (w/v) polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed three times with 4 ml of NaCl/Pi buffer in a filtration device (Hoeffer) and transferred to polystyrene tubes. The filter-bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter (Packard). 1 mg (400 nmol) of endothelin-1 was dissolved in 200 μl of 35% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetate and further diluted with 50 mm sodium borate, 0.015% Triton X-305, pH 8.2. A 10-fold excess (4 μmol) of the heterobifunctional cross-linkerN-(ε-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide dissolved in 200 μl of acetonitrile, was added in 5 portions at 10-min intervals, followed by intensive mixing. After incubation for 2.5 h at room temperature the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 6.0 with 140 mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate to protect the sensitive maleimido group of the cross-linker from hydrolysis (32Brinkley M.A. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Derivatized endothelin-1 (EMC-ET) was purified on a Sephacel C18 column using a gradient of 5–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of the EMC-ET containing fraction was checked by protein sequencing and mass spectrometry (found MH+ 2685.0, expected 2685.0). The susceptibility of the maleimido group to Michael addition of thiols was indirectly monitored with cysteine and Ellman's reagent (33Kitagawa T. Shimozono T. Aikawa T. Yoshida T. Nishimura H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1981; 29: 1130-1135Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Purified EMC-ET was stored at −20 °C. To (dA)30–5′-SS-R 1-O-dimethoxytrityl hexyldisulfide in 45 μl of 100 mm triethylammonium acetate, 10 μl of freshly prepared 1m dithiothreitol in 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, were added. The solution was mixed briefly then incubated for 3 h at room temperature to achieve quantitative reduction of the disulfide to the free thiol. For complete removal of the dithiothreitol, a gel filtration on PC 3.2/10 column was performed under isocratic conditions (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm EDTA). The fraction with the deprotected oligonucleotide (about 200 μl) was immediately mixed with 15 nmol of EMC-ET, which had previously been concentrated in a Speed-vac, and adjusted to pH 6.0 in a volume of 150 μl with 200 mm MES. The reaction mixture was incubated overnight under argon to prevent dimerization of the thiol-containing oligonucleotides. The extent of the reaction was monitored by gel-retardation on SDS gels of the modified oligonucleotide, compared with the monomer and the dimer of the thiol-modified oligonucleotide. The (dA)30–5′-S-EMC-ET was purified on a Sephacel C18 column by applying a linear gradient of 2–70% acetonitrile in 100 mm tryethylammoniumacetate, 2 mmBu4NHSO3. Binding of the (dA)30–5′-S-EMC-ET to endothelin receptor was checked by a competitive binding assay against native endothelin-1. Frozen membranes (100 g) were thawed and suspended in 2 volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.40% digitonin, 0.25% Chaps, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mmEDTA, 1 μg/ml RNase, and the same protease inhibitors as buffer A (buffer C). The mixture was gently stirred at 4 °C for 2 h, filtered through 3 layers of miracloth and the filtrate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants (85 ml) were incubated with 0.5 nmol of (dA)30–5′-S-EMC-ET for 3 h at room temperature, 100 mg of oligo(dT)-cellulose was added and the suspension was gently agitated at 4 °C for 12 h. Oligo(dT)-cellulose was pelleted by centrifugation (4 °C, 1,000 × g, 5 min) and packed in a micro column. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer C at 4 °C and afterward eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.40% digitonin, 0.25% Chaps, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin. 200-μl fractions were collected. Fractions containing endothelin receptor were identified by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot analysis. 20 μl of each fraction from the oligo(dT)-cellulose column were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer containing 6% SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and brought to 95 °C for 2 min. Electrophoresis was performed in 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS at a constant current of 40 mA for 1.5 h (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were phosphorylaseb (95.0 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68.0 kDa), ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30.0 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The resolved proteins were visualized by silver staining (Sigma Rapid Silver Staining Kit). Immunoblot analysis followed the procedure described by Hagiwaraet al. (35Hagiwara H. Nagasawa T. Yamamoto T. Lodhi K.M. Ito T. Takamura N. Hirose S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: R777-R783PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μl of the protein sample were loaded per gel lane. Proteins from SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Scleicher & Schuell). The blot was incubated with anti-ETB receptor serum at a 1:5,000 dilution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, at room temperature for 1 h. The receptor-antibody complexes were treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugate goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antiserum (Sigma) at 1:2.000 dilution. The immunoprecipitate was stained with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (ready made solution from Böhringer, Mannheim). After visualization, the gel was destained with a solution of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile. The proteins were digested in the gel according to the modified procedure of Hellmanet al. (36Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated using a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC on a Aquapore RP 300 A (2.1 × 250 mm) column in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 3% acetonitrile, 7% 1-propanol, 0.1% (w/v) octyl-β-glucoside using a gradient of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% acetonitrile, 70% 1-propanol, 0.1% (w/v) octyl-β-glucoside from 0 to 60% in 50 min and 60–100 in 15 min. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min and the fractions were monitored at 215 and 280 nm. For MALDI mass spectrometry, samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and sonicated for few minutes. Aliquots of 0.5 μl were applied onto a target disk and allowed to air dry. Subsequently, 0.3 μl of matrix solution (1% w/v α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker Biflex MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer. MS/MS analyis was carried out using Finnigan Mat (San Jose, CA) LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. For the interpretation of MS and MS/MS spectra of protein digests we used the Sherpa software (37Taylor J.A. Walsh K. Johnson R.S. Rapid. Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 10: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the MS-Fit program available at the www site at the University of California at San Francisco (http://rafael.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/msfit). Proteins were electroblotted onto poly(vinylidenedifluoride) membrane, stained with Coomassie Blue, and directly used for protein sequencing. The protein sequence analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 4-cartridge sequencer (ABI, Foster City). The sequencing results were analyzed using a Macintosh based 610A data system. We have designed a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent which in addition to aN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated ester also possesses a thiol-selective maleimido group. This linker was first attached to endothelin-1 via the ε-amino group of Lys9. The identity of the N-(ε-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide endothelin (Fig. 1 A) was checked by MALDI mass spectrometry and protein sequencing. Following HPLC purification, the thiol selective maleimido group was used to attach 30-mer(dA). After purification (Fig. 1 B), the final product, (dA)30–5′-S-EMC-ET, was subsequently added to a suspension of bovine lung membranes solubilized in digitonin/Chaps. The ET receptors were purified in a manner similar to that used for isolation of eukaryotic mRNA: absorbtion on oligo(dT)-cellulose, washing under conditions which favor formation of a (dA·dT) double helix (high salt concentration) and elution with very low salt concentrations that destabilize a (dA·dT) double helix. Endothelin A and B receptors were isolated in virtually pure form (Fig.2 A) and their identity was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against ETA and ETB receptors. We estimate that about 30 pmol of ETB receptor was obtained from 100 g of bovine lung tissue. This is more than twice the yields that we and others have previously reported (38Kozuka M. Ito T. Hirose S. Lodhi K.M. Hagiwara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16892-16896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected from our previous experience (39Hick S. Heidemann I. Soskic V. Müller-Esterl W. GodovacZimmermann J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 40Hick S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 276-278Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), ETB receptor was isolated in larger quantities than ETA (Fig. 2 A). The specificity of the isolation procedure was further verified by experiments demonstrating that natural endothelin competes with the (dA)30–5′-S-EMC-ET fishhook (Fig. 2 B) and that the yield of the receptor depended on the concentration of (dA)30–5′-S-EMC-ET (Fig.2 C). As previously noted by ourselves and others (38Kozuka M. Ito T. Hirose S. Lodhi K.M. Hagiwara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16892-16896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hick S.

After electroblotting, sequence analysis gave the NH2-terminal sequence EEREFP for the ETBreceptor of 49 kDa, which also conforms to previous identification of the NH2 terminus of the ETB receptor (38Kozuka M. Ito T. Hirose S. Lodhi K.M. Hagiwara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16892-16896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,39Hick S. Heidemann I. Soskic V. Müller-Esterl W. GodovacZimmermann J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). From the SDS-PAGE gels, about 4 pmol of Coomassie Blue-stained ETB receptor were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. We took precautions during gel electrophoresis to avoid formation of acrylamide adducts and used only the best and purest chemicals and solvents available throughout the entire purification process. MALDI mass spectrometry was used for initial analysis of the entire mixture of tryptic peptides. This gave predominantly singly charged fragments, which allows easier interpretation of masses observed for peptide mixtures than is the case for spectra generated by electrospray mass spectrometry. From the MALDI mass spectra (Fig. 3), it was possible to identify the entire NH2-terminal extracellular region and peptides from the second and third extracellular regions. From the cytoplasmic region, peptides from the second, third, and COOH-terminal loops were observed. Peptides containing transmembrane helical regions joined to loop regions could also be observed (Fig.4, TableI). Half of the total tryptic digest (about 2 pmol) was submitted to HPLC separation using octyl-β-glycoside as a detergent during elution. The separated peptides were collected and subjected to MALDI analysis. As summarized in Fig. 4 and Table I, analysis of the original peptide mixture and the HPLC-separated peptides allowed the observation of peptides corresponding to the entire protein sequence including all transmembrane helices. Due to incomplete tryptic cleavage, which is often observed for membrane receptors, two membrane helices with the intervening loop were often recovered in a single peptide, presumably because the attached loops decrease the overall hydrophobicity of the fragment (Fig. 4). The mass measurements were sufficiently accurate (better than 0.1% of the calculated mass) to give clear indications of which peptides were post-translationally modified (Table I). We observed phosphorylation for peptides 31, 45, 48, and 49. Peptides 31, 45, and 48 showed an increased mass of 80 Da, which is characteristic for peptides with single phosphorylation sites. For peptide 49, masses consistent with mono, di-, tri-, and tetra-phosphorylated peptide were observed. For peptide 43, palmitoylation at two sites was suggested by an increase of mass of 476 Da (2 × 238 Da). Although endothelin B receptor contains two consensus glycosylation sites at residues Asn-60 and -118, the masses of peptide 2a-9 (residues 27–100), peptide 4 (50–65), and peptide 10–15 (101–164) were consistent with no glycosylation at these sites.Figure 4Peptides identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of bovine ETB receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1972725165,"The in vivo analysis of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), an independent atherosclerosis risk factor in humans, has been limited in part by its restricted distribution among mammals. Although transgenic mice have been created containing Lp(a), the relatively small size of the mouse has precluded some studies. To examine the properties of this molecule in a significantly larger mammal, we have used a 270-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome clone containing the human apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) gene and a 90-kilobase P1 phagemid clone containing the human apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene to create transgenic rabbits that express either or both transgenes. Expression of both transgenes was tissue specific and localized predominantly to the liver. Average apolipoprotein plasma levels in the rabbits were 2.5 mg/dl for apo(a) and 17.6 mg/dl for human apoB. In contrast to observations in apo(a) transgenic mice, we found that apo(a) plasma levels in the rabbits were stable throughout sexual maturity. Also, apo(a) formed a covalent association with the endogenous rabbit apoB albeit with a lower efficiency than its association with human apoB. The analysis of Lp(a) transgenic rabbits has provided new insights into apo(a) expression and Lp(a) assembly. In addition, these transgenic rabbits potentially will provide an improved experimental model for the in vivo analysis of Lp(a) and its role in promoting atherosclerosis and restenosis.

In addition, these transgenic rabbits potentially will provide an improved experimental model for the in vivo analysis of Lp(a) and its role in promoting atherosclerosis and restenosis. Lipoprotein(a) is a complex particle composed of a lipid moiety and two disulfide-linked subunits: apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB 1The abbreviations used are: Lp(a), lipoprotein(a); apo(a), apolipoprotein(a); apoB, apolipoprotein B; LDL, low density lipoprotein; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. -100) and apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)). The presence of apo(a), a hydrophilic glycoprotein structurally related to plasminogen, distinguishes Lp(a) from low density lipoprotein (LDL) and confers its characteristic biological and physical properties. Although many biological properties of Lp(a) have not been resolved, its clinical importance is highlighted by numerous studies correlating elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and stroke (reviewed in Refs. 1Utermann G. Science. 1989; 246: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar and 2Maher V.M.G. Brown B.G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Apo(a) is naturally present exclusively in old world monkeys, humans, and one nonprimate species, the European hedgehog. Such limited distribution of apo(a) among mammals has limited studies of itsin vivo properties. The development of transgenic mice expressing human apo(a) cDNA provided a means to test hypotheses accounting for the effect of Lp(a) on the vasculature. Specifically, these mice have been used to examine the ability of apo(a) to promote atherogenesis by inhibition of plasmin formation and associated consequences (3Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Hammer R.E. Chiesa G. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Metcalfe J.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Studies of apo(a) transgenic mice have also led to several important insights into Lp(a) assembly, including the observation that apo(a) was unable to form a covalent association with LDL containing murine apoB (5Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. Koschinsky M.L. Lawn R.M. Maika S.D. Hammer R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24369-24374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result, coupled with evidence for Lp(a) formation when the mice were infused with human LDL or expressed a human apoB transgene (6Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), suggested that murine apoB lacked structural requirements necessary for Lp(a) assembly. This finding was not completely unexpected in light of the sequence specific interactions between apo(a) and apoB believed to mediate assembly of Lp(a). Two studies using site-specific mutagenesis of human apoB transgenes in mice have reported localization of a single cysteine in human apoB (Cys-4326) that provides the site of attachment for apo(a) (8Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23914-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The regulation of apo(a) gene expression has been studied in transgenic mice containing a human apo(a) genomic clone (10Frazer K.A. Narla G. Zhang J.L. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This transgene comprised the apo(a) gene along with its native promoter andcis-acting elements present within the approximately 60 kilobases of 5′- and 80 kilobases of 3′-flanking DNA. The transgene was more efficiently expressed (i.e. all of the apo(a) transgenic founder lines created containing an intact transgene expressed apo(a)) and resulted in significantly higher plasma apo(a) levels than observed in mice containing an apo(a) cDNA construct. A surprising finding in mice expressing the human apo(a) genomic transgene was the profound sex hormone-induced changes in apo(a) expression, far surpassing the magnitude of androgen- and estrogen-related changes observed in humans. These changes were, however, qualitatively similar in humans and transgenic mice. In both cases, these hormones lower apo(a) plasma levels. Transgenic rabbits represent an increasingly utilized approach to the study of apolipoproteins and their impact on lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis (11Fan J. McCormick S.P. Krauss R.M.

The advantages of this animal, compared with the mouse, relate in part to its relatively larger size, enabling facile studies of vascular injury and restenosis. In addition, whereas rabbits are similar to mice in lacking apo(a) and Lp(a), their lipoprotein profile more closely mimics that of humans with LDL as the predominant plasma lipoprotein (13Chapman M.J. Segrest J.P. Albers J.J. Methods in Enzymology: Plasma Lipoproteins, Part A, Preparation, Structure, and Molecular Biology. 128. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 70-143Google Scholar). Rabbits also develop well characterized human-like atherosclerotic lesions when fed a cholesterol-rich diet. To investigate the in vivo assembly requirements for Lp(a) and to create a new relatively large animal model to study the biological properties of Lp(a), we have produced rabbits containing human genomic transgenes for apo(a) or apoB, and through mating of these founders, rabbits with both apoB and apo(a) transgenes. In the analysis of these animals, we have demonstrated efficient, tissue specific expression of both human transgenes and the assembly of Lp(a) particles. In addition, we have demonstrated that apo(a) covalently interacts in vivo with rabbit apoB and have characterized this novel interaction. The YAC clone containing the human apo(a) gene (clone 366H2 in the Centre d'Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain library) has previously been described (10Frazer K.A. Narla G. Zhang J.L. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The YAC was separated from the yeast chromosomes by pulse field gel electrophoresis. The band containing the YAC was excised from SeaPlaque GTG-agarose (FMC, Rockland, ME), treated with beta-agarose (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and then dialyzed against 0.1 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA (14Couto L.B. Spangler E.A. Rubin E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 90-kilobase P1 phagemid containing the human apoB gene has been previously described (7Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Production of transgenic rabbits utilized methods previously described by Duvergeret al. (12Duverger N. Viglietta C. Berthou L. Emmanuel F. Tailleux A. Parmentier-Nihoul L. Laine B. Fievet C. Castro G. Fruchart J.C. Houdebine L.M. Denefle P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, New Zealand White adult female rabbits were superovulated and then mated on the same day that luteinizing hormone was injected. Embryos were collected 17 h later. Embryo injection, transfer to pseudopregnant females, and animal husbandry was as previously reported (11Fan J. McCormick S.P. Krauss R.M. Taylor S. Quan R. Taylor J.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Duverger N. Viglietta C. Berthou L. Emmanuel F. Tailleux A. Parmentier-Nihoul L. Laine B. Fievet C. Castro G. Fruchart J.C. Houdebine L.M. Denefle P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 pL of 1 ng/μl DNA solution containing either the human apo(a) YAC or the human apoB P1 phagemid was injected into the male pronuclei. Rabbit DNA extracted from ear biopsies was screened for the presence of human apo(a) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using methods and primers described previously (10Frazer K.A. Narla G. Zhang J.L. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Human apoB-specific primers from the promoter region of the gene were used to screen rabbits for human apoB: 5′-AGAAGGTTCCAGATGTCTATGAGG and 5′-TCCAAGTATCTGTCTTCAAGAAACC. Total RNA was extracted from control and transgenic rabbit tissues using RNAstat-60 (Tel-Test B, Friendswood, TX) subjected to DNase treatment and then reverse transcribed (5 μg of RNA incubated with 10 ng of apo(a)RT primer: 5′-GATGACCAAGCTTGGCAGGTTCTTCC-3′, or apoB M46 primer: 5′-CCACATTTTGAATCCAGGATGCAGTACTACT-3′ in a volume of 12 μl at 65 °C for 10 min and then supplemented with Superscript II/buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 1 h at 42 °C). The first strand cDNA was then treated with RNase and extracted with phenol/chloroform. 5 μl of the RT product was subjected to PCR under standard conditions for Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) using 50 pmol of each primer and thermocycling as follows: (94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 90 s/25 cycles). Apo(a) cDNA was detected using primers (a)Kr1F: 5′-ACCTGAGCAAAGCCATGTG-3′ and (a)Kr1R: 5′-AGTACTCCCACCTGACACCG-3′. ApoB cDNA was detected using human- and rabbit- specific PCR primers (M49/M50 human or M49/M50 rabbit) (15Hughes S.D. Rouy D. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Rubin E.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. To demonstrate the absence of genomic DNA contamination, RNA preparations were directly subjected to the same PCR conditions, and no product was amplified. Lp(a) and human apoB concentrations were measured in rabbit plasma by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Lp(a) assay has been described previously (7Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and used purified IgG prepared from goat polyclonal antiserum to human apolipoprotein(a) (International Immunology Corp., Murrieta, CA) as both the capture and detection antibody. The assay for human apoB (B48 + B100) employed a mouse anti-human apoB antibody (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Standard curves were calculated with appropriate blanks and controls using Logit-Log data transformation. All reported concentrations were calculated from triplicate analysis. To assess apo(a) and apoB interactions, plasma isolated from the transgenic rabbits was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to a Millipore nitrocellulose membrane by immunoblotting according to Towbin (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 6: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Where indicated, samples were reduced by the addition of denaturing sample buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Apo(a) was detected with goat anti-apo(a) (Valbiotech, Paris) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat (Bio-Rad). Human apoB was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-human apoB (kindly provided by C. Fievet, Institut Pasteur de Lille). Protein bands were revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham) and scanned using a Hoefer GS transmittance scanning densitometer. The area of the main peaks were used to evaluate the relative proportion of free and apoB-bound apo(a) (18Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weights were determined by the use of prestained standards (Bio-Rad). Freshly isolated plasma was fractionated by gel permeation chromatography using a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). 100 μl of plasma was injected onto the column and run under isocratic conditions with a flow rate of 40 μl/min in GF2 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.27 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). The effluent was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm, and 50-μl fractions were collected during the run and subsequently assayed for cholesterol using a commercial cholesterol assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim). A 20-μl aliquot of cholesterol-containing fractions was used to detect the presence of apo(a) and Lp(a) using electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described above. To create the apo(a) transgenic rabbits, 280 microinjected embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant females, resulting in 17 live born rabbits. Two female rabbits were transgenic, and the animal with the highest apo(a) plasma level was used in subsequent studies. PCR screening was used to identify rabbits containing the transgenes and to confirm the complete integration of the apo(a) gene and its flanking regions (Fig.1). The apo(a) founder rabbits contained an intact copy of the entire YAC genomic clone, as determined by four different PCR reactions spanning the entire length of the clone. For apoB transgenics, 780 microinjected embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant females. Of the 20 live born rabbits, two transgenics were identified using a single PCR reaction specific for human sequences in the promoter region. Offspring of the apo(a) and apoB founder animals were positive for the appropriate markers and demonstrated a Mendelian pattern of transmission of the two transgenes. Mating between the apo(a) and apoB transgenic founders produced rabbits of the predicted genotypes, which were used in this study. To determine the distribution of apo(a) and apoB transgene expression, RNA preparations from several tissues (liver, testes, small intestine, kidney, brain, and lung) were subjected to RT-PCR assays as a qualitative determination of transgene expression (Fig. 2). Apo(a) mRNA was detected in the liver and the testes, whereas under more sensitive conditions (increased number of PCR cycles from 25 to 30) it was also observed in the brain. The portion of the human plasminogen gene contained on the YAC was not expressed in the transgenic rabbits (data not shown). Expression of the apo(a)-like gene was not evaluated. The liver and testes were also the major sites of expression for the human apoB transgene. A relatively weak signal (<5% of signal in liver) was detected in the small intestine. As a control for the species specificity of the apoB mRNA assay, as well as for RNA quality, the RT-PCR assay was used to detect specifically rabbit apoB. As expected, rabbit apoB mRNA was detected in all of the tissues examined. Because of the profound decrease in apo(a) plasma levels associated with sexual maturity previously noted in mice containing the apo(a) genomic transgene, we examined the effect of sexual maturity on apo(a) plasma levels in the transgenic rabbits. Plasma samples collected from rabbits at 3, 6, and 9 months of age (rabbits are sexually mature at 6 months of age) were evaluated for changes in apo(a) levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). This analysis revealed no significant change in apo(a) levels over the course of sexual maturation in the transgenic rabbits. The formation of Lp(a) in the plasma of transgenic rabbits was evaluated by immunoblotting with antisera specific for human apo(a). Under nonreducing conditions, plasma samples from both the apo(a) transgenic rabbits and the combined human apoB/apo(a) transgenic rabbits demonstrated two bands (Fig.4 A); the higher molecular weight band corresponded to the apoB/apo(a) complex, and the lower molecular weight band corresponded to noncovalently bound apo(a). The presence of a high molecular weight apo(a) band indicated assembly of Lp(a) in the combined transgenic rabbits, as well as some degree of covalent interaction between apo(a) and rabbit apoB in rabbits transgenic for apo(a) only. However, the greater proportion of noncovalently bound apo(a) in apo(a) transgenic rabbits suggested that the rabbit apoB/apo(a) complex was formed in vivo at a lower efficiency relative to the human apoB/apo(a) complex. Patterns of apo(a) immunoreactivity were compared in several apo(a) transgenic and apoB/apo(a) transgenic rabbits by densitometric scanning of immunoblots similar to that shown in Fig. 4 A. In apoB/apo(a) transgenics, approximately 20% of the apo(a) consistently migrated as free apo(a) (n = 3), with the remaining 80% covalently bound to either human or rabbit apoB. In apo(a) transgenic rabbits, the reverse distribution was observed (80% free protein and 20% bound to rabbit apoB; n = 3). Although this was not a rigorously quantitative evaluation, the consistent differences between the two groups of transgenic rabbits containing similar total apo(a) levels suggest that apo(a) forms a disulfide linkage more efficiently with human apoB than rabbit apoB. Immunoblotting of reduced plasma samples using the same human apo(a) antisera revealed only a single band representing apo(a) in both types of transgenic rabbits (Fig.4 B). The apparent molecular mass of this apo(a) was approximately 200 kDa, corresponding to an apo(a) protein containing approximately nine kringle 4-like repeats. Samples blotted with human apoB-specific antiserum (Fig. 4 C) gave a single band of 550 kDa, representing human apoB-100 exclusively in the plasma of rabbits containing the human apoB transgene. Concentrations of apo(a) and apoB in the transgenic rabbits were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The average concentration of human apoB in the transgenic rabbits was 17.6 mg/dl. The average total apo(a) concentration in plasma was 2.5 mg/dl with no significant difference between the apo(a) only and human apoB/apo(a) transgenics. To further characterize the association of apo(a) with lipoproteins in the transgenic rabbits, lipoproteins were size-fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. In contrast to density gradient centrifugation methods commonly used to separate lipoproteins from plasma, this procedure can isolate lipoprotein complexes containing proteins associated by weak noncovalent interactions. Immunoblotting of plasma fractionated in this manner showed that apo(a) was present primarily in the LDL fraction in both human apoB/apo(a) (Fig.5 A) and apo(a) transgenic rabbits (Fig. 5 B). LDL fractions of combined transgenic rabbits contained two distinct high molecular weight bands corresponding to the human apoB·apo(a) complex and rabbit apoB/apo(a) complex, distinguished on the basis of the lower molecular mass of rabbit apoB-100 (320 kDa). Noncovalently associated apo(a), although present in the immunoblot of total plasma, was not detected in the LDL fractions of human apoB·/apo(a) transgenic rabbits. LDL fractions of apo(a) transgenic rabbits contained a broad band representing rabbit apoB·apo(a) complex accompanied by a relatively larger amount of apo(a) dissociated from LDL under electrophoresis conditions and designated as free apo(a) (Fig. 5 B). This analysis confirmed the association of apo(a) with lipoproteins containing both human and rabbit apoB, although in the case of rabbit apoB, apo(a) was linked through a disulfide bond in a much lower proportion of particles. Due to the surprising ability of rabbit apoB, unlike murine apoB, to form a covalent linkage with human apo(a), we made a comparison of its amino acid sequence within a region homologous to the site of apo(a) attachment in human apoB. Since the relevant portion of rabbit apoB has not been reported, the carboxyl-terminal region of a rabbit apoB cDNA clone was sequenced. The derived protein sequence for rabbit apoB is shown in Fig. 6aligned within a region of significant homology to four other reported apoB sequences including human. As in rodents and pigs, two mammals in which apoB has been demonstrated to be unable to form a covalent linkage with human apo(a) in vitro, rabbit apoB also lacks a cysteine at a position homologous to the site of apo(a) attachment in human apoB (Cys-4326). These results, in contrast to two previous reports suggesting that a cysteine residue at this position is required for covalent interaction with apo(a) (8Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23914-23917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9McCormick S.P.A. Ng J.K. Taylor S. Flynn L.M. Hammer R.E. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10147-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), indicate that cysteines elsewhere in the rabbit apoB molecule are capable of covalent interaction with apo(a). The use of genomic clones in creating transgenic animals generally has several advantages over the use of cDNA constructs. Most importantly, transgene expression is regulated in an appropriate manner and is independent of its site of integration. To date, several studies have reported the successful use of large genomic clones to produce transgenic mice. However, due to the inherently lower efficiency of transgenic production with large segments of DNA, this approach is rarely used in the more laborious and expensive protocols for transgenesis in other species. In this work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of producing transgenic rabbits containing and expressing a human apo(a) YAC genomic clone. Consistent with studies in transgenic mice, both human apo(a) and apoB transgenes were expressed at significant levels and in the appropriate tissues in all of the founder rabbits identified. Whereas the tissue specificity of apo(a) genomic transgene expression was similar in rabbits and mice, developmental regulation of expression differed significantly between these two organisms. Unlike the striking effects of sexual maturity on apo(a) plasma levels in transgenic mice, apo(a) levels in rabbits were not altered by sexual maturation. Since plasma levels of apo(a) are primarily determined by synthetic rate, a lack of a decline in apo(a) plasma levels accompanying sexual maturity in rabbits containing the apo(a) transgene suggests that sex hormones do not have a potent effect on transgene expression in these animals. The tissue distribution of human apoB expression was somewhat different than that observed in transgenic mice. Human apoB expression detected in the intestine of transgenic rabbits was far below that of endogenous apoB, suggesting that control elements required for expression in this tissue were not present in the apoB genomic construct. This is consistent with the conclusions of two independent reports of mice containing an identical apoB transgene (7Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Consistent with findings of Fan et al. (11Fan J. McCormick S.P. Krauss R.M. Taylor S. Quan R. Taylor J.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), human apoB-48 was not detectable in the plasma of transgenic rabbits, suggesting that there was little or no human apoB protein production in the intestine. The ability of rabbit apoB to form a covalent linkage with apo(a) was first suggested by in vitro studies examining human apo(a) interactions with apoB from a number of mammals that demonstrated that rabbit apoB may form a covalent interaction with human apo(a) under certain conditions (20Trieu V. McConathy W.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The current study substantiates this interaction under in vivo conditions and allows a comparison with the human apoB/apo(a) interaction. The relative proportions of covalently bound apo(a) in the two types of transgenic rabbits reflect a much higher efficiency of human apoB in Lp(a) assembly. As in the previous in vitro studies of apo(a) interactions with apoB from several different species, apo(a) exhibited specific noncovalent interactions with lipoproteins containing human or rabbit apoB, suggesting a highly conserved affinity between apo(a) and apoB. Such noncovalent interactions between apo(a) and apoB have been proposed to facilitate Lp(a) assembly by bringing cysteine residues in position for disulfide bond formation (21Trieu V. McConathy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15471-15474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This type of interaction may explain the presence of noncovalently bound apo(a) in the combined apoB/apo(a) transgenic rabbits. Apo(a) could persist in this noncovalently bound form due to the capacity of rabbit apoB to effectively trap some apo(a) in the initial binding step while whereas disulfide bond formation from this intermediate proceeds with much lower efficiency since covalent linkage must occur between cysteines that are not optimally positioned through noncovalent interactions. In addition to providing unique insights into Lp(a) assembly and apo(a) expression, several features of the Lp(a) transgenic rabbits described in this work represent improvement over currently available animal models for investigating Lp(a), including a lipoprotein profile closely mimicking that of humans and the potential for vascular injury and restenosis studies. However, one important shortcoming of this model is that Lp(a) plasma levels in the rabbits are approximately 10-fold below the concentration deemed to put humans at risk for atherosclerosis. Although the low plasma level of Lp(a) is certainly a weakness of the transgenic rabbit model, its significance is unknown and is currently being evaluated through atherogenesis studies. Another aspect of the rabbit model that may be relevant to atherosclerosis studies is the formation of Lp(a)-like particles containing rabbit apoB. The properties of these particles, which constitute approximately 10% of the Lp(a) in human apoB/apo(a) transgenic rabbits, are entirely unknown. Their presence is obviously not representative of the human condition, and it creates an extra variable, the effects of which cannot be entirely determined through comparison to apo(a) transgenic rabbits. Considering these potential flaws in the model, it remains to be determined whether these transgenic rabbits will provide an important new resource to study the effects of Lp(a) on the progression of atherosclerosis and vascular disease.

We investigated the suitability of three versions of the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of the α7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) family for this purpose by examining their ligand-binding and assembly properties. Two versions included the first transmembrane domain and were solubilized with detergent after expression inXenopus oocytes. The third was truncated before the first transmembrane domain and was soluble without detergent. For all three, their equilibrium binding affinities for α-bungarotoxin, nicotine, and acetylcholine, combined with their velocity sedimentation profiles, were consistent with the formation of native-like AChRs. These characteristics imply that the α7 ECD can form a water-soluble AChR that is a model of the ECD of the full-length α7 AChR.

A considerable collection of studies of their cell biology, electrophysiology, and structure makes them the best characterized family of a superfamily of homologous neurotransmitter-gated channels that includes glycine, γ-aminobutyric acidA, and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors (1Lindstrom J. Narahashi T. Ion Channels. 4. Plenum Press, New York1996: 377-450Google Scholar, 2Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Muscle-type AChRs are composed of four different subunits with the subunit composition (α1)2(β1)δ(γ or ε) and bind the snake venom toxin α-bungarotoxin (αBgt). Neuronal AChRs that do not bind αBgt are formed from combinations of α2, α3, α4, or α6 subunits with β2, β3, β4, and/or α5 subunits. Neuronal AChRs that do bind αBgt are formed from α7, α8, and α9 subunits, perhaps in combination with unknown subunits. When heterologously expressed, α7, α8, and α9 form functional homomeric AChRs that appear to contain five identical subunits. AChRs are composed of five homologous membrane-spanning subunits that are ordered around a central, cation-selective channel. The topology of AChRs that is predicted by hydrophobicity plots has received substantial experimental support (4Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The approximately 200 residues at the N-terminal half of each AChR subunit are extracellular, areN-glycosylated, contain sites for agonist and antagonist binding, and form the vestibule through which cations reach the transmembrane channel. Relatively little of the remainder of the primary sequence is extracellular. Three of the four transmembrane domains (M1–M3) that form the channel are grouped together following the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and are separated from M4 by a large cytoplasmic loop. For the muscle-type AChR, three distinct regions of the primary sequence around amino acid residues 86–93, 149, and 190–198 of α1 subunits and peptide loops around residues 34, 55–59, 113–119, and 174–180 of the γ or δ subunit contribute to the ACh binding sites at the interfaces between α and δ and between α and γ (or ε) subunits, based on photoaffinity labeling and site-directed mutagenesis (6Galzi J.-L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because of primary sequence and topological similarity, homologous residues at subunit-subunit interfaces in other neuronal AChR subunits are expected to have similar roles in the agonist binding site. For example, residues of the α7 subunit homologous to those of α1 and to those around γ55 and δ57 have been shown to contribute to the agonist binding in homomeric α7 AChRs (8Corringer P.-J.

Our knowledge of the molecular structure of AChRs, however, is far from complete. Electron diffraction methods using two-dimensional, tubular arrays of AChRs from Torpedo californica have successfully yielded structural details at 9 Å resolution in three dimensions (10Beroukhim R. Unwin N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 12Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) and at 7.5 Å in two-dimensional projection (13Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Achieving higher resolution, however, has been elusive with membrane-bound or detergent-solubilized AChRs. No member of this superfamily of integral-membrane receptors has been crystallized, and the intact AChRs are too large (more than 200 kDa) for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. An AChR formed from the ECD may be a suitable structural model of a full-length AChR, if the ECD can both fold and oligomerize in the absence of the remainder of the subunit. Several lines of evidence suggest that the ECD meets these requirements. First, the specific interactions between subunits that are important in assembly of the muscle-type AChR and for formation of mature acetylcholine binding sites appear to depend primarily on the ECD (14Gu Y.

The long cytoplasmic loop of α1 participates in assembly subsequent to the formation of heterodimers (22Yu X.M. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 247-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, membrane-tethered ECDs of mouse muscle α1 and δ form heterodimers with ligand binding sites that reflect properties of a full-length AChR (23Wang Z.-Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Wang Z.-Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J.

Biol. 1996; 61: 363-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, sequences of α7 that affect homomeric assembly also have been localized to the first half of the ECD and an area around M1 based on chimeras of α7 and α3 (26Garcı́a-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). According to this report, the long cytoplasmic loop of α7 is not essential for oligomerization. To determine whether AChRs formed from the ECD (residues 1–208) of α7 subunits are water-soluble structural models for the ECD of the full-length α7 AChR, we expressed two constructs of the ECD of the α7 subunit with M1 retained and one construct of the ECD without M1 in Xenopus oocytes. The constructs with M1 were included to explore the feasibility of removing M1 by in vitroprocessing subsequent to in vivo synthesis. We examined ligand binding properties and velocity sedimentation profiles as indicators of global structure and local structure at the agonist binding site of the resulting AChRs, which we have designated as α7 ECD AChRs. We found that each construct, including the water-soluble one without M1, assembles into an AChR with affinities for125I-labeled αBgt (125I-αBgt), nicotine, and ACh that match those of the full-length α7 AChR. These properties demonstrate that the α7 ECD forms a water-soluble α7 ECD AChR that can be a starting point for structural studies of this superfamily of ion channels. The full-length cDNA sequence of chicken α7 (27Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) previously was cloned into a modified SP64T expression vector (28Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar, 29Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 212-220PubMed Google Scholar). For α7M1, which encodes the ECD of α7 up to the start of M2, the α7 coding sequence from the beginning of M2 to past the native stop codon was removed by digestion withBglII and BsmI. It was replaced by a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette coding in-frame for the 19-amino acid sequence SQVTGEVIFQTPLIKNPRV and a stop signal. This sequence contained the epitope of mAb 142 from residues 2 to 17 (5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), followed by a MluI restriction site in the DNA sequence. The last native residue from α7 was Ile240, according to the numbering scheme of the mature chicken α7 AChR subunit (27Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The mAb 142 epitope was introduced for immunoblotting and for binding the subunit protein to mAb 142-coated plastic wells for solid-phase assays (5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The MluI site was included so that the epitope insert could be extended with additional residues after digestion withMluI and BsmI. It has been shown that such extension may be necessary for accessibility of the epitope by the antibody (5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The other construct that included M1 was α7EK, which was similar to α7M1 except for the inclusion of a peptide spacer between the end of the ECD and the beginning of M1. To prepare α7EK, a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette coding for the 38-amino acid residue sequence TMRRRTGTVSISPESDRPDLSTFTSDDDDKILERRRTL was ligated in frame between the proximal BsmAI and distal HgaI sites that are nearly juxtaposed to the 5′ side of M1 in α7M1. Residues 1–6 reconstructed the end of the N-terminal extracellular domain from residues Thr203 to Thr208; the DNA sequence for residues 7–8 introduced a KpnI site; residues 9–23 were the epitope for mAb 236 (5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); the DNA sequence for residues 24–25 introduced a SpeI site; residues 26–31 (DDDDKI) were the specificity sequence for EK that is modeled after its site of proteolysis on trypsinogen (30LaVallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Anderson L.E. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3354-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); the DNA sequence for residues 32–33 introduced a XhoI site; and residues 34–38 reconstructed the native sequence of Arg205 to Leu209 at the distal end of the insert. Beginning with Tyr210 (native numbering), the remainder of the sequence was identical to α7M1. The KpnI, XhoI, andSpeI restriction sites were included so that the mAb 236 epitope and the target for protease digestion easily could be modified readily. A total of 27 amino acid residues were inserted between the proximal copy of Thr208 and the distal copy of Arg205. The third construct, α7WS, was truncated at the end of the ECD of α7 and did not include M1. To prepare α7WS, the full-length sequence of α7 was cut at the BglII site between M1 and M2. The resulting N-terminal domain sequence was cut at theBsmAI site proximal to the start of the M1 coding sequence. A double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette coding for the 22-amino acid residue sequence TMRRRTQVTGEVIFQTPLIKNP followed by a stop codon was ligated between the BsmAI site of the N-terminal sequence and the EcoRI site of a modified SP64T expression vector. Residues 1–6 of this sequence reconstructed the native sequence Arg203 to Thr208; residues 7–22 constituted the epitope for mAb 142. The oligonucleotides were synthesized using the phosphoramidite method on a MilliGen oligonucleotide DNA synthesizer. DNA from each of the three plasmids was purified on a CsCl gradient. cRNA was synthesized using an SP6 mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and linearized DNA. The cytoplasm of each oocyte was injected with approximately 50 ng of cRNA and incubated at 18 °C for 3–5 days in 50% Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. For α7M1 and α7EK, extraction of membrane-bound subunit protein with a buffer containing Triton X-100 was accomplished with a previously reported procedure (29Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 212-220PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were homogenized by hand in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 15 mm iodoacetamide, pH 7.5). The membrane-containing fraction was separated by centrifugation, was washed twice with buffer A, and then was extracted with buffer B (40 mm sodium phosphate, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mmbenzamidine, 12 mm iodoacetamide, 2% Triton) during gentle agitation for 2 hours at 4 °C. The soluble fraction from this detergent extraction step was separated by centrifugation and was used for both Western blotting and assays of ligand binding. For α7WS, the secreted fraction was defined as the subunit protein present in the L-15 medium incubating injected oocytes. Particulates in this fraction were removed by centrifugation. The cytoplasmic fraction of α7WS was defined as the subunit protein present in the soluble fraction following homogenization of the oocytes by hand in buffer A and centrifugation to sediment the insoluble, membranous component. The Triton-extracted fraction of α7WS was defined as the subunit protein present in the solvent following extraction in buffer B of the membranous component from the homogenization step during gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C. Triton-extracted α7M1 and α7EK or secreted α7WS was incubated overnight at 4 °C with mAb 142 that had been coupled to Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) with CNBr (32Wilchek M. Miron T. Kohn J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 3-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After this concentration step, the protein was eluted at 55 °C with 2% SDS and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were deglycosylated for 18 h at 37 °C with 1 unit of a mixture of endoglycosidase F and glycopeptidase F according to instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). A sample without enzyme was run in parallel as the negative control. Protein was denatured and reduced at 55 °C in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS, separated on a 13% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After being blocked in 5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) containing 0.5% Triton, the membrane was incubated with 2 nm125I-mAb 142. Specific activities of the labeled antibodies ranged from 1017 to 1018cpm/mol. Labeling was visualized by autoradiography. Immulon 4 plastic microwells (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with mAb 142 or mAb 236 for solid-phase assays (5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. For α7M1 and α7EK, a volume of the Triton-solubilized protein from the equivalent of from one to three oocytes that had been injected with cRNA was added to each microwell. For the measurement of αBgt affinity, 125I-αBgt was added to the Triton extract and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Total volume in each well was 100 μl. The wells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Triton, and the amount of radioactivity was measured using a γ counter. Each data point was measured in duplicate. For the competitive inhibition assays, the wells were washed free of the Triton solution after 24 h and loaded with125I-αBgt at 4 nm in the presence ofl-nicotine or ACh. The wells were incubated 8 h at 4 °C before washing and then measuring the amount of radioactivity. Each data point was measured in duplicate. Nonspecific binding was measured with Triton-solubilized protein extracts from uninjected oocytes and generally was less than 5% of the specific binding. For α7WS, the volume of L-15 medium above about six oocytes was added to mAb 142-coated microwells and incubated overnight at 4 °C for capture of the secreted α7WS. The L-15 was washed away with PBS. For the measurement of αBgt affinity in 0% Triton,125I-αBgt was added to buffer C (same composition as buffer B, except without Triton) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Total volume in each well was 100 μl. The wells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the amount of radioactivity was measured using a γ counter. Inhibition by nicotine and ACh in 0% Triton was measured after capture of the secreted α7WS, washing of L-15, and loading of each well with 0.6 nm125I-αBgt and the appropriate amount of inhibitor in buffer C. Total volume in each well was 100 μl. The wells were incubated 8 h at 4 °C before washing and measuring the amount of radioactivity. Data points were measured in duplicate. Nonspecific binding was measured with L-15 medium that was used to incubate uninjected oocytes and generally was less than 10% of the specific binding. Buffer B was substituted for buffer C at the step of loading the wells with 125I-αBgt or with 125I-αBgt and nicotine or ACh for the ligand affinity measurements of α7WS in 2% Triton. The equilibrium dissociation constants K d for125I-αBgt were determined by least-squares, nonlinear fitting to a Hill-type equation (Equation 1) using the graphing software KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) C=C0·11+KdLnEquation 1 where C is the measured signal (counts/min),C 0 is the maximal signal (which corresponds in this case to the maximum number of 125I-αBgt binding sites), L is the concentration of 125I-αBgt,n is the Hill coefficient. The half-maximal inhibition constants, IC50, for nicotine and ACh in the presence of125I-αBgt were determined by nonlinear fitting to Equation 2, where L is the concentration of nicotine or ACh,C 0 is the maximal signal, andC 1 is a constant that represents signal that is not displaced by high concentrations of agonist. We used the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Equation 3) to estimate equilibrium dissociation constants from IC 50 values (33Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem.

AChRs in membrane vesicles fromT. californica and AChRs from the TE671 cell line (35Conroy W.G. Saedi M.S. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21642-21651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were solubilized in buffer B. About 200-μl aliquots of solubilized protein containing from 20 to 100 fmol of 125I-αBgt binding sites were layered onto 5-ml sucrose gradients (5–20% (w/v)) in 0.5% Triton solution of 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaN3 at pH 7.5. The gradients were centrifuged 75 min at 70,000 rpm (approximately 340,000 ×g) and 4 °C in a Beckman NVT90 rotor. For determining a ligand binding profile, aliquots of 11 drops each (approximately 130 μl) from the gradient were collected into Immulon 4 plastic microwells coated with mAb 142 for α7M1, mAb 236 for α7EK, or mAb 318 (a rat monoclonal antibody against an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain) (27Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) for the full-length α7. The entire gradient was collected in 40 fractions. After 24 h at 4 °C, the microwells were washed and filled with from 4 to 12 nm125I-αBgt in buffer B for 6 h at 4 °C, followed by washing and quantitation of bound 125I-αBgt by γ counting. Processing of α7WS was slightly more involved because of the low concentration of the secreted protein in the incubation medium. The protein was concentrated by binding overnight at 4 °C to α-toxin that had been isolated from the venom of Naja naja siamensiswith ion exchange chromatography (36Karlsson E. Arnberg H. Eaker D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 21: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and then coupled to Sepharose CL-4B with CNBr (32Wilchek M. Miron T. Kohn J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 3-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The bound protein was eluted from the α-toxin with 200 μl of 100 mm nicotine and was layered onto 5-ml sucrose gradients (5–20%) without Triton in centrifuge tubes. The gradient was centrifuged 75 min at 70,000 rpm (approximately 340,000 × g) and 4 °C, as was done for α7M1 and α7EK. The entire gradient was collected in 39 fractions of 6 drops each, because the drop size was larger in the absence of detergent. After 24 h at 4 °C, the microwells were washed and filled with 1 nm125I-αBgt in buffer C for 6 h at 4 °C, followed by washing and quantitation of bound125I-αBgt by γ counting. The yield was defined as the theoretical maximal amount of bound 125I-αBgt, which was the value of C 0 in Equation 1 from125I-αBgt-binding assays. The AChR yield was calculated in terms of 125I-αBgt binding sites per oocyte. The three variations of the ECD sequence of the α7 subunit were studied (Fig.1). The first construct, α7M1, includes the N-terminal ECD, M1, and the portion of α7 between M1 and M2 up to residue Ile240. It was intended to demonstrate the pharmacological properties and oligomerization behavior of the α7 subunit proximal to M2 and tethered to the membrane through M1. The second construct, designated α7EK, contains a peptide spacer of 27 amino acid residues that is spliced between Thr208 and Leu209 at the junction of the ECD and M1. α7EK also contains M1 and terminates at Ile240, like α7M1. The position of an RRR motif from 205 to 207 at the junction of the ECD with M1 suggests a structural role for these positively-charge residues; therefore, the native sequence Arg205 to Thr208 was repeated at the C-terminal end of the interposed segment before M1. The name “α7EK” is derived from the DDDDKI sequence that was included in the peptide spacer for site-specific proteolysis by EK. α7EK was intended to test the feasibility of removing M1 from the ECD by in vitro enzymatic proteolysis after synthesis. The third variation, α7WS, was intended to be a direct route to a water-soluble α7 ECD AChR. It is truncated at Thr208, just before M1 and contains no transmembrane domain. Epitopes for monoclonal antibodies mAb 142 and mAb 236 were included in the truncated constructs so that the proteins could be detected by immunoblotting and tethered through the antibodies to plastic wells for solid-phase ligand-binding assays (5Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of Triton X-100 extracts from oocytes injected with α7M1 and α7EK cRNA confirmed the expression of these proteins (Fig.2). α7M1 before deglycosylation migrated at an apparent mass of 37 kDa; α7EK migrated at 40 kDa. These apparent masses were about 7 kDa higher than the values of 30 kDa for α7M1 and 33.5 kDa for α7EK that were calculated from amino acid compositions. The detection of predominately a single band before deglycosylation suggested that post-translational modifications were comparatively uniform on all molecules. Deglycosylation shifted each band to approximately the molecular mass of the protein calculated without modifications. Without M1, α7WS was secreted in soluble form into the incubation medium by oocytes that had been injected with α7WS cRNA. The secreted protein displayed an apparent mass of about 41 kDa by immunoblotting, compared with a calculated mass of 26 kDa (Fig. 2). The detection of a diffuse pattern of bands before deglycosylation suggested more heterogeneous glycosylation than was present on α7M1 and α7EK. Deglycosylation shifted the apparent mass down to about 26 kDa, confirming that α7WS had the most extensive glycosylation of the three proteins. The larger shift in apparent mass compared with α7M1 and"

We examined the processing kinetics of normal substrates and the inhibitory effect of the tRNA product on both processing reactions. The product is not a good RNase P inhibitor, with a K I approximately 7 times greater than the substrate K M of ∼200 nm and is a better inhibitor of 3′-tRNase, with aK I approximately two times theK M of ∼80 nm.We generated matrices of substitutions at positions G18/U55 and G19/C56(two contiguous universally conserved D/T loop base pairs) inDrosophila tRNAHis precursors.

Science. 1976; 194: 706-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). tRNA precursors undergo endonucleolytic end processing and modification before their aminoacylation and use in translation (for reviews, see Ref. 3$$Google Scholar). An additional G is added to the 5′ end of tRNAHis (4Cooley L. Appel B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6475-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and CCA is added to the 3′ end of all eukaryotic tRNAs (5Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) following the RNase P and 3′-tRNase reactions in vivo. Several post-transcriptional tRNA processing reactions have been used to evaluate the relation between primary, secondary, and tertiary structure in recognition and catalysis. RNase P, a ribozyme (6Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), recognizes internal tRNA tertiary structure; enzyme-substrate base pairs which are important in RNase P catalysis have also been demonstrated between tRNA nucleotides C74 and C75 and Escherichia coli M1 RNA nucleotides G293 and G292 (7Kirsebom L.A. Svard S.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although not directly relevant to eukaryotic tRNA end processing reactions (eukaryotic tRNA genes lack a transcriptionally encoded 3′-CCA), the observation of base pairing between enzyme and substrate nonetheless raises the possibility of direct readout of internal substrate sequence, either by RNA or protein in the processing enzymes. None of the positions where tRNA sequence varies (8Guttell R.R. Power A. Hertz G.Z. Putz E.J. Stormo G.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 20: 5785-5795Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar), however, could be sequence-specific substrate determinants for recognition or catalysis by general tRNA processing enzymes such as RNase P and 3′-tRNase. The universally conserved, paired nucleotides G18/ψ55, G19/C56 in the tRNA D and T loops are good candidates for direct readout. These base pairs also stabilize the tRNA tertiary fold. Herein, we examine the effects of substitutions in these D and T loop nucleotides. tRNA tertiary contacts have recently been analyzed using substitutions in studies of aminoacylation (9Puglisi J.D. Putz J. Florentz C. Giegé R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Hou Y.M. Sterner T. Bhalla R.

Interestingly, the first C of the 3′-CCA pairs with conserved G2252 in the peptidyltransferase center of 23 S ribosomal RNA, as proven by partial matrix analysis (13Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have studied the 5′ and 3′ end endonucleolytic processing ofDrosophila tRNAHis precursors (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present report, we investigate processing kinetics and the inhibitory effect of the tRNA product on the RNase P and 3′-tRNase reactions. We generated matrices of substitutions in the conserved nucleotides that stabilize the D/T loop tertiary interaction; most of these variants display reduced processing by RNase P and/or 3′-tRNase. Mini-tRNAs with deleted D and anticodon arms could be processed much like wild type tRNAs by both RNase P and 3′-tRNase, demonstrating the absence of required substrate contacts by either enzyme within these regions. By structure probing, we establish that substrate defects do not generally coincide with the disruption of tertiary contacts. Structure modeling the D and T loop substitutions suggests that local perturbations may have occurred in the variants. Drosophila Kc0 cells adapted to serumless growth were cultured and harvested, and S100 extracts were prepared as described previously (15Preiser P.R. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7509-7516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase P and 3′-tRNase in the S100 were separated by S-Sepharose column chromatography (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 50 mm KCl S-Sepharose flow-through containing the 3′-tRNase and the 200 mm KCl fraction containing RNase P were stored in aliquots at −70 °C and used in processing reactions for up to 6 months without loss of activity. The initialDrosophila tRNAHis template linked to a T7 RNA polymerase promoter was constructed using overlapping oligonucleotides (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the small high copy number vector PHC624 (16Boros I. Pósfai F. Venetianer P. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) for propagation and into SK− (Stratagene) for mismatch mutagenesis (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The template for preparation of RNase P substrates has an inserted 16-nt 5′ end leader and an NsiI runoff site at A73 (Fig. 1 B). For preparation of 3′-tRNase substrates, T7 transcription initiates at +1 and runs off at aDraI site, including a 36-nt 3′ end trailer (Fig.1 C). To investigate further possible inhibitors, we prepared the 72-nt product of both tRNA end processing reactions by introducing an NsiI runoff site at +73 into the template for the 3′-tRNase substrate. Three different mismatched oligonucleotides were used to make the substitutions at G18, combined with three oligonucleotides to make the substitutions at U55 (Fig. 1 D). Oligonucleotides were annealed singly to prepare single substitutions or in pairs to make double substitutions. This procedure was followed using both RNase P and 3′-tRNase templates. The same strategy was used to generate the 19/56 matrices. Plasmid DNAs were extracted using Wizard minipreps (Promega). All mutants were confirmed by supercoil DNA sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Corp.). Plasmid DNAs were purified on a larger scale by CsCl ethidium bromide banding. Internally labeled RNAs were prepared by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase using [α-32P]UTP and three unlabeled NTPs (15Preiser P.R. Levinger L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7509-7516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Templates for transcription were obtained by digestion with NsiI (New England Biolabs) to obtain an RNase P substrate or with DraI (Amersham Corp.) to obtain a 3′-tRNase substrate. Runoff transcripts were gel-purified, extracted by a cut-and-crush procedure, and recovered for processing reactions. Unlabeled RNAs were prepared using 1.25 mm each of four NTPs and a 5 × molar excess of GMP to obtain a monophosphate at +1 (18Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The monophosphate at +1 could be important, both for substrate and for the study of inhibition by product, due to a large local charge difference compared with a triphosphate in the vicinity of the active site for both enzymes. T7 RNA polymerase with a 6-residue N-terminal His tag was isolated by a procedure of T. Shrader 2T. Shrader, unpublished observations. using Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose (Qiagen). Unlabeled RNAs were detected by UV shadowing, recovered using the Elutrap (Schleicher and Scheull), and concentrations determined by A 260. 5′-End-labeled RNAs were prepared as described previously (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by treating unlabeled T7 transcripts with shrimp alkaline phosphatase followed by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. 3′-tRNase substrates were 3′-end-labeled for structure probing by preparing 32P-Cp using [γ-32P]ATP and unlabeled Cp (Sigma) with polynucleotide kinase (the mutant from Boehringer Mannheim lacking 3′-phosphatase activity, as recommended by R. Gumport). The 32P-Cp was attached to the RNA 3′ end using T4 RNA ligase (19England T.E. Gumport R.I. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4839-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; a gift of R. Gumport or from Amersham Corp.). End-labeled tRNAs were gel-purified. RNase P reactions were performed using a 1/10 dilution of the S-Sepharose 200 mm KCl fraction incubated with the internally labeled RNase P substrate (Fig.1 B) in a volume of 60 μl containing 30 mmK-Hepes, pH 8, 175 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and 1 μl of RNasin (40 units; Promega) at 28 °C. Reactions were sampled after 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, recovered, and analyzed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Results were obtained by autoradiography. 3′-tRNase reactions were performed similarly except that the S-Sepharose flow-through was the source of the enzyme; the 3′-tRNase substrate (Fig. 1 C) was processed, and the reaction buffer contained 50 mm KCl. Microdensitometry was performed on all lanes of the autoradiograms using an LKB XL laser microdensitometer. The processing product of both RNase P and 3′-tRNase is a 72-nt tRNA which runs from G1 to A73 (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Bands above and below the 72-nt product were not scored. These quantitation procedures using a limiting amount of labeled substrate (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) yielded first-order processing rate constants (V max/K M) relative to wild type (bottom of Figs. 3 and 4); processing reactions with variants and wild type were performed in parallel on the same day to correct for possible day to day differences in enzyme activity or in the preparation of processing buffer. The lower limit for detection of processing using the gel assay is less than 1% of the wild type rate.Figure 3RNase P and 3′-tRNase 18/55 processing matrices. All possible variants at nts 18 and 55 were constructed and tested as substrates in RNase P (left, panels 1–5) and 3′-tRNase (right, panels 6–10) processing reactions. Variants tested are identified below each panel. TheA parts of each panel are wild type; B,C, and D parts are variants as notedbelow each panel. Processing reactions were sampled and analyzed after 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation (lanes 1–5 of each set, respectively). Processing efficiencies relative to wild type are indicated in the matrices at the bottom of each figure. Each matrix value is a proportion of wild type processing rate (bold; 1.00).

Because the enzymes were not purified to homogeneity, we did not determinek cat but, instead, normalized allV max values. The first-order rate constants (V max/K M) relative to wild type do not agree precisely with results presented in the processing matrices, perhaps due to differences between these two types of processing experiments. Recovered end-labeled tRNAs were heated to 70 °C for 5 min in distilled H2O and refolded by cooling to room temperature for 10 min in 15 mm K-MOPS, pH 7, 175 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2containing 1.25 μg of unlabeled tRNA per 5-μl reaction. Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with RNase T1 at 0.4 or 1 unit/ml or with RNase A at 1.5 or 4 × 10−3 units/ml, deproteinized, recovered, and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. BioSym software was used on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 Extreme to obtain wild type and variant tRNA structure models. A yeast tRNAPhe structure from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank was stripped of modifications and Mg2+ so that potentials could be recognized by the software (following instructions provided by J. Stuart, with technical support by E. VanRiper). The structures were minimized by 100 iterations of steepest descent. We have renumbered DrosophilatRNAHis to match yeast tRNAPhe (Fig.1; 20Sprinzl M. Dank N. Nock S. Schon A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2127-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by omitting nt 17 and including nt 20a in the D loop and by omitting nt 46 in the V loop. Five of the eight tertiary contacts in yeast tRNAPhe (8–14,15–48, 18–55, 19–56, 22–46, 23–9, 26–44, and 54–58; see Ref. 21Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag Inc., NY1985Google Scholar), are conserved inDrosophila tRNAHis (bold), based on its sequence and presumed secondary structure (dashed lines in Fig.1 A; green and blue bases in Fig.1 E). TheDrosophila tRNAHis precursor has a 5′ end leader and a 3′ end trailer which are endonucleolytically removed by RNase P and 3′-tRNase, respectively (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 14Levinger L. Vasisht V.

We simplified the substrates from the in vivo precursor to minimize possible interference between the 5′ end leader and 3′ end trailer in tRNA refolding and to avoid any problem with reaction order, which appears to be first 5′ end, then 3′ end, processing in vitro (22Frendewey D. Dingermann T. Cooley L. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Castaño J.G. Tobian J.A. Zasloff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNase P substrate has a 16-nt 5′ end leader and a 3′ end at A73(Fig. 1 B). The 3′-tRNase substrate has a mature 5′ end and a 36-nt 3′ end trailer (Fig. 1 C). The product of both reactions is thus a 72-nt tRNA (nt 1–73). We have used this 72-nt tRNA to determine product K I values for both RNase P and 3′-tRNase (Fig. 2). Prokaryotic RNase P is subject to product inhibition, especially when its catalytic RNA component is used for processing (24Reich C. Olsen G.J. Pace B. Pace N.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16559-16566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have found that under physiological conditions, however, the affinity of RNase P RNA for substrate and product decreases significantly due to an increase in the dissociation rate constant, thereby also lessening inhibition by product. We investigated the kinetics of the fly RNase P and 3′-tRNase reactions (Fig. 2 and data not shown) by varying substrate concentration with a constant amount of input 32P-tRNA, in the presence or absence of a possible inhibitor, the 72-nt product of these reactions.Panel 1 of Fig. 2 shows a time course (10–20-30-min incubations; no burst of processing activity was observed with short reactions) for the 3′-tRNase reaction at seven different concentrations of substrate (A-G). Panel 2 shows the same substrate concentration series in the presence of 5 × 10−7m 72-nt tRNA product. Edie-Hofstee plots used for the determination of K M, V max, and K I are shown in panel 3 of Fig. 2. The ∼3-fold increase in slope in the presence of product (+Prod; - - -) with a very similar y intercept is consistent with competitive inhibition. Fly RNase P displays a K M of 220 nm(panel 4 of Fig. 2), similar to that for other eukaryotic RNase Ps (e.g. Ref. 28Hardt W.-D. Schlegl J. Erdmann V.A. Hartmann R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and K M for 3′-tRNase is 80 nm. K I for the 72-nt tRNA product was ∼1.6 × 10−6m for RNase P and ∼1.5 × 10−7m for 3′-tRNase. Added product is thus a poor inhibitor of RNase P with aK I approximately 7 times wild typeK M; product is, however, a better inhibitor of 3′-tRNase, with a K I approximately 2 times theK M for wild type substrate (Fig. 2 C). Before examining the effects of internal substrate sequence on RNase P and 3′-tRNase processing, we consider the purity of enzymes used for the analysis and the possible effects of endogenous inhibitors. Fractions from early stages of enzyme purification might have at least two types of endogenous inhibitors of tRNA processing reactions as follows: tRNAs and other RNAs, and tRNA binding proteins. To examine the possibility that further purification of the enzymes might remove endogenous inhibitors and thereby reduceK M, we repeated the kinetic analysis using wild type substrates and enzyme fractions that had been further fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ; data not shown), which greatly reduces the concentration of endogenous RNA. We found no decrease inK M, and in the case of 3′-tRNase,K M increased with purification. The D/T loop tertiary contacts are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1 D, and ingreen in the tRNAPhe tertiary structure (Fig.1 E). We made all 15 possible pairwise substitutions at 18/55 and 19/56 (Fig. 1 D) in both RNase P and 3′-tRNase substrates (Fig. 1, B and C) and tested their ability to be processed (Figs. 3 and 4). Relative processing rates are presented in the 16-place matrices (below the processing autoradiograms in Figs. 3 and 4), in which the rows represent the indicated D loop and the columns represent the T loop substitutions. A row in the matrices with reduced processing values suggests that a D loop substitution disables processing; similarly, a column of reduced values implies a processing defect caused by the T loop substitution. There are four combinations in the matrices with the substitution U55A as follows: U55A which is wild type at G18 (Fig. 3, C partsof panels 2 and 7), G18C/U55A (D partsof panels 2 and 7), G18A/U55A (B partsof panels 5 and 10), and G18U/U55A (C parts of panels 5 and 10). The RNase P substrates are poorer than the 3′-tRNase substrates in the cases of G18A/U55A and G18C/U55A. The left-most columns in the matrices at the bottom of Fig. 3 (enclosed indashed vertical rectangles) show that the inhibitory effect of the U55A substitution on both RNase P (left) and 3′-tRNase (right) cannot be compensated by changes at nt 18. The four G18C substitutions, which include G18C with a wild type U at nt 55 (Fig. 3,panel 2B), G18C/U55A (panel 2D), G18C/U55C (panel 4B), and G18C/U55G (panel 4C), all severely inhibit RNase P. 3′-tRNase, on the other hand, is not inhibited by G18C (Fig. 3, panel 7B) and G18C/U55G (panel 9C). The quantitative results are enclosed indashed horizontal rectangles in the third row of the matrices at the bottom of Fig. 3. In contrast to the above and our previous observation (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that RNase P tends to be more sensitive to substrate changes than 3′-tRNase, we found three instances in the 18/55 matrix in which 3′-tRNase is more severely inhibited than RNase P (indicated by the dashed circles in the matrices at the bottom of Fig. 3): G18A/U55C (Fig. 3, D parts of panels 3 and8), U55C (C parts of panels 3 and8), and U55G (C parts of panels 1 and6). G19/C56 is the only Watson-Crick base pair among the tRNA tertiary contacts. There are four C56A substitutions as follows: C56A (Fig.4, part C of panels 3 and 8), G19U/C56A (part D of panels 3 and 8), G19A/C56A (part B of panels 4 and 9), and G19C/C56A (part D ofpanels 4 and 9). Three of the C56A substitutions inhibit processing by both RNase P and 3′-tRNase (vertical rectangle on the left of the matrices at thebottom of Fig. 4), whereas C56A with a wild type G19 (enclosed by a dashed square in the matrix at the bottom left of Fig. 4) inhibits RNase P processing less severely. Three 19/56 appositions in addition to wild type hardly impair RNase P processing (dashed squares in the matrix at thebottom of Fig. 4): G19A/C56U (Fig. 4, panel 2D), G19C/C56G (Fig. 4, 1D), and C56A (Fig. 4, 3C). Interestingly, three of the four appositions that are processed well are on the Watson-Crick diagonal (G19A/C56U, G19/C56 wild type, and G19C/C56G); the fourth member of the Watson-Crick set (G19U/C56A) is poorly processed by RNase P (Fig. 4, panel 3D). G19U (Fig. 4, 3B) and G19U/C56G (Fig. 4, 5D) give RNase P processing rates between 10 and 20% of wild type (dashed circles in matrix). The 19/56 variants that are processed well by 3′-tRNase (dashed squares in the matrix at the bottom right of Fig. 4) are G19C (Fig. 4, panel 6B), C56G (Fig. 4, 6C), G19C/C56G (Fig. 4, 6D), and C56U (Fig. 4, 7C). Combinations which are processed at an intermediate level include G19A/C56U and G19U (dashed circles). The other nine appositions interfere with 3′-tRNase activity. Seven of the 19/56 appositions are poorly processed by both RNase P and 3′-tRNase as follows: G19A/C56A, G19C/C56A, G19U/C56A, G19A/C56G, G19A, G19C/C56U, and G19U/C56U. We prepared unlabeled selected variant RNAs (G18C, U55A, and C56A), mixed them in varying amounts with a fixed amount of internally labeled substrate, and performed Michaelis-Menten experiments to determineK M and V max for both RNase P and 3′-tRNase reactions (Table I). These variants were selected for kinetic analysis because each one was a poor substrate for either RNase P (G18C) or 3′-tRNase (C56A) or both (U55A). Reduced processing was due principally to increases inK M, with relatively little effect onV max, perhaps due to impaired substrate recognition and binding. Using the formula ΔG 0= −RT ln(1/K d) and settingK M equivalent to K d, we can convert the ∼75-fold increase in K M for U55A processed either with 3′-tRNase to a ΔG 0 of 2.6, approximately equivalent to breaking 1–2 H bonds that could be involved in stabilizing the E-S complex (Ref. 29McClain W.H.

Open table in a new tab The D arm and anticodon arm were established to be dispensible for RNase P processing by M1 RNA in E. coli (30Carrara G.P. Calandra P. Fruscoloni P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5741-5764Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, all four G18C substitutions are poor substrates for RNase P (Fig. 3) and the D stem substitution U11A is a poor substrate for both RNase P and 3′-tRNase (14Levinger L. Vasisht V. Greene V. Bourne R. Birk A. Kolla S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18903-18909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the possible functional importance of the D arm for the RNase P and/or the 3′-tRNase reaction by making fly mini-tRNAs consisting of the acceptor stem, T arm, and variable loop (Fig. 5). Both RNase P and 3′-tRNase can efficiently process the mini-tRNAs (Δ11–42), as indicated by the 40-nt labeled internal product (I) at the predicted position on the gel, as well as the 16-nt 5′ end leader (5′EL, Fig. 5 A) and 36 nt 3′ end trailer (3′ET, Fig. 5 B) characteristic of these reactions. In the process of optimizing mini-tRNA processing, we determined that 3′-tRNase works efficiently at submillimolar MgCl2 as well as at 3 mm MgCl2, although the processing is prevented by excess EDTA (data not shown), in agreement with the characterization of these eukaryotic 3′-tRNases as low [Mg2+] endonucleases (5Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of variants that gave different processing results for RNase P and 3′-tRNase, the possibility of differential misfolding arising from the internal substitutions was addressed by structure probing both 3′-end-labeled 3′-tRNase substrates and 5′-end-labeled RNase P substrates (Figs.6 and 7). These variants include G18U (RNase P worse than 3′-tRNase), U55C (RNase P better than 3′-tRNase), G18C/U55G (RNase P worse than 3′-tRNase), illustrated in Fig. 3, and C56A and G19A/C56U (RNase P better than 3′-tRNase in both cases; Fig.4). The most prominent RNase T1 site in wild type tRNA is at G34 in the anticodon loop; D and T loop nucleotides can become susceptible to T1 as a result of D/T loop substitutions (arrowheads in the structure diagrams at left in Fig. 6 and Ref. 14Levinger L.

More dramatically, the anion exchanger of a clonal cell line of intercalated cells derived from the kidney can be retargeted from the apical to basolateral domain. This Cl:HCO3 exchanger, kAE1, is an alternately spliced form of the erythroid anion exchanger (AE1, band 3), but unlike band 3 it does not bind ankyrin. Here we identify a new protein (kanadaptin) that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1in vitro and in vivo but not to the erythroid AE1 or to ankyrin. No significant homologous proteins have been reported so far. Kanadaptin is widely expressed in epithelial (kidney, lung, and liver) and non-epithelial cells (brain and skeletal and cardiac muscle). In kidney, we found by immunocytochemistry that kanadaptin was only expressed in the collecting tubule. In the intercalated cells of this segment, it colocalized with kAE1 in cytoplasmic vesicles but not when the exchanger was in the basolateral membrane.

These results raised the possibility that this protein is involved in the targeting of kAE1 vesicles to their final destination. Epithelial membrane proteins are targeted to apical or basolateral domains using a number of sequence-specific signals (1Eaton S. Simons K.

However, it is becoming increasingly obvious that this process is plastic and flexible in that some proteins, e.g.Na+K+-ATPase, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-coupled proteins, the vacuolar H+-ATPase, and the low density lipoprotein receptor transgene, are targeted to the apical membrane of one epithelial cell type but to the basolateral membrane of another (4Gundersen D.

In one clonal cell line derived from the intercalated cell of the kidney, a cell specialized for H+ and HCO3 transport, we found that the same protein, a Cl:HCO3 exchanger, can be retargeted from the apical to the basolateral domain if this cell is plated at a higher seeding density (8van Adelsberg J.S.

Band 3 is critical for the maintenance of the biconcave disc shape of red cells where it binds to ankyrin, which in turn binds to spectrin, thereby organizing the submembrane actin cytoskeleton. Ankyrin binds to at least two regions of the large cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (12Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), one of which is deleted in kAE1. In detailed biochemical studies in vitro, it was found that ankyrin does not bind to the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 (13Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This immediately raised the question of what binds the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1. In this report, we identify a new protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 but not that of AE1. Although this protein is widely expressed, its expression in the kidney is restricted to the collecting tubule. In the intercalated cells of that segment it colocalizes with kAE1 only when the latter is in intracellular vesicles but not when it had been delivered to the basolateral membrane. The cytoplasmic domain of mouse kAE1 was introduced into the bait, pGBD9 (CLONTECH), and transformed into Y190, which was made competent and transformed with a mouse kidney MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH). Double transformants were selected on Leu−,Trp−,His−selection plates and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Blue color development was assayed after a freeze-thaw cycle and reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside-containing media for 2–12 h at 30 °C. Positive yeast colonies were streaked to isolate single colonies, which were used for plasmid isolation. The plasmids were tested in two yeast strains, Y190 and SFY526. Assays for interaction between various GAL4DNA binding domain (BD) and GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion proteins were performed in the SFY526 strain. The cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 was cloned into a pBS/SK vector (Stratagene) downstream of a T7 promoter, transcribed, and translated using a TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. pGEX-kanadaptin was transformed intoEscherichia coli to direct the synthesis of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein in bacteria. Bacteria were lysed and adsorbed on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the bound proteins were incubated with35S-labeled AE1 in the presence of different salt and detergent concentrations. After extensive washing the labeled proteins that bound to the beads were separated on 10% PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Subconfluent monolayers of the intercalated cell were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 20 min with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, either 0.1 or 1% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitors 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Cells were then disrupted by shearing with a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with GST-kanadaptin or GST beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing the proteins that bound to the beads were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper for immunoblotting with anti-AE1 antibodies. The insert in the plasmid pGAD-kanadaptin was extended using 3′- and 5′-RACE. Mouse kidney “marathon-ready” cDNA (CLONTECH) was used as the template. The T m of the gene-specific primers was designed to be above 65 °C, and the 3′- and 5′-RACEs were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. A mouse multiple tissue blot containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was hybridized to a32P-labeled 900-base pair DNA fragment of kanadaptin under high stringency conditions, and the x-ray film was exposed for 10 h. The plasmid expressing GST-kanadaptin was generated into a the pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia), and the expression of the protein was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were sonicated in the presence of protease inhibitors, centrifuged, incubated with glutathione-agarose, and washed extensively. Fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mm glutathione; their total amino acids were analyzed to ensure that they coded for authentic kanadaptin and then were used to generate polyclonal antibodies in guinea pigs. Purification of GST-kanadaptin on glutathione columns resulted in a largely degraded protein product despite the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. It was only when we included the detergent Sarkosyl (1%) that the proteolysis was reduced, although it was never eliminated. The antisera recognized the fusion proteins whereas preimmune sera did not. Kidney cortex, medulla, and papilla were cut from frozen rabbit kidneys and homogenized in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA using a Polytron followed by a tissue homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min and centrifuged again at 10,000 ×g for 20 min (at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was assayed for protein concentration using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and used for immunoblotting with anti-kanadaptin antibody depleted of anti-GST. Rabbit kidney tissue sections were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 7 min and stained with kanadaptin antisera with or without a monoclonal mouse anti-AE1 antibody (IVF12; a generous gift of M. Jennings, University of Arkansas). Antibodies were diluted into media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the sections were exposed for 2 h at room temperature. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, secondary antibodies (donkey anti-guinea pig antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate) or donkey anti-mouse antibody (rhodamine)) that were diluted into 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% rabbit serum were used. Tissues were analyzed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (model LSM 410; Jena, Germany). Images were saved in TIFF format and analyzed and displayed using the Zeiss LSM 3.95 software. To identify sequences that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the kidney AE1, the bait (pGBD9-kAE1) was transformed into strain Y190, which was made competent and transformed with a mouse kidney cDNA library. Approximately 2 × 107 colonies were screened representing 2 × 106 clones. After retesting the blue transformants, cDNA species were recovered and tested for specific interaction with kAE1. One cDNA specifically interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 but not with vector or with the irrelevant nuclear protein, lamin C (Fig.1 A). The protein (heretofore called kanadaptin, for kidney anion exchangeradaptor protein), interacted again with the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 even when the two vectors were switched (Fig. 1 B) but did not interact with the nuclear protein, SV40 large T antigen, or with itself (not shown). These results demonstrate that kanadaptin interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 in yeast. The cytoplasmic domain of kAE1 differs from that of the erythroid AE1 by deletion of the 79 N-terminal amino acids (the product of the first three exons that are spliced out in the kidney) (9Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Brosius III, F.C. Alper S.L. Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Kanadaptin did not interact with the cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (Fig. 1 C). When ankyrin, a well studied binding protein for the cytoplasmic domain of AE1, was used in this assay it interacted with AE1, indicating that the folding of AE1 preserves important aspects of its native conformation (Fig. 1 D). The construct we used contained the first 24 ankyrin repeats representing the four important subdomains of ankyrin known to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (12Michaely P. Bennett V. J.

Ankyrin also did not bind to kanadaptin suggesting that it is not an adaptor that connects kAE1 to ankyrin (Fig. 1 D). These results emphasize that the targeting or retention of kAE1 does not follow the same rules as that of AE1 and illustrates the power of alternative splicing in increasing the diversity of interactions of individual proteins. Kanadaptin was cloned and expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria. Purified GST-kanadaptin was loaded onto glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with the expressed 35S-labeled cytoplasmic domain of kAE1. After extensive washing, it was found that kAE1 interacted with kanadaptin; the interaction was not disrupted by washing with salt concentrations as high as 500 mm, and it was not affected by washing with solutions containing the detergent Nonidet P-40 at concentrations that varied from 0.1 to 1% (Fig.2 A). However, 0.1% Triton X-100 completely disrupted the interaction (Fig. 2 A). These results confirm the yeast two-hybrid interaction and further suggest that the interaction is likely due to hydrophobic forces. GST-kanadaptin beads were incubated with homogenates of the intercalated cell line in the presence of either 0.1% or 1% Nonidet P-40. After extensive washing the proteins bound to the beads were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (17van Adelsberg J.S. Edwards J.C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11283-11289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that kanadaptin beads are able to interact with authentic kAE1 in intercalated cells (Fig.2 B). The full-length cDNA of mouse kidney kanadaptin was cloned, and the sequence is shown in Fig.3 A. In the 507-amino acid sequence, a region of high proline content (underlined in the figure) suggests that kanadaptin might bind to SH3 domains. In addition, there was a string of 12 glutamate residues near the C-terminal end whose functional significance is not clear at present. Although standard programs of sequence comparisons did not reveal any strong homologies, there was a distantly related open reading frame in theCaenorhabditis elegans genome (termed ZK632.2). In Northern blot analysis, kanadaptin was widely expressed (but at a low level) in kidney, lung, liver, brain, testis, heart, and skeletal muscle, with the brain and testis having the highest expression, and there were at least two messages in the brain and kidney (Fig.3 B). Since AE1 is expressed only in erythroid cells and kidney whereas kanadaptin is expressed in many more cell types, a new question arises: what does kanadaptin interact with in, for instance, brain, testis, or liver? To examine its function further, we generated a polyclonal antibody by immunizing animals with the GST-kanadaptin fusion protein. Immunoblot studies showed that whereas preimmune sera did not recognize any proteins in the bacterial lysates, they recognized a new protein of a molecular mass appropriate for GST-kanadaptin (Fig.4 A). In rabbit kidney cytosol, the antibody recognized a major protein of apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa; however, there were minor bands of about 40 and 28 kDa. Preimmune sera did not recognize any proteins (Fig. 4 B). Because the animals were immunized with GST-kanadaptin and the kidney is a rich source of several GST isoforms (many of which have molecular masses around 28 kDa) we depleted the sera of anti-GST antibodies by passing them through agarose beads covalently coupled to GST (Pierce). The results were the same (Fig. 4 B). Whether these minor bands are degradation products or the result of alternate splicing will need to be determined. Rabbit kidney cytosol was prepared from cortex, medulla, and papilla, and 50 μg of protein was placed in each lane and blotted with the depleted antisera. Kanadaptin was highly enriched in the papilla compared with the medulla. In rabbit kidney sections, kanadaptin was expressed in the kidney only in the collecting duct (Fig.5 A), using either the original or GST-depleted antisera. This explains the immunoblot results since the collecting tubule forms a large fraction of the tubule segments in the papilla and medulla. There was no specific staining in the glomeruli or in other tubular segments. In the collecting duct, all cell types (principal and intercalated) were stained. The staining pattern was cytosolic with an accentuation in the region of plasma membranes, especially apical membranes. One-third of the cells in this segment are intercalated cells and we (and others) had found that their staining pattern for kAE1 is quite heterogenous (see Ref. 18Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar for review). In some intercalated cells, kAE1 was localized only in the basolateral membranes, whereas in others it was present in intracellular vesicles. Using simultaneous staining for kanadaptin and kAE1 and thin confocal optical sections, we found remarkable colocalization (Fig. 5, B and C). In α intercalated cells, kAE1 was present in the basolateral membrane and in intracellular vesicles. Kanadaptin was colocalized with kAE1 in these vesicles but not when kAE1 was located in the basal and lateral plasma membranes (Fig. 5, B and C). One possible interpretation of this colocalization is that kanadaptin is an adaptor protein that guides kAE1 vesicles from the cytoplasm to their basal target. Once delivered there, it dissociates from kAE1 to start another cycle. We speculate that kanadaptin is part of a signal transduction machine that is important in targeting these kAE1 vesicles. Kanadaptin contained a proline-rich sequence (LPPKRPELPP) that could bind to SH3 domain protein. One proposed function for SH3-containing proteins is to mediate localization of their targets to different cellular compartments including interaction with the cytoskeleton or signal transduction proteins (19Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Future studies will aim at identifying the interacting proteins with kanadaptin in the intercalated cells. The plasticity of epithelial polarity of proton ATPases and anion exchangers was first identified in vivo as a mechanism of regulation of trans-epithelial H+ transport in response to an increase in the acid content of the diet (20Schwartz G.J. Barasch J. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1985; 318: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our recent studies showed that plasticity is mediated, in vitro at least, by signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). The factor responsible for the in vitro effect was recently purified and partially sequenced, and this new ECM protein, which we have termed hensin, is restricted in expression to epithelia and in the kidney to the collecting duct (21Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Upon localization of this protein to the ECM of intercalated cells in vitro, intracellular signals lead to retargeting of kAE1 from the apical to the basolateral membrane (8van Adelsberg J.S. Edwards J.C. Takito J. Kiss B. Al-Awqati Q. Cell. 1994; 76: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,21Takito J. Hikita C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Kanadaptin is likely to be an important mediator of this targeting process. The identification of kanadaptin should facilitate the further purification of the other proteins involved in the retargeting of kAE1-containing vesicles from the apical to basolateral surface. That kanadaptin did not localize to the basolateral membrane raises the possibility that it dissociates from kAE1, perhaps to return and bind to other kAE1 vesicles in the cytoplasm. One interesting issue that is raised by our studies and those of others is what retains kAE1 in the basolateral domain. Fodrin and ankyrin are present in this membrane (16Drenckhahn D. Schluter K. Allen D.P. Bennett V. Science. 1989; 230: 1287-1289Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar), yet neither binds to kAE1 (Refs. 13Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 14Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, and this report). If no other proteins are discovered that might anchor it to the basolateral cytoskeleton, it is possible that kAE1-carrying vesicles exist in a mobile pool that can be retracted and inserted into the basolateral membrane under the influence of physiological regulators. That a large fraction of these intercalated cells contains kAE1 only in intracellular vesicles (18Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. We had previously discovered that the vacuolar proton ATPase in these same cells exists in such a regulated pool (22Gluck S.L. Cannon C. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Cannon C. van Adelsberg J. Cannon C. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1985; 314: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An increase in the pCO2of the medium acidified the cytoplasm, which led to an increased cell calcium. This in turn triggered the insertion of vesicles enriched in the vacuolar ATPase into the apical plasma membrane, thereby increasing trans-epithelial H+ secretion. We are grateful to the following for providing reagents used in this study: J. C. Edwards for kAE1; S. L. Alper for AE1; G. Michaely and V. Bennett for ankyrin; M. L. Jennings for AE1 antibodies; and J. Takito for help and discussion."

Although these enzymes are evolutionarily related, only prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) requires 7B2 for activation. To examine the potential contribution of each domain of PC2 to PC2–7B2 interactions, we performed sequential deletions, site-directed mutagenesis, and domain swapping to replace individual domains or particular amino acids of pro-PC2 with the corresponding segments/amino acids of pro-PC1. These chimeras and mutant enzyme molecules were then expressed in AtT-20 cells and analyzed for 7B2 binding, maturation ability, and enzymatic activity. The results revealed that 1) the PC2 proregion is required but is not sufficient to confer 7B2 binding; 2) the P domain is required for the stabilization of PC2 structure and is not exchangeable with the P domain of PC1; and 3) the carboxyl-terminal domain is not involved in 7B2 binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of pro-PC2 further showed that a single residue replacement in the catalytic domain, Tyr-194 → Asp, prevented pro-PC2 from binding 7B2 and blocked activation. This residue is present within a loop rich in aromatic amino acids which appears to be on the surface of the molecule as extrapolated from the crystal structure of subtilisin. This loop may represent the primary recognition site for 7B2 within the catalytic domain.

This loop may represent the primary recognition site for 7B2 within the catalytic domain. The processing of many peptide hormones and other protein precursors is mediated by a family of subtilisin-like serine endoproteases that act through cleavage at paired or multiple basic residues. Two members of this family, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1, 1The abbreviations used are: PC1 and PC2, prohormone convertase 1 and 2; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; m, mouse; wt, wild type; 7B2 CT-peptide, human 7B2155–185; CMV, cytomegalovirus. also known as PC3) and 2 (PC2), are the major proteinases involved in the cleavage of many hormone precursors (reviewed in Ref. 1Rouille Y.

These enzymes have been found to function sequentially in the biosynthesis of neuropeptides; PC1, which is activated in the endoplasmic reticulum, is believed to act early in the processing pathway, whereas PC2, which is activated only in the trans-Golgi network/immature secretory granules, is thought to be involved in the later stages of prohormone proteolysis (2Zhou A.

Like other members of this protease family these two enzymes exhibit four distinct structural domains (Fig. 1) as follows: a poorly conserved amino-terminal proregion, a highly conserved subtilisin catalytic domain, a less well-conserved middle or P domain, and a non-conserved carboxyl terminus (1Rouille Y.

The domain boundaries are distinguishable by comparison of enzyme sequences from different species (7Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A unique feature of PC2 as opposed to other members of this family is that another protein, 7B2, is involved in its biosynthesis (8Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M.

The neuroendocrine protein 7B2, whose expression is restricted to the central nervous system and to endocrine tissues (11Hsi K.L. Seidah N.G. De Serres G. Chretien M.

Its amino-terminal domain is responsible for the facilitation of maturation of pro-PC2 (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and its carboxyl-terminal peptide is a potent inhibitor of PC2 (14Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have previously reported on the structural features of 7B2 required for its interaction with pro-PC2/PC2 and provided evidence that the proline-rich region in the interior of this molecule (residues 88–95) along with a flanking putative α-helix are pivotal in assisting pro-PC2 maturation (17Zhu X. Lamango N.S. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23582-23587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PC1 and PC2 are closely evolutionarily related, yet PC1 does not require 7B2 for its maturation and activation. To determine what structural element(s) unique to PC2 are involved in the PC2–7B2 interaction, we compared the sequences of all known PC2s, including that of DrosophilaPC2, 2D. Siekhaus and R. S. Fuller, manuscript in preparation. with those of PC1 and furin. These efforts identified several regions unique to PC2s. To examine the potential contribution of these PC2-specific sequences to 7B2 binding (as well as the contributions of the proregion, the catalytic region, the P domain, and the carboxyl-terminal tail of pro-PC2), we used sequential deletion and domain swapping as well as site-directed mutagenesis to replace individual domains or particular amino acids of pro-PC2 with the corresponding segments or individual amino acids of pro-PC1. These chimeras and mutant enzyme molecules were then expressed in neuroendocrine cells and analyzed for 7B2 binding, for maturation, and for enzymatic activity. Except for the carboxyl-terminal region, all of the other PC2 domains, i.e.the proregion, the catalytic domain, and the P domain of PC2, were implicated in successful folding and/or PC2–7B2 interactions. We further identified a single amino acid in the catalytic domain, Tyr-194, as particularly critical to PC2–7B2 binding. pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) was used in constructing all PC2-derived mutants. The serial deletions, domain swapping, and point-directed mutation constructs were created by PCR-mediated procedures as described earlier (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The PC2 construct lacking the P and carboxyl-terminal domains and the construct lacking the PC2 carboxyl-terminal domain only (hereafter referred to as PC2ΔPC and PC2ΔC, respectively (Fig. 1)) were made using a common amino-terminal primer (PC2HindIII), 5′-GGGCCAAGCTTCACTCCCAAAGAAGGATGG-3′; the carboxyl-terminal primer used in PC2ΔPC (amino acids 1–452) was 5′-CGCGCTCTAGACTACACCATGGCACCTGCATC-3′; and for PC2ΔC (amino acids 1–593), 5′-CGCGCTCTAGACTATGTGCCGTGAAGCATCAG-3′. The PCR-generated fragments were inserted into pRc/CMV between HindIII andEcoRI sites. For domain-swapped mutants, the amino-terminal primer 5′-GGGCCGAATTCTTTCACTCCCAAAGAAGG-3′ (mPC2A-EcoRI), and the carboxyl-terminal primer 5′-GGGCGCTCTAGATTAATTCTCCTCATTTAGGAT-3′ (mPC1-XbaI end) were used in making PC2[PC1-PC] and PC2[PC1-C] (Fig. 1). To make the chimera PC2[PC1-PC], which has the P and C domains of PC2 replaced with those of PC1, two rounds of PCR were performed. Two independent PCRs were involved in the first round. In one reaction, the template was mouse PC2, and the primers were mPC2A-EcoRI and mPC2PC1-P2 (5′-GCCAAATCCAAATCGGCTATTAAATTCCAGGCCAAC-3′. In another reaction, the template was mPC1 and the primers were mPC1-XbaI and mPC2PC1-P1 (5′-GTTGGCCTGGAATTTAATAGCCGATTTGGATTTGGC-3′). The PCR products of both reactions were purified as described previously (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These two fragments were then pooled together and used as template for the second round of PCR, in which primers PC2A-EcoRI and PC1-XbaI-end were used. The construction of PC2[PC1-C], in which the PC2 carboxyl-terminal domain was replaced with that of PC1, followed the same procedure, except that two different primers were used as follows: PC2PC1-C2 (5′-GTGCTCTGGTTGAGAAGATGTGCCGTGAAGCATCAG-3′) and PC2PC1-C1 (5′-CTGATGCTTCACGGCACATCTTCTCAACCAGAGCAC-3′) were used in the place of PC2PC1-P2 and PC2PC1-P1, respectively. The fragments were cloned into pRc/CMV between the EcoRI and XbaI sites. The four site-directed mutants were generated as described previously (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All constructs used the same amino- and carboxyl-end primers, PC2HindIII and PC2XbaI (5′-CGCGCTCTAGAGTGAAGGCGGAAGCGTGGCC-3′), respectively. The middle primers were as follows: for construct PC2-(189–194), 5′-ATCATGATCATTATCGTTGAAGTCTAACTTGCATC-3′ and AACGATAATGATCATGATCCATACCCTCGATACACA-3′; for PC2-(201–206), 5′-TTTATTTTCATTTGTGAGTGTGTATCGAGGGTATGG-3′ and 5′-CTCACAAATGAAAATAAACATGGAACTAGGTGTGCA-3′; for PC2-S190D, 5′-GGGGTCATTATCGCTGAAGTCATAACTTGC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCGATAATGACCCCTACCCATAC-3′; for PC2-Y194D, 5′-AGGGTATGGATCGGGGTCATTGCTGCTGAA-3′ and 5′-GACCCCGATCCATACCCTCGATACACA-3′. Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) was used in all PCR reactions. The PCR-generated fragments were cloned into pRc/CMV between HindIII andXbaI. The fidelity of PCR-generated fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. PC2-P:PC1, Fur-P:PC2, and oxyanion hole-mutated PC2 (PC2-D309N) represent stable AtT-20 cell line derivatives which have been described previously (18Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These cell lines were supertransfected with 21-kDa 7B2 in the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). An AtT-20 cell line stably transfected with 21-kDa 7B2 in pCEP4 (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was used for transfections of the PC2 constructs described above. Transfection and isolation of mutant PC2-expressing clones was performed following the procedures described previously (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Two or three clones from each transfection were selected and analyzed to minimize potential clonal variation. Antiserum LSU13 (against residues 23–39 of vertebrate 7B2) and antiserum LSU18 (against the carboxyl terminus of PC2) have been described (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). LSU3 was raised against residues 714–724 of mouse PC1 (the carboxyl terminus) (19Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). LSU7 was raised against the first 13 residues of mature mouse PC2. 3I. Lindberg, unpublished observations. All antisera were raised in rabbits against peptides conjugated to hemocyanin. Metabolic labeling was performed in a 6-well tissue culture plate. In all cases 5 × 105 cells were seeded and labeled 2 days later in Met−Cys− medium containing 0.5 mCi of35S-labeled Pro-Mix (Amersham Corp.) in 1 ml for 20 min. For co-immunoprecipitation using antisera LSU3 and LSU18, cells were extracted immediately after labeling. Alternatively, for 7B2 immunoprecipitations using LSU13 antiserum, cells were labeled and then chased for 20 min with Met/Cys-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 2% fetal bovine serum). Cells were extracted with 1% Triton buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton (20Kim P.S. Kwon O.Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). The samples were then diluted with an equal volume of extraction buffer (lacking Triton). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (30 μl of 100 mm stock) andp-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (30 μl of 10 mm stock) were then added, and the samples were clarified by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Pulse-chase experiments were carried out as described previously (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8.8% acrylamide for pulse-chase samples, 15% for co-immunoprecipitated samples) was also performed as described previously (21Shen F.-S. Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's recommendations prior to fluorography. PhosphorImager analysis was used in some cases (as indicated in the figure legends). All experiments were repeated at least twice and usually three times. For assay of PC2 enzymatic activity, 500,000 cells of each clone were plated per 35-mm well (two independent clones were used per experiment). Two days after plating, the wells were rinsed twice with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of serum-free medium (Opti-MEM; Life Technologies) containing 100 μg/ml aprotinin was placed on the cells for 16 h. The conditioned medium was removed, centrifuged briefly to remove cells and debris, and stored frozen prior to analysis for PC2 enzymatic activity and radioimmunoassay. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, extracted with 0.5 ml of acid extraction solution (0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.0 macetic acid, 20 mm HCl), and the acid solution subjected to protein assay to correct for variations in cell growth. 7B2 radioimmunoassay (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was performed on 50-μl triplicates of the conditioned medium. PC2 enzymatic activity was assayed using 35 μl of conditioned cell culture medium in duplicate for a 4-h incubation period, in the presence and absence of the PC2 inhibitor CT peptide; 200 μm pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-AMC (Peptides International, Lexington, KY) was used as a substrate (10Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It should be noted that varying expression levels cannot account for the differences observed in enzymatic assays of conditioned media, as pulse-labeling experiments indicated roughly comparable expression levels of the various mutant PC2s and wtPC2. Similar to the other members of the kex2-like protease family, pro-PC2 can be divided into four distinct domains. To determine whether a particular domain might confer 7B2 binding, we constructed chimeric and truncated pro-PC2 molecules (as depicted in Fig.1) for stable transfection into AtT-20/21-kDa 7B2 cells. We first examined the role of the PC2 proregion in the binding of 7B2 by a co-immunoprecipitation study using Fur-P:PC2 (in which the PC2 proregion was replaced with the furin proregion) and PC2-P:PC1 (in which the PC1 proregion was replaced with that of PC2) (18Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). AtT-20/PC2/21-kDa 7B2, AtT-20/Fur-P:PC2/21-kDa 7B2, and AtT-20/PC2-P:PC1/21-kDa 7B2 cells were labeled with [35S]Met and -Cys ProMix for 20 min, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated under non-denaturing conditions using antisera LSU18 (for PC2 and Fur-P:PC2) and LSU3 (for PC2-P:PC1) to examine potential co-immunoprecipitation of PC2 domains with 7B2. The results, presented in Fig. 2, showed no 7B2 binding to the chimera containing the furin rather than the PC2 proregion (Fur-P:PC2). It should be noted that both the Fur-P:PC2 and PC2-P:PC1 proteins are not efficiently processed and secreted (18Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and therefore may not represent well folded proteins. However, if folding of these chimeras is assumed, then it can be concluded that the PC2 proregion alone cannot confer ability to co-immunoprecipitate 7B2 since, even after prolonged exposure of the gel to film, no 7B2 bands were visible in co-immunoprecipitations (not shown). The carboxyl-terminal domains are not conserved between the various PCs, suggesting PC-specific roles such as 7B2 binding; however, carboxyl-terminal domains from PC2s of various species do not exhibit remarkable homology, potentially ruling out a role for this domain in binding of 7B2. To investigate the possibility of the involvement of the carboxyl domain with respect to 7B2 binding, we constructed a truncated PC2 mutant, PC2ΔC. In addition, a mutant with both the P and carboxyl-terminal domains deleted (PC2ΔPC) was also created. Both constructs were transfected into AtT-20/21-kDa 7B2 cells. The results, presented in Fig. 3 a, showed that PC2ΔC was still capable of binding 7B2. These data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain is not essential for binding of 7B2. However, there was no mature form of PC2ΔC detectable inside the cell, although it was found in the medium (Fig. 3 b). Interestingly, this truncated form of PC2 was still active (TableI). Further deletion of the P domain (PC2ΔPC) destabilized pro-PC2; this protein may represent an unfolded form which was presumably degraded since it was neither released into the medium nor retained intracellularly (Fig. 3 b).Table IEnzymatic activity of PC2 deletion mutants and chimerasEnzyme activity1-a1 unit = 1 fmol AMC/h/μg cellular protein.Secreted 7B2 immunoreactivity1-bfmol/μg protein, mean ± SD, n = 3.unitswt PC2255.2 ± 0.6PC2ΔC135.7 ± 0.4PC2ΔPCND1-cND, not detectable (<1 unit).3.6 ± 0.2PC2[PC1-C]213.8 ± 0.8PC2[PC1-PC]ND4.4 ± 0.81-a 1 unit = 1 fmol AMC/h/μg cellular protein.1-b fmol/μg protein, mean ± SD, n = 3.1-c ND, not detectable (<1 unit). Open table in a new tab Since the truncated pro-PC2 construct lacking the P domain was not stable, and with the knowledge that the P domains of PC2 and PC1 are relatively well conserved, we exchanged both the PC2 P and carboxyl-terminal domains with those of PC1 (PC2[PC1-P]). Analysis of expression confirmed that the resulting PC2[PC1-P] protein was well expressed in AtT-20/21-kDa 7B2 cells; however, it was unable to bind 7B2 (Fig.4 a). Furthermore, this chimera appeared to remain in the cell for an unusually long time (Fig.4 b); it was neither processed nor released, indicating potential problems in proper folding. We conclude that the PC1 and PC2 P domains are not interchangeable with respect to either folding and/or 7B2 binding. In contrast, the PC2 chimera containing only the PC1 carboxyl-terminal domain (PC2[PC1-C]), but not the PC1 P domain, was capable of binding 7B2 (Fig. 4 a). Interestingly, the mature form of PC2[PC1-C] was found only in the medium but not inside the cell (Fig.4 b). This construct also exhibited enzymatic activity (TableI), indicating successful traverse of the secretory pathway. These results support the lack of importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain in 7B2 binding and further demonstrate that despite proper 7B2 binding, PC2 constructs containing a PC1 carboxyl terminus do not exhibit correct cellular routing. One striking difference between PC2 and all other known PCs is that a catalytically important asparagine residue is replaced by an aspartate (Asp-309). The asparagine, which is involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole (22Robertus J.D. Kraut J. Alden R.A. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4293-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), is conserved in all other members of the subtilisin family except PC2. Seidah and colleagues (23Benjannet S. Lusson J. Savaria D. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have suggested a critical role for this residue in the interaction between PC2 and 7B2. We subjected the AtT-20/PC2-D309N cell line, in which Asp-309 was intentionally mutated to asparagine (18Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), to supertransfection with 21-kDa 7B2. In the new 7B2-expressing cell line, the PC2-D309N protein was well expressed and released (Fig.5). PC2-D309N was still able to bind 7B2, although in three separate experiments 7B2 was bound to a lesser degree than to wild-type PC2 (Fig. 5 a). This mutant form of PC2 was processed more slowly than wild-type PC2 (Fig. 5 b) and was also slightly less active, although it also exhibited lowered 7B2 expression which could account for this decrease in activity (TableII).Table IIEnzymatic activity of residue-switched PC2 mutantsEnzyme activity2-a1 unit = 1 fmol AMC/h/μg cellular protein.Secreted 7B2 immunoreactivity2-bfmol/μg protein, mean ± SD, n = 3.unitswtPC2183.6 ± 0.4PC2-D309N112.6 ± 0.1PC2-(189–194)ND2-cND, not detectable (<1 unit).4.7 ± 0.2PC2-(201–206)1.35.4 ± 0.4PC2-S190DND3.6 ± 1.2PC2-Y194DND4.0 ± 0.22-a 1 unit = 1 fmol AMC/h/μg cellular protein.2-b fmol/μg protein, mean ± SD, n = 3.2-c ND, not detectable (<1 unit). Open table in a new tab Our previous studies have shown that a putative polyproline helix formed by the proline-rich region in 7B2 is involved in the interaction between pro-PC2 and 7B2. It has been suggested that elongated patches of aromatic residues represent likely candidates for binding of the relatively hydrophobic polyproline helix (24Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Goonesekere N.C.

Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A close inspection of the PC2 amino acid sequence revealed that a relatively aromatic residue-rich region lies between residues 186 and 204, a region well conserved among all known PC2s (Fig.8 b). Seven aromatic residues are contained within this stretch of 19 amino acids; only four of these are present in the homologous sequence of PC1 and two within that of furin. To determine whether this region could be involved in 7B2 binding, two PC2 mutants were made in this region, each containing six amino acid stretches replaced with the homologous sequences of PC1. This strategy resulted in the replacement of the three non-conserved aromatic residues of PC2. In the PC2-(189–194) construct, the SSNDPY sequence (residues 189–194) was replaced with the corresponding NDNDHD (residues 190–195) sequence present in PC1; for the PC2-(201–206) construct, the DDWFNS sequence (residues 201–206) was mutated to the LTNENK sequence (residues 202–207) found in PC1. The expression of both PC2-(189–194) and PC2-(201–206) was similar to those of wild-type PC2 (Fig. 6), and both proteins were released into the medium, indicating successful traverse of the secretory pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation results, presented in Fig.6 a, demonstrated that PC2-(189–194) was completely unable to bind to 7B2; furthermore, this mutant exhibited no PC2 activity (Table II). On the other hand, PC2-(201–206) was still capable of binding 7B2 and was enzymatically active, although to a lesser extent than wild-type PC2. The processing of pro-PC2-(201–206) was also impaired compared with that of wild-type pro-PC2 (Fig. 6 b). Unexpectedly, however, even in the absence of 7B2 binding, the proteolytic processing of pro-PC2-(189–194) was more rapid than that of wild-type PC2, as judged from the disappearance of the proform (Fig.6 b).Figure 6The substitution of a six amino acid sequence (amino acids 189–194) of PC2 with corresponding PC1 sequence abolishes PC2–7B2 binding. a, PC2-(189–194) cannot co-immunoprecipitate 7B2. AtT-20/PC2–7B2, AtT-20/PC2-(189–194)-7B2 and AtT-20/PC2-(201–206)-7B2 cells were pulsed for 20 min, followed by co-immunoprecipitation with antiserum LSU18. b, PC2-(189–194) can undergo proregion removal. The data presented in Table II indicate that processed PC2-(189–194) is inactive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A comparison of residues 189–194 of PC2, SSNDPY, with the corresponding PC1 and furin sequences (NDNDHD and NDQDPD, respectively) suggested that the two residues that were most likely to be critical for 7B2 binding were Ser-190 and Tyr-194. Based on this observation, the PC2 point mutants PC2-S190D and PC2-Y194D, which replaced Ser-190 and Tyr-194 with the corresponding PC1 residues Asp-190 and Asp-194, respectively, were made. These two mutants were transfected into AtT-20/21-kDa 7B2 cells. Both constructs were expressed (Fig. 7) and were efficiently released (not shown). The co-immunoprecipitation results revealed that 7B2 still bound to PC2-S190D, whereas no detectable 7B2 co-immunoprecipitated with PC2-Y194D (Fig. 7 a). Both constructs were, however, enzymatically inactive (Table II). It is interesting that binding of 7B2 was unable to facilitate the intracellular processing of pro-PC2-S190D, which remained as the proform, whereas the processing of pro-PC2-Y194D, which was unable to bind to 7B2, was actually more rapid than that of wild-type PC2 (Fig.7 b). In this study we have attempted to define the regions of pro-PC2 important for interaction with its helper protein 7B2. We first investigated the role of each individual domain of PC2 by replacement with the respective PC1 or furin domains. It has been demonstrated that the proregion is required for the proper folding of subtilisin (26Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and appears to be required for other members of this protease family (18Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol.

Our work demonstrated that PKCβI and -βII have different and distinct functions in response to insulin in stable transfectants of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E.

The contribution of PKCβII activity to insulin-stimulated [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake was also examined in rat L6 myotubes, a cell line phenotypically similar to skeletal muscle expressing GLUT4 and GLUT1 type glucose transporters (8Chalfant C.E.

Thus, one alternative splice variant of the PKCβ gene is more effective than the other as a positive transducer for glucose transport responses. The regulation of PKCβ gene expression has not been extensively studied. Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate that expression of these two messages was regulated acutely by insulin (12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V.

In BC3H-1 myocytes, insulin induced alternative splicing of the PKCβ mRNA, thereby switching expression from PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA (12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13326-13332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The switch in mRNA was reflected by increased protein levels of PKCβII (12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13326-13332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of how insulin regulated the post-transcriptional processing of PKCβ pre-mRNA was unclear. There were several options. For example, insulin could affect polyadenylation site selection to define the carboxyl terminus, and, in another case, insulin could affect the inclusion of the PKCβII-specific exon into the mature message since the PKCβII-specific exon includes a translation stop codon. Increased transcription or changes in PKCβII mRNA stability may also affect post-transcriptional processing. In this report, each of these possibilities were considered in L6 skeletal muscle cells, which, unlike the BC3H-1 myocytes, express the GLUT4 type glucose transporter and are a fully differentiating cell model for insulin action. We demonstrate that insulin specifically enhances the inclusion of an exon encoding the last 52 COOH-terminal amino acids of PKCβII. Insulin also activated two 5′ splice sites, a previously known site and a second newly identified 5′ splice site, to include the PKCβII-specific exon, which contains a stop codon, thereby encoding only the PKCβII protein. This is the first report of a hormone affecting the 5′ splice site selection in pre-mRNA. Since our knowledge of alternative splicing is derived primarily from in vitro biochemical approaches, this study expands our understanding of how splicing is regulated in vivo in eukaryotes and demonstrates L6 skeletal muscle cells as a model for hormone-induced alternative splicing. L6 rat skeletal myoblasts (obtained from Dr. Amira Klip, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) were grown in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) to confluence. Myoblasts were fused into myotubes by changing media to α-MEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 2–4 days after confluence. Cells were incubated in α-MEM + 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 6 h and placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% bovine serum albumin just prior to treatment with insulin (200 nm) or IGF-I (Long R3 IGF-I, GroPep) (20 ng/ml). For mRNA stability studies, actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added 5 min prior to addition of insulin or PBS sham control. Total RNA was isolated from L6 myotubes (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar) and 1 μg was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies pre-amplification kit). For quantitative RT-PCR, 5% of the cDNA was amplified in the presence of 10−2 amol of mimic DNA using primers specific for PKCβI, PKCβII, or β-actin and Taq DNA polymerase from Perkin-Elmer. The PKCβII-specific primers correspond to Primer A, a sense primer to the V3 region of PKCβ (5′-ATGAAACTGACCGATTTTAACTTCCTG-3′), and Primer B, an antisense primer corresponding to the V5 region of PKCβII (5′-CGGAGGTCTACAGATCTACTTAGCTCT-3′) (Fig. 1 B). The PKCβI-specific primers were Primer C, a sense primer corresponding to the C3 region (5′-CCGCCTCTACTTTGTGATGGA-3′), and Primer D, an antisense primer corresponding to the V5 region of PKCβI (5′-TGCCTGGTGAACTCTTTGTCG-3′) (Fig. 1 B). Sense and antisense primers for β-actin (CLONTECH) were used to normalize for total RNA. Mimics (competitors) for PKCβI and PKCβII were constructed using the CLONTECH MIMIC construction kit (CLONTECH). The mimic is a neutral piece of DNA containing primer sequences for either PKCβI or PKCβII on its 5′ and 3′ ends. The mimic will specifically compete for primer binding sites with the target PKCβI or PKCβII cDNA. Extension rates of competitor mimics are within 5% of the target cDNA extension rate. Following 30 cycles of amplification in a Biometra Trioblock thermocycler (β-actin and PKCβII: 94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 3 min; PKCβI: 94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 1 min), 20% of the PCR reaction was resolved on a 1% agarose gel. The photograph of the ethidium bromide-stained PCR products was quantified by scanning densitometry. For evaluating PKCβII-specific exon inclusion, Primer E, an upstream sense primer corresponding to the C4 kinase domain common to both PKCβI and -βII (5′-GTTGTGGGCCTGAAGGGGAACG-3′), and Primer D (described above) were used. This RT-PCR assay allows for relative comparison of PKCβII versus PKCβI mRNA levels. For evaluating PKCβII 5′ splice site selection, Primer F, a sense primer corresponding to the PKCβII exon (5′-CACCCGCCATCCACCAGTCCT-3′) and Primer D (described above) were used. This method allows for comparing different PKCβII alternative splice products. To examine potential expression of the polyadenylated form of PKCβII, Primer E (described above) and Primer G, an antisense primer corresponding to intronic sequences upstream from the PKCβII polyadenylation signal and downstream of the PKCβII exon (5′-CGGGAAGGTGGAAGAATGTTGC-3′), were used. Following 35 cycles of a two-step PCR amplification program (95 °C, 30 s; and 68 °C, 2 min) using Taq-Gold DNA polymerase from Perkin-Elmer, 15% of the PCR reactions were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. The gel was then denatured 30 min in a 0.5 m NaOH, 1 m NaCl solution, neutralized 30 min in a 1 m Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl solution, and blotted via capillary transfer to nylon membranes. Membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled PKCβ cDNA probe as described below. For insulin receptor isoform analysis, primers specific for the exons flanking the alternatively spliced exon 11 of the insulin receptor were used to amplify reverse transcribed total RNA. The sequences are (5′-GTCCCCACCTTTTGAGTCTGA-3′) for the sense primer to exon 10 and (5′-AAATGGTCTGTGCTCTTCGTG-3′) for the antisense primer to exon 12. Following 35 cycles of a three-step PCR amplification program (95 °C, 30 s; 64 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 2 min), PCR reactions were resolved and quantitated as described above. L6 myotube cell lysates (40 μg) were subjected to 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk, washed, and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against either the COOH terminus of PKCβII or PKCβI (Santa Cruz Technologies and Dr. Yoshiko Akita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). PKCβII cDNA (25 ng) was labeled with [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using random prime labeling (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeled cDNA was purified from unincorporated nucleotides using G50 Sephadex chromatography (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham) and baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Blots were prehybridized for 1 h in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 50% formamide at 43 °C. Random prime labeled PKCβII cDNA (1 × 106 cpm) was added, and blots were hybridized for 16 h at 43 °C and washed for 15 min at room temperature with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Blots were exposed to an imaging screen and quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. PKCβ promotor (−2200 to +43) constructs were cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid as described previously (15Obeid L.M. Blobe G.C. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20804-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L6 rat skeletal muscle myotubes were grown in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and co-transfected with 3.5 μg of the PKCβ promotor/luciferase construct and 1 μg of SV40 β-galactosidase vector using the calcium phosphate method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate for 16 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in medium (2% fetal bovine serum) for 8 h (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Serum was removed for 6 h prior to insulin (200 nm) treatment. Cells were lysed with 1 × lysis buffer (Promega Corp.) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Corp.). All PCR products were verified by sequencing at the University of South Florida Genome Center. Although insulin regulation of alternative splicing of PKCβII pre-mRNA has been reported previously in BC3H-1 myocytes, the mechanism by which insulin affected splicing was not examined. Since the mechanism is likely to be relevant in insulin action, we used L6 myotubes in this study. These cells represent a model of fully differentiated skeletal muscle myotubes that express GLUT4 type glucose transporters, in contrast to the BC3H-1 myocytes. Using competitive RT-PCR, the expression of PKCβII mature mRNA was examined in response to acute insulin treatment in differentiated L6 myotubes (Fig.1 B). Upon treatment with insulin (200 nm) for 15 min, a 3-fold increase in PKCβII mRNA was observed (Fig. 2). The up-regulation of PKCβII mRNA increased 3.5–4-fold at 1 h after insulin treatment. This extended our earlier findings in BC3H-1 myocytes to L6 myotubes for examining the molecular basis of hormone-induced alternative splicing. To quantify potential changes in PKCβI mRNA levels via competitive RT-PCR, cycling conditions were optimized to efficiently amplify the 684-bp PKCβI PCR product and not other species. Unlike the BC3H-1 myocytes, no change occurred in PKCβI mRNA with acute insulin treatment (Fig. 2). This may reflect the difference between an undifferentiated cell line such as the the BC3H-1 myocytes and a differentiated cell type like the L6 myotubes. This may also suggest that there is a functional role for PKCβI in insulin signal transduction in the L6 myotubes. PKCβI and -βII mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels using competitive RT-PCR (data not shown). To examine whether insulin effects on PKCβI and -βII mRNA were reflected at the protein level, polyclonal antibodies specific for the COOH terminus of either PKCβI or PKCβII proteins were used for detection on Western blots. Insulin treatment increased PKCβII immunoreactive protein levels greater than 3.5-fold (350%), while PKCβI immunoreactive protein levels remained unchanged (Fig.3). The data shown are composites of five separate experiments with each time point examined for an individual effect. Thus, the increase in PKCβII mRNA expression was directly reflected at the protein level between 15 min and 24 h as with the BC3H-1 myocytes. Differences in the amount of basal PKCβII immunoreactive protein between experiments are attributed to variables in cell culture and sensitivity of chemiluminescence detection. The overall increase in PKCβII immunoreactive protein following insulin treatment was consistent. If the alternative splicing that leads to mature PKCβII mRNA is under negative regulation by a limited amount of RNA transactivating factors, a rapid increase in PKCβ pre-mRNA via transcriptional activation may account for increased PKCβII expression. To examine whether the up-regulation of PKCβII mRNA was related to an increase in transcriptional activity, several PKCβ promotor constructs of varying lengths including a (−2200 to +43) construct were examined for insulin responsiveness. The PKCβ promotor (−511 to +43)/luciferase construct was the only construct activated in response to insulin following transient transfection (data not shown). This construct contains an AP2, an E-box, and two Sp1 sites. With this construct, no change in PKCβ promotor/luciferase activity was observed within 30 min and only modest increases were noted after 16 h. Based on these data and the observation that PKCβI mRNA is not increased in response to insulin, the early increase in PKCβII mRNA was not likely due to an increase in transcriptional activity of the PKCβ gene. Treatment with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate to activate the promotor and transfection with a fully active SV40/luciferase construct were used as positive controls to demonstrate promotor activation (15Obeid L.M. Blobe G.C. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20804-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized using a ratio of the co-transfected pSV-β-galactosidase activity. The possibility of post-transcriptional regulation of PKCβII expression at the level of message stability was also evaluated. To demonstrate whether PKCβII mRNA was up-regulated via increases in message stability, insulin effects on PKCβI and PKCβII mRNA levels were determined after treatment with the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, after 1 h of acute insulin treatment. Using competitive RT-PCR, no differences in mRNA levels were detected between control and insulin-treated L6 myotubes (data not shown). This suggests that insulin effects on PKCβII message were not likely due to rapid increases in mRNA stabilization. Also of note is the observation that insulin did not destabilize PKCβI message as in the BC3H-1 myocytes, demonstrating either the lack of a hormone-induced destabilization system or a requirement for PKCβI in insulin-activated metabolic or mitogenic processes in L6 myotubes. Since insulin treatment did not result in transcriptional activation or increased message stability, the possibility that PKCβII expression was regulated primarily at the level of alternative splicing was likely. Early studies by Nishizuka and co-workers (4Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) suggested PKCβII mRNA is encoded via inclusion of the PKCβII exon into the mature mRNA transcript in brain tissue. In B lymphoblastoid cells, however, Hannun and co-workers (16Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that polyadenylation site selection might govern PKCβII splicing. Based on the information available about the arrangement of terminal exons in the PKCβ gene, it was possible that the alternatively spliced PKCβII mRNA resulted from one of these two mechanisms, inclusion of the PKCβII-specific exon or alternative polyadenylation site selection, in L6 myotubes. Regulation of either mechanism by a hormone had not been demonstrated. In the case of polyadenylation site selection, insulin would activate a polyadenylation site located downstream of the PKCβII exon, thereby producing mature PKCβII mRNA. In the case of an exon inclusion mechanism, the PKCβI polyadenylation site would be used, but a stop codon in the PKCβII exon terminates translation and results in a protein with the PKCβII COOH terminus. If the PKCβII exon were skipped, then PKCβI would be encoded. To determine if the increase in PKCβII mRNA was due to regulation of PKCβII polyadenylation site selection, an RT-PCR-based assay was designed. Using primer E, a sense primer to the C4 region, and primer G, an antisense primer to a sequence downstream of the PKCβII exon and near the PKCβII polyadenylation site, only a polyadenylated form of PKCβII mRNA could be amplified. Neither control L6 myotubes nor insulin-treated L6 myotubes expressed a polyadenylated form of PKCβII even after 55 PCR cycles (Fig. 4). Therefore, the increase in PKCβII mRNA in response to insulin was not likely due to regulation of PKCβII polyadenylation site selection. As a positive control, 10−3 amol of a PKCβII cDNA containing the 3′-untranslated region of the polyadenylated form of PKCβII was amplified (obtained from Dr. S. Ohno, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan). Since alternative polyadenylation site selection did not likely account for the effect of insulin on PKCβII expression, the possibility that insulin affected inclusion of the PKCβII-specific exon in L6 myotubes was a likely alternative. An RT-PCR assay that allowed for the simultaneous detection of PKCβII and PKCβI mRNA utilizing primer E, a sense primer to the upstream PKCβ common exon (C4 kinase domain), and primer D, an antisense downstream primer specific for PKCβI (V5 domain) was designed (Fig.5, A and B). In response to acute insulin treatment, PKCβII message (374-bp PCR product) increased to levels that exceeded PKCβI message (153-bp PCR product) (Fig. 6). The amount of mature PKCβII mRNA increased from 15% exon-included message to 60% by 15 min to a maximum of 80% exon-included message at 30 min after treatment with insulin. This demonstrated that insulin rapidly enhanced inclusion of the PKCβII-specific exon.Figure 6The effects of insulin on PKCβII exon inclusion into mature mRNA. L6 myotubes treated with PBS (sham control) or insulin (200 nm) for 15 min were analyzed by RT-PCR using primer E, a sense primer to the C4 region common to both PKCβI and -βII, and primer D, an antisense primer specific for the PKCβI V5 exon (depicted in Fig. 5, A and B) (see “Materials and Methods” for primer sequences). Prior to assay, the cells were removed from serum for 6 h. C indicates control, I indicates insulin, and + indicates PKCβI positive control (PKCβI cDNA). Arrows indicate PKCβI or PKCβII mature mRNA. Data are representative of three separate determinations from an experiment reproduced on three occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An additional, longer PCR product was also observed following exon inclusion analysis, which did not correspond to the anticipated PKCβII amplification product (Figs. 6) (4Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The new fragment hybridized with a labeled PKCβ cDNA probe upon Southern blot analysis suggesting that the amplified fragment was not artifactual. Sequence analysis revealed it was a new splice variant of PKCβII, which included approximately 136 nucleotides of additional extended 3′-untranslated sequence (Fig. 5 C). After comparing this sequence to the published sequence of the PKCβII exon and surrounding intronic sequences, the activation of a second 5′ splice site, CAG/GTGGCAT, was demonstrated (Fig.7 A) (4Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Insulin action culminated in the activation of both 5′ splice sites that resulted in exon inclusion (Fig. 7, A and B). To further investigate the effects of insulin on exon inclusion and the activation of the two 5′ splice sites, we amplified the region between the PKCβII exon and the PKCβI terminal exon (Fig. 5, A and C). This RT-PCR-based assay examines specifically exon-included PKCβII mRNA and therefore increases our detection sensitivity for PKCβII message. We found that insulin activated the second downstream 5′ splice site in a time-dependent manner. After a 20 min insulin treatment, activation of the second splice site was detected by RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis. By 30 min after insulin treatment, the second splice site was preferentially activated since the longer transcript “exceeded” transcripts using the conventional 5′ splice site by a ratio of 2 to 1 (Fig. 8). Acute IGF-I treatment also activated the second 5′ splice site at 30 min, demonstrating that other related peptide hormones have the capability of affecting PKCβII exon inclusion and 5′ splice site selection in L6 myotubes (Fig. 8). This is the first report of a hormone affecting 5′ splice site selection and the first report of IGF-I affecting alternative splicing. The effect of insulin on alternative splicing of the insulin receptor was also reported in FAO cells, but the mechanism was neither specified nor elucidated. To examine if the effects of insulin on exon inclusion reflect a more general effect on splicing, the potential regulation of insulin receptor exon 11 inclusion was examined in L6 myotubes. Primers that amplified from exon 10 to exon 12 of the insulin receptor gene were used to observe the inclusion of the insulin receptor exon 11 (17Sell S. Reese D. Ossowski V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30769-30772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In control and insulin-treated L6 myotubes, both type A (exon 11 excluded) and type B (exon 11 included) insulin receptor mRNA were detected with type B receptor mRNA predominating (85%). As shown in Fig.9, insulin, however, had no affect on the ratio of type A to type B insulin receptor mRNA after 30 min. These results suggest that insulin's effects on exon inclusion are probably not a general phenomenon, but specifically targeted to certain pre-mRNAs. Our earlier studies in the BC3H-1 myocytes demonstrated that PKCβII expression was regulated by insulin (12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13326-13332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). L6 myotubes were used to determine the mechanism responsible for insulin effects on PKCβII expression. The BC3H-1 myocytes used in previous studies were a non-fusing cell line and only expressed GLUT1 transporters. A fully differentiated cell line such as the L6 cell line that more closely resembles skeletal muscle expressing both GLUT4 and GLUT1 type glucose transporters provides a more physiologically relevant model for studying splicing (18Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Mladen V. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine PKCβI and PKCβII mRNA levels, a highly sensitive method to quantitate mRNA levels by RT-PCR was developed. In L6 myotubes, as in the BC3H-1 myocytes, mature PKCβII mRNA and protein increased more than 3.5-fold following acute insulin treatment. Levels of PKCβI mature mRNA and immunoreactive protein remained unchanged following insulin treatment. Prior studies in the BC3H-1 myocytes showed that PKCβI mRNA and protein levels decreased in response to insulin. This was due to destabilization of PKCβI mRNA in response to insulin. The different observations between the two cell types may be explained in two ways. The lack of a insulin-induced destabilization system in the L6 myotubes or a role for PKCβI in insulin action in the L6 myotubes. Other findings from our laboratory suggest a role for PKCβI in insulin action. We found that overexpression of PKCβI in L6 myotubes overcomes the inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (19Chalfant C.E. Watson J.E. Cooper D.R. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 243APubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCβI in L6 myotubes also increases insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activation. 2D. R. Cooper, J. E. Watson, and C. E. Chalfant, unpublished observations. These data suggest that PKCβI as well as PKCβII have distinct roles in the metabolic effects of insulin. However, the mechanism by which insulin affected PKCβ pre-mRNA splicing had not been elucidated, and whether PKCβ pre-mRNA preferentially processed to PKCβI or PKCβII mature mRNA was not known. It also remained to be elucidated whether PKCβ pre-mRNA splicing was positively or negatively regulated by insulin and whether RNA transactivating factors were involved. Transactivating factors are known to be involved in regulating post-transcriptional as well as transcriptional events (20Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism to preferentially increase PKCβII mRNA expression could be through increased transcriptional activation in response to insulin. In this case, the RNA splicing of PKCβ pre-mRNA to mature PKCβII mRNA may be negatively regulated in the basal state. For example, in the absence of insulin RNA transactivating factors may inhibit the inclusion of the PKCβII-specific exon or recognition of the PKCβII polyadenylation site, thereby leading to the production of mature PKCβI mRNA. A rapid increase in the transcription of the PKCβ gene in response to insulin may increase the levels of PKCβ pre-mRNA. If the inhibitory RNA transactivating factors are limiting, the newly transcribed PKCβ pre-mRNA would be processed to mature PKCβII mRNA. The PKCβ message occurs at relatively low levels. Therefore, to investigate the possibility of a transcriptional mechanism of regulation, we initially evaluated the effect of insulin on several PKCβ promotor/luciferase constructs spanning −2200 to +43 bp (15Obeid L.M. Blobe G.C. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20804-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only a −511/+43 PKCβ promotor construct was activated by insulin. All other constructs, including a −2200 to +43 bp construct, exhibited no response to insulin. Insulin stimulation of the −511/+43 bp PKCβ promotor construct occurred, however, at later times (16 h), and induction was minimal. Hence, the increase in PKCβII mRNA was not likely accounted for at the level of transcriptional activation, although one could argue that the promotor constructs used required an upstream enhancer element to respond to insulin. An increase in PKCβII mRNA stability could also increase PKCβII mRNA levels in response to insulin. To determine if increases in PKCβII mRNA were due to increased mRNA stability, relative decay rates of PKCβI and PKCβII mRNA were measured following actinomycin D treatment. Relative decay rates did not change within 1 h of insulin treatment, and the increase in PKCβII mRNA levels were not likely justified by increased PKCβII mRNA stability. Mature PKCβII mRNA could also result from alternative exon selection or alternative polyadenylation site selection (4Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13326-13332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of either nuclear mechanism by an external cell receptor signaling cascade had not been reported. In the L6 myotubes, we found that PKCβII mRNA was produced via inclusion of an exon that encodes a stop codon defining the V5 region of PKCβII in response to insulin treatment. This mechanism produces a message with the PKCβI exon including a polyadenylation site spliced onto the 3′ end of the PKCβII exon (Fig. 7 B). Insulin regulation of PKCβII exon inclusion changed the ratio of PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA following insulin treatment. The levels of newly processed PKCβII mRNA exceeded the synthesis of PKCβI mRNA, demonstrating that insulin enhanced PKCβII exon inclusion into the mature mRNA transcript. The molecular mechanism through which insulin affects PKCβII exon inclusion has not been addressed. Our findings suggest that alterations in splicing factors associated with the PKCβII exon may be occurring. Several RNA cis-elements that are known to affect exon inclusion and splice site selection were presently identified in the PKCβII exon and its surrounding intronic sequences. They include a binding site for phosphorylated SRp40, several purine-rich exon splicing enhancers, and multiple pyrimidine tracts (Fig.7 A).2 Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and pyrimidine tract-binding protein are known RNA transactivating factors that bind to these cis-elements and affect exon inclusion and 5′ splice selection (21Fu X.-D. Nature. 1993; 365: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Since SR proteins can be regulated via phosphorylation by SR protein kinases (22Gui J.F. Lane W.F. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 23Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), it is possible that insulin may activate a protein kinase that modulates SR protein phosphorylation and their RNA binding properties thereby affecting exon inclusion. An even more novel mechanism of insulin regulation of PKCβ pre-mRNA splicing was the observation that insulin activated a second 5′ splice site downstream of the previously reported 5′ splice site for the PKCβII exon. This additional downstream 5′ splice site was preferentially activated compared with the conventional 5′ splice site by 30 min after insulin treatment. This second splice variant for PKCβII extended the 3′-untranslated region by approximately 136 nucleotides. The observation that insulin activated two 5′ splice sites for PKCβII exon inclusion is intriguing. The time-dependent manner in which the downstream 5′ splice site is activated following insulin treatment suggests that the additional untranslated region serves a functional purpose. This novel mechanism may introduce features into the newly spliced PKCβII mRNA that further regulate translation, long term stability, or nuclear export of mature mRNA. Extending this observation, we found that IGF-I also stimulated splicing via exon inclusion and activated the second 5′ splice site. This is the first report of IGF-I affecting the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA and suggests that both peptides stimulate similar signaling pathways culminating in nuclear post-transcriptional processing of mRNA. Insulin effects on exon inclusion appear to have some specificity, since it did not further alter the inclusion of exon 11 into insulin receptor mRNA, another gene whose pre-mRNA splicing has been demonstrated to be affected rapidly by insulin (17Sell S. Reese D. Ossowski V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30769-30772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This, therefore, argues against widespread activation of RNA trans-activating factors and nonspecific insulin effects on splicing. These data also suggest a different insulin signaling pathway or RNA processing mechanism for regulation of PKCβ pre-mRNA splicing compared with insulin receptor mRNA splicing. PKCβ is activated and translocated by insulin in L6 myotubes, and we have previously reported that PKCβII is associated with enhanced insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, thus suggesting a physiological significance for increasing PKCβII expression (8Chalfant C.E. Ohno S. Konno Y. Fisher A.A. Watson J.E. Cooper D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16662-16667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible link of PKCβII to insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake could be hypothesized by the fact that PKCβII specifically encodes an F-actin binding site in its V5 region that PKCβI does not encode. PKCβII specifically binds and is activated by F-actin (25Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton undergoes rapid rearrangement in response to acute insulin treatment in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner (26Haruta T. Morris A.J. Rose D.W. Nelson J.G. Mueckler M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Disassembly of the actin network with cytochalasin D inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in L6 muscle cells (27Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PKCβII may function in the process of insulin-stimulated actin rearrangement leading to activation or translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane in L6 myotubes. In conclusion, PKCβII expression is increased through enhanced exon inclusion and additional 5′ splice site activation, which introduces a new COOH-terminal exon containing a stop codon that defines the V5 region of PKCβII. This is the first report of insulin altering nuclear mRNA processing through 5′ splice site regulation. Insulin regulation of post-transcriptional splicing events demonstrates a novel mechanism for hormonal responses to rapidly alter gene expression. We thank Dr. Harald Mischak for providing the design of the PKCβII primers used in the competitive RT-PCR assay and Dr. Yoshiko Akita for the gracious gift of the PKCβI- and PKCβII-specific antibodies."

We have cloned and characterized a novel cDNA that encodes a Caenorhabditis elegans aPKC (PKC3) composed of 597 amino acids.

In contrast,C. elegans PKC3 accumulates in non-dividing, terminally differentiated cells that will not undergo apoptosis. Thus, aPKCs may control cell functions that are independent of cell cycle progression and programmed cell death. PKC3 is also expressed during embryogenesis. Ablation of PKC3 function by microinjection of antisense RNA into oocytes yields disorganized, developmentally arrested embryos. Thus, PKC3 is essential for viability. PKC3 is enriched in particulate fractions of disrupted embryos and larvae. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that PKC3 accumulates near cortical actin cytoskeleton/plasma membrane at the apical surface of intestinal cells and in embryonic cells.

Thus, aPKCs may control cell functions that are independent of cell cycle progression and programmed cell death. PKC3 is also expressed during embryogenesis. Ablation of PKC3 function by microinjection of antisense RNA into oocytes yields disorganized, developmentally arrested embryos. Thus, PKC3 is essential for viability. PKC3 is enriched in particulate fractions of disrupted embryos and larvae. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that PKC3 accumulates near cortical actin cytoskeleton/plasma membrane at the apical surface of intestinal cells and in embryonic cells. A candidate anchoring/targeting protein, which binds PKC3 in vitro, has been identified.

Distinct genes encode mammalian atypical PKCs (aPKCs), but the proteins are similar in size (M r ∼68,000) and amino acid sequence (72% identity) (3Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarishi K.

In contrast to the classical (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, and θ) PKCs (cPKCs and nPKCs, respectively), the ζ and λ/ι isoforms lack binding/regulatory sites for diacylglycerol (DAG), phorbol esters, and Ca2+ (3Ono Y.

However, knowledge of biochemical pathways by which PKCs ζ and λ/ι control aspects of cell physiology is limited. Activation of platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases in cells that overexpress aPKCs promotes autophosphorylation of atypical kinases (on Thr/Ser) and transcription of an AP-1-controlled reporter gene (10Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osado S. Mizuno K. Hirai L. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Both effects depend upon activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activated PKCs ζ and λ/ι apparently promote mitogenic signaling via the Ras-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway through interactions downstream from Ras and upstream from MEK (7Berra E.

The precise mechanism(s) and number of steps that couple phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis with aPKC activation and mitogenesis are unknown. Tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 stimulate sphingomyelinase-catalyzed synthesis of ceramide (15Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Ceramide activates PKCζ in vitro and apparently promotes phosphorylation of IκB by sequential activation of PKCζ and an uncharacterized, 50-kDa protein kinase in cells (11Lozano J. Berra E.

Pfinzenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB dissociates from its' cytoplasmic ligand NFκB and is rapidly proteolyzed. NFκB then translocates to the nucleus and stimulates gene transcription (16Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). However, the ability of PKCζ (and the 50-kDa effector kinase) to regulate activity of NFκB or the cytokine mediator p85 IκB kinase (17DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) in a normal physiological context remains to be established. An 80-kDa protein named LIP binds PKCλ/ι in vitro and in serum-stimulated Cos cells that overexpress both LIP and PKCλ/ι (18Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC λ/ι·LIP complex formation correlates with increased kinase activity and NFκB-stimulated transcription of a reporter gene. Both aPKCs are inhibited by a 35-kDa protein named Par-4, which accumulates during apoptosis (13Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J.

Conclusions regarding functions and regulation of aPKCs are derived principally from studies on overexpressed wild-type and mutant PKC λ/ι and ζ transgenes in immortalized or transformed cells that also overexpress receptor tyrosine kinases, protein modulators (Par-4, LIP), constitutively activated or inhibited Ras or MEK, etc. (7Berra E.

High level co-expression of regulatory proteins in transfected cells enables characterization of ordered interactions among members of a signaling cascade. However, such experiments provide no information on whether observed interactions are of major or minor importance in normal cells that contain low levels of endogenous signaling molecules. There are also major gaps in our basic knowledge of (a) patterns and levels of aPKC gene expression, (b) the nature and quantitative significance of upstream regulators of aPKC catalytic activity, (c) intracellular anchoring/targeting of aPKCs, and (d) the number and identity of downstream substrate/effector proteins controlled by aPKCs in specific cells in intact organisms. Furthermore, aPKC expression, activity, location, and functions may be regulated during and after cell differentiation and tissue development. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a system for investigating properties and functions of aPKCs in intact cellsin vivo. Adult C. elegans are composed of 959 somatic cells that are organized into tissues that constitute digestive, reproductive, muscular, hypodermal, and nervous systems (20Sulston J. Wood W.B.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) permits detection of specific proteins in individual cells of intact C. elegans at all stages of development. We have characterized a cDNA that encodes a novel Ca2+, DAG-independent C. elegans PKC (PKC3). PKC3 is partially homologous with mammalian aPKCs, and its catalytic properties provide a functional basis for its assignment to the atypical subclass of PKCs. A 647-bp promoter/enhancer that precedes the pkc-3 gene governs expression of PKC3 mRNA and protein in cells that are involved in feeding, digestion, excretion, and reproduction. A high proportion of PKC3 is anchored/targeted in the vicinity of cortical actin cytoskeleton at all stages of development. A candidate PKC3 anchoring protein has been identified. Antisense RNA-mediated depletion of PKC3 disrupted embryogenesis and compromised the viability ofC. elegans. Accumulation of PKC3 in terminally differentiated muscle and epithelial cells indicates that the kinase can regulate functions that are independent of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Three oligonucleotides (5′-CTCAATAGACTCACAAATGGAACTTGATGAAGCAGTTCGATG-3′, 5′GAATATGGATTCAGTGTTGATTGGTGGGCATTGGGAGTGTTAATG-3′, and 5′-TTTGAATACGTGAATCCTCTACAAATGAGTCGGGAAGATTCAGTC-3′), whose sequences correspond to portions of C. elegans expressed sequence tags (GenBank) that are homologous with human PKCζ (31Barbee J.L. Loomis C.R. Deutscher S.L. Burns D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), were synthesized and end-labeled with 32P as described in Hu and Rubin (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides (107 cpm/ml) were used to screen 450,000 plaques from a C. eleganscDNA library in bacteriophage λZAPII (Stratagene). Nitrocellulose filter lifts were hybridized and washed as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive plaques were purified to homogeneity, and recombinant pBluescript SK phagemids that contain hybridizing cDNA inserts were excised from the phage in Escherichia coli (33Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and purified. Two positive cDNA clones were isolated. The larger cDNA (2.4 kbp) contains the complete coding sequence and 3′-untranslated region for PKC3 mRNA; the sequence of the smaller cDNA (1 kbp) is identical with a segment of the larger insert. cDNA inserts were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure of Sanger et al.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountainview, CA) and BLAST programs (35Pearson W.R.

C. elegans genomic DNA was isolated by using a QIAamp Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fragments of DNA were generated by digestion with restriction endonucleases, fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a Nytran membrane as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Southern blot was probed with 32P-labeled PKC3 cDNA (2 × 106 cpm/ml) that was prepared as reported previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 2.4-kbp PKC3 cDNA insert (see Fig. 1, below), which was released from pBluescript SK by cleaving with PstI and XhoI, served as a template for synthesis of the radiolabeled probe. Conditions for hybridization, as well as high and low stringency washing of the membrane, and autoradiography are given in Hu and Rubin (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

The derived amino acid sequence is presented below the corresponding codons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A segment of cDNA encoding amino acid residues 477–597 of PKC3 (see Fig. 1) was synthesized via polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ primer contained an NdeI restriction site followed by nucleotides 1429–1451 of PKC3 cDNA (Fig. 1); the 3′ primer consisted of the inverse complement of nucleotides 1770–1794 in PKC3 cDNA preceded by a BglII restriction site. The cDNA fragment was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Product DNA was digested with NdeI andBglII and cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-14b (Novagen) that was cleaved with NdeI andBamHI. The cDNA insert is preceded by vector DNA that encodes a 20-residue N-terminal peptide. The N-terminal fusion peptide includes six consecutive His residues, which constitute a Ni2+-binding site. Transcription of the fusion gene is driven by the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase. E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with recombinant expression plasmid was grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (37Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described in previous studies (37Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC3 fusion protein, which was recovered in the pellet fraction, was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 8 m urea, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine HCl. Fusion protein was purified to near-homogeneity by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography (in the presence of 8 m urea) as described previously (38Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The purified partial PKC3 protein remained soluble when urea was removed by dialysis against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS). Approximately 2.5 mg of highly purified PKC3 fusion protein was isolated from a 1-liter culture of E. coli. Samples of the PKC3 fusion protein were injected into rabbits (0.4-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of five booster injections) at Covance Laboratories (Vienna, VA) at 3-week intervals. Antiserum was collected at 3-week intervals after the first injection. Purified PKC3 fusion protein was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (39Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield a final concentration of 1.5 mg of protein bound per ml of resin. Serum (2 ml) was incubated with 2 ml of PKC3 fusion protein-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 20 °C. Next, resin containing anti-PKC3 IgGs was packed into a column and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl until the flow-through reached an A 280 of 0. The column was successively eluted with 5 ml of 0.5% acetic acid, pH 2.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 ml of 0.1 m diethylamine, pH 11.8, to release IgGs. Sufficient 1 m Na2HPO4 or 0.5 m Hepes was added to column fractions to adjust the pH to ∼7.5. IgG concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm. IgGs were dialyzed against PBS containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos, prepared by the method of Sulston and Hodgkin (40Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 603-605Google Scholar), were hatched in the absence of nutrients. Hatched nematodes were transferred to plates containing Azotobacter vinelandii as a food source, whereupon the animals develop synchronously (41Wood W.B. Hecht R. Carr S. Vanderslice R. Wolf N. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1980; 74: 446-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). L1 larvae were harvested 6 h after feeding, L2 larvae at 20 h, L3 larvae at 29 h, L4 larvae at 40 h, young adult C. elegans at 52 h, and egg-laying adult animals were collected at 78 h. Pelleted C. elegans were suspended in an equal volume of 0.1 m NaCl and frozen at −196 °C. FrozenC. elegans were pulverized in a mortar cooled with liquid N2, and the resulting powder was stored at −75 °C. Cytosolic and particulate fractions of C. elegans and hamster AV-12 cell homogenates were isolated as described previously (32Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (39Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Phosphorylase (M r = 97,000), transferrin (77,000), albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), and carbonic anhydrase (29,000) were used as standards for estimation ofM r values. Western blots of proteins from C. elegans and AV-12 cells were prepared, incubated with anti-PKC3 IgGs (1:2000, relative to serum), and washed as previously reported (43Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (43Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-embryonic C. elegans were fixed, washed, incubated sequentially with affinity purified anti-PKC3 IgGs (1:100, relative to serum) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged goat IgGs directed against rabbit immunoglobulins as described previously (37Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was visualized by serially incubating the specimens with a mouse monoclonal IgG (1:100 dilution) (clone C4, ICN Inc.) directed against actin and rhodamine-coupled sheep antibodies directed against mouse IgGs (Amersham Corp.). Embryos were fixed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 4% paraformadehyde for 10 min. This step was repeated once. After two rinses with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, embryos were immersed in methanol at −20 °C overnight. Next, embryos were rehydrated in 10% incremental steps using TTBS (0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% albumin, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5) as the diluent. Samples were then incubated with affinity purified PKC3 antibodies (1:100, relative to serum) for 2 h at 20 °C. After 3 washes with TTBS, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Secondary antibody was preabsorbed with fixed embryos that did not receive anti-PKC3 antibody. Following three washes with TTBS and a final rinse with PBS, embryos were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 10 μg/ml RNase. After three additional washes with PBS, stained embryos (3 μl) were mixed with 3 μl of 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 30 μmpropidium iodide, 2% n-propylgallate, and 70% glycerol and were mounted on a 2% agarose pad. Fluorescence signals corresponding to PKC3-IgG complexes were obtained and recorded with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope system (Image Analysis Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) as described previously (37Land M.

https://openalex.org/W2166593574,"TFIIH is a high molecular weight complex with a remarkable dual function in nucleotide excision repair and initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription. Mutations in the largest subunits, the XPB and XPD helicases, are associated with three inherited disorders: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy. To facilitate the purification and biochemical characterization of this intricate complex, we generated a cell line stably expressing tagged XPB, allowing the immunopurification of the XPB protein and associated factors. Addition of two tags, a N-terminal hexameric histidine stretch and a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope, to this highly conserved protein did not interfere with its functioning in repair and transcription. The hemagglutinin epitope allowed efficient TFIIH immunopurification to homogeneity from a fractionated whole cell extract in essentially one step. We conclude that the predominant active form of TFIIH is composed of nine subunits and that there is one molecule of XPB per TFIIH complex. The affinity-purified complex exhibits all expected TFIIH activities: DNA-dependent ATPase, helicase, C-terminal domain kinase, and participation inin vitro and in vivo nucleotide excision repair and in vitro transcription. The affinity purification procedure described here is fast and simple, does not require extensive chromatographic procedures, and yields highly purified, active TFIIH.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar, 2Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The principal steps in the reaction mechanism of NER are recognition and demarcation of the lesion, probably involving chromatin remodelling and local helix opening, incision of the DNA on both sides of the lesion at some distance, removal of the damaged oligonucleotide, and, finally, repair DNA synthesis and ligation. In eukaryotes, this reaction requires about 30 polypeptides and has been reconstituted with purified components, including XPA, XPC/HHR23B, replication protein A, the structure-specific nucleases ERCC1/XPF and XPG, and the multisubunit basal transcription factor TFIIH (3Aboussekhra A.

One of these, transcription-coupled repair, preferentially removes DNA damage from the transcribed strand of active genes, whereas lesions in the rest of the genome are repaired more slowly and less efficiently by the global genome repair pathway. TFIIH appears to be a core component of both excision subpathways. Mutations in the two largest subunits of TFIIH, the XPB and XPD helicases, are associated with the rare genetically heterogeneous disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne's syndrome (CS), and trichothiodystrophy (TTD) (6Bootsma D. Cleaver J.E. Kraemer K.H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.

Many complementation groups and considerable overlap have been established for these syndromes: seven complementation groups in XP (XP-A–XP-G), three of which include patients with combined XP and CS phenotypes (XP-B, XP-D and XP-G), two in the classical form of CS (CS-A and CS-B), and three in TTD (XP-B, XP-D, and TTD-A). The discovery of the dual function of XPB and XPD in both NER and transcription provides a rationale for the complex clinical features that are specifically associated with inherited defects in TFIIH subunits, such as seen in the combined XP/CS and the photosensitive form of TTD, that were difficult to explain solely on the basis of a NER defect. Thus, it was proposed that typical XP characteristics, such as UV-induced cutaneous abnormalities and predisposition to skin cancer, are due to inactivation of the NER function of TFIIH, whereas features typical for CS and/or TTD, such as neurodysmyelination, brittle hair, and growth defects, are due to a deficiency in the transcription function of TFIIH, possibly affecting only a subset of genes (8Vermeulen W. van Vuuren A.J. Chipoulet M. Schaeffer L. Appeldoorn E. Weeda G. Jaspers N.G.J. Priestley A. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Stefanini M. Mezzina M. Sarasin A. Bootsma D. Egly J.-M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition to XPB and XPD, which exhibit DNA-dependent ATPase activities and are 3′-5′ and 5′-3′ DNA helicases, respectively (9Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 10Schaeffer L. Moncollin V. Roy R. Staub A. Mezzina M. Sarasin A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), seven more TFIIH subunits have been identified to date. CDK7 was identified as the catalytic subunit of the kinase activity of TFIIH that is able to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (11Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.-P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CDK7 also constitutes a separate trimeric kinase complex that is possibly involved in cell cycle regulation together with the cyclin H and MAT1 subunits of TFIIH (12Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p44, the human homologue of yeast SSL1, and p34 contain zinc finger domains and possess putative DNA binding capacity (14Humbert S. van Vuuren A.J. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). So far, no activity has been detected for the p62 and p52 subunits (15Fischer L. Gerard M. Chalut C. Lutz Y. Humbert S. Kanno M. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1992; 257: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Molina Gomez D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether these nine proteins constitute the TFIIH complex and whether the composition of TFIIH differs during NER and transcription initiation are yet unresolved issues. The presence of two DNA helicases has implicated TFIIH in a helix-opening step during both transcription initiation and NER. It has been shown that such open-complex formation at the transcription start site depends on TFIIH and that the requirement for TFIIH is dependent on promoter topology and can be alleviated by premelted regions at the transcription start site (17Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 18Holstege F.C.P. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M.

During NER, TFIIH is thought to convert a recognized damaged site into a substrate for the XPG and XPF/ERCC1 structure-specific nucleases by locally opening DNA around a lesion. The formation of an opened DNA conformation around a recognized lesion has been demonstrated; however, the direct involvement of TFIIH in this step has not been shown (20Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Answers to these questions are hampered by the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of highly purified TFIIH. Therefore, we developed a procedure that facilitates the isolation of TFIIH using a human cell line expressing functional XPB provided with two tags. The affinity purification procedure described here is fast and simple, does not require extensive chromatographic procedures, and yields highly purified, active TFIIH. Purification of nucleic acids, restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids and proteins, immunoblotting, detection of proteins and nucleic acids were performed according to standard procedures (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1994Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the C-terminal HA epitope tag was added via PCR using oligonucleotide primer pairs p90 5′-CCCGGATCCTCAGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATTTCCTAAAGCGCTTGAAG-3′ (3′ primer; underlined sequence encodes the HA epitope, and double underlined sequence indicates a BamHI restriction site) and p33 5′-GGATCCACCATGGGCAAAAGAGACCG-3′ (5′ primer). Likewise, the hexahistidine tag was added using oligonucleotides p123 5′-CGCGCGGAATTCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCACAGCAGCGGCCTGGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCCATATGGGCAAAAGAGACCG-3′ (5′ primer; underlined sequence encodes a hexahistidine stretch and thrombin cleavage site, and double underlined sequence indicates anEcoRI site) and p41 5′-CGGGAAGTGGAGGGCCCACC-3′ (3′ primer). PCR fragments were cloned, sequenced, and confirmed to be free of PCR-introduced sequence errors. Full-length XPB and double-tagged XPB cDNA (dtXPB cDNA) were subcloned as EcoRI-BamHI fragments in a modified pSG5 eukaryotic expression vector yielding plasmids pSHE3 and pSHE3HA, respectively. From pSHE3HA, the dtXPB cDNA was subcloned as a EcoRI-XhoI fragment in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) yielding plasmid pM300. Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HeLa TK− cells were transfected with vector pM300 by electroporation, and after selection with 1.0 mg/ml G418, individual clones were selected for expression of dtXPB by immunoblot analysis using anti-XPB antibodies. Cell lines XP-wt and XP-t3 were generated by transfection of XPCS2BASV (XP-B) SV40-immortalized fibroblasts with XPB anddtXPB cDNA, respectively. Expression vector pSHE3 or pSHE3HA and a neomycin-selectable marker, were cotransfected using Lipofectin reagent essentially as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably expressing mass populations were obtained by selection with 300 μg/ml G418 and repeated UV irradiation at 1 day intervals (three doses of 4 J/m2). UV survival was assayed by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation 3 days after irradiation as described (22Sijbers A.M. Van der Spek P.J. Odijk H. Van den Berg J. Van Duin M. Westerveld A. Jaspers N.G.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proliferating cells were pulse-labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine (3 h) and then chased (1 h). Cell lysates were transferred to scintillation-counting vials, and survival was calculated as the average ratio of incorporated radiolabel in treated triplicates to that in four untreated control dishes. XP-t3 cells were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) (total, 530 mg) were prepared from frozen cell pellets (total, 50 ml packed cell volume) as described (23Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Subsequently, WCEs were fractionated on heparin-Ultrogel (IBF, France) equilibrated in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 17% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2) containing 0.1 m KCl and eluted with Buffer A containing 0.22, 0.4, and 1.0 m KCl as described (24Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.-M. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the dtXPB protein was present in the 0.4 m KCl fraction (designated Hep0.4; 175 mg of protein) as judged by immunoblot analysis similar to TFIIH. Typically, 10–12 ml (7.5–9.0 mg of protein) of the Hep0.4 fraction was successively incubated with 400 μg of purified 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody bound to 400 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 17% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.4 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with buffer T/0.1 m KCl containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Bound material was eluted for 1 h at 30 °C in 400 μl of buffer T/0.1 m KCl containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mg/ml insulin, 2.0 mg/ml synthetic peptide corresponding to the HA epitope (sequence YPYDVPDYA), and 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin. This step was repeated once or twice. Routinely, nearly all dtXPB and associated factors were present in the first eluate as detected by immunoblotting. Purified proteins were stored at −80 °C. The same procedure was used for immunoprecipitation of dtXPB directly from a WCE (15 mg) to analyze protein-protein interactions. However, in this case, bound material was washed five times with buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and analyzed by immunoblotting after overnight elution at 4 °C with buffer containing 1.0 mg/ml peptide and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Prior to microinjection, human primary fibroblasts were fused by inactivated Sendai virus as described earlier (8Vermeulen W. van Vuuren A.J. Chipoulet M. Schaeffer L. Appeldoorn E. Weeda G.

Biol. 1994; 59: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were microinjected into the cytoplasm of XP polykaryons, and NER activity was measured by pulse labeling with [methyl-3H]thymidine and in situautoradiography as described (8Vermeulen W. van Vuuren A.J.

Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Repair activity was quantified by counting autoradiographic grains above at least 50 non-S phase nuclei. Primary cell lines used were XPCS1BA (XP-B), XP6BE (XP-D), XP126LO (XP-F), XP3BR (XP-G), TTD1BR (TTD-A), and C5RO (wild type). WCEs were prepared from repair-proficient HeLa and XP-t3 cells and repair-deficient SV40-immortalized XPCS2BASV (XP-B) cells (23Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NER reactions (50 μl) contained 250 ng of plasmid DNA randomly damaged withN-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and as an internal control an equal amount of undamaged control plasmid of a different size, the indicated amount of extract, and purified proteins; the reactions were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. DNA was purified, linearized withBamHI, and analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel (25van Vuuren A.J. Vermeulen W. Ma L. Weeda G. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G.J. van der Eb A.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Antibody depletion of extracts was performed as follows: for each reaction, 100 μg of WCE was incubated with 0.5 μl of anti-p62 ascites and 5 μl of protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6 A, plasmid DNA was randomly damaged with cis-diaminedichloro-platinum(II) (16Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Molina Gomez D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Purified TFIIH was incubated with recombinant human TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIE and purified TFIIA, TFIIF, and RNA polymerase II as described earlier (24Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.-M. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 15 min of preincubation at 25 °C with 70 ng of linearized template DNA containing the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, nucleotides were added, and transcription was allowed to proceed in a final reaction volume of 25 μl for 45 min at 25 °C. The 309-nucleotide runoff transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 5% acrylamide/50% urea gel. ATPase reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 ng of DNA and were performed essentially as described before (27Roy R. Schaeffer L. Humbert S. Vermeulen W. Weeda G. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9826-9832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 25-μl reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 25 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA). Of each reaction, 1 μl was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using polyethylenimine-cellulose plates (Merck) run in 0.75 mKH2PO4. CTD kinase assays (20 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 30 mm KCl were performed with 10 μg of a synthetic tetrapeptide of YSPTSPS as a substrate as detailed before (27Roy R.

Lane D. Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). To analyze interactions of the XPB protein with other proteins, including TFIIH under physiological conditions, and to facilitate the purification of active TFIIH, we decided to generate a human cell line stably expressing a tagged version of XPB (dtXPB) cDNA. To permit isolation of full-length XPB protein and allow purification of XPB on the basis of different reversible affinity purification steps, we chose to add two different types of tags, one on each end of the protein. Thus, coding sequences for a N-terminal hexahistidine stretch followed by a thrombin cleavage site and a C-terminal HA epitope tag (28Field J. Nikawa J.I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) were added to XPBcDNA fragments, and a full-length double-tagged XPBcDNA was constructed (Fig.1 A) and subcloned in eukaryotic expression vectors. To obtain cell lines stably expressing dtXPB, the cDNA vectors were transfected to two human cell lines. First,dtXPB cDNA and a neomycin-selectable marker were transfected into HeLa cells. After selection with G418, individual HeLa clones were obtained and analyzed by immunoblotting for the level of the dtXPB protein using anti-XPB antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 B, lanes 1–5, the double-tagged XPB can be conveniently discerned from the endogenous wild type XPB protein because of its increased size (the predicted molecular mass increases from 89,279 Da to 92,690 Da). In the 48 clones analyzed, various levels of dtXPB protein were detected in WCEs, with many clones expressing no or hardly detectable dtXPB, despite the fact that the dtXPBcDNA was under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter, and multiple copies are expected to be integrated in the genome. Interestingly, in neither case did we observe a large overexpression, and clones expressing the highest level of dtXPB clearly showed decreased levels of the wild type endogenous protein as compared with the p62 core subunit of TFIIH (e.g. Fig. 1 B, compare clone 1-19 with clones 1-6, 1-2, and1-7). These findings suggest that the cellular content of XPB is kept within narrow concentration ranges by degrading excess protein and that there is competition between the endogenous wild type and exogenous tagged protein. Secondly, XP-B UV-sensitive cells were transfected, and after selection with G418 and repeated UV irradiation, a stably expressing mass population was established, designated XP-t3. As with the HeLa transfectants, immunoblot analysis of XP-t3 cell extracts indicated that dtXPB protein levels were comparable with the endogenous (mutant) XPB levels (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–8). Because the relatively high dtXPB protein levels in HeLa clone 1-19 varied during culturing and appeared to be more stable in the transfected XP-B cells, the XP-t3 cell line was further characterized and used for all experiments described here. To characterize the functionality of the dtXPB protein in vivo, an UV survival experiment was carried out. Fig.1 C shows that dtXPB is able to reverse the UV sensitivity of XP-B cells to the same extent as wild typeXPB cDNA, although both not to the same level as the wild type MRC5 transformed cell line used as a repair-proficient control. The NER activity was further analyzed using an in vitro assay. WCEs were prepared and incubated in the presence of both damaged and undamaged plasmid DNA and labeled nucleotides. The resulting incorporation of labeled nucleotides in the damaged plasmid DNA is due to repair DNA synthesis and a measure for NER activity. Fig.1 D shows that extracts prepared from XP-t3 cells were able to repair N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene-damaged DNAin vitro, whereas extracts prepared from XP-B cells display a strongly reduced repair activity. The above findings indicate that the dtXPB protein is functional in NER, implying that it most likely is incorporated in the TFIIH complex. Finally, the fact that these cells grow normally strongly suggests that the dtXPB protein is not interfering with the basal transcription initiation function of the complex. To identify proteins interacting with XPB, an immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out under physiological salt conditions (0.1m KCl) using a repair- and transcription-competent XP-t3 WCE. As shown in Fig. 2, the dtXPB protein could be specifically and quantitatively immunoprecipitated using anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, and in addition to dtXPB, we could detect several TFIIH subunits in the bound fraction (XPD, p62, CDK7, and cyclin H). This confirms that dtXPB was incorporated in TFIIH. Furthermore, the fact that the relative intensities of XPBversus p62 are not significantly altered in the load, unbound, and the bound fractions indicates that the established XP-t3 cells harbor dtXPB in the majority of the TFIIH complexes. Interestingly, although all dtXPB protein was depleted from the WCE, none of the endogenous (mutant) XPB was detected in the bound fraction. This demonstrates that only one XPB subunit is present per complex: if the complex contained more than one XPB molecule, complexes with both the endogenous (mutant) subunit and the tagged protein would be expected to be present in the bound material. Because a number of TFIIH subunits specifically co-immunoprecipitated with dtXPB protein using anti-HA antibodies, we set out to purify TFIIH on this basis and analyze the composition of the TFIIH complex (Fig.3 A). First, WCEs from XP-t3 cells were fractionated on heparin-Ultrogel as described (24Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.-M. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All dtXPB protein, as well as XPB and other known TFIIH subunits, were present in the 0.4 m KCl fraction, designated Hep0.4. Portions of this fraction were directly incubated without further fractionation with anti-HA resin to purify dtXPB and associated proteins. After incubation, the anti-HA resin was extensively washed, and bound material was eluted by competition with excess HA peptide. Subsequently, the composition of the eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with silver nitrate. In addition to dtXPB, we identified only eight polypeptides ranging in molecular mass from 80 to 34 kDa that specifically and consistently immunoprecipitated with dtXPB and are thus XPB-associated factors (Fig. 3 B). These associated proteins were all identified as known TFIIH subunits by two criteria: (i) reactivity with monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing TFIIH subunits; and (ii) exact co-migration with known TFIIH subunits in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Finally, the staining intensity of the dtXPB subunit, compared with the other subunits, suggests that the dtXPB protein was predominantly present in stoichiometric amounts and not in a free form. A number of NER and basal transcription factors (TFIIE, CSA, CSB, and XPG, among others) have been described to interact with the TFIIH complex, either as part of a RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (31Ossipow"
https://openalex.org/W2081175796,"Activation of RNA polymerase II transcription<i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> is synergistic with respect to increasing numbers of activator binding sites or increasing concentrations of activator. The Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein manifests both forms of synergy during activation of genes involved in the viral lytic cycle. The synergy has an underlying mechanistic basis that we and others have proposed is founded largely on the energetic contributions of (i) upstream ZEBRA binding to its sites, (ii) the general pol II machinery binding to the core promoter, and (iii) interactions between ZEBRA and the general machinery. We hypothesize that these interactions form a network for which a minimum stability must be attained to activate transcription. One prediction of this model is that the energetic contributions should be reciprocal, such that a strong core promoter linked to a weak upstream promoter would be functionally analogous to a weak core linked to a strong upstream promoter. We tested this view by measuring the transcriptional response after systematically altering the upstream and core promoters. Our data provide strong qualitative support for this hypothesis and provide a theoretical basis for analyzing Epstein-Barr virus gene regulation."

Accordingly, de novo formation of sphingomyelin and of glycosphingolipids, all of which contain ceramide in their backbone, was reduced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by up to 80%. Complex sphingolipid synthesis was restored upon addition of dihydroceramide or ceramide, in micromolar concentrations, to the culture medium, suggesting that none of the glycosyltransferases involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is inhibited by this analog. Assays of the enzymes catalyzing sphinganine biosynthesis, as well as its N-acylation to form dihydroceramide, revealed that they were also not affected. In contrast, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the activity of sphinganine kinase. Reduction of de novosphingolipid biosynthesis by 1-methylthiodihydroceramide is therefore due to its ability to deplete cells of newly formed free sphinganine. As a consequence of depletion of sphinganine levels, 1-methylthiodihydroceramide disrupted axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons in a manner similar to that reported for direct inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis; thus, there was essentially no axon growth after incubation with 1-methylthiodihydroceramide between days 2 and 3, and co-incubation with short acyl chain analogs of ceramide (5 μm) antagonized the inhibition of growth. Interestingly, the d-erythro and thel-threo isomere were equally effective, but the corresponding free base as well as other structurally related compounds did not affect either sphingolipid biosynthesis or neuronal growth. 1-Methylthiodihydroceramide (10 μm) decreased de novo ceramide biosynthesis by about 90% in primary cultured cerebellar neurons.

SLs contain a ceramide backbone, which anchors them in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The ceramide backbone can be modified by attachment of phosphorylcholine, to form sphingomyelin (SM), or by attachment of one or more sugar residues, to form glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs form cell- and species-specific profiles known to change characteristically during development, differentiation, and transformation, suggesting that they play a role in cell-cell interactions and in cell adhesion (1$$Google Scholar). Gangliosides, the sialic acid containing GSLs, are particularly abundant in neuronal cells, and their involvement in neuritogenesis and possibly synaptogenesis has been extensively studied (2Nagai Y.

During the last few years studies have also been initiated to examine the role of endogenous SLs in neuronal growth (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

In these studies inhibitors of SL biosynthesis, such as fumonisin B1(FB1) and PDMP (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol), as well as inhibitors of lysosomal GSL degradation, like conduritol B-epoxide (5Schwarz A.

In addition, evidence has emerged during the last few years that SL metabolites such as ceramide (Cer), sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) play an important role as intracellular signaling molecules for a variety of different targets (8Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Sphingosine and SPP, originally proposed as negative regulators of protein kinase C (9Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 234: 500-507Crossref Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), were shown to play alternative signaling roles as mitogenic second messengers (8Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Cer is involved in what has become known as the “sphingomyelin cycle” (10Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Cer serves as a mediator of cellular senescence (11Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (30108): 30701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), apoptosis, and differentiation in many cell types (12Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increasing amount of data concerning the role of SL metabolites in cellular signal transduction strongly suggests that SL metabolism is tightly regulated. The identification of factors interfering with SL metabolism and the examination of their mode of action is therefore of great importance.Much of the current knowledge on SL metabolism has been derived from studies with compounds specifically inhibiting defined steps of SL biosynthesis (14Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1996; 25: 371-381Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration that dihydroceramide (DH-Cer) does not mimic the effects of Cer in signaling pathways (15Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we are studying the effects of DH-Cer analogs on SL biosynthesis and on neuronal growth. We now demonstrate that treatment of cerebellar neurons with 1-methylthiodihydroceramide (1-MSDH-Cer) strongly interferes with de novo Cer synthesis, and hence SL formation, by stimulating the catabolism of sphinganine, a vital precursor of SL biosynthesis. Furthermore, this analog significantly reduces the rate of axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons, in a manner similar to that reported for compounds that directly inhibit Cer synthesis (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have described an SL analog that stimulated the activity of sphinganine kinase in vivo, resulting in increased rates of sphinganine degradation and, as a consequence, significantly reduced rates of SL synthesis. This novel analog, 1-MSDH-Cer, may provide an important new means of manipulating levels of SL synthesis without accumulation of toxic SL intermediates, such as sphinganine and sphingosine that accumulate upon incubation with FB1.Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that exogenous sphingosine homologs of different chain length as well as the biosynthetically stable azidosphingosine (23van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and thecis-configured 4-methylsphingosine (35van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) cause a decrease ofde novo SL biosynthesis in primary cultured neurons by specifically interfering with serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Our results revealed a striking correlation of the relative order and magnitude of the sphingosine analogs in terms of the percentage of the phosphorylated metabolites in cultured cells and the inhibitory effect of the respective compound on serine palmitoyltransferase activity, supporting the idea that 1-phosphates are the link between sphingosine metabolites and serine palmitoyltransferase regulation (35van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In the present study we examined the effects of truncated DH-Cer analogs (with a chain length corresponding to 12 carbon atoms in the sphingoid and in the fatty acid moiety, respectively) with changed polar head groups on SL metabolism as well as on neuronal growth using primary cultured neuronal cells. All of the analogs tested lack the 1-hydroxyl group and are thus resistant to glycosylation as well as to phosphorylation at this position. However, only 1-MSDH-Cer was found to exhibit a pronounced effect on both de novo SL biosynthesis and consequently on neuronal growth. The effect of 1-MSDH-Cer was not stereospecific. Both, the d-erythro and thel-threo isomer exerted similar effects onde novo SL biosynthesis and on axonal growth in cerebellar and hippocampal neurons. The corresponding free base (1-methylthiodihydrosphingosine) had almost no effect. Together, these results suggest that several structural requirements are essential for the observed effect of 1-MSDH-Cer.In contrast to the sphingoid bases previously studied, reduction ofde novo SL biosynthesis by 1-MSDH-Cer was not due to a decrease of serine palmitoyltransferase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of SL biosynthesis, but rather to the stimulation of sphinganine kinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of long chain base degradation. Both, DH-Cer and sphingosine are intermediates of SL metabolism, but the former is primarily a biosynthetic metabolite, whereas the latter is exclusively a degradation product (29Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Rother J. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that there might exist two different mechanisms for regulation of SL biosynthesis. First, accumulation of an SL degradation product (SPP) leads to down-regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (27Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); alternatively, accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate (DH-Cer) stimulates the catabolism of its biosynthetic precursor (Fig.7). An unusual degradation of sphinganine also occurs in the presence of FB1, which causes an accumulation of sphinganine, a biosynthetic intermediate, by inhibiting sphinganine N-acyltransferase (37Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7). In that study, however, sphinganine degradation was indirectly evaluated by its utilization for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis and not by direct measurements of sphinganine kinase activity. The fact that 1-MSDH-Cer does not directly stimulate sphinganine kinase upon addition to the in vitro enzyme assay but only after preincubation of the cultured neurons suggests that it does not directly interact with the enzyme on molecular level. More likely, up-regulation of sphinganine kinase activity by 1-MSDH-Cer seems to be a complex process which requires cell integrity and longer incubation. Stimulation of sphingosine kinase of human erythroleukemia cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also required preincubation of cells for at least 18 h with the phorbol ester (38Buehrer B.M. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unlike growth factors (39Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) or GM1 (40Wang F. Buckley N.E. Olivera A. Goodemote K.A. Su Y. Spiegel S. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) which rapidly and transiently increase sphingosine kinase activity, stimulation of sphingosine kinase by phorbol ester appeared to be dependent on transcriptional as well as on translational events (38Buehrer B.M. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Reduction of SL biosynthesis by about 80% as well as some reduction of total SL mass after long incubation times (72–96 h) caused by 1-MSDH-Cer (10 μm) is quite similar to the results obtained in cerebellar neurons with FB1 (25 μm), known to specifically inhibit sphinganine (sphingosine) N-acyltransferase (41Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to FB1 which caused a 20-fold increase of the amount of free sphinganine, 1-MSDH-Cer almost completely depleted the cells of sphinganine within 24 h. Moreover, when both compounds, FB1 and 1-MSDH-Cer, were simultaneously supplied, the latter completely prevented sphinganine accumulation caused by the former.It is intriguing to note that 1-MSDH-Cer has a similar effect on axonal growth of hippocampal neurons as that reported for FB1 (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both reduce axonal length and the number of axonal branch points. In addition, the effect of both compounds on axonal growth can be fully reversed by the addition of C6-NBD-Cer to the culture medium, supporting the idea that endogenous SLs in general (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Cer (6Posse de Chaves E.I. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3028-3035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and GlcCer (5Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

SLs contain a ceramide backbone, which anchors them in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The ceramide backbone can be modified by attachment of phosphorylcholine, to form sphingomyelin (SM), or by attachment of one or more sugar residues, to form glycosphingolipids (GSLs). GSLs form cell- and species-specific profiles known to change characteristically during development, differentiation, and transformation, suggesting that they play a role in cell-cell interactions and in cell adhesion (1$$Google Scholar). Gangliosides, the sialic acid containing GSLs, are particularly abundant in neuronal cells, and their involvement in neuritogenesis and possibly synaptogenesis has been extensively studied (2Nagai Y.

During the last few years studies have also been initiated to examine the role of endogenous SLs in neuronal growth (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

In these studies inhibitors of SL biosynthesis, such as fumonisin B1(FB1) and PDMP (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol), as well as inhibitors of lysosomal GSL degradation, like conduritol B-epoxide (5Schwarz A.

In addition, evidence has emerged during the last few years that SL metabolites such as ceramide (Cer), sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) play an important role as intracellular signaling molecules for a variety of different targets (8Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Sphingosine and SPP, originally proposed as negative regulators of protein kinase C (9Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 234: 500-507Crossref Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), were shown to play alternative signaling roles as mitogenic second messengers (8Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Cer is involved in what has become known as the “sphingomyelin cycle” (10Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Cer serves as a mediator of cellular senescence (11Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (30108): 30701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), apoptosis, and differentiation in many cell types (12Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 13Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increasing amount of data concerning the role of SL metabolites in cellular signal transduction strongly suggests that SL metabolism is tightly regulated. The identification of factors interfering with SL metabolism and the examination of their mode of action is therefore of great importance. Much of the current knowledge on SL metabolism has been derived from studies with compounds specifically inhibiting defined steps of SL biosynthesis (14Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1996; 25: 371-381Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration that dihydroceramide (DH-Cer) does not mimic the effects of Cer in signaling pathways (15Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we are studying the effects of DH-Cer analogs on SL biosynthesis and on neuronal growth. We now demonstrate that treatment of cerebellar neurons with 1-methylthiodihydroceramide (1-MSDH-Cer) strongly interferes with de novo Cer synthesis, and hence SL formation, by stimulating the catabolism of sphinganine, a vital precursor of SL biosynthesis. Furthermore, this analog significantly reduces the rate of axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons, in a manner similar to that reported for compounds that directly inhibit Cer synthesis (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have described an SL analog that stimulated the activity of sphinganine kinase in vivo, resulting in increased rates of sphinganine degradation and, as a consequence, significantly reduced rates of SL synthesis. This novel analog, 1-MSDH-Cer, may provide an important new means of manipulating levels of SL synthesis without accumulation of toxic SL intermediates, such as sphinganine and sphingosine that accumulate upon incubation with FB1.Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that exogenous sphingosine homologs of different chain length as well as the biosynthetically stable azidosphingosine (23van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and thecis-configured 4-methylsphingosine (35van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) cause a decrease ofde novo SL biosynthesis in primary cultured neurons by specifically interfering with serine palmitoyltransferase activity. Our results revealed a striking correlation of the relative order and magnitude of the sphingosine analogs in terms of the percentage of the phosphorylated metabolites in cultured cells and the inhibitory effect of the respective compound on serine palmitoyltransferase activity, supporting the idea that 1-phosphates are the link between sphingosine metabolites and serine palmitoyltransferase regulation (35van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In the present study we examined the effects of truncated DH-Cer analogs (with a chain length corresponding to 12 carbon atoms in the sphingoid and in the fatty acid moiety, respectively) with changed polar head groups on SL metabolism as well as on neuronal growth using primary cultured neuronal cells. All of the analogs tested lack the 1-hydroxyl group and are thus resistant to glycosylation as well as to phosphorylation at this position. However, only 1-MSDH-Cer was found to exhibit a pronounced effect on both de novo SL biosynthesis and consequently on neuronal growth. The effect of 1-MSDH-Cer was not stereospecific. Both, the d-erythro and thel-threo isomer exerted similar effects onde novo SL biosynthesis and on axonal growth in cerebellar and hippocampal neurons. The corresponding free base (1-methylthiodihydrosphingosine) had almost no effect. Together, these results suggest that several structural requirements are essential for the observed effect of 1-MSDH-Cer.In contrast to the sphingoid bases previously studied, reduction ofde novo SL biosynthesis by 1-MSDH-Cer was not due to a decrease of serine palmitoyltransferase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of SL biosynthesis, but rather to the stimulation of sphinganine kinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of long chain base degradation. Both, DH-Cer and sphingosine are intermediates of SL metabolism, but the former is primarily a biosynthetic metabolite, whereas the latter is exclusively a degradation product (29Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Rother J. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that there might exist two different mechanisms for regulation of SL biosynthesis. First, accumulation of an SL degradation product (SPP) leads to down-regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (27Mandon E.C. van Echten G. Birk R. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bär T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); alternatively, accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate (DH-Cer) stimulates the catabolism of its biosynthetic precursor (Fig.7). An unusual degradation of sphinganine also occurs in the presence of FB1, which causes an accumulation of sphinganine, a biosynthetic intermediate, by inhibiting sphinganine N-acyltransferase (37Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7). In that study, however, sphinganine degradation was indirectly evaluated by its utilization for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis and not by direct measurements of sphinganine kinase activity. The fact that 1-MSDH-Cer does not directly stimulate sphinganine kinase upon addition to the in vitro enzyme assay but only after preincubation of the cultured neurons suggests that it does not directly interact with the enzyme on molecular level. More likely, up-regulation of sphinganine kinase activity by 1-MSDH-Cer seems to be a complex process which requires cell integrity and longer incubation. Stimulation of sphingosine kinase of human erythroleukemia cells by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also required preincubation of cells for at least 18 h with the phorbol ester (38Buehrer B.M. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unlike growth factors (39Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) or GM1 (40Wang F. Buckley N.E. Olivera A. Goodemote K.A. Su Y. Spiegel S. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) which rapidly and transiently increase sphingosine kinase activity, stimulation of sphingosine kinase by phorbol ester appeared to be dependent on transcriptional as well as on translational events (38Buehrer B.M. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Reduction of SL biosynthesis by about 80% as well as some reduction of total SL mass after long incubation times (72–96 h) caused by 1-MSDH-Cer (10 μm) is quite similar to the results obtained in cerebellar neurons with FB1 (25 μm), known to specifically inhibit sphinganine (sphingosine) N-acyltransferase (41Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to FB1 which caused a 20-fold increase of the amount of free sphinganine, 1-MSDH-Cer almost completely depleted the cells of sphinganine within 24 h. Moreover, when both compounds, FB1 and 1-MSDH-Cer, were simultaneously supplied, the latter completely prevented sphinganine accumulation caused by the former.It is intriguing to note that 1-MSDH-Cer has a similar effect on axonal growth of hippocampal neurons as that reported for FB1 (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both reduce axonal length and the number of axonal branch points. In addition, the effect of both compounds on axonal growth can be fully reversed by the addition of C6-NBD-Cer to the culture medium, supporting the idea that endogenous SLs in general (4Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Cer (6Posse de Chaves E.I. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol.

M., and Kerjaschki, D. (1995) J. Exp. Med. 181, 585–597). To search for a molecule that reacts with the antibodies, we screened a λgt11 human placental cDNA library. Two of the isolated clones were found to encode a putative counterpart of the rodent trans-Golgi network (TGN) glycoprotein 38, hTGN46, which has the tyrosine containing motif YQRL shared by mouse and rat TGN38. Moreover, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of hTGN46transcripts and genomic analysis of a cDNA deposited as an expressed sequence tag in dbEST Data Base revealed that additional cDNAs exist that are produced by alternate usage of 3′-splice sites of intron III. Alternative splicing results in frame shifts and leads to novel larger translation products with one (for hTGN48) or two (for hTGN51) additional tyrosine-containing motifs. hTGN51 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells were localized to thetrans-Golgi network, overlapping with β-1,4-galactosyltransferase even after mutating the tyrosine-containing motif common to hTGN46. In contrast, mutated hTGN48 and hTGN46 are no longer retrieved to the TGN. These results strongly suggest that hTGN51 may have a unique function compared with hTGN46 or hTGN48 in shuttling between the cell surface and the TGN.

The trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN,trans-Golgi network; TGN38, trans-Golgi network glycoprotein 38; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EST, expressed sequence tag; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 1The abbreviations used are: TGN,trans-Golgi network; TGN38, trans-Golgi network glycoprotein 38; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EST, expressed sequence tag; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. is a tubulo-vesicular structure adjacent to the trans-most cisternae of the Golgi stack. The TGN is the major site where secretory and membrane proteins are sorted to the plasma membrane, lysosomes, endosomes, and secretory granules (1Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 447-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 3Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The final stages of processing N-glycans and most likely O-glycans take place in the TGN, and in some instances such unique glycosylation plays a role in sorting to the correct destination (1Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 447-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 3Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). TGN38, originally characterized in rat, is a type I integral membrane protein predominantly localized to the TGN (4Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The rat cDNA encoding rTGN38 predicts a protein with 357 amino acid residues. The cytoplasmic domain consisting of 33 amino acids contains a YQRL sequence, which has been shown in other proteins to be a signal for the endocytic pathway and for lysosomal targeting (5Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J.

Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and a retrieval signal for rTGN38 from the plasma membrane (10Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of this motif resulted in constitutive expression of TGN38 at the plasma membrane (10Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the transmembrane domain of TGN38 plays a role as a retention signal in the TGN, making rTGN38 unique in having both retrieval and retention signals (12Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In rat, a cDNA encoding a translational product different from the original rTGN38 was isolated (13Reaves B. Wilde A. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This cDNA has an insertion of 5 bp, of which 4 bp replace the counterpart of TGN38 cDNA in the region of the cytoplasmic tail. This insertion changes the reading frame such that the three COOH-terminal amino acids of TGN38 are replaced with a different sequence, and the cytoplasmic tail is 23 amino acid residues longer than that of TGN38. This variant, termed rTGN41, also contains the same tyrosine motif as rTGN38. On the other hand, the mouse homologue of rTGN38 has two forms due to allelic differences (14Kasai K. Takahashi S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14471-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that sera from patients with autoimmune vasculitis were found to react with glycoprotein(s) with a molecular mass of ∼130 kDa (gp130s) (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against gp130s, and monoclonal antibody AG11 was found to show a staining profile identical to that of sera from patients. Attempts to isolate cDNA clones using AG11 to screen expression libraries have been unsuccessful. In contrast, one 130-kDa glycoprotein has been identified as LAMP-2 in a λgt11 library screen using the antibodies specific to gp130s (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of LAMP-2 differs from that detected by the AG11 antibody, suggesting that LAMP-2 is only one of the members of gp130s (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). By using the antibodies specific to gp130s in the present study, we screened a λgt11 library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human placenta. In addition to cDNAs encoding LAMP-2, we first isolated cDNA encoding the human homologue of rat TGN38, designated human TGN46 (hTGN46). We then detected additional transcripts that encode larger proteins than hTGN46. These novel forms of hTGN46 are produced by different usage of 3′-splicing sites in intron III. The largest protein, hTGN51, is unique in having two additional tyrosine containing motifs and a dileucine motif (16Ogata S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fukuda M. Maddy A.H. Harris J.R. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 199-230Google Scholar), both of which together we showed to function as a retrieval signal to the TGN. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to gp130s were prepared as described previously (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera specific to gp130s were passed through Escherichia coli lysates immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pierce) and purified on gp130s immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (300 μg/ml), as described previously (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A λgt11 cDNA term placenta library (18Millan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3112-3115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened with affinity purified rabbit anti-gp130 antibodies. After screening 106 plaques, 9 positive clones were isolated. Among the clones analyzed, 7 clones were found to harbor cDNAs encoding lamp-2. Using a Blast Search (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58724) Google Scholar), 2 clones were found to harbor cDNAs with no homology to human sequences reported at that time, but both were homologous to sequences encoding the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of rat TGN38 (4Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the obtained clones indicated that the 5′-end was missing. To obtain a complete cDNA clone, 5′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out (20Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using poly(A)+ RNA from human placenta (CLONTECH Laboratories) as a template and an oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 658–675. hTGN46 was amplified by PCR using a 5′-anchor primer provided in the RACE kit and a 3′-PCR nested primer, 5′-TCCA GGC CGT TGG CTC AAG CT-3′ (primer 20), which is complementary to nucleotides 133–153 (Fig. 1). From this 5′-RACE product, cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR using two gene-specific sequences. The upstream primer used was primer 30, 5′-TAT GGA TCC CGC GAG AGC ATT AG-3′ (BamHI site underlined; −44 to −26), and the downstream primer was primer 20. The 200-bp PCR product was subcloned into pBluescriptII/SK+ by T-A cloning. In parallel the cDNA sequence of one of the clones (4a1) in pBluescript was linearized at an XhoI site and subjected to partial digestion with StyI. A 1449-bp cDNA product was then ligated to the 3′-end of the 5′-RACE product described above at a common StyI site. This cDNA was then subcloned into theBamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA3-hTGN46. PCR was carried out using various cDNA libraries as templates. For the first PCR, the 5′-primer (primer 11) corresponds to nucleotides 986–1003, and the 3′-primer (primer 10) is complementary to nucleotides 1347–1367 of hTGN46. For the second PCR, the nucleotide sequence encoding the lumenal domain (nucleotides 137–1185) was amplified using primer 1 (nucleotides 137–153) and primer 2 (nucleotides 1168–1185). A human genomic P1 plasmid library was screened by PCR as described (21Onda M. Fukuda M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 5′- and 3′-primers for PCR correspond to the sequence of nucleotides 1245 to 1278 (primer 27) and nucleotides 1386 to 1369 (primer 10), respectively, of hTGN46 sequence. Purified DNA from one of the isolated P1 clones, clone 10508, was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes under the conditions as described (22Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A. Sasaki K. Nishi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3684-3691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To isolate genomic clones of TGN46, the above P1 plasmid, 10508, was digested by BamHI and XhoI and cloned into pBluescript. The resultant colonies were then screened initially by hybridization with the cDNA clone 8c1 that encompasses nucleotides 28–2103 as a probe. Five positive clones were then screened by cDNA encompassing either nucleotides −45 to 153 or nucleotides 1369 to 1386. Three clones harboring the 5′-half of the genomic sequence and two clones harboring the 3′-half were isolated. 5′-Primer extension analysis was carried out essentially as described (23Sawada R. Jardine K.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9014-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primer was complementary to nucleotides +23 to +46 (46 is at the end of exon 1). Poly(A)+ RNA from HL-60 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells was annealed to the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide and incubated with Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as detailed previously (23Sawada R. Jardine K.A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9014-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various 5′-regions of the hTGN46 gene were obtained by PCR using the P1 plasmid as template. A 2.7-kb fragment immediately upstream of nucleotide −44 and shorter genomic fragments spanning −1.2 kb to −340 bp were cloned in sense into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The shorter fragment was also cloned in the reverse orientation. These nucleotide sequences were determined by sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with these constructs. Negative and positive controls for transfection were carried out using pGL3 vector itself and PTRELuc (CLONTECH), respectively (24Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Microlumat LB96P luminometer (EG&G Berthold) were used. The results were normalized to protein content. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase, poly(A)+ RNA derived from fetal liver and oligonucleotide r3, shown in Fig. 4, corresponding to 3′-untranslated sequences. Using the cDNAs synthesized as templates, PCR was performed to amplify sequence from exon 3 to exon 4 under the conditions described (16Ogata S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first PCR, the 5′-primer (primer 27) corresponds to nucleotides 1245–1278 and the 3′-primer (primer B) is complementary to nucleotides 1348–1372 of the hTGN51 sequence. This PCR reaction yielded 128- and 87-bp products derived from the transcripts forTGN51 and TGN48 (Fig. 2 C). For isolation of cDNA encoding TGN51, another PCR was carried out to isolate the 3′-region of the sequence using a 5′-primer (primerA) corresponding to nucleotides 1301–1321 and a 3′-primer (primer 54) complementary to nucleotides 1518–1547. This PCR product and the 128-bp product described above were then used as a template for PCR using primers 27 and 54 as described (16Ogata S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in cDNA encoding nucleotides 1245–1547 of hTGN51.Figure 2Analysis of PCR products derived from cDNA libraries (A and B) and from reverse-transcribed templates (C). A andB, PCR was carried out using cDNA libraries constructed from poly(A)+ of human placenta (lane 1), human adult kidney (2Roth J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), human kidney glomeruli (3Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and human fetal kidney (lanes 4 and 5). The sequences between primers 10 and 11 and between primers 1 and 2, shown in Fig. 1, were amplified inA and B, respectively. C, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase using primer r3 and poly(A)+ RNA from fetal and adult liver, 293 cells, and HL-60 cells. Sequences between primers 27 and B (right lanes) and between primers A and 29 (left lanes) shown in Fig. 4 are amplified. Primer 29 ends 13 bp upstream from the 3′-end of primer 54. PCR products were visualized by Southern blot analysis using 32P-labeled cDNA as a probe (A andB) or ethidium bromide staining (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For cloning of cDNA encoding TGN48, a second PCR was carried out to amplify sequence between nucleotides 1350 and 1547. Using this PCR product and the 87-bp fragment obtained in the first PCR as templates, a final PCR was carried out using primers 27 and 54. Control experiments were performed omitting reverse transcriptase or after digestion of poly(A)+ RNA by ribonuclease A. These cDNA fragments were cloned into PflMI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3-hTGN46, replacing the corresponding sequence of hTGN46, which resulted in pcDNA3-hTGN48and pcDNA3-hTGN51, respectively. A human multiple fetal tissue Northern blot (CLONTECHLaboratories) was hybridized with a gel-purified cDNA fragment (nucleotide −45 to nucleotide 153) of pcDNA3-hTGN46after labeling with [α-32P]dCTP by one PCR cycle (25Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 37-42Google Scholar). The same blot was also hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 59 or primer 54, as described previously (26Siebert P.D. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6735-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide 59 (nucleotides 1342–1318) hybridizes only with the transcript of hTGN51, whereas primer 54, described above, hybridizes with all three of the TGN glycoprotein transcripts. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using pcDNAI-hTGN46 as a template as described (16Ogata S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-primer for this PCR (primer 30) was used in the isolation of pcDNA3-hTGN46. The 3′-primer was 5′-TCTGTTAGGACTTCTGGTCCAAACGTTGGTTGTCACT-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1280–1318 in hTGN46, in which the tyrosine codon was changed to asparagine, as shown by double underlines. The PCR product was blunt-ended by vent DNA polymerase, digested by BamHI, and cloned into the BamHI andEcoRV sites of pcDNA3, resulting in pcDNA3-TGN46YN. To isolate cDNA encoding mutated TGN48 and 51, cDNA fragments obtained by PflMI and XbaI digestion were separately cloned into pcDNA3-TGN46YN which had been digested with the same restriction enzymes, resulting in pcDNA3-hTGN48YN and pcDNA3-hTGN51YN. The fragment of cDNA encoding part of the lumenal domain of hTGN46 was excised from clone 4a1 with BamHI and HindIII (position 862) (see Fig. 1) and ligated in-frame into pMALc2 (New England Biolabs). Transformed E. coli DH5α were induced to express a soluble maltose binding fusion protein (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant fusion protein was digested with factor Xa, resulting in precipitates that almost exclusively contained hTGN46 peptide. One hundred μg of this protein were used for the initial immunization and for further boosts. Sera were passed through a column of bacterial proteins produced inE. coli DH5α and then purified by adsorbing on protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) as described (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S.

The specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by Western blot analysis of TGN46 contained in fusion proteins and human tissues performed as described previously (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Skrincosky D. Kain R. El-Battari A. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Fukuda M. J.

To express hTGN46 and related glycoproteins, pcDNA3-hTGN46 was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells grown on coverslips using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (27Skrincosky D. Kain R. El-Battari A. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22695-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In some experiments, TGN glycoproteins were co-expressed with human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase. For this, pcDNAI-GalT (28Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and pcDNAI-hTGN46,hTGN48, hTGN51, or corresponding mutant proteins were transiently transfected into CHO cells. Rabbit anti-hTGN46 antibodies and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to human β-galactosyltransferase (29Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar) were used in the assay. Samples were visualized as described (27Skrincosky D. Kain R. El-Battari A. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Indirect immunoperoxidase staining was performed as described previously (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1989; 143: 546-552PubMed Google Scholar). For gold labeling, ultrathin frozen sections of paraformaldehyde/lysine/periodate-fixed normal human kidneys were incubated with purified rabbit anti-hTGN46 antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-10-nm gold conjugate (1:20, Auroprobe, Amersham Corp), as described (15Kain R. Matsui K. Exner M. Binder S. Schaffner G. Sommer E.M. Kerjaschki D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Controls were performed either by omitting the primary antibody or by replacing it with rabbit preimmune serum. A λgt11 cDNA expression library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of human term placenta was screened with affinity purified rabbit anti-gp130s antibodies. After screening 106 plaques, 9 positive clones were isolated. Among them, seven clones were found to harbor cDNAs encoding LAMP-2, whereas two other clones were found to have no homology to any human sequences in the data base at that time. Further analysis of these two clones revealed that they contain sequences highly homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of rat TGN38, rTGN38 (4Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We designated the protein encoded by these clones as human TGN46, hTGN46. Comparing rTGN38 to human cDNA sequences cloned, two clones, 4a1 and 8c1, contain almost all of the coding sequence but lack the extreme 5′-region. The sequence obtained by 5′-RACE reaction was ligated to one of the cDNA clones isolated (4a1) at a commonStyI site to form a cDNA encoding the entire hTGN46 polypeptide, resulting in pcDNA3-hTGN46. Sequencing the isolated cDNA in pcDNA3-hTGN46revealed an insert of 2142 base pairs encoding a single open reading frame, predicting a protein of 437 amino acids (molecular weight, 45,724) (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1, we combine results obtained from cDNA and genomic clones described below. The hydropathy plot (data not shown) indicates that the amino acid sequence encompassing from residue 1 to 21 and that from 385 to 402 are hydrophobic, suggesting that they represent a leader peptide and a transmembrane domain, respectively. The lumenal domain of hTGN46 contains nine potential N-glycosylation sites and a large segment enriched in proline, glycine, serine, and threonine residues, which likely serve as O-glycosylation sites. Notably, the sequence from residues 55 to 250 consists of 14 tandem repeats of 14 amino acid residues (see sequence between two horizontal arrows in Fig. 1). This sequence is followed by a domain enriched in acidic amino acids (see dotted line in Fig. 1), the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic segment. It is noteworthy that there is no homology in the lumenal domain between hTGN46 and rodent TGN38 except for the acidic region (4Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Reaves B. Wilde A. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Kasai K. Takahashi S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14471-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To determine whether variants of hTGN46 are expressed in placenta and kidney, cDNA sequences of hTGN46 were amplified using various cDNA libraries as templates. When the sequence encoding the lumenal domain was amplified by PCR, only one product (∼1.0 kb), that expected from hTGN46 sequence, was obtained (Fig.2 B). In contrast, two bands were obtained when PCR was carried out with primers to the lumenal domain and 3′-untranslated sequence (Fig. 2 A). Of these products, the shorter one (402 bp) corresponds to the hTGN46sequence (nucleotides 998–1399). The longer product is larger than this shorter product by approximately 60 bp. The results suggest that there is more than one form of hTGN46 and that a novel form contains additional sequences between the acidic region and the COOH terminus. Different forms of hTGN46 described above could be produced by different genes or by alternative splicing of mRNA encoding hTGN46. To determine whether more than one gene encodes hTGN46 and related sequences, the hTGN46 gene was localized on chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization procedures. These experiments demonstrated that hTGN46 gene is localized in chromosome 2. Measurement of 10 specific hybridizations of chromosome 2 demonstrated that 10508 is located at a position 10% the distance from the centromere to the telomere of chromosome 2 arm p, an area corresponding to chromosome 2, band p11.2 (Fig.3). The results strongly suggest that only one gene encodes different forms of hTGN46, although tandemly arranged multiple genes would provide the same results. The above results suggest that different transcripts of hTGN46are produced by alternate splicing. To determine whether variant transcripts are produced from the same gene, we isolated genomic clones from the P1 plasmid, as detailed in “Experimental Procedures.” Two representative genomic clones were obtained, and clone 6 contained exon 1 to intron III sequence, whereas clone 24 contained intron III to exon 4 sequence. The genomic organization of hTGN46 as shown in Fig. 1 is derived from this analysis. Primer extension analysis showed that the transcription start site lies 62 bp upstream from the initiation methionine codon. In addition, the 5′-flanking sequence from 2.7 kb to 42 bp upstream from the initiation methionine codon showed strong promoter activity (data not shown). These results suggest that different transcripts are not produced by different initiation of transcription or from different genes. The results shown in Fig. 2, A and B, also indicate that a portion"
https://openalex.org/W2161121955,"The linear single-stranded DNA genome of the minute virus of mice (MVM) is replicated via a double-stranded replicative form (RF) intermediate. Amplification of this RF is initiated by the folding-back of palindromic sequences serving as primers for strand-displacement synthesis and formation of dimeric RF DNA. Using an in vitro replication assay and a cloned MVM DNA template, we observed hairpin-primed DNA replication at both MVM DNA termini, with a bias toward right-end initiation. Initiation of DNA replication is favored by nuclear components of A9 cell extract and highly stimulated by the MVM nonstructural protein NS1. Hairpin-primed DNA replication is also observed in the presence of NS1 and the Klenow fragment of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Addition of ATPγS (adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)) blocks the initiation of DNA replication but not the extension of pre-existing hairpin primers formed in the presence of NS1 only. The NS1-mediated unwinding of the right-end palindrome may account for the recently reported capacity of NS1 for driving dimer RF synthesis in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2131746248,"Protein-protein interactions are often mediated by the recognition of proline-rich domains by SH3 or WW modules. Previously, we demonstrated that the PEST-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTP HSCF (hematopoietic stemcell fraction), bound to a novel cytoskeletal associated protein, proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PST PIP), via an interaction between the proline-rich COOH terminus of the PTP and a site within the putative coiled-coil domain of PST PIP. Here we describe a more detailed analysis of this interaction. Earlier data suggested that the NH2terminus of PST PIP was important for binding to the phosphatase, and deletion of the NH2-terminal 50 amino acids of the PST PIP resulted in an apparently misfolded protein that was incapable of binding PTP HSCF. To examine the region involved with binding to PTP HSCF, alanine-scanning mutants were produced at intervals throughout PST PIP. This analysis demonstrated that a tryptophan at position 232 was essential for binding in vitro. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the Trp232 mutant protein was capable of association with the cortical cytoskeleton but was not bound to PTP HSCF in vivo. Alanine scanning of a peptide derived from the COOH-terminal proline-rich domain of PTP HSCF revealed that a subset of prolines, as well as other residues, was required for efficient binding to PST PIP, and introduction of alanines at some of these positions in the protein resulted in decreased binding to PST PIPin vitro and in vivo. Analysis of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of the Trp232 mutant of PST PIP in the presence of v-Src revealed that this protein was phosphorylated more efficiently than the wild-type molecule. Thus, the interaction between PTP HSCF and PST PIP is mediated by a novel site in the cytoskeletal associated protein which interacts with residues within the proline-rich COOH terminus of the phosphatase.

The specific interactions of a large number of intracellular proteins are involved in a diversity of signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. Although many of these interactions are mediated by, for example, the recognition of phosphotyrosines by SH2 domains, many important binding events are also generated by the recognition of proline-rich motifs (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Two different domains, the SH3-type (2Mayer B. Baltimore D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 3Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and the WW-type (4Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5Einbond A. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), recognize proline-rich regions of proteins. SH3 domains are protein modules that are approximately 60 amino acid long which are found in a diversity of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins. An example of the importance of SH3 domain-mediated interactions is found in the GRB2-son of sevenless complex, where SH3-induced interactions are involved with growth factor receptor activation of the ras signaling pathway (6Rozakis Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Botwell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). SH3 domains recognize residues within type II polyproline helices with relatively low affinity (7Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R. Schreiber S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Tsuchiya S. Ogura K. Nagata K. Ishii S. Mandiyan V. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. Nat.

Biol. 1997; 267: 933-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interactions among residues conserved in a number of SH3 domains and both prolines as well as other residues within the polyproline helix of the binding partner can induce adhesion in either of two orientations, a result that enhances the combinatorial complexity of such binding events (7Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R. Schreiber S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Feng S. Chen J. Yu H. Simon J. Schreiber S. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). WW domains represent a second type of polyproline recognition motif which is approximately 38 amino acids long and contains two tryptophan residues, a COOH-terminal proline, and a high concentration of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids (4Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5Einbond A. Sudol M.

As is the case with SH3 domains, WW modules recognize regions rich in proline, although the types of proline-containing sequences recognized by WW motifs are divergent from those that bind to SH3 domains (5Einbond A. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,13Chen H. Sudol M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S.

The recognition pocket of the WW motif contains a hydrophobic binding site in part derived from the COOH-terminal tryptophan conserved in these modules (12Macias M. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), a configuration that differs substantially from the SH3 interaction region (7Feng S.

Meyers C.A. Mueller L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 933-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The potential importance of WW domains is highlighted particularly in the case of the formins, polyproline-containing molecules involved with limb and kidney development which bind to proteins that contain WW motifs (16Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Chan D. Bedford M. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of the physiological importance of WW-containing proteins has yet to be demonstrated, although recent data suggest a role for this type of interaction in retroviral budding from infected cells (18Garnier L. Wills J. Venderame M. Sudol M. Nature. 1996; 381: 744-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and possibly in the regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel (19Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that recognition of proline-rich domains by at least two divergent protein motifs may be a critical aspect of eukaryotic signaling. We recently described the characterization of a novel, tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeletal associated protein, termed PST PIP, 1The abbreviations used are: PST PIP, proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HSCF, hematopoietic stem cell fraction. 1The abbreviations used are: PST PIP, proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HSCF, hematopoietic stem cell fraction. which is a substrate for one or more of the PEST family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PST PIP (proline serinethreonine phopsphatase interactingprotein) contains a putative coiled-coil region as well as a COOH-terminal SH3 domain, and it is homologous to aSchizosaccharomyces pombe cytoskeletal associated protein termed CDC15p, which is involved with the assembly of the cytokinetic cleavage furrow during mitosis (21Fankhauser C. Reymond A. Cerutti L. Utzig S. Hofmann K. Simanis V. Cell. 1995; 82: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Examination of the cellular localization of PST PIP during mitosis in 3T3 cells demonstrated that the mammalian protein was also associated with the cleavage furrow, consistent with a role for this protein in cytokinesis. In addition, overexpression of the mammalian protein in the yeast S. pombe resulted in localization of PST PIP to the cleavage furrow and a partial dominant negative effect on cytokinesis, again consistent with a role for PST PIP in cleavage furrow assembly. Endogenous and transfected PST PIP was constituitively unphosphorylated on its tyrosine residues, and it appeared likely that this was in part due to an interaction with an endogenous PTP, since treatment of cells with the pan-PTP inhibitor pervanadate resulted in a high level of PST PIP tyrosine phosphorylation. PST PIP was also tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of cotransfected v-Src, and these phosphotyrosines appeared to be substrates for dephosphorylation by the PEST-type PTP, PTP HSCF. Dephosphorylation of PST PIP phosphotyrosines by PTP HSCF required the presence of a proline-rich region that is ∼20 amino acids long in the COOH terminus of the phosphatase, and it was demonstrated that this region appeared to be necessary and sufficient to mediate binding between these two proteins. Examination of this COOH-terminal region revealed that it bore a striking resemblance to the proline-rich motifs recognized by SH3 domains, consistent with its interacting with the PST PIP SH3 module (7Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R. Schreiber S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Tsuchiya S. Ogura K. Nagata K.

Meyers C.A. Mueller L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 933-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the region of PST PIP which interacted with PTP HSCF revealed that the coiled-coil-containing domain was responsible for the binding of these two proteins. This surprising result suggested that a novel type of polyproline recognition motif is involved with the interaction between PTP HSCF and PST PIP because neither consensus SH3- nor WW-type modules were contained within the coiled-coil region. Here we describe a detailed analysis of the interaction between the PTP HSCF COOH-terminal proline-rich region and the coiled-coil domain of PST PIP. Although a consensus WW-type motif is not found in the coiled-coil region of PST PIP, a tryptophan residue within this region appears to be critical for recognition of the proline-rich COOH terminus of PTP HSCF. In addition, a tryptophan in the PTP proline-rich COOH terminus, together with a subset of prolines and glycine and arginine residues, also appears to be involved with this interaction.In vivo expression of the mutant form of PST PIP, which is incapable of binding PTP HSCF, results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of the v-Src tyrosine kinase. Together, these data define a novel type of protein-protein interaction which appears to regulate the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of a cytoskeletal associated protein. Deletions in the PST PIP molecule were made from both the amino and carboxyl termini. The deletions were constructed from Pfu polymerase chain reaction fragments that were ligated back into the original PST PIP expression vector (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction primers for the NH2-terminal deletions were (all 5′ to 3′) as follows: N-coil.1, CAGTTCGGATCCATGATGCTGCAGAGGCTGCTGGACGGCAGG; N-coil.2, CAGTTCGGATCCATGATGGAGAGGTACGGGAAGGAGCTGGTG; N-coil.3, CAGTTCGGATCCATGATGTCCTTTGACTCCCTGAAGCAGCAA; N-coil.4, CAGTTCGGATCCATGATGGAGCTGCGGAGCCTGGAGGAGTTC; N-coil.5, CAGTTCGGATCCATGATGGTCCAGAAGAGCAAGTTGTCGCTC; N-coil.6, CAGTTCGGATCCATGATGGCAGATGATGCTGAGCAGGCCTTC. The common 3′-end primer was ACGTCACTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTT. The primers for the COOH-terminal deletions were as follows: C-coil.1, TTGACCTCGAGTCATCACCGCTCAGGGGTGGGAGTCAGAGTC; C-coil.2, TTGACCTCGAGTCATCACAGCCCAGAGAACCTCTTTATCA; C-coil.3, TTGACCTCGAGTCATCAGTCATAGTAGTTCTGATAAGGCACCGGA; C-coil.4, TTGACCTCGAGTCATCAGTCACCTTCCACATCACAGCCCTCAAGGGTC; C-coil.5, TTGACCTCGAGTCATCAGGAGAGCTGGTTACAGTGCACCCACAGGGCA; C-coil.6, TTGACCTCGAGTCATCACTCACGCAGGGCCAGGGCCAGCTGGATGTG. The primer N-coil.1 was used as the common 5′-polymerase chain reaction primer for the COOH-terminal deletions. The mutagenesis of PST PIP and PTP HSCF was accomplished using the Dut/Ung− procedure (Bio-Rad). For PST PIP the mutagenesis primers were designed to change 3 contiguous amino acids to alanine. Mutations were spaced approximately 12 amino acids apart, with new restriction sites engineered in for identification of mutant clones. Primer annealing was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 10 min, room temperature for 5 min, and then on ice prior to the addition of T7 DNA polymerase. The primers used for PST PIP alanine-scanning mutagenesis were (all 5′ to 3′) as follows: D38VE, GTCTGAGGAGCTCCGCCGCAGCCTTGCAC; E50ER, CCTTCCCGTACGCCGCCGCCGCCTGAGCTCTCTG; R62K, GGCCACCAGCCGCGGCTGCAATCTGCACGAGC; R73TS, CAGGGAGTCAAAGGCGGCCGCCAGGGAGTTCATC; N84VG, CTGGATGTGCGCGCTGGCCGCAGCCTCTGTTTGC; R99EE, CCTCCAAGCTTCGCAGCGCCGCAGCCAGGGCCAGGGC; E110RQ, CCGCTGCTCTTTCGCTGCCGCTCGGAATTCCTCC; I122MD, CTTCTGGACACGGGCCGCGGCGGCCTCATACTTCT; L132YK, GGTCTTCTTGGCGGCCGCAAGCTTGCTCTTCT; D145QK, GCATCCCTGCACGCCGCGGCATATAAGCTTTCTTGGACTCCA; E159RV, GTGGCCATTGGCACTCGCAGCCGCGAAAGCTTGCTCAGCATC; Q169VE, GGCTTTGTTCTGGCTCTTTGCTGCTGCCTTCTGGTGACCATTGGC; R194QN, CCTCGCTCTCTCCAGTTGTTCAATAGCTGCCGCGTACACTCT; Trp204, CTCCTGCTCCGCCTCGGTCCGAGCTCTCTCC; Phe221, GGATGGTGAGCCGGTCTGCCTCCTGCAGCTGGAGGCC; Leu224, CGGAGGATGGTGGCCCGGTCGAATTCCTGCAACTGG; Trp232, ATGGAGAGCTGGTTACAGTGCACCGCCAATGCATTGCGGAGG. Cysteines within the region of PTP HSCF binding domain of PST PIP were also mutated to alanine using the following primers (all 5′ to 3′): Cys36, TCCACATCCTTGGACATCTTCCTG; Cys148, CATCATCTGCATCCCTGGCCTTCTGGTCATATCCCTTCTTG; Cys180, GGCTGACTCCTTGGACTGCTTGGC; Cys213, GAAGGCCTCGGAGGTAGTCCGGTGCTC; Cys235, ATGGAGAGCTGGTTGGAGTGCACCCACA; Cys242, CATCATCCTTGACGGACTGCATGGAGAGCT; Cys259, GATGTCACCTTCCACATCGGAGCCCTCAAGGGTCAG. Single codon mutations to alanine were also made in the carboxyl terminus of PTP HSCF using the following primers (all 5′ to 3′): HSCF Arg436, CCCTTTGGGTCGACCGATGGCCAAGTTGAAGCC; HSCF Pro440, AGGATCTCGGGGCCCTTTGGCCCTTCCGATGCGC; HSCF Gly442, CTGGAGGATCTCGAGGTGCTTTGGGCCTTCC; HSCF Pro443, GGAGGATCTCGGGCCCCTTTGGGCCTTCCG; HSCF Arg444, CTGCAGGAGGATCCGCGGGCCCTTTGGGCCTTCC; HSCF Pro447, GTCCACTCTGCAGCAGGATCCCGGGGCCCTT; HSCF Trp450, GTTACACCCGTGTCGCCTCTGCAGGAGGATCCCG. The R444A,W4540A double mutant was made with the HSCF Trp450 primer on a single strand template of the Arg444 mutant phosphatase. The mutants were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. Confocal microscopy was performed as described previously (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary cells in chamber slides were transfected using LipofectAMINE and the indicated plasmids. 48 h later, cells were fixed in formaldehyde and stained with an anti-FLAG epitope-specific antibody (Kodak) and fluorescein-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Anti-FLAG-stained cells were washed and stained with Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG. Stained cells were observed using a Molecular Dynamics confocal microscope (2001) and analyzed with ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics). In vitro binding analyses between various PTP HSCF and PST PIP constructs were performed as described previously (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmids were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Samples were diluted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; 1% Triton X-100; 10% glycerol; 100 mm NaCl; and 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). Samples were then reacted with GST fusion proteins at various concentrations, and the bound proteins were centrifuged using glutathione-Sepharose beads washed and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. COOH-terminally derived peptide inhibition studies were performed by incubating the GST fusion protein binding reactions in the presence of 10 μg/ml of the indicated peptides. Peptides were produced by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids as described previously (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In vivo interactions between various forms of PTP HSCF and PST PIP were also performed as described previously (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS cells were transfected with various constructs; after 48 h, lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to either the FLAG epitope contained at the COOH terminus of PST PIP or a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope contained at the NH2 terminus of PTP HSCF. The resultant blots were probed with anti-FLAG to detect PST PIP, anti-HA to detect PTP HSCF, or anti-phosphotyrosine to detect levels of this modified amino acid in each protein. COS cells were transfected with a constant amount of either the wild-type or W232A mutant of PST PIP and cotransfected with increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding the v-Src tyrosine kinase (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Plasmid concentrations were equalized with an empty vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. After 48 h, lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Precipitates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and probed with either anti-FLAG antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described previously (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. PST PIP was originally isolated as a binding partner of the PEST-type PTP, PTP HSCF, in a yeast two-hybrid screen (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the clones isolated in this procedure began within 10–15 amino acids of the NH2 terminus of PST PIP, consistent with the proposal that the NH2 terminus was critical for binding to PTP HSCF. To examine this possibility, deletions of 25 (Δ25), 50 (Δ50), and 75 (Δ75) amino acids of the NH2 terminus of the PST PIP coiled-coil domain were created. These deletion mutants were produced by in vitro transcription/translation, and they were tested for binding to a GST fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal 149 amino acids of PTP HSCF, including the proline-rich PST PIP binding site (GST-PTP HSCF). As Fig. 1illustrates, the full-length and Δ25 forms of PST PIP were capable of interacting with the GST-PTP HSCF fusion protein, whereas the Δ50 and Δ75 forms were not. This lack of binding might have been caused either by a deletion of the actual binding site or by a misfolding of the protein. Transfection of either the full-length (Fig.2) or coiled-coil domain 2Y. Wu and L. Lasky, unpublished observations. of PST PIP results in colocalization of the proteins with the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the lamellipodia, an event that presumably requires a protein that is folded correctly. Thus, the analysis of the cellular localization of mutant forms of PST PIP can be utilized as an assay for correct folding of the protein. Fig. 2 illustrates that both the wild-type and Δ25 forms of PST PIP colocalized predominantly with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, whereas the Δ50 and Δ75 forms of the protein both formed large aggregates within the cytoplasm and showed no cortical localization, consistent with the hypothesis that these deletion mutants were folded improperly. These data are consistent with the results of the original two-hybrid assay, and they suggest that the NH2 terminus of PST PIP is required for the formation of a correctly folded protein that is capable of binding to PTP HSCF.Figure 2Confocal laser scanning microscopy of various forms of PST PIP expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with plasmids expressing various forms of PST PIP, and the cells were subsequently stained with a rhodamine-conjugated monoclonal antibody directed against a PST PIP COOH-terminal FLAG epitope.

Panel E, PST PIP with an alanine replacement mutation at tryptophan 232.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To define more accurately the binding site within the PST PIP coiled-coil domain, a collection of cluster and point mutations was produced within this domain. Preliminary deletion mapping suggested that binding of PTP HSCF could be obtained with a form of PST PIP containing amino acids 1–264 of the coiled-coil domain, 3D. Dowbenko and L. Lasky, unpublished data. and the mutagenesis was thus confined to this region of the protein. Because protein folding appeared to be critical for the binding of PTP HSCF (Figs. 1 and 2), all 6 cysteine residues within this part of the protein were mutated to serines, and the resultant mutants were tested for interaction with the PTP HSCF GST fusion protein. The elimination of individual cysteine residues did not appear to affect the binding of these two proteins, suggesting that the protein could fold and function appropriately in the absence of individual cysteines (data not shown). Further mutational analysis of PST PIP was thus performed to identify a region(s) that was potentially directly involved with PTP HSCF binding. Clustered alanine substitutions were produced at approximately 12-amino acid intervals throughout the PST PIP coiled-coil domain, and each mutant was tested subsequently for binding to the GST-PTP HSCF fusion protein. Mutation of residue clusters L26QR, D38VE, E50ER, R62K, R73TS, N86VG, R99EE, E110RQ, I122MD, L133YK, D145QK, E159RV, Q169VE, E184S, and R194QN individually to alanine resulted in either no or a minor change in the binding activity of these two proteins in vitro (data not shown). However, Fig.3 illustrates that the mutation of the tryptophan residue at position 232 of PST PIP to alanine resulted in a complete loss of binding to the GST-PTP HSCF fusion protein in vitro. Additionally, Fig. 4 shows that cotransfection of wild-type PST PIP together with PTP HSCF into COS cells resulted in in vivo association of the proteins, as described previously (20Spencer S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas cotransfection of the W232A mutant of PST PIP resulted in a complete lack of in vivoassociation, consistent with the in vitro binding studies. As expected, this mutant nonbinding form of PST PIP could no longer be “substrate trapped” (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J.

Thus, whereas the wild-type PST PIP showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of a dominant negative substrate trapping form of PTP HSCF (PTP HSCF C-S) (20Spencer S. Dowbenko D.

Because previous results suggested that tryptophan, aromatic, and hydrophobic residues are involved with the recognition of proline-rich domains when found appropriately spaced together in the context of other residues in WW-type domains (12Macias M.

This examination revealed that Trp232 is 27 amino acids COOH-terminal to another tryptophan at position 205. In addition, a phenylalanine (Phe221) and leucine (Leu224) residue also occur near the Trp232 residue with a spacing that is reminiscent of the WW motif (11Andre B. Springael J. Biochem. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2036591609,"Previously, we have shown that prolactin inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced mitogenesis in mouse mammary epithelial cells without altering the response to other growth promoting agents. This effect has been associated with reduced EGF-induced EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation, Grb-2 association, and Ras activation. Our current hypothesis is that prolactin induces an alteration in EGFR kinase activity via a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we treated normal murine mammary gland cells with or without 100 ng/ml prolactin. EGFR isolated by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography from nontreated cells exhibited substantial ligand-induced phosphorylation, and EGFR isolated from prolactin-treated cells displayed minimal EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, as well as decreased kinase activity toward exogenous substrates. The observed decrease in ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation could not be attributed to either differential amounts of EGFR, decreased EGF binding affinity, or the presence of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase or ATPase. EGFR isolated from prolactin-treated cells exhibited increased phosphorylation on threonine. Removal of this phosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase restored EGFR kinase activity to levels observed in nontreated cells. Therefore, these results suggest that prolactin antagonizes EGF signaling by increasing EGFR threonine phosphorylation and decreasing EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1976879089,"We examined the mechanism(s) by which the progesterone receptor (PR) is able to inhibit glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter in vivo. Using specific hormone antagonists, we demonstrate that the PR complexed with an type II antiprogestin blocks glucocorticoid-induced activation of the MMTV promoter. However, when complexed with a type I antiprogestin the PR is unable to block glucocorticoid-induced activation. PR repression of GR activity results from the inhibition of the ability of the GR to remodel chromatin such that the antiprogestin-occupied/PR prevents the glucocorticoid induced assembly of a preinitiation complex at MMTV promoter. These experiments suggest that the specific chromatin organization of the MMTV promoter provides a mechanism for regulating cross-talk between the GR and PR in vivo."

About a dozen naturally occurring mutations that affect lipid metabolism in mice have been described (1Reue K. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1387-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, the mutant genes have not yet been cloned. One such mutation, adrenocortical lipid depletion (ald), 1The abbreviations used are: ald, adrenocortical lipid depletion; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; Acact, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase mouse gene; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPTLC, high-performance thin-layer chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. is expressed as a recessive trait in inbred AKR mice and was first described in 1955 by Arnesen (2Arnesen K. Acta Endocrinol. 1955; 18: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Arnesen K. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. Suppl. 1974; 248: 15-19PubMed Google Scholar). The ald phenotype is characterized by spontaneous lipid depletion in the zona fasciculata at the time of sexual maturation (2Arnesen K.

The lipid depletion results from a loss of cholesterol esters, which are normally abundant in the adrenocortical cells, but not of free cholesterol or triacylglycerols. In male ald/ald mice, the lipid depletion is nearly total and appears to be androgen-dependent (5Molne K. Brabrand G. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1968; 72: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Maleald/ald mice younger than 30 days have normal adrenocortical lipid content, but cholesterol ester stores are rapidly lost between 30 and 40 days, and the depletion is essentially complete by 50 days (5Molne K. Brabrand G. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1968; 72: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In female mice, the lipid depletion is subtotal and variable (4Arnesen K. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1963; 58: 212-218Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Prepubertal orchiectomy prevents the aldphenotype in male AKR mice, and the phenotype has been reversed by postpubertal orchiectomy (6Doering C.H. Shire J.G.M. Kessler S. Clayton R.B. Biochem. Genet. 1973; 8: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or by the administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (2Arnesen K.

The aldlocus was mapped to chromosome 1 in 1976 (8Taylor B.A. Meier H. Genet. Res. 1976; 26: 307-312Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The DBA/2 strain is characterized by a similar adrenocortical lipid depletion phenotype, which appears to be due to a different genetic locus (6Doering C.H. Shire J.G.M. Kessler S. Clayton R.B.

These observations prompted us to ask whether ald results from an Acact mutation. In the current study, we examined whether ald andAcact are allelic through genetic crosses of AKR andAcact−/− mice and by molecular analysis of theAcact mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity levels in AKR mice. The results indicate that ald is indeed due to a naturally occurring mutant Acact allele but that theald protein is capable of catalyzing cholesterol esterification normally. This finding suggests that the expression of the adrenocortical cholesterol ester depletion phenotype in AKR mice is caused by an altered susceptibility of the mutant protein to modifying influences. All inbred strains including AKR were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Acact−/− mice (9Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J.

Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility operating on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed rodent chow (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Colocalization ofald and Acact was confirmed by typing microsatellite markers flanking a small region of chromosome 1 presumed to contain both loci. For Acact, a ((C57BL/6J ×Mus spretus)F1 × C57BL/6J) interspecific backcross mapping panel (15Warden C.H. Mehrabian M. He K.-Y. Yoon M.-Y. Diep A. Xia Y.-R. Wen P.-Z. Svenson K.L. Sparkes R.S.

Map positions were determined by minimizing the number of double and multiple recombination events. These mapping data have been deposited in the Mouse Genome Data Base (accession number MGD-JNUM-42073). For neutral lipid staining, adrenal glands were perfusion fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in Tyrode's solution, dissected from surrounding tissues, and frozen. Vibratome-cut sections were subsequently stained with Oil Red O (18Coalson R.E. Clark G. Staining Procedures. 4th Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1981: 228-229Google Scholar). For chromatographic analysis, lipids were extracted from adrenal gland homogenates with the Bligh-Dyer method (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar), and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) was performed as described (20Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 215-242Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4). An equal volume of homogenization buffer containing 10% SDS was then added to protein aliquots (final concentration, 5% SDS); the samples were heated to 65 °C for 20 min, and protein aliquots were size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10% gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nylon membranes and immunoblotted with a rabbit antiserum generated against a glutathioneS-transferase/mouse ACAT fusion protein containing the amino-terminal 120 residues of the mouse ACAT protein (21.Meiner, V., Tam, C., Gunn, M.

PCR conditions were 28 cycles, each of 30 s at 96 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced directly with an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Adrenal glands were homogenized in 0.1 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 40 mm KH2PO4, and 30 mmEDTA (pH 7.4) with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After removal of intact cells and nuclei by centrifugation of homogenates at 600 ×g for 10 min, total membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g pellet). The rate of incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (Amersham Corp.) into cholesterol esters was assayed essentially as described by Ericksonet al. (25Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 5 min with 100–150 μg of protein homogenate and 25 μmoleoyl-CoA (specific activity, ∼18 mCi/mmol). Exogenous cholesterol (20 nmol) was added to the reaction by preincubating membranes for 30 min at 37 °C with phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol (4:1 molar ratio) liposomes. In some experiments, exogenous cholesterol was provided as an acetone solution. ACAT-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-(AC29) cells (provided by Dr. T. Y. Chang, Dartmouth University, Hanover, NH) were transfected with pcDNA3 mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing the wild-type human, wild-type mouse, or AKR mouse (ald) ACAT cDNAs. DNA vectors (1 μg) were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) into equivalent amounts of cells (4 × 105) plated on 6-well dishes. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and homogenized in the buffer described above using a syringe and 10 passes through a 25-gauge needle. Total membranes (excluding nuclei) were isolated, and immunoblotting and cholesterol esterification assays were performed as described above. We previously mapped Acact to a region of mouse chromosome 1 (13Welch C.L. Xia Y.-R. Shechter I. Farese R. Mehrabian M. Mehdizadeh S. Warden C.H. Lusis A.J. J.

The segregation pattern ofAcact exhibited no recombination with D1Mit14 orD1Mit33 among 62 or 55 backcross progeny, respectively.ald was localized proximal to D1Mit33 but within the 95% confidence interval for the location of Acact, indicating that the Acact and ald loci were indistinguishable as determined within the resolution of these genetic markers. To determine whether Acact and ald were allelic, we performed two genetic experiments designed to test whether theald locus would complement the Acact− locus. We crossed Acact−/− mice (mixed C57BL/6 and 129/Sv background) with ald/ald (AKR) mice and assessed the adrenal neutral lipid content in Oil Red O-stained adrenal sections of male postpubertal F1 offspring. WhereasAcact+/+ and Acact+/− control male mice had abundant neutral lipids in their adrenal cortex, male postpubertal F1 offspring (carrying one ald and oneAcact− allele) exhibited marked adrenocortical lipid depletion, similar to that in Acact−/− controls (Fig.2 A). In a separate experiment, we crossed Acact+/− mice with ald/aldmice and analyzed the adrenal gland cholesterol ester content of the postpubertal male F1 offspring by HPTLC. All F1offspring that carried an Acact− allele and anald allele had marked cholesterol ester depletion (Fig.2 B), similar to that observed in Acact−/− controls and less than that observed in ald/aldcontrols. In contrast, control littermate F1 offspring carrying an Acact+ allele and an ald allele had cholesterol ester levels equivalent to or greater than that inAcact+/− controls (Fig. 2 B). The failure of theald allele to complement the Acact− allele in both experiments indicated that the two loci were allelic. Immunoblotting of preputial gland homogenates from adult male mice of 10 inbred strains demonstrated that the Acact protein from AKR mice migrated at a lower molecular mass (∼42 kDa) on SDS-PAGE than the ∼45-kDa protein in the other mouse strains (Fig.3 A). Similarly, a protein of reduced molecular mass was observed in adrenal gland homogenates from male and female AKR mice and in ovary homogenates from female AKR mice (not shown). Quantitative analysis of the Acact protein in adrenal homogenates of AKR mice demonstrated that its levels in males and females were reduced to ∼33 and ∼46%, respectively, of the levels in male control (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv) mice (Fig.3 B). Northern blotting of RNA from the preputial glands of adult AKR mice revealed that the Acact mRNA was less abundant and slightly smaller than that of control mice (Fig.4 A). Similar findings were observed in RNA samples from kidney and testes of AKR mice (data not shown). Because the immunoblotting and Northern blotting experiments suggested that the ald protein may be truncated, we examined the cDNA sequences of the Acact mRNA and observed several differences as compared with the wild-type AcactcDNA (14Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26192-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Initial 5′-RACE experiments followed by cDNA sequencing demonstrated that the ald cDNA contained a 118-bp deletion spanning part of the 5′ untranslated region and the initial coding sequences (cDNA nucleotides 790–897 (14Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26192-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). To further investigate this finding, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments using primers located on either side of the deleted region (Fig. 4 B). Whereas a 312-bp wild-type product was consistently amplified from cDNA of control mice, a 194-bp product (reflecting the 118-bp deletion) was amplified from all tissues tested of both male and female AKR mice; the 194-bp product was also observed at very low levels in the cDNA from the control mice. DNA sequencing of this amplification product demonstrated that it lacked the identical 118 bp identified in the 5′-RACE experiments. DNA sequencing from C57BL/6 genomic DNA revealed that the 118 bp deleted in the ald cDNA corresponded to an exon containing the AUG translation initiation codon. In addition to the deleted sequences, theald cDNA contained two missense mutations: A → G at cDNA nucleotide 1248, resulting in Ile → Val at amino acid 147; and C → T at nucleotide 1422, resulting in His → Tyr at amino acid 205. Several other nucleotide differences were observed (A → G at position 917, A → G at 971, and A → C at 1232) that did not result in amino acid coding differences. To determine whether the protein product of the ald allele could esterify cholesterol, we performed cholesterol esterification activity assays on adrenal membranes harvested from AKR mice and controls. The adrenal membranes from adult male AKR mice had activity levels (121 ± 11 pmol/mg protein/min) similar to those of membranes from wild-type control (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv) male mice (111 ± 17 pmol/mg protein/min) and much greater than those ofAcact−/− controls (3.8 ± 0.5 pmol/mg protein/min) (Fig. 5 A). Membranes from female AKR mice exhibited ∼3–4-fold greater activity (351 ± 171 pmol/mg protein/min) than those from male mice (consistent with the higher cholesterol ester in adrenal glands of female mice (26Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)). Because these assays were performed at V max, with saturating concentrations of cholesterol substrate (20 nmol), we hypothesized that the activity levels of the ald protein might be altered at lower substrate concentrations owing to altered affinity of the protein for cholesterol substrate. We therefore analyzed activity levels of postpubertal male AKR adrenal membranes in response to various concentrations of cholesterol. At each cholesterol concentration tested, however, the cholesterol esterification activity in membranes from AKR mice was equal to or greater than that of wild-type control membranes (Fig. 5 B). To confirm that the protein expressed by the ald allele could catalyze cholesterol esterification, we transiently expressedald and wild-type Acact cDNAs in cultured ACAT-deficient (AC29) CHO cells (27Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measured cholesterol esterification activity in membrane homogenates. The transfection of the ald cDNA resulted in the expression of anAcact protein of lower molecular mass than that obtained with wild-type cDNAs, confirming the results of the immunoblot experiments in tissues from AKR mice. Membranes prepared from cells transfected with ald cDNA catalyzed cholesterol esterification at levels much greater than membranes of untransfected cells and similar to that of membranes from cells transfected with wild-type cDNA (Fig. 6). Normal cholesterol esterification activity was also observed in a pulse cholesterol esterification assay performed on intact transfected AC29 cells (data not shown). ald, a naturally occurring mutation in the AKR inbred mouse strain, is associated with cholesterol ester depletion in the adrenal cortex, which becomes manifest at the time of sexual maturation (3Arnesen K. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. Suppl. 1974; 248: 15-19PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we provide genetic and molecular evidence indicating that ald is associated with a naturally occurring mutant Acact allele. The AKR strain carries mutations at theAcact locus that result in an amino-terminal deletion in theAcact protein and two amino acid changes compared with the wild-type protein. Despite these differences, the ACAT protein from theald allele catalyzed cholesterol esterification at levels similar to that of the wild-type protein. This finding suggests that the adrenocortical cholesterol ester depletion phenotype due to theald mutation results from an altered susceptibility of the mutant ald protein to modifying influences present in vivo. Two lines of genetic evidence from our studies indicate thatald and Acact are allelic. First, refined genetic mapping demonstrated colocalization of the two loci to the same region of chromosome 1. Second, a cross between Acact−/− and AKR (ald/ald) mice demonstrated a lack of complementation between the ald and Acact− alleles with regard to adrenocortical lipid depletion in male postpubertal mice. Male postpubertal F1 offspring from this cross with an ald/− genotype were characterized by cholesterol ester depletion in the adrenal cortex. If aldand Acact were alleles of different loci, then this cross would result in heterozygosity at each locus (i.e. Acact+/− and ald/+), and male postpubertal offspring would be expected to have abundant cholesterol esters in the adrenal cortex at levels similar those in Acact+/− mice or +/aldmice. The fact that DNA from AKR mice could not correct the adrenocortical lipid depletion caused by the Acact− allele provides near-definitive evidence that the ald mutation results from a mutant Acact allele. The RNA and immunoblot analyses demonstrate clearly that theald allele results in the production of a mutantAcact protein. Of 10 inbred strains surveyed, anAcact protein of lower molecular mass was found only in the AKR strain. The analysis of Acact cDNA from AKR mice demonstrated that the truncated Acact protein lacks the first coding exon containing the AUG translation initiation codon. Further experiments will be necessary to identify the genomic mutation that leads to the missing exon. The lack of this exon in theald mRNA results in an amino-terminal deletion of at least the first 30 amino acids of the Acact protein. We hypothesize that translation of the Acact protein from theald mRNA begins at the AUG codon at amino acid 34; this AUG is in the correct reading frame and is located in a Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation (28Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, the expression of the ald cDNA in cultured cells resulted in a truncated protein of identical molecular mass to that observed in tissues from AKR mice. The mutant protein was detected at lower levels than the wild-type Acact protein by immunoblotting, both in homogenates from male and female AKR mice and in cultured cells expressing equal amounts of wild-type or mutantAcact cDNAs. These immunoblot results may truly reflect lower levels of the ald protein, possibly due to a lower rate of translation originating from the alternate AUG start codon. However, it is also possible that the amino-terminal deletion in theald protein resulted in altered reactivity of this truncated protein with the polyclonal antiserum (which recognizes epitopes at the amino terminus of ACAT) and that the immunoblotting data reflect this difference. Despite the alterations, the ald protein catalyzed cholesterol esterification at levels equivalent to or greater than those of the wild-type Acact protein. This finding was observed both in adrenal tissues from adult male and female postpubertal AKR mice and in cultured cells expressing the mutant protein. Similar findings indicating that the ald protein can catalyze cholesterol esterification have been observed in pulse assays of cultured peritoneal macrophages from AKR mice. 2I. Tabas, personal communication. We observed normal or supranormal activity levels in assays carried out both atV max and at a range of cholesterol substrate concentrations. Thus, it is clear that the ald protein can catalyze cholesterol esterification, at least under the conditions utilized in our experiments. These data provide important structure-function information indicating that the Acactprotein can still catalyze cholesterol esterification at normal levels despite an amino-terminal truncation (likely of 33 amino acids) and the amino acid changes at residues 147 and 205. Although this finding was somewhat surprising given the cholesterol ester depletion phenotype, it was not totally unexpected, inasmuch as the adrenal glands of AKR mice contain normal levels of cholesterol esters before sexual maturation. It is possible that the ald protein is associated with reduced ACAT activity in intact male AKR adrenal glands and that we were unable to reproduce the conditions or modifying factors that inhibit the activity in adrenal glands in our in vitroassays. How does the ald allele contribute to cholesterol ester depletion at the time of puberty? The answers to this question are largely speculative. It is clear that alterations of different proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism can cause adrenocortical lipid depletion. Phenotypes of adrenocortical lipid depletion have been observed for knockouts of Acact (9Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J.

Biochem. Genet. 1973; 8: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) mice. In contrast to the cholesterol ester depletion in both male and female Acact−/− and Apoa1−/− mice, however, the ald phenotype in AKR and DBA/2 mice is conditional and is manifested only in the presence of modifying influences, such as androgen production at the time of puberty. Supporting the hypothesis that adrenocortical lipid depletion can result from the interactions of different factors, preliminary studies in DBA/2 mice suggest that the primary defect is not due to theAcact locus and that at least two loci are responsible for the phenotype. 3C. Welch, unpublished observations. In AKR mice, we speculate that an increase in androgens affects or interacts with the ability of the ald protein to esterify cholesterol or to facilitate the storage of cholesterol esters. One possibility is that the amino-terminal deletion in the ald protein affects protein-protein interactions or the localization of the aldprotein in intracellular compartments or in cell membranes and that these alterations influence the susceptibility of the protein to androgen-associated factors. Identifying factors that modulate the adrenocortical lipid depletion phenotype could provide a better understanding of cholesterol metabolism in adrenocortical cells and intracellular cholesterol metabolic pathways.

To examine glycan remodeling of cell surface glycoproteins, high mannose-type glycoforms were generated by adding the reversible mannosidase I inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin during metabolic labeling with [3H]mannose, thereby preventing further processing of high mannose-type N-glycans to complex structures. Upon transport to the cell surface, glycoproteins were additionally labeled with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. This strategy allowed us to follow selectively the fate of cell surface glycoproteins. Postbiosynthetic demannosylation was monitored by determining the conversion of Man8–9GlcNAc2 to smaller structures during reculture of cells in the absence of deoxymannojirimycin. The results show that high mannose-typeN-glycans of selected cell surface glycoproteins are trimmed from Man8–9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 with Man7GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2 formed as intermediates. It could be clearly shown in MH 7777 as well as in HepG2 cells that demannosylation affects plasma membrane glycoproteins after they are routed to the cell surface. As was determined for total cell surface glycoproteins in HepG2 cells, this process occurs with a half-time of 6.7 h. By analyzing the size of high mannose-type glycans of glycoproteins isolated from the cell surface at the end of the reculture period, i.e. after trimming had occurred, we were able to demonstrate that glycoproteins carrying trimmed high mannose glycans become exposed at the cell surface. From these data we conclude that cell surface glycoproteins can be trimmed by mannosidases at sites peripheral to N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I without further processing of their glycans to the complex form. This glycan remodeling may occur at the cell surface or during endocytosis and recycling back to the cell surface.

This glycan remodeling may occur at the cell surface or during endocytosis and recycling back to the cell surface. During their maturation, N-linked glycans of secretory and membrane glycoproteins undergo extensive processing by specific glycosidases and glycosyltransferases in the ER, 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ConA, concanavalin A; dMM, 1-deoxymannojirimycin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPPIV, dipeptidyl peptidase IV; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; HPAE, high performance anion exchange; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PNGase F, peptideN 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F; TfR, transferrin receptor; TGN,trans-Golgi network; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ConA, concanavalin A; dMM, 1-deoxymannojirimycin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPPIV, dipeptidyl peptidase IV; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; HPAE, high performance anion exchange; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PNGase F, peptideN 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F; TfR, transferrin receptor; TGN,trans-Golgi network; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the Golgi complex, and the TGN (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kornfeld R.

The sequence of processing events includes trimming of the precursor oligosaccharide, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, by glucosidases I and II and by distinct α1,2-mannosidases to form Man5GlcNAc2. Several of the processing mannosidases have been described (for reviews, see Refs. 4Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) such as ER mannosidases and Golgi mannosidase IA/IB. Following the action ofN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and Golgi mannosidase II, the transfer of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine,d-galactose, l-fucose, and sialic acids by an array of glycosyltransferases generates the wide variety of oligosaccharide structures found on mature glycoproteins. Several lines of evidence suggest that oligosaccharide processing of cell surface glycoproteins is not restricted to biosynthesis but may also occur after the initial passage through the compartments of the secretory pathway to the cell surface (for a review, see Ref. 6Tauber R. Kreisel W. Reutter W. Courtoy P.J. Endocytosis. Springer, Heidelberg1992: 187-194Crossref Google Scholar). First, measurements of the turnover rates of the different sugar residues of glycoproteins isolated from rat liver plasma membranes have shown that these turnover kinetics are distinctly influenced by the position of each sugar within the N-linked oligosaccharides (7Kreisel W.

The half-lives of the terminal or penultimate sugars,l-fucose, sialic acid, and d-galactose, are only 16 to 13 as long as that of the protein backbone. From these studies it has been proposed that terminal sugar residues may be removed from the nonreducing end of the N-glycans of plasma membrane glycoproteins. In distinct plasma membrane glycoproteins, even mannose residues were lost from the glycoproteins (11Tauber R. Park C.S. Becker A. Geyer R. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Second, studies designed to examine the return of surface receptors to compartments of the secretory pathway have demonstrated that selected cell surface glycoproteins may also acquire terminal sugars, l-fucose, and sialic acid when recycling to fucosyl- and sialyltransferases in the medial/trans-Golgi and in the TGN (12Duncan J.R.

In Chinese hamster ovary cells, the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor has been reported to recycle even to galactosyltransferases in the trans-Golgi region (19Huang K.M. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9302-9310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that reglycosylation might serve as a repair mechanism for surface glycoproteins trimmed by glycosidases encountered on the cell surface or during endocytosis and recycling and that cell surface glycoproteins may pass several rounds of de- and reglycosylation (15Kreisel W.

Cambridge University Press, New York1991: 361-386Google Scholar). However, as compared with recycling to glycosyltransferases, far less is known about postbiosynthetic trimming of cell surface glycoproteins by glycosidases. In an important study, Snider and Rogers (21Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1986; 103: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TfR and glycoproteins from the total cellular protein pool may return to mannosidase I in the early Golgi region in K 562 cells. This was shown in that cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mannose in the presence of the reversible mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM). Glycoproteins synthesized under these conditions retained immature oligomannosidicN-glycans during their initial transport through the Golgi complex. A return to early Golgi mannosidase I and a subsequent passage through peripheral Golgi elements was noticed by trimming of the immature oligomannosidic N-glycans and conversion to complex-type structures during reculture of cells in the absence of dMM. Employing this experimental strategy, a return to early Golgi mannosidase I was also shown for the cation-dependent and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor in BW 5147 mouse lymphoma cells (12Duncan J.R. Kornfeld S. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It was calculated that glycoproteins recycle to mannosidase I at very low rates with half-times of 12 h for the total glycoprotein pool in K562 cells (19Huang K.M. Snider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9302-9310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ∼20 h for both mannose 6-phosphate receptors in BW 5147 cells (12Duncan J.R. Kornfeld S. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 106: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In none of these studies, however, was a return to Golgi mannosidase I examined by a sample of glycoproteins that had been covalently labeled on the cell surface beforehand. Hence, it could not be distinguished whether glycoproteins trimmed by early Golgi mannosidase I recycled from the cell surface or from other post-Golgi locations such as the TGN, secretory vesicles, endosomes, or lysosomes or even represented, in the case of the total glycoprotein pool, at least partly glycoproteins resident in the Golgi complex. Moreover, it remained unknown whether glycoproteins return to the cell surface after reentering the early Golgi. A recent study designed to examine the transport of TfR and DPPIV from the cell surface to compartments of the secretory pathway in HepG2 cells showed that oligomannosidic N-glycans of these two glycoproteins were not converted to complex structures during recycling (18Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.P. Tauber R. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In accordance with this finding, Neefjes et al. (22Neefjes J.J. Verkerk J.M. Broxterman H.J. van D.M.G. van B.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 107: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) failed to detect conversion of oligomannosidic to complex-type glycans on recycling glycoproteins including TfR and HLA class II antigens in different cell lines, indicating that these proteins do not encounter mannosidase I in the early Golgi (i.e. at sites proximal toN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I). This enzyme is localized in medial Golgi elements (23Dunphy W.G. Brands R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1985; 40: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and initiates the further processing of the oligomannosidic trimming intermediate Man5GlcNAc2 to complex-type oligosaccharides. In a recent immunohistochemical study, however, mannosidase I was found to be less compartmentalized than previously assumed and was also detected in the medial and the trans-Golgi and, in some cell types, even in the TGN, in secretory vesicles, and in the plasma membrane (24Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Hence, it became conceivable that cell surface glycoproteins could return to mannosidase I also at sites peripheral toN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, resulting in trimming of oligomannosidic glycans without further processing to complexN-glycans. In that case, membrane glycoproteins retaining trimmed oligomannosidic glycans might return to the plasma membrane and become exposed on the cell surface. In the present paper, this assumption was examined in two hepatoma cell lines and primary rat hepatocytes by a sample of cell surface glycoproteins of well defined function, i.e. the TfR, the serine peptidase DPPIV, the cell adhesion molecule gp110/cell-CAM105 (25Becker A. Lucka L. Kilian C. Kannicht C. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (a member of the Ig superfamily), and LI-cadherin (26Berndorff D. Gessner R. Kreft B. Schnoy N. Lajous P.A. Loch N. Reutter W. Hortsch M. Tauber R. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1353-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (a member of the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules). Using a strategy based on the experimental design initially described by Snider and Rogers (21Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. J. Cell. Biol. 1986; 103: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), in conjunction with covalent labeling of cell surface glycoproteins with NHS-SS-biotin, it was determined whether plasma membrane glycoproteins might be trimmed by mannosidases after transport to the cell surface. Moreover, to examine whether subsequently glycoproteins carrying trimmed oligomannosidicN-glycans are exposed on the cell surface, glycoproteins were allowed to encounter mannosidases and were, thereafter, isolated selectively from the cell surface. In this report, we present evidence that N-glycans of selected cell surface glycoproteins are postbiosynthetically trimmed from Man8–9GlcNAc2 to Man5–7GlcNAc2. Following demannosylation, glycoproteins carrying trimmed oligomannosidic structures become exposed on the cell surface, indicating that demannosylation occurs at sites peripheral to N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, either at the cell surface or during endocytosis and recycling back to the cell surface.

The rat hepatoma cell line MH 7777 derived from Morris hepatoma 7777 was described previously (30Neumeier R. Dethlefs U. Reutter W. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated according to the procedure of Seglen (31Seglen P.O. Methods Cell. Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar) at a minimum viability of 80–90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were seeded on collagen I-coated plastic dishes. Hepatocytes and hepatoma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), insulin (0.08 milliunits/ml), dexamethasone (1 μm), and 10% (v/v) complement-inactivated horse serum in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described (32Loch N. Tauber R. Becker A. Hartel S.S. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (33Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were cultured as described (18Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.P. Tauber R. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Confluent layers of cells were trypsinized and seeded on collagen I-coated dishes (50-mm diameter). Cells were allowed to adhere overnight. For labeling in the polypeptide moiety, the monolayers were washed and preincubated for 60 min in DMEM without l-methionine/l-cysteine. The cells were pulse-labeled for 4 h withl-[35S]methionine/l-[35S]cysteine (5.5 Mbq/3 × 106 cells) and then chased for 3 h in DMEM with 1 mm unlabeledl-methionine/l-cysteine. When used, 3 mm dMM was present during the preincubation, pulse, and chase periods. For labeling of glycoproteins in the oligosaccharide moiety, cells were washed, preincubated for 60 min in the presence of 3 mm dMM, and then labeled for 8 h withd-[2,6-3H]mannose (14.8 Mbq/6 × 106 cells) in glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 3 mm dMM, 5 mmd-galactose, and 10 mm pyruvate. Cells were then washed and chased for 3 h in the presence of 3 mm dMM. Cell surface proteins were labeled with NHS-SS-biotin essentially as described (18Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.P. Tauber R. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After cooling on ice, cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ (PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2) and incubated with a freshly prepared solution of NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml) in PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and twice with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+ and were then either recultured or harvested for further analysis. The following steps were carried out at 4 °C. After washing with PBS/Ca2+/Mg2+, cells were solubilized for 2 h in lysis buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatants were precleared by incubation with 100 mg of Sepharose-4B for 2 h. The Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation and discarded. For immunoaffinity absorption, 20 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody (De 13.4, Lo 47.2, or 188 A2) coupled to 8 mg of protein A-Sepharose was added to the supernatant and rotated end-over-end for 4 h. Immunocomplexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with washing buffer B (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40), twice with washing buffer C (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and finally with PBS. Immunoaffinity absorption of gp110/cell-CAM105 with a polyclonal antibody was performed as described previously (25Becker A. Lucka L. Kilian C. Kannicht C. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were eluted by heating (95 °C) for 3 min with 50 μl of SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (4% SDS, 28.6% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue). If not otherwise stated, electrophoresis was performed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Gels with35S-labeled samples were processed and fluorographed as described (35Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar) using Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Cells were extracted as detailed above with lysis buffer A, which additionally contained 10 mml-lysine (lysis buffer B). A cellular glycoprotein fraction was prepared from detergent extracts by binding to ConA-Sepharose. For this purpose, ConA-Sepharose (0.5 g of ConA-Sepharose/5 mg of protein) was added to the detergent extract and slowly shaken at 4 °C for 12 h. ConA-Sepharose was then pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times in lysis buffer B. Bound glycoproteins were eluted with 200 mmα-methylmannopyranoside in lysis buffer B. Biotinylated cell surface glycoproteins were then isolated from this cellular glycoprotein fraction by binding to streptavidin-agarose. Streptavidin-agarose (100 μg/mg of protein) was added, and the mixture was shaken at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing five times in lysis buffer A, biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling for 3 min in 100 μl of 0.4% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol. Biotinylated DPPIV was isolated as described previously (18Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.P. Tauber R. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was immunoadsorbed from detergent extracts and eluted from protein A-Sepharose with 3 m KSCN, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Eluates were diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and streptavidin-agarose was added. The suspension was shaken at 4 °C for 4 h; washed four times in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 m KSCN; washed twice in the same buffer without KSCN; and washed once with PBS. Biotinylated DPPIV bound to streptavidin-agarose was eluted by boiling for 3 min in 100 μl of 0.4% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol. Immunoabsorbed glycoproteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose by boiling for 3 min in 0.4% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA. Biotinylated proteins bound to streptavidin-agarose were eluted with the same buffer (100 μl per 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose). Before the addition of the glycosidases, all samples were diluted 4-fold in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer. The diluted samples were cleared by centrifugation followed by the addition of a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, pepstatin) each at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Treatment with 10 milliunits of Endo H from Streptomyces plicatus (EC 3.2.1.96) was performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 20 h at 37 °C. Treatment with PNGase F (EC 3.2.2.18) fromFlavobacterium meningosepticum was performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 1% (v/v) decanoyl-N-methylglucamide for 20 h at 37 °C. High mannose-type oligosaccharides were prepared from immunoadsorbed glycoproteins or from biotinylated proteins eluted from streptavidin-agarose as described previously (36Tauber R. Nuck R. Gerok W.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligosaccharides were released from glycoproteins by incubation with Endo H and then separated from proteins by ultrafiltration through Centricon-10 microconcentrators. The filtrates were desalted by mixed bed ion exchange chromatography on a column (0.6 × 10 cm) containing 500 μl of Dowex AG50W-X12 and 500 μl of Dowex AG3-X4. After washing the column with four bed volumes of water, the combined filtrates were dried by evaporation. The oligosaccharides were converted to their corresponding oligosaccharide alditols by reduction with sodium borohydride in 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9.2, for 6 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the dropwise addition of 1 m acetic acid. The solution was adjusted to pH 5.0 and passed through a cation exchange column containing 4 ml of AG 50W-X12. The column was washed with five bed volumes of water, and the combined filtrates were evaporated to dryness at 30 °C. Boric acid was completely removed by 5-fold evaporation with 1 ml of methanol, and traces of acetic acid were removed by drying the oligosaccharides over sodium hydroxide in a desiccator. HPLC separation of the oligosaccharide alditols was performed as described previously (37Nuck R. Paul C. Wieland B. Heidrich C. Geilen C.C. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad model 700 chromatography workstation equipped with two Bischoff (Leonberg, Germany) model 2200 pumps, a Knauer (Berlin, Germany) dynamic mixing chamber, and a Shimadzu fluorescence HPLC monitor RF-535. Briefly, oligosaccharide alditols were separated on two Spherisorb-NH2 columns (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm; Bischoff) equilibrated with a mixture containing 65% acetonitrile and 35% 15 mm sodium dihydrogenphosphate, pH 5.2, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and were eluted by decreasing the proportion of acetonitrile to 45% within 100 min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting using a Tri-Carb 1900 CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Canberra Packard). A mixture of glucose oligomers (n = 1–20), fluorescence-labeled by reductive amination with 8-amino-2-naphthol, was used as an internal standard. Columns were calibrated with authentic oligosaccharide alditols Man5–9GlcNAcOH, prepared from HA2 subunits of influenza virus hemagglutinin by Endo H treatment and NaBH4 reduction after metabolic labeling with d-[2-3H]mannose (38Geyer R.

https://openalex.org/W1966669706,"An alanine to cysteine mutation at position 166 has been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the rabbit sodium/glucose transporter (rSGLT1). When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, this mutant transporter (A166C rSGLT1) demonstrates a significantly lower apparent affinity for α-methyl glucoside (αMG) compared with the wild-type transporter (apparentK m = 0.8 versus 0.15 mm). Using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, transient currents have also been measured, and for the mutant transporter, the transients induced by large depolarizations exhibit longer time constants than those for wild type. Moreover, the substitution of Ala-166 with a cysteine allows the sulfydryl specific reagent, methanethiosulfonate ethylamine (MTSEA), to react with and alter the function of the transporter. Whereas the wild-type transporter is unaffected by reaction with MTSEA, A166C rSGLT1 has its steady-state currents induced by 1 mm αMG inhibited 83% within a minute of exposure to MTSEA. Furthermore, the pre-steady-state transients of the A166C mutant after MTSEA exposure demonstrate much shorter time constants than before while the total amount of charge transferred is only slightly diminished. These results together provide evidence that position 166 is situated in a region critical to the functioning of rSGLT1.

These results together provide evidence that position 166 is situated in a region critical to the functioning of rSGLT1. The sodium/glucose cotransporter is one member of a family of sodium-dependent transport proteins found in the brush border membrane of intestinal and kidney epithelia (1Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It uses the sodium electrochemical gradient to drive the transport of sugar into epithelial cells and is specifically inhibited by phlorizin. Since being cloned in 1987 from a rabbit small intestinal cDNA library (2Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), the high affinity sodium/glucose transporter (SGLT1) 1The abbreviations used are: SGLT1, sodium/glucose transporter; αMG, α-methyl glucoside; MTSEA, methanethiosulfonate ethylamine; MBS, modified Barth's saline; wt, wild type; MTSES, methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase. has been extensively characterized. The expression of SGLT1 in Xenopus laevisoocytes has allowed for the application of electrophysiologic techniques to measure in detail the kinetics of the transporter. The two-electrode voltage clamp method and the cut open oocyte technique have been used to measure the sodium currents mediated by the transporter, and from such measurements, substrate affinities as well as the sodium:glucose coupling stoichiometry have been determined (3Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,4Chen X.Z. Coady M.J. Jackson F. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.Y. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2405-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, electrophysiology has been used to demonstrate that in the absence of sugar or phlorizin, SGLT1 exhibits pre-steady-state currents in response to rapid changes in membrane potential. These transient currents have been hypothesized to be due to charge movements associated with conformational changes of the transporter, and by studying them, estimates have been made of the rate constants for sodium association/dissociation and the reorientation of the empty transporter from an outside facing to inside facing conformation (5Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A number of studies have combined site-directed mutagenesis with the oocyte expression system to identify residues that contribute to the functioning of SGLT1 and its proper trafficking to the plasma membrane (6Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Sampogna S.L. Bok D. Wright E.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A set of glycosylation mutants has yielded information on topology, and a chimera of the high affinity and low affinity isoforms has suggested that sugar binding is determined by the C-terminal half of the protein (8Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Kong C.T. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10029-10034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). From comparisons of SGLT1 homologues cloned from different species, certain residues have been hypothesized to be important in determining the kinetic differences between these isoforms (9Hirayama B.A. Lostao M.P. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Turk E. Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G919-G926PubMed Google Scholar). Direct experimental evidence elucidating specific structure/function relationships is, however, lacking, and the exact residues that make up the substrate binding sites or determine the coupling of sodium binding to glucose transport remain unknown. In this study, we report on the characterization of a single cysteine mutant of rSGLT1 with properties distinct from wild type that was identified during a cysteine scanning mutagenesis project. The alanine at position 166, which was replaced with cysteine to generate this mutant, had not previously been hypothesized to be important, although in one glucose galactose malabsorption patient, it was found mutated to a threonine (10Martin G.M. Turk E. Lostao M.P. Kerner C. Wright E.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Ala-166 is conserved across the rabbit/rat/human isoforms of SGLT1 as well as SGLT2 and the sodium myoinositol transporter. This is not surprising given the high degree of sequence identity for these members of the sodium cotransporter family. What was unexpected was the degree to which some of the steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of the transporter was changed by the relatively conservative alanine to cysteine substitution. To date, there have been no other single-site mutations reported that produce dramatic changes to both the steady-state and transient currents mediated by SGLT1. In addition to the kinetic changes, we also observed that the A166C mutation introduced sensitivity to the cysteine-specific reagent methanethiosulfonate ethylamine (MTSEA). Belonging to a class of compounds known as MTS derivatives, MTSEA has been used in combination with cysteine site-directed mutagenesis in the study of proteins such as ACh receptor channel, GABA receptor channel, lactose permease, and voltage-gated ion channels (11Akabas M.H.

Fu D. Chen J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 692-698PubMed Google Scholar). We present here experimental evidence that such an approach can also be taken with SGLT1, providing unique insight into certain structure/function relationships for this transporter. The multicloning site of the eukaryotic expression vector PMT3 (kindly provided by the Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) was removed by digestion with PstI andKpnI, and the cDNA of rSGLT1 (kindly provided by M. Heidiger) was subcloned into the remaining EcoRI site. The A166C mutation was introduced into this construct using the megaprimer method of polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (15Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with 5′-TCGGAGCCTCTCTGTTTG-3′ as the sense primer, 5′-TACCCAGACAGAATCGAGCCGGCCTT-3′ as the antisense primer, and 5′-GGATGAAGATGCATCCGGAAAAGATG-3′ as the mutagenic primer. These primers were used to make a mutation-containing polymerase chain reaction product that was digested with BclI and then ligated toBclI-digested PMT3-rSGLT1 using a cycle ligation protocol (16Lund A.H. Duch M. Pedersen F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 800-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mutation and the stretch of DNA between the twoBclI sites was verified by dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing using the Pharmacia Biotech Inc. T7 polymerase sequencing kit. The DNA used for the oocyte injections was prepared using the QIAprep Spin Plasmid Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) without further purification. X. laevis frogs were anaesthetized with a 0.17% solution of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester in water. Stage V or VI oocytes were then surgically removed and digested with 2 mg/ml of type IV collagenase (Sigma) prepared in modified Barth's saline (MBS) for 60–90 min. The composition of the MBS was 0.88 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15.0 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.3 mm CaNO3, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mg/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. After the collagenase digestion, oocytes were kept in MBS overnight at 18 °C before being injected with the DNA. Using a Drummond Nanoject (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), 4.7 nl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 0.15 ng of PMT3-rSGLT1 or PMT3-A166C-rSGLT1 and 0.15 ng of PMT3-SEAP was injected into the animal pole of the defolliculated oocytes as described previously by Swick et al. (17Swick A.G. Janicot M. Chenval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The injected oocytes were kept in MBS supplemented with 2.5 mmsodium pyruvate for 2–3 days before transfer to 96-well plates and incubation individually another 16–24 h. The incubation solution from each oocyte was then tested for alkaline phosphatase activity following the protocol of Tate et al. (18Tate S.S. Urade R. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Udenfriend S.

Oocytes that were positive according to this assay were then selected for the electrophysiology that was conducted over the next 2 days. In all experiments, the oocyte currents were measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (19Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Assoc. Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). We used an Axoclamp-2A amplifier, TL-2 data acquisition system, and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) to generate voltage pulses and measure the current responses. Oocytes with resting membrane potentials less negative than −30 mV were discarded. During an experiment, the voltage clamped oocyte was under the constant perfusion of buffer at approximately 2 ml/min. The composition of this uptake buffer was 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Tris base (pH 7.4). Current responses were recorded at a sample rate of 2.5 ms−1 as the average of the responses to three consecutive trials and were subjected to a 500 kHz, 5 point gaussian filter prior to curve fitting or the calculation of steady-state parameters. Curve fitting was done either using the Simplix method with the pCLAMP software or using the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm (Origin 4.0, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Time constants describing the transient currents were obtained only from data collected in which the voltage clamp was sufficiently fast. Specifically, by fitting the current responses collected in the presence of 0.2 mm phlorizin to a single exponential, the time constant of the voltage clamp for these experiments was estimated to be between 0.4 and 0.7 ms. Fig. 1 shows the current responses to a series of 100-ms voltage steps (−150 to 90 mV in 20 mV increments) from a −50 mV holding potential before (panel A) and after (panel B) the addition of 10 mm αMG for an oocyte expressing A166C rSGLT1. As described previously for wild-type SGLT1 (3Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the presence of αMG in the bath solution induces an inward sodium current that is not observed in water-injected oocytes. Moreover, A166C rSGLT1 expression results in current responses which consist of a capacitive transient followed by a slow decay to steady state (most clearly seen for voltage steps to positive potentials). The slow decay has been extensively characterized in wild-type SGLT1 as a pre-steady-state current associated with sodium binding and the reorientation of the empty carrier (5Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As with wild-type SGLT1, this pre-steady-state current is abolished by the addition of αMG. Fig. 1 C shows, for the same representative oocyte expressing A166C, the I-V relationship of the current induced by the 10 mm αMG and the I-V relationship of the sodium leak. In this and all other experiments, the αMG-induced current is defined as the calculated difference in a measurement made in the absence of αMG and a second measurement made immediately afterward in the presence of αMG; the sodium leak is defined experimentally as the current inhibited by saturating phlorizin concentrations in the absence of αMG. In Fig. 1 D, we compare the sodium leak of the A166C mutant and wild-type SGLT1 by normalizing with respect to I max (Fig.2 A). Clearly, the A166C mutant exhibits a much smaller sodium leak at negative membrane potentials.Figure 2A, sugar-induced sodium currents as a function of sugar concentration for A166C rSGLT1. In this representative experiment, an oocyte expressing A166C rSGLT1 was voltage clamped and exposed to a bath solution containing 100 mm sodium and a varying amount of αMG (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mm). Current responses were recorded before and after the addition of each concentration of αMG for a series of 100-ms voltage steps. The steady-state current (i.e. the currents recorded during the final few milleseconds of the voltage pulse) induced by the αMG was taken as the difference between these two measurements. These αMG-induced currents as a function of αMG concentration are shown here fitted to the Michealis-Menton relationship I =I max [αMG]/(K m + [αMG]), where I max is the current at saturating [αMG] and K m is the apparent αMG affinity. B, voltage dependence of the αMG affinity for A166C and wt rSGLT1. The data presented here are the mean of three experiments for A166C and three experiments for wt rSGLT1. The values for the αMG K m were derived from fitting data to the Michealis-Menton relationship as described for panel A. The error bars represent standard deviations. C, sodium activation of the steady-state sugar-induced currents. This representative experiment shows the sodium dependence of the currents induced by 1 mm αMG. Recordings were made in bath solutions in which varying amounts of sodium were replaced with equimolar amounts of choline. The currents depicted are the differences in the current recordings made at a particular sodium concentration before and after the addition of 1 mm αMG. The data are fitted to the Hill equation, I = I max[Na] n /([Na] n +K 0.5 n), where I is current,I max is the maximal current at saturating [Na], K 0.5 is the [Na] at whichI = I max/2 (i.e.apparent sodium affinity), and n is the Hill coefficient. For −70 mV, the curve fitting gives I max = −134 ± 6 nA, K 0.5 = 19.9 ± 2.0 mm, n = 1.32 ± 0.1; for −50 mV,I max = −115 ± 6 nA,K 0.5 = 24.2 ± 2.2 mm,n = 1.66 ± 0.15; for −30 mV,I max = −87 ± 4 nA,K 0.5 = 28.2 ± 2.1 mm,n = 2.5 ± 0.3; errors are the errors of the fit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the αMG-induced currents for A166C rSGLT1 were, generally speaking, comparable in magnitude with those observed for wt SGLT1, we were able to proceed with a characterization of the steady-state transport kinetics of the mutant. The data from a series of I-V curves for A166C rSGLT1 are replotted as functions of αMG concentrations in Fig. 2 A and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain values for an apparent K m. The results from fitting data from a number of different oocytes expressing either A166C rSGLT1 or wt SGLT1 are presented in Fig. 2 B. Clearly, the apparent affinity of αMG has been lowered by the alanine to cysteine substitution. In experiments where the αMG-induced currents were determined for a series of sodium concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mm, data were obtained which showed that the mutation did not appear to affect stoichiometry or the apparent sodium affinity. In Fig. 2 C, a representative experiment is shown in which the sodium dependence of a 1 mm αMG-induced current at −30, −50, and −70 mV is fitted to the Hill equation. An interesting consequence of the introduction of the cysteine at position 166 was the effect of allowing MTSEA to react with the transporter and alter its function. In Fig.3, the steady-state αMG-induced currents for A166C rSGLT1 are shown to be inhibited by the addition of 1 mm MTSEA to the bath solution. The inhibition by the MTSEA exhibited the same rapid kinetics in the presence of saturating concentrations of αMG (10 mm) as at lower concentrations. Although we could not directly monitor the time course of inhibition in the absence of αMG, MTSEA exposure under such conditions resulted in the same degree of inhibition. Moreover, saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor phlorizin had no effect on the degree of the MTSEA inhibition nor did replacing the 100 mm NaCl with 100 mm choline-Cl (data not shown). The inhibition by the MTSEA did not eliminate the αMG-induced currents although the kinetics of the curve in Fig. 3 indicate that the reaction has gone to completion. Analysis of the αMG currents remaining after exposure to MTSEA (Fig.4) demonstrates that the effect of MTSEA is both on the αMG apparent affinity as well as theI max of the transporter. To further examine the effect of the cysteine substitution and the MTSEA inhibition, we undertook a series of experiments to examine the pre-steady-state currents of the mutant transporter before and after MTSEA exposure. Fig. 5 (panels A and B) show the transient currents observed for an oocyte expressing A166C rSGLT1 prior to and subsequent to reaction with MTSEA. The traces are the difference in the currents obtained in the presence and absence of 200 μm phlorizin. Phlorizin is a specific inhibitor of the transporter that has been shown to effectively eliminate the transients associated with the transporter and provides a means to measure and subtract the nonspecific capacitive currents (3Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 5Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For purposes of clarity and comparison, in Fig.5 C, we overlay the transient currents for the +90 mV voltage step from panels A and B. MTSEA affected the rate of decay of the transient currents exhibited by the A166C mutant. Qualitatively, the decay of the on currents is faster after MTSEA exposure. When the on currents are fitted to a first order exponential decay equation, time constants can be obtained that demonstrate the effect quantitatively (Fig. 5 D). The transient currents for each voltage pulse (V t) can be integrated to give a value for the quantity of charge transferred (Q) as a result of the change in membrane potential. Q as a function of V t has been demonstrated previously to be adequately described by the Boltzmann equation (5Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows how the Q versus V t relationship for A166C is changed by exposure to MTSEA and panel B compares the normalized Q versus V t relationship for wt A166C before and after MTSEA inhibition. The Q max obtained from fitting data to the Boltzmann relation correlates with the number of transporters expressed in a given oocyte. It has been shown thatI max/Q max can provide an estimate of the maximal rate of transporter turnover (assuming a stoichiometry of 2:1 and that 2 charges per transporter are translocated by the transient currents) (5Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Hazama A. Loo D.D.F. Wright e.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using theI max for −150 mV, we have found that wt SGLT1 has a maximal turnover rate of 22.8 ± 0.5 s−1(n = 3), whereas the A166C mutant exhibits a turnover of 12.3 ± 0.3 s−1 (n = 5). Since theI max of A166C before and after MTSEA inhibition can be determined in the same oocyte, the change in turnover rate caused by the MTSEA can be determined directly. Assuming that the number of transporters has not changed during the MTSEA exposure, the decrease in turnover is directly proportional to the decrease inI max. Hence, MTSEA results in a 3-fold decrease in turnover rate (I max, before MTSEA/I max, after MTSEAis ∼3). To explore further the nature of the MTSEA effect on the mutant, we tested a related compound, methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES). Like MTSEA, MTSES reacts specifically and rapidly with thiols to form mixed disulfides. However, the unreacted MTSES in solution posesses a negative charge instead of a positive charge, and the mixed disulfide it forms is the negatively charged thiol ethylsulfonate instead of the positively charged thiol ethylamine. We first confirmed that MTSES at 1 mm and 10 mm had no effect on wt SGLT1 steady-state or pre-steady-state kinetics (data not shown). Then interestingly, we found that MTSES at these concentrations likewise had no effect on the kinetics of the mutant (data not shown). Incubation with 10 mm MTSES did however protect against a subsequent inhibition with MTSEA. Fig. 7 shows that for progressively longer pre-treatments with MTSES followed by washout of the MTSES, there is a decreasing degree to which MTSEA exposure can inhibit the αMG-induced steady-state currents. These findings indicate that MTSES can also react with the cysteine at position 166, but that the mixed disulfide it forms does not perturb transporter function. Based on theoretical considerations and data from glycosylation mutants, position 166 is hypothesized to be part of a short 16 amino acid loop connecting transmembrane helices IV and V of SGLT1 (21Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To date, the only experimental data ascribing function to any part of this loop comes from a study by Panayotova-Heiermann, et al. (6Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the aspartic acid at position 176 (located at the transmembrane V end of the loop) was mutated to an alanine. In this study, the D176A mutation was shown to result in 1) an increased rate of decay for the on current transients corresponding to membrane depolarizations and 2) a shift of the Q versus V t curve along the voltage axis toward more hyperpolarizing potentials. In contrast, we have shown that an A166C mutation results in these pre-steady-state parameters changing in the opposite direction, namely in 1) a decreased rate of decay for these same current transients and 2) a shift of the Q versus V t curve along the voltage axis toward more depolarizing potentials. Since an aspartic acid to alanine change is from an electronegative to neutral amino acid and an alanine to cysteine change is from a neutral to relatively electronegative amino acid, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that this putative extracellular loop is sensitive to changes in charge and/or polarity. In fact, the direction in which the polarity is adjusted seems to determine the direction in which the time constants describing theseon transient currents (τon) change and theQ versus V t curve shifts. Referring to the modelling of SGLT1 current transients by Loo and Wright (5Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the above changes in pre-steady-state parameters caused by the mutations may be interpreted in terms of conformational transitions. These conformational transitions are induced by changes in membrane potential and involve the movement of charged residues and sodium ions through the membrane electric field. For membrane depolarizations, the transition would be the dissociation of sodium followed by reorientation of the unloaded transporter from outside to inside facing (i.e. NaC out →C out → C in, whereC out and C in represent the outside and inside facing conformations of the cotransporter). Therefore, the observation that the A166C mutant exhibits a slower τon (for V t = +90 mV) than wild type implies that the cysteine substitution has caused a decrease in the rate of this NaC out →C in transition. Moreover, the change in theQ/V t relationship may be interpreted as a change in the voltage-sensing capacity of the transporter. It is useful to apply the same kind of interpretation to the pre-steady-state data relating to the effect of MTSEA on the A166C mutant. Here were have shown that reaction with MTSEA reduces the value for τon (for V t = +90 mV) and shifts the Q versus V t curve along the voltage axis toward more depolarizing potentials such that the normalized Q versus V t curve is indistinguishable from that of wild type. Assuming that the MTSEA is reacting with the cysteine introduced at 166 and therefore placing an electropositive ethyl amine group at this location, these results are consistent with the notion presented above, namely that the region around 166 is sensitive to changes in charge and/or polarity. Futhermore, they lend support to the idea that this region is important in defining the energetics of the NaC out → C in transition and the transporter's voltage-sensing capacity. In addition to alterations in pre-steady-state parameters, the A166C mutation also results in changes in the steady-state operation of the transporter. Most notably, the A166C mutant demonstrates a significantly lower αMG apparent affinity, an observation which indicates that the mutation has affected either the true αMG affinity or a transition that is directly coupled to sugar binding. We consider two possibilities, 1) that position 166 is located in the sugar binding site and has a direct influence on that event, and 2) that position 166 is in a region that can influence the sodium activation of sugar binding, perhaps sodium binding itself. The detailed characterization of the transient currents exhibited by the A166C mutant, unfortunately, do not distinguish between these two possibilities, although analysis of the MTSEA effect argues against the first one. Since the inhibition by the MTSEA appears to be unaffected by saturating concentrations of αMG and phlorizin, the cysteine at 166 reacting with the MTSEA is unlikely to be located within either the αMG or the phlorizin binding sites. The decrease in the αMG affinity upon substituting alanine 166 for cysteine and the further decrease in affinity upon reaction with MTSEA, we believe, are due to an influence on the ability of sodium binding to activate αMG binding and then transport. Another piece of evidence that supports the hypothesis that 166 is located in a region important to sodium binding and the coupling of this event to sugar transport is the order of magnitude lower sodium leak exhibited by the A166C mutant as compared with that for wild type. The comparison holds for the case where the leak was normalized toI max and also for the case where the leak was normalized to Q max. The interpretation that the sodium leak represents an uncoupled pathway for sodium transport therefore suggests that the introduction of a cysteine in place of an alanine at 166 has altered the coupling characteristics of the transporter. The importance of the molecular character of the residue at 166 to the function of the transporter is also supported by the estimates of turnover rate for the A166C mutant and the mutant following MTSEA exposure. Compared with wild type, the turnover rate was halved by the cysteine substitution (∼23 s−1 versus ∼12 s−1) and the reaction with MTSEA caused an additional 3-fold decrease in the rate (∼4 s−1). Due to the complexity of the kinetics for a system that couples the transport of two sodium ions to one glucose molecule, it is difficult to explain these changes in turnover rate in terms of the changes observed for the pre-steady-state data. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to speculate that the changes in the nature of the reorientation of the empty carrier along with sodium binding in response to membrane potential changes would be evidence that the same transition occurring during a transport cycle, in which membrane potential is held constant, has also changed. Since this transition is believed to be one of the rate-limiting steps in the transport cycle, such speculation is consistent with the turnover data. Assuming that the effects of the MTSEA are due to reaction with cysteine 166, the results presented also provide information about the topology of the protein at position 166. Since MTSEA is a water-soluble compound that would not be expected to permeate across membranes, the residue at 166 must be placed either extracellularly or in some pore that is accessible from the extracellular compartment. This is important confirmation of the results of Turk et al. (21Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) which show that a 42-amino acid loop containing the native glycosylation site, when inserted between positions 169 and 170, is glycosylated by the Xenopus oocyte expression system. That particular mutant was reportedly non-functional while the A166C mutant we have shown is still able to mediate substantial αMG-induced currents. One important question we have been able to address is whether the effect of the MTSEA on A166C rSGLT1 is due to steric effects or charge effects introduced by the ethyl amine group. Our data suggest that the positive charge on the amine is responsible for altering both the steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of the mutant transporter. Although we cannot determine directly whether MTSES is reacting with the transporter, the results showing that MTSES preincubation can protect against MTSEA incubation demonstrate that MTSES and MTSEA react with the same cysteine. Since MTSES had no effect on any of the functional characteristics of the transporter and given that ethyl sulfonate is negatively charged and bulkier than ethyl amine, we conclude that the MTSEA effect on transport kinetics and charge transfer are due to the addition of a positive charge in what must be a key location. In conclusion, this study presents an application of cysteine mutagenesis coupled with reaction to MTS compounds to the elucidation of SGLT1 structure function relationships. We have provided evidence favoring the hypothesis that changes in the polarity of the molecular group at position 166 can bring about significant changes in both the pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics of the transporter. A significant advantage to the approach with the MTSEA is that it allowed the comparison of functional parameters perturbed by a specific and rapid covalent reaction, with those same parameters measured in the same oocyte for presumably the same population of transporters before the perturbation took place. We speculate that application of this approach to other residues in SGLT1, particularly the region around position 166, can continue to provide valuable information about the mechanism of sodium-coupled transport.

Two clones were selected, one recognizing H10 only in differentiating cells (clone 27 antibody), and the other recognizing the protein constitutively (clone 34 antibody). Both antibodies recognized a restricted region of the protein located at the N-terminal part of the globular domain. Amino acids 24–30, essential for the recognition of the protein by the clone 27 antibody, are extremely conserved in all known H10-like proteins from sea urchin to human.

Detailed analysis of the differential recognition of H10 in chromatin during cell differentiation and proliferation suggests that the modification of chromatin structure as well as that of H10 conformation can account for this effect.

Linker histone is an abundant basic protein present in almost all eukaryotes. The protein is involved in the formation of higher order structure in the chromatin (1Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) and the maintenance of the overall chromatin compaction (2Shen X. Yu L. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In general, linker histone has a tripartite structure: a central globular domain flanked by N- and C-terminal tail domains (3Hartman P.G. Chapman G.E. Moss T. Bradbury E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The globular domain binds the linker DNA and interacts with the nucleosome where DNA enters and exits the nucleosome (4Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 5Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Unlike core histones, linker histones diverge significantly in sequence and structure (6Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Numerous developmentally regulated variants of linker histone have been defined. These variants can be subdivided in three major groups in vertebrates as a function of their expression during development and cell differentiation (8Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). First, an embryonic form of linker histone is present during the oogenesis and the early development in amphibians. Replication-dependent types are present in all tissues during the life of the organism, and finally the differentiation-specific group accumulates in differentiating cells. Some members of this later group are tissue- and species-specific, like histones H5 and H1t. Others, like histone H10, are widely expressed in many tissues and in almost all vertebrates (9Zlatanova J. Doenecke D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that there is a tight correlation between the type of linker histone expressed and the proliferative capacities of cells during early Xenopus development. Histone H10 appears relatively late and concomitant with a dramatic decrease in the cell proliferation during the tail bud-tadpole transition period (10Grunwald D. Lawrence J.J. Khochbin S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, crucial periods in development can be characterized by a transition in the linker-histone variants within chromatin. Nothing is known concerning the role of these variants in specific organization of the chromatin structure. Immunolocalization of these proteins using specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies provided interesting information concerning the distribution of a given linker histone variant in the nucleus (11Banchev T. Srebeva L. Zlatanova J. Tsanev R. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Gorka C. Fakan S. Lawrence J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Schulze E. Nagel S. Gavenis K. Grossbach U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1789-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, chromatin organization is extremely dynamic and is subject to permanent remodeling. One of the most striking examples of this phenomenon is early embryonic development. Indeed, transition periods have been defined during development that are characterized by the modification of both chromatin constituents and the proliferative capacities of cells (8Khochbin S. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, later during development and in adult tissues, chromatin remodeling continues as adult type linker histones accumulate in cells (9Zlatanova J. Doenecke D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is therefore of great importance to understand the nature of these remodeling processes and to evaluate their role in the expression of specific genetic programs. The aim of this work was the identification of monoclonal antibodies raised against histone H10, showing specific abilities in recognizing this protein in chromatin. Individual anti-H10monoclonal antibodies were screened in an immunolocalization assay to isolate clones able to recognize H10 in a differentiation-dependent manner. Antibodies characterized in this work appeared to be probes that are useful for monitoring chromatin structure modifications occurring concomitantly with regulatory events such as the onset of a differentiation program and the arrest of cell proliferation.

To induce differentiation, MEL cells in exponential growth were treated with hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (Sigma) as described previously (14Khochbin S. Principaud E. Chabanas A. Lawrence J.J. J. Mol.

After centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, cells were lyzed in a lysis buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.65 mmspermidine, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.34m sucrose, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, nuclei were rinsed with the same buffer lacking EDTA, EGTA, and Triton (buffer D). To obtain chromatin, nuclei in buffer D were digested by micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer, 5 units/107 nuclei) for 7 min at 37 °C. Oligonucleosomes were fractionated on linear sucrose gradients in 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, 80 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA. Mouse full-length histone H10cDNA (16Alonso A. Breuer B. Bouterfa H. Doenecke D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3003-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or cDNAs corresponding to mutated H10were cloned in pET expression vector (Novagen). All mutations and deletions were performed by polymerase chain reaction. Briefly, for N-terminal deletion mutants, oligonucleotides (33 bases) containing the desired sequence (removing an increasing number of amino acids from the N-terminal part of the protein, see Fig. 1) and an additionalNdeI restriction site were used to amplify cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction. The 3′ primer had the sequence of the stop codon region and an additional XhoI site. The proline-valine mutant as well as the 24–30 deletion mutant were produced according to the method described in Refs. 17Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned, and their sequences were verified. The expression of the recombinant H10 was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the protein was extracted according to the standard protocol by 5% perchloric acid. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of histone H10was performed as described by Dousson et al. (19Dousson S. Gorka C. Gilly C. Lawrence J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Anti-H10 antibodies were monoclonal antibodies produced in our laboratory as described previously (19Dousson S. Gorka C. Gilly C. Lawrence J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in this work were from clones 27E 8E10 (clone 27 antibody) and 34B10H4 (clone 34 antibody). For immunostaining, hybridoma supernatant was used, and for gel shift assays, Igs were purified as follows. Ascites were induced in BALB/c mice after the intraperitoneal injection of hybridoma cells (5 × 106cells/mouse). Ascitic fluid was collected and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Igs were then purified as described (20Mc Kinney M.M. Parkinson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Briefly, albumin and other non-Ig proteins were first precipitated with caprilyc acid. Then Igs were precipitated by ammonium sulfate. Anti-H1 antibodies were elicited in rabbits. Primary injection and boost were performed using H1-yeast tRNA complex (3:1 w/w). Rabbits were subcutaneously injected at multiple sites with 100 μg of ox liver H1–1 and H1–2 (1 ml phosphate-buffered saline/Freund's adjuvant, v/v). Specific IgG was successively purified by protein A-Sepharose 4B chromatography and by affinity chromatography using H1-coupled cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B. H1 histones were analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to a Hybond C extra membrane (Amersham Corp.) at 24 V (0.2 A) for 1 h with a semi-dry electrotransfer apparatus. The membrane was blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was incubated with specific antibodies and then with an horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-IgG. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Oligonucleosomes fractionated on sucrose gradient were dotted on Hybond C extra membrane (10 μg of chromatin for each fraction) and subjected to immunodetection as above. The four-way junction DNA was obtained by annealing four oligonucleotides synthesized according to the sequence published by Teo et al. (22Teo S.H. Grasser K.D. Hardman C.H. Broadhurst R.W. Laue E.D. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3844-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The four oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl, gel purified, and labeled by polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Wild type or mutated H10 (1 μm) were incubated with labeled four-way junction DNA (75 nm) in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 15.6 mm NaCl, 5% Ficoll, and 50 μg/ml sonicated DNA from herring sperm) at room temperature for 30 min. DNA-protein interaction was analyzed in 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mmTris-base and 50 mm glycine, pH 8.9, that had been pre-electrophoresed at 4 °C (23Varga-Weisz P. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20699-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-H10-DNA interaction study was carried out as above, but after 15 min of incubation the antibody was added, and the incubation was carried out for an additional 15 min before analysis. RNAs were extracted from cells and analyzed by Northern blot by methods described by Khochbin et al. (14Khochbin S. Principaud E. Chabanas A. Lawrence J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), then incubated with monoclonal antibody against H10. The second antibody was a goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment against mouse IgG Fc fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch Lab). After immunolabeling, DNA was stained with DNA-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). When immunostaining was carried out on nuclei, purified nuclei were obtained as described above, resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 6 mmMgCl2 containing either 100 mm, 200 mm or 300 mm NaCl, at room temperature for 30 min then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer for 1 h at +4 °C. Nuclei were then doubly stained according to the procedure described above. Xenopus laevis embryos were taken at stage 36 of development, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C, and embedded in Tissue Tek (Bayer-Diagnostic) according to published procedure (10Grunwald D. Lawrence J.J. Khochbin S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 10-μm cryosections were mounted and treated as described previously (10Grunwald D. Lawrence J.J. Khochbin S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The doubly stained cells were analyzed in a FACStar Plus (Becton Dickinson) using a dual laser configuration: the Hoechst fluorescence was excited at 340–360 nm by the first argon laser, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence at 488 nm by the second argon laser. The fluorescence intensities were collected in a list mode. To determine the mean specific H10 fluorescence per cell we used ProCyt®, a computer program developed in our laboratory (available on request) (24Khochbin S. Chabanas A. Albert P. Lawrence J.J. Cytometry. 1989; 10: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported the preparation of monoclonal antibodies raised against histone H10 (19Dousson S. Gorka C. Gilly C. Lawrence J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work we undertook a screening of these antibodies for their ability to recognize the protein in chromatin. The first screening was performed using immunodetection of the protein in undifferentiated MEL cells. This work allowed us to define two clones: one (34B10H4) able to recognize H10 in chromatin and the second one (27E8E10) not able to bind the protein in this environment (both antibodies recognizing H10 in cellular or nuclear extracts with high specificity; data not shown). For simplicity, in the text we will refer to 34B10H4 and 27E8E10, as clone 34 and clone 27 antibodies, respectively. Preliminary mapping based on the recognition of peptides obtained by partial cleavage of H10 by cyanogen bromide (cleaving the protein at methionine 31) showed that the N-terminal part of the protein is essential for recognition; neither antibody recognized the protein fragment containing the amino acids 31–193 (Fig. 1 A). We therefore focused our attention on the N-terminal part of histone H10. A series of experiments were planned to map precisely the epitopes recognized by these two antibodies and to elucidate the basis for the differential recognition of the protein in chromatin. Mouse H10 cDNAs encoding the wild type protein or proteins bearing mutations affecting the N-terminal tail and the globular domain were cloned into prokaryotic expression vectors to obtain purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 1 B). The wild type recombinant protein was efficiently recognized by both antibodies, and moreover, the complete deletion of the N-terminal tail domain did not affect protein recognition (Fig.1 C, δ20). However, the removal of 18 AA from the N-terminal part of the globular domain completely abolished the binding of these antibodies (Fig. 1 C, δ38). A portion of the protein covering the AA 20–38 region therefore plays an essential role in the recognition of the protein by both antibodies. A more detailed analysis of the region recognized by these antibodies (AA 20–38 region) was performed. The comparison of the sequence covering this portion of H10 from vertebrate and H1δ from sea urchin (the adult type histone H1 in sea urchin, see Ref. 25Lieber T. Angerer L.M. Angerer R.C. Childs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4123-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that in H1δ, the region homologous to the mouse H10 AA 25–32 portion (AA 33–40 in H1δ) is absolutely conserved and is flanked by a nonconserved stretch of AA (Fig.2 A). This situation allowed us to more precisely map the epitopes recognized by these antibodies. We performed a Western blot with total H1 extracted from a mouse cell line (MEL cells), Xenopus, and adult sea urchin tissues and showed that only clone 27 antibody is able to recognize the protein in sea urchin, whereas both antibodies are able to recognize the protein in Xenopus and mouse (Fig. 2 B). We concluded that this motif (AA 25–32) is sufficient for the recognition of the protein by clone 27 antibody. This experiment showed also that the AA 20–24 play an important role in the recognition of the protein by clone 34 antibody. To confirm the importance of AA 24–30 region, a H10 mutant was prepared containing a deletion that covers precisely the AA 24–30 region. This deletion completely abolished the recognition by the clone 27 and 34 antibodies (Fig. 1 C, δ24–30). This portion of the protein is therefore essential for recognition by both antibodies. Considering the crystal structure of H5 (26Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), it is obvious that the proline 26 is involved in the formation of a bend in the unstructured part of the N-terminal region before the helix I. Moreover, this proline is one of the most conserved amino acids in all known H1s (not shown, see also Ref. 27Schulze E. Schulze E. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to study the influence of this residue on the recognition of the protein by these antibodies. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we changed this proline into a valine that is supposed to destroy this bend. Interestingly, this mutation abolished almost completely the recognition of the protein by the clone 27 antibody, whereas the recognition of the protein by the clone 34 antibody is not affected (Fig. 1 C, P-V). These experiments therefore allowed establishment of a precise map of the motifs recognized by these antibodies. AA 20–30 play an important role in the recognition of the protein by clone 34 antibody, whereas the AA 24–30 are sufficient for recognition by the clone 27 antibody (Fig. 2 C). The high affinity binding of H1 to four-way junction DNA (23Varga-Weisz P. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20699-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Krylov D. Leuba S. Van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5052-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) allows the study of the specific aspects of H1-DNA interactions (29Goytosolo F.A. Gerchman S.E. Yu X. Rees C. Graziano V. Ramakrishnan V. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3421-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this model to determine how the defined target epitopes are recognized by our antibodies when H10 interacts with DNA. Conditions for a complete shift of the labeled four-way junction DNA upon the addition of recombinant H10 (wild type or mutated) were determined, excesses of the clone 27 and 34 antibodies were added to the mixture, and the shift was examined. Upon the addition of the clone 34 antibody, three different cases were observed: 1) a fraction of DNA-H10 complex interacts with the antibody and is super-shifted (Fig.3 A, WT panels,lanes +H1 0 +Ab); 2) a fraction of DNA-H10complex is not recognized by the antibody; and 3) a fraction is dissociated as indicated by the release of free DNA. To discover whether the N-terminal tail of the protein can influence the recognition and the dissociation of the H10-four-way junction DNA complex by these antibodies, we used H10mutant lacking the 10 and 20 AA from the N-terminal end of the protein. The removal of the N-terminal 10 or 20 AA facilitated the dissociation of the H10-DNA complex by the clone 34 antibody without significantly increasing the amount of supershifted materials (Fig.3 A, 34B10H4, panels −10 and−20, lanes +H1 0 +Ab). Conversely, these mutations affected the formation of the ternary complex by the clone 27 antibody. Indeed, a decrease in the amount of the super-shifted material is observed (Fig. 3 A, 27E8E10,panels −10 and −20, lanes +H1 0 +Ab). Moreover, the dissociation of the H10-DNA complex by this antibody is also less efficient. As a control, we show that when the proline-valine mutant is used, clone 27 antibody is not able to supershift the complex nor to dissociate it, whereas clone 34 antibody (which is able to recognize this protein) supershifts and dissociates the complex (Fig. 3 B,panel Pro-Val, lanes +H1 0 +Ab34 and+H1 0 +Ab27). The δ24–30 mutant is able to interact with the DNA, but the addition of the described antibodies does not affect the H10-DNA complex. The use of these mutants showed also that the supershifted materials observed upon the addition of antibodies is highly dependent on the nature of H10 and is not due to the association of DNA with the antibody or some other components present in the reaction. These observations suggest that the shortening of the N-terminal part of the protein, nonessential for the recognition of the free protein, renders the dissociation of the complex by the clone 34 antibody more efficient, although it does not significantly affect that mediated by the clone 27 antibody. MEL cells are virus-transformed erythroid precursors able to undergo a differentiation program under the action of a large variety of chemical inducers (30Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We used this differentiation model to monitor H10 recognition by our antibodies during cell differentiation. Uninduced MEL cells or cells treated with the inducer (4 mm hexamethylene-bis-acetamide) for 6, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 48 h were fixed, and the immunofluorescence was monitored by flow cytofluorimetry after immunostaining with clone 27 and 34 antibodies. In uninduced MEL cells, whereas H10 is efficiently recognized by the clone 34 antibody, the protein is not recognized by clone 27 antibody (Fig.4 A, 0 h). In these cells, clone 27 antibody-related immunofluorescence corresponds to the background fluorescence, which is observed when anti-H10antibody is omitted (not shown). Clone 34 antibody-related immunofluorescence intensity changes between 0 and 6 h after induction (Fig. 4 A, 6 h; a broader distribution of the immunofluorescence is observed). An accumulation of the protein during this period (31Rousseau D. Khochbin S. Gorka C. Lawrence J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) can contribute to this increase in immunofluorescence intensity. However, despite this accumulation of H10, clone 27 antibody is not able to detect the protein in chromatin after 6 h of induction (compare0 and 6 h, Fig. 4 A). An increase in clone 27 antibody-related immunofluorescence is visible after 8 h of induction characterized by a broader distribution of cells along the immunofluorescence axis. The onset of the differentiation program as judged by the initiation of α-globin mRNA accumulation is also observed after 8 h of induction (Fig. 4 B). Another increase in the immunofluorescence intensity is observed between 32 and 48 h of induction, essentially visible for clone 27 antibody. To know if the differential recognition of H10 by these antibodies described above is indicative of a modification of chromatin structure (a change of accessibility), we fixed nuclei isolated from uninduced MEL cells after incubation in a buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl and performed immunodetection of H10as above. When nuclei were fixed after a treatment with 200 mm NaCl, a clear increase in the clone 34 antibody-related immunofluorescence is observed compared with nuclei fixed at 100 mm NaCl. Clone 27 antibody immunoreactivity did not change significantly in such conditions (Fig. 4 C, 200 mm NaCl, note that the clone 34 and 27 antibody-related immunofluorescence was recorded at the basal level to better visualize the increase of the immunofluorescence intensity after the salt treatment). When the nuclei were prepared in the presence of 300 mm NaCl, the recognition of the protein by both antibodies is enhanced. These data indicate that the recognition of H10 in chromatin by clone 34 antibody is more sensitive to chromatin structure modification than that of the clone 27 antibody. It would be interesting to know whether the differential recognition of the protein by these antibodies can also be observed on fractionated chromatin. Nuclei from both uninduced cells and cells induced for 48 h were digested by micrococcal nuclease, and chromatin fragments were fractionated on a sucrose gradient (Fig.5 A). A comparable amount of chromatin from each fraction was loaded on a filter in duplicate using a dot blot apparatus (Fig. 5 B). One blot was incubated with clone 34 antibody, and the other was incubated with clone 27 antibody, and recognition of H10 was monitored by the ECL system. As a control, different amounts of purified H10 were also loaded on each filter (Fig. 5 B, purified H1 0 panel). Fig. 5 B shows that as expected the clone 27 antibody did not recognize the protein in chromatin of uninduced cells (27E8E10, 0 h lane), whereas the clone 34 antibody recognized the protein efficiently (34B10H4,0 h lane). The purified protein was recognized with an equal efficiency by both antibodies (purified protein panel). Interestingly, 48 h after the induction of cell differentiation, clone 27 antibody was able to recognize H10 in the chromatin (27E8E10, 48 h lane). Signals corresponding to the recognition of the protein by clone 34 antibody is also more intense for this chromatin (34B10H4, compare the48 h lane with the 0 h lane). The same blots were then washed, and the immunodetection of histone H1 was performed using polyclonal anti-H1 antibodies. Fig. 5 B (anti-H1 panel) shows that histone H1 was recognized efficiently in each fraction and proved that a"
https://openalex.org/W1982432153,"The influence of transcription factor (TF) IIE on mRNA synthesis <i>in vivo</i> was examined in a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant. A missense mutation in the conserved zinc finger domain severely weakened TFIIE's transcription activity without appreciably affecting its quaternary structure, chromatographic properties, or cellular abundance. The mutation conferred recessive slow-growth and heat-sensitive phenotypes in yeast, but quantitative effects on promoter utilization by RNA polymerase II ranged from strongly negative to somewhat positive. Heat-induced activation of the <i>HSP26</i>, <i>HSP104</i>, and<i>SSA4</i> genes was attenuated in the mutant, indicating dependence on TFIIE for maximal rates of <i>de novo</i> synthesis. Constitutive <i>HSP</i> expression in mutant cells was elevated, exposing a negative (likely indirect) influence by TFIIE in the absence of heat stress. Our results corroborate and extend recent findings of differential dependence on TFIIE activity for yeast promoters, but reveal an important counterpoint to the notion that dependence is tied to TATA element structure (Sakurai, H., Ohishi, T., and Fukasawa, T. (1997) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 272, 15936–15942). We also provide empirical evidence for conservation of structure-activity relationships in TFIIE's zinc finger domain, and establish a direct link between TFIIE's biochemical activity in reconstituted transcription and its function in cellular mRNA synthesis."

The results reported in this paper utilized the photoaffinity probe S4-ddUTP to derivatize the active site of HIV-1 RT during productive synthesis involving a ternary complex. The chain terminating probe is located specifically at the 3′-OH end of the nascent product. The hexapeptide VRQLCK of the p66 subunit was the only target peptide that was detected. A general discussion of the possible mechanistic implications of these results is directed at making all the known topologic information compatible.

Exonuclease III was purchased from Amersham Life Science. Sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C was purchased from Promega. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. HinP1I restriction endonuclease was purchased from New England Biolabs. All reagents for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Spectra/Por 6 molecular porous dialysis membrane (M r cut-off = 1,000) was purchased from Spectrum. Mini ProBlott™ membranes was purchased from Applied Biosystems. The high intensity black lamp (model B-100A, long wave UV, which peaks at 365 nm) was purchased from Eastern Corp. Computer program Insight II was purchased from Biosym Technologies. The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) for photoaffinity labeling was: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 1.0 μm HIV-1 RT heterodimer (M r = 117,000), 10 μm DNA template, and 10 μm DNA primer. The nonradioactive substrates dATP, dCTP, and photoprobe (S4-ddUTP) were each added to a final concentration of 100 μm. The radioactive substrate [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was added to achieve a specific activity within the range of (1,000∼10,000 cpm/pmol). The template primer complex was prepared by heating a solution of 20 μm DNA template and 20 μm DNA primer in the reaction buffer to 100 °C for 3 min. Upon cooling (1 h), the HIV-1 RT was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Immediately upon adding the substrates, the reaction mixture was placed in a depression well of an aluminum foil-covered, temperature-regulated aluminum block. The aluminum block was covered with an inverted Petri dish to prevent extensive evaporation of the reaction mixtures. The UV lower wavelength cut-off of a Pyrex Petri dish is 290 nm. An additional Petri dish, filled with water, was positioned on top of the first one to provide cooling. The lamp was positioned to shine the light from a distance of about 2 cm onto the top of the water-filled Petri dish. The reaction mix was irradiated with UV (365 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C. To minimize the damage from the heat generated by the UV lamp, the water in the top Petri dish was replaced with cool water at 20 and 40 min. A small aliquot of the photoaffinity labeling reaction mix was removed and analyzed for protein and DNA product. Radioactive labeled and unlabeled HIV-1 RT was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The DNA product of the HIV-1 RT was analyzed by 20% urea-PAGE. In both cases, the radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. For a quantitative analysis, radioactive bands of interest were excised for Cerenkov counting. The DNA products were separated on the basis of molecular weight using 20% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 19:1) gel electrophoresis containing 7m urea (dimensions: 170 × 140 × 1.7 mm). The electrophoresis buffer was 0.89 m Tris, 0.89 mboric acid, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. The gel was preelectrophoresed with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol dye markers in deionized formamide for 1 h prior to loading the samples. Sample mixtures of 15 μl were applied and electrophoresed for 3.5–4 h at 600 V until the xylene cyanol dye marker was about 5 cm from the bottom of the gel. The DNA products were visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive bands were excised and counted in Eppendorf tubes by the Cerenkov method. For protein labeling analysis, samples from the photoaffinity labeling experiments were mixed with 2 × Laemmli buffer containing the bromphenol blue dye marker (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) at 1:1 (v/v) ratio and boiled at 100 °C for 3 min. The total samples were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 30:0.8) gel containing 0.1% SDS (dimensions: 275 × 140 × 7 mm). The electrophoresis buffer was 25 mm Tris glycine, pH 8.3. The electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V for 1 h and 300 V for another 4.5 h. The radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. For quantitative analysis, the radioactive bands were excised and counted in Eppendorf tubes by the Cerenkov method. The same size gel bands containing variable amounts of 32P radioactivity were excised from a 20% urea-PAGE (or 10% SDS-PAGE) and counted in Eppendorf tubes once. Each band was then transferred to a scintillation vial and minced. The scintillation vial was filled with scintillation fluid and counted in the 32P channel for 5 min. The data from the scintillation counting was plotted versus the data from the Cerenkov counting. The points were fitted with a linear function. The slope is the calibration factor for Cerenkov counting. The calibration factor for gel bands from 20% urea-PAGE is 1.3724. The calibration factor for gel bands from 10% SDS-PAGE is 1.7245. The photoaffinity labeling reaction (total volume 10 ml containing 10 nmol of HIV-1 RT and 100 nmol each of DNA template (RT20) and DNA primer (P12)) was performed as described above. After UV irradiation, 1.0 ml of 10 × exonuclease III (ExoIII) digestion buffer was added to the reaction mixture. This reaction mixture was immediately digested by 5,000 units of ExoIII (100 unit/μl) at 37 °C for 30 min (1 unit of ExoIII will catalyze the release of 1.0 nmol of acid-soluble nucleotide in 30 min at 37 °C in 1 × buffer). After the ExoIII digestion, the reaction mixture was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. A 20-ml glass vial was used as a container, and a stir bar constantly stirred the reaction mixture while the trichloroacetic acid was added. Ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid (2.5 ml) was added to the ExoIII reaction mixture to a final 1:4 (v/v) ratio. After the precipitation step, the mixture was distributed repetitively into two Eppendorf tubes and was subjected to centrifugation (13,000 rpm, microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min). The supernatant was removed from the precipitated protein. Multiple centrifugations were required to accumulate the precipitated protein. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed once with cold (−20 °C) 100% acetone and centrifuged at 4 °C for another 5 min. The pellet was air-dried and immediately dissolved into a buffer suitable for proteolytic digestion to form peptides (trypsin or Lys-C). In the case of trypsin digestion, the pellet was recovered by dissolving it into 100 μl of denaturation buffer 1 (800 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, and 8 m urea). The solution was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, and then it was diluted 8-fold with H2O. Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:20 (w/w). The trypsin digestion was incubated at 37 °C overnight. In the case of Lys-C digestion, the pellet was recovered by dissolving it into 100 μl of denaturation buffer 2 (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 m urea). The solution was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and then was diluted 5-fold with H2O. The Lys-C (1 μg/μl) was added at a ratio of 1:60 (w/w). The Lys-C digestion was incubated at 37 °C overnight. To remove small radioactive nucleotides, excess salts, and urea, the peptide digestion solution was dialyzed against H2O at 4 °C overnight, then concentrated to 30 μl by SpeedVac. The molecular weight cut-off of the dialysis membrane was 1,000. The concentrated peptide solution was mixed with buffer (98% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue) at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v), and then loaded on to a 20% urea-PAGE. Electrophoresis was conducted at 600 V for 4 h. The radioactive bands in the gel were visualized by autoradiography. A small amount of labeled peptide sample, which was digested with Pronase, was also loaded on to the same 20% urea-PAGE. The Pronase-sensitive radioactive band was the labeled peptide band of interest. This band was excised, quantified by Cerenkov counting, minced in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and then soaked in 1.0 ml of H2O overnight to elute the labeled peptides. The eluate was separated from the gel by centrifugation. The elution was repeated two more times so that the recovery of labeled peptide reached 90%. The eluates were combined, dialyzed against H2O, and concentrated again by SpeedVac. The recovered peptide (about 20 pmol) was dissolved into 100 μl of H2O. To purify the peptide adduct, a “gel band shift” procedure was conducted using the endonuclease HinP1I. The DNA template (RT20) was added to the peptide solution at a ratio of 80:1 (template/peptide). The standard reaction buffer was also added to the peptide solution to give a final peptide solution containing 1 × HIV-1 RT reaction buffer. The DNA template and DNA product double helix (total volume was 178 μl) were annealed by boiling the mixture at 100 °C for 3 min and cooling it down gradually (30 min). About 20 μl of 10 × NEBuffer 2 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and 2 μl of HinP1I (5 unit/μl) were added to the mixture. The final volume was 200 μl.HinP1I digestion was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against H2O at 4 °C overnight. The molecular weight cut-off of the dialysis membrane was 1,000. The dialyzed solution was then concentrated to 15 μl by SpeedVac. The sample was analyzed on a 20% urea-PAGE, and the shifted labeled peptide was visualized by autoradiography. The gel was removed from the electrophoresis cell and soaked in the electroblotting buffer for 5 min. The electroblotting buffer was 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 20% HPLC-grade methanol. The Mini ProBlott™ membrane was prewetted with methanol for a few seconds and then was placed in a dish containing blotting buffer. The transblotting sandwich was then assembled and electroblotting was conducted at a constant current of 200 mA (50–75 V), at 4 °C for 60 min. The Mini ProBlott™ membrane was removed from the transblotting sandwich and was rinsed with deionized water prior to air drying. The labeled peptide on the Mini ProBlott™ membrane was located by autoradiography. The peptide area was cut out and subjected to Edman microsequencing on a Perkin Elmer 494 automated protein sequencer equipped with a 6-mm microcartridge. Sequence interpretation was performed on a DEC Alpha (23Henzel W.J. Rodriguez H. Watanabe C. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 404: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A previous photoaffinity labeling study employing S4-dUTP as a probe for the active site subunit of HIV-1 RT has been reported by Sheng and Dennis (14Sheng N. Dennis D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (4932): 4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The basic features of that study were repeated using the chain terminator S4-ddUTP, and similar results were obtained in that the labeling of the p66 subunit was light- and photoprobe-dependent and the efficiency of labeling was ∼2%. The basic strategy for substituting S4-ddUTP in place of S4-dUTP in the current study was to ensure that no additional nucleotides could be added after the photoprobe was inserted at the 3′-terminal position of the elongated primer. In our previous study (14Sheng N. Dennis D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (4932): 4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the isolation of a small labeled peptide was not achieved and a large 16-kDa (288–423) fragment was isolated and partially sequenced (288–313). In our present study, the isolation and purification of the peptide derived from the Lys-C proteolysis of the labeled p66 subunit enabled us to obtain a single radioactive hexapeptide for sequencing. The photoaffinity labeling reaction mixture was treated with the 3′ → 5′ DNA specific nuclease ExoIII and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to remove the majority of radioactive oligonucleotide (and mononucleotides). The radioactive elongated primer containing the photoprobe at the 3′ terminus (and covalently linked to the p66 subunit) is resistant to the nuclease since its 3′ end is blocked. In Fig. 1, the results of the ExoIII digestion can be seen by comparing lanes 1 and 2in panel A or B. The radioactive component at the origin is the band of interest, whereas the product (n) and the photodimer containing the template cross-linked to the radioactive elongated primer (T-n) are essentially removed from the trichloroacetic acid precipitate. As seen in lane 3, after treatment with either trypsin (panel A) or Lys-C (panel B), a single radioactive peptide (n-p) from the p66 subunit is produced in addition to the product (n), which persists as a detectable contaminant. The shift of n-p to a lower position is produced upon treatment with Pronase, which cleaves most (but not all) of the peptide from the cross-linked n fragment (lane 4 in A andB). A steric restraint may prevent Pronase from hydrolyzing the peptide bonds close to the derivatization point between the peptide and the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide product. Notice that the oligonucleotide product located at n is not altered by Pronase, and therefore does not contain a peptide. The efficiency of labeling was calculated to be 2%, by measuring the total combined radioactivity of the p66 subunit isolated as p1 and p2 bands on a 10% SDS-PAGE (14Sheng N. Dennis D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (4932): 4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and assuming that all of the HIV-1 RT enzyme added to the reaction was catalytically active. The reaction mixture produced a total of 200 pmol of derivatized p66 subunit. The treatment with ExoIII followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation yielded 150 pmol of p66 subunit. The labeled peptide recovered from the (n-p) gel band after the 20% urea-PAGE procedure was 45 pmol. To purify the labeled peptide n-p (Fig. 1, lane 3), the radioactive band was excised from the 20% urea-PAGE gel, minced, and eluted into aHinP1I reaction buffer. An excess of the DNA template RT20 was added and annealed to the n-p peptide. The specific endonucleaseHinP1I was then added and incubated for 10 min to cleave a 9-base oligonucleotide fragment from the 5′ end of n-p to generate n′-p. This mixture was separated by rerunning in another 20% urea-PAGE, and that autoradiogram is shown in Fig.2 for the peptides generated by trypsin (panel A) or Lys-C (panel B). The “band shift” achieved by digestion with HinP1I nuclease repositions the radioactive band n-p to a unique faster moving position denoted n′-p. This operation (removal of a 9-mer oligonucleotide from n-p) nicely separates the peptide of interest from any nonradioactive peptide contaminants that might have comigrated with n-p. The n′-p radioactive band contained 15 pmol of peptide in the case of the trypsin-produced peptide (panel A) and 24 pmol in the case of the Lys-C-produced peptide (panel B). The “↓” indicates the cleaving sites ofHinP1I on template DNA RT20 and product DNA n. The cleavage generated n′-p (CGCCACAACAS4ddU-peptide). The cleavage site for HinP1I endonuclease on the target adduct is shown below. The n′-p fragments resulting from HinP1I treatment of the n-p component shown in Fig. 2 were transferred by electroblotting to a PVDF membrane and autoradiographed to visualize the band of interest, which was excised and a portion subjected to a Edman microsequencing. The total sample was calculated to be 12–20 pmol. The analytical data for several sequence analysis are presented in TableI for either the trypsin- or Lys-C-generated n′-p samples.Table IAmino acid sequence analysis of the n′-p peptide (each of the entries (1Majumdar C.

Open table in a new tab The sequence analysis for the n′-p peptide derived from a trypsin digestion sample gave evidence of a tetrapeptide that did not allow the identification of the amino acids located in either position 1 or 3. This result did not allow distinction between two possible tetrapeptide sequences ELNK (positions 79–82) or QLCK (positions 278–281). The sequence analysis for the n′-p derived from a Lys-C digestion sample was therefore conducted to make the selection between these choices since the nonomer peptide LVDFRELNK would be produced in place of the ELNK trypsin-generated tetrapeptide and the hexamer peptide VRQLCK would be produced in placed of the QLCK trypsin-generated tetrapeptide. The photoaffinity-labeled amino acid sequence was found to be the hexapeptide VRQLCK (positions 276–281), which resulted from the Lys-C digestion of the p66 subunit. The data for several different experiments is collected in Table I. Note that a second template (RT19) was also used to generate the same labeled peptide. Several attempts were made to alkylate the Cys280 residue (just prior to the Edman microsequencing) to pinpoint the possible positions of derivatization with the photoprobe. Since we were unable to successfully achieve the alkylation, we suggest that the Cys280 is the most likely choice of the amino acid that is covalently linked with the photoprobe. In our previous study of the photoaffinity labeling of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using S4-dUTP as a photoprobe (14Sheng N. Dennis D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (4932): 4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we isolated a 16-kDa labeled fragment (288–423) from the p66 subunit and sequenced the N-terminal portion (288–313). In our present study using S4-ddUTP as the photoprobe, we have isolated a unique labeled hexapeptide (276–281). The photoprobe in our present studies was positioned at (and only at) the 3′ end of the primer terminus of an actively synthesizing ternary complex and was incorporated as a chain terminator. Exposure of the photoprobe to ultraviolet light λ360 nm resulted in derivatization of the amino acid Cys280 as an accessible target, presumably in close proximity to the active site. The isolation of a target hexapeptide that is somewhat different from our initial study (14Sheng N. Dennis D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (4932): 4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) could reflect the possible different binding options available for the different photoprobes. For example, if translocation occurs prior to photolysis, the S4-dUTP photoprobe could engage in a binding interaction at the 3′-hydroxy binding site for the next phosphodiester bond forming event. The S4-ddUTP would have no such new binding option since it does not have a 3′-hydroxyl group."
