https://openalex.org/W3034304416,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children1-4. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12-31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57-82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures-such as many low-income countries-the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic."

https://openalex.org/W3033015248,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with millions of human infections. One limitation to the evaluation of potential therapies and vaccines to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and ameliorate disease is the lack of susceptible small animals in large numbers. Commercially available laboratory strains of mice are not readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of species-specific differences in their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Here, we transduced replication-defective adenoviruses encoding human ACE2 via intranasal administration into BALB/c mice and established receptor expression in lung tissues. hACE2-transduced mice were productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this resulted in high viral titers in the lung, lung pathology, and weight loss. Passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced viral burden in the lung and mitigated inflammation and weight loss. The development of an accessible mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis will expedite the testing and deployment of therapeutics and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3035986830,"Soybean is one of the most important vegetable oil and protein feed crops. To capture the entire genomic diversity, it is needed to construct a complete high-quality pan-genome from diverse soybean accessions. In this study, we performed individual de novo genome assemblies for 26 representative soybeans that were selected from 2,898 deeply sequenced accessions. Using these assembled genomes together with three previously reported genomes, we constructed a graph-based genome and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified numerous genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto a single reference genome. The structural variations from the 2,898 accessions that were genotyped based on the graph-based genome and the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the representative 26 accessions helped to link genetic variations to candidate genes that are responsible for important traits. This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics studies in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W3036928921,"Structural variants (SVs) underlie important crop improvement and domestication traits. However, resolving the extent, diversity, and quantitative impact of SVs has been challenging. We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3035468097,"As of 24 April 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has resulted in over 830,000 confirmed infections in the United States1. The incidence of COVID-19, the disease associated with this new coronavirus, continues to rise. The epidemic threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, and identifying those regions where the disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency medical care and public health resources. Globally, the risk of severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 has consistently been observed to increase with age2,3. We used age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data to map projections of the cumulative case burden of COVID-19 and the subsequent burden on healthcare resources. The analysis was performed at the county level across the United States, assuming a scenario in which 20% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identified counties that will probably be consistently, heavily affected relative to the rest of the country across a range of assumptions about transmission patterns, such as the basic reproductive rate, contact patterns and the efficacy of quarantine. We observed a general pattern that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring equitable and adequate allocation of medical care and public health resources to communities outside of major urban areas. Projection of the number of COVID-19 cases and the associated burden on healthcare resources using a modified SEIR model reveals that rural regions in the United States are at risk of higher per capita case burdens, which could lead to health systems being overwhelmed in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W3035864988,"Drug partitioning in nuclear condensates There is increasing interest in the function of phase-separated biomolecular condensates in cells because of their distinct properties and expanding roles in important biological processes. Klein et al. considered the fate of small-molecule therapeutics in the context of nuclear condensates (see the Perspective by Viny and Levine). They show that certain antineoplastic drugs have physicochemical properties that cause them to concentrate preferentially in condensates, both in vitro and in cancer cells. This property influences drug activity, and protein mutations that alter condensate formation can lead to drug resistance. Optimizing condensate partitioning may be valuable in developing improved therapeutics. Science , this issue p. 1386 ; see also p. 1314"

For example, in addition to the V. cholerae DncV product 3′3′-cGAMP, Escherichia coli CdnE synthesizes 3′3′ cyclic UMP-AMP (3′3′-cUA), and Enterobacter cloacae CdnD (CD-NTase in clade D) synthesizes the cyclic trinucleotide second messenger 3′3′3′ cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP (3′3′3′-cAAG) (Whiteley et al., 2019Whiteley A.T.

The best-characterized family of receptors that respond to bacterial CD-NTase nucleotide second messengers are patatin-like phospholipases, which are activated to degrade membrane phospholipids upon nucleotide signal binding. The first known example is the Vibrio cholerae protein cGAMP-activated phospholipase in Vibrio (CapV), which responds to 3′3′-cGAMP and causes membrane rupture and bacterial cell death (Severin et al., 2018Severin G.B.

Similarly, the E. coli CD-NTase CdnE signals through CapE, a CapV homolog that specifically recognizes 3′3′-cUA, indicating that CBASS operons function with high specificity for a single-nucleotide second messenger (Whiteley et al., 2019Whiteley A.T.

Bacterial cGAS-like enzymes synthesize diverse nucleotide signals.Nature. 2019; 567: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, a majority of bacterial CD-NTase enzymes are encoded in CBASS operons that do not contain proteins with homology to CapV-like receptors (Burroughs et al., 2015Burroughs A.M. Zhang D.

Here we reconstitute Enterobacter cloacae CdnD signaling in vitro and in vivo to discover CD-NTase-associated protein 4 (Cap4) as the founding member of a major family of downstream receptors that specifically respond to nucleotide second messenger signals in CBASS immunity. High-resolution crystal structures of Cap4 combined with negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis reveals a DNA endonuclease effector domain activated through nucleotide second messenger-induced oligomerization. We demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized protein domain in Cap4 called SAVED is responsible for nucleotide second messenger recognition. Remarkably, SAVED is a fusion of two CRISPR-associated Rossman fold (CARF) domains derived from type III CRISPR immunity, revealing a common ancestry between these nucleotide second messenger-centric antiviral systems. Divergence in the SAVED nucleotide binding pocket enables recognition of an expanded range of CD-NTase products, including bacterial second messengers with alternative ring size, nucleobase, and 3′–5′ or 2′–5′ phosphodiester linkages. We further show that SAVED-containing effectors are essential for CBASS-mediated protection of bacteria from phage infection. Our results uncover a major family of nucleotide second messenger receptors and reveal a role of 2′–5′-linked nucleotide signals in bacterial resistance to phage infection. The E. cloacae CD-NTase CdnD (EcCdnD) is constitutively active in vitro and synthesizes the nucleotide second messenger 3′3′3′-cAAG (Whiteley et al., 2019Whiteley A.T. Eaglesham J.B. de Oliveira Mann C.C. Morehouse B.R. Lowey B. Nieminen E.A. Danilchanka O. King D.S. Lee A.S.Y. Mekalanos J.J. Kranzusch P.J. Bacterial cGAS-like enzymes synthesize diverse nucleotide signals.Nature. 2019; 567: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). EcCdnD is encoded in an operon containing three additional genes of unknown function, designated here CD-NTase-associated proteins 2, 3, and 4 (Cap2, Cap3, and Cap4) (Figure 1A). To define how bacterial CD-NTase enzymes control downstream signaling, we purified each protein from the E. cloacae CdnD02 operon and used a biochemical approach for receptor identification. Incubation of radiolabeled 3′3′3′-cAAG with purified EcCap4 (GenBank: WP_032676399.1) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay resulted in complete shift and formation of a stable Cap4-3′3′3′-cAAG complex (Figures 1B and S1A). No interaction was observed between EcCap4 and the V. cholerae DncV product 3′3′-cGAMP, demonstrating that EcCap4 is a downstream receptor that specifically recognizes the cognate EcCdnD nucleotide second messenger.Figure S1Biochemical Reconstitution of Cap4 Endonuclease Activity, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stain analysis of purified recombinant Cap4 and CdnD proteins.(B) Cartoon schematics and crystal structures of apo MoCap4 and AbCap4 enzymes.(C) Alignment of divergent Cap4 homologs.

Biochemical data are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. To understand the function of Cap4, we screened homologs for suitability in a structural analysis and determined a 2.4 Å crystal structure of Cap4 from the bacterium Moraxella osloensis (MoCap4; GenBank: WP_060996052.1) and a 2.6 Å crystal structure of Cap4 from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbCap4; GenBank: WP_008942236.1) (Figures 1C and S1B; Table S1). The structure of Cap4 reveals a two-domain architecture with an N-terminal domain containing a mixed β sheet braced on either side with α-helical bundles and a globular C-terminal domain that contains internal two-fold pseudosymmetry (Figures 1C and S1B). Sequence alignment based on the MoCap4 structure demonstrates that all Cap4 homologs contain the same domain architecture with MoCap4 versus AbCap4 sharing ~80% identity and MoCap4 versus EcCap4 sharing ~20% identity at the amino acid level (Figure S1B). The Cap4 N-terminal domain is a member of an uncharacterized protein domain classification, domain of unknown function 4297 (DUF4297), that is widespread in bacteria. Comparative analysis using the MoCap4 structure reveals that the DUF4297 domain shares structural homology with type II restriction endonucleases, including the enzymes AgeI and HindIII (Figure 1D). Sequence alignment of Cap4 and type II restriction enzymes confirms conservation of all putative active-site residues required for metal coordination and suggests that Cap4 proteins are functional nuclease enzymes (Figure S1B; Burroughs et al., 2015Burroughs A.M. Zhang D. Schäffer D.E. Iyer L.M. Aravind L.

In the presence of an activating nucleotide second messenger, Cap4 proteins catalyze complete degradation of plasmid DNA to small, <45 bp DNA fragments (Figure 1E). Cap4 alone exhibits no nuclease activity, indicating that recognition of a nucleotide second messenger is a strict requirement for nuclease activation. Cap4 activity is divalent cation metal dependent (Figure S1D), and mutation of a conserved lysine residue in the active site ablates nuclease activity (Figures 1F and S1E), further confirming that Cap4 proteins use a type II restriction enzyme-like reaction mechanism to degrade DNA. Type II restriction endonucleases contain loops or helices that extend from the nuclease domain to form DNA major and minor groove contacts and control target sequence cleavage specificity (Tamulaitiene et al., 2017Tamulaitiene G. Jovaisaite V. Tamulaitis G. Songailiene I. Manakova E. Zaremba M. Grazulis S. Xu S.Y. Siksnys V. Restriction endonuclease AgeI is a monomer which dimerizes to cleave DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3547-3558PubMed Google Scholar, Watanabe et al., 2009Watanabe N. Takasaki Y. Sato C. Ando S.

Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Cap4 N-terminal endonuclease domain is minimized, with nearly all extensions absent, suggesting relaxation of DNA targeting specificity (Figure 1D). Consistent with these structural observations, EcCap4 degrades plasmid DNA, E. coli genomic DNA, and synthetic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in vitro with no apparent target sequence or DNA modification specificity (Figures 1G and S1F). In each case, Cap4 endonuclease activity remains strictly dependent on the presence of activating nucleotide second messenger. Together, these results demonstrate that Cap4 proteins are dsDNA endonucleases controlled through nucleotide second messenger-gated enzyme activation. To determine the specificity of CD-NTase-Cap4 signaling, we next compared cross-activation between E. cloacae and A. baumannii CdnD operons. Although each CdnD activates the robust endonuclease activity of its cognate Cap4 protein in vitro, heterologous reactions with one CdnD or Cap4 component derived from each operon fail to reconstitute signaling and do not result in DNA degradation (Figures 2A and S2A). Selective Cap4 activation reveals that AbCdnD must synthesize a nucleotide second messenger distinct from the EcCdnD product 3′3′3′-cAAG. We tested nucleotide combinations and observed that ATP is necessary and sufficient to allow AbCdnD to synthesize the activating nucleotide second messenger signal (Figure S2B). However, all known canonically linked cyclic di-, tri-, and tetra-AMP RNA products failed to reconstitute activation of AbCap4 DNA degradation activity (Figure 2B). We therefore hypothesized that, like human cGAS-STING, AbCdnD-Cap4 signaling may require a noncanonical 2′–5′-linked second messenger. To assess whether the AbCdnD nucleotide product contains a non-canonical linkage, we analyzed the sensitivity of CD-NTase reaction products to digestion by nuclease P1, which specifically hydrolyzes 3′–5′-linked phosphodiester bonds and is unable to cleave non-canonical 2′–5′ phosphodiester bonds (Ablasser et al., 2013Ablasser A.

Unlike the V. cholerae DncV and EcCdnD products 3′3′-cGAMP and 3′3′3′-cAAG, the mammalian cGAS 2′3′-cGAMP and the AbCdnD reaction products contain phosphates resistant to nuclease P1 digestion, confirming the presence of a 2′–5′-linked bond (Figure 2C).Figure S2Purification and Characterization of the AbCdnD Nucleotide Second Messenger Product, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) DNA cleavage analysis of MoCap4 endonuclease activity.

https://openalex.org/W3036025379,"Delicate dance becomes a ballet The enzyme nitrogenase uses adenosine triphosphate and several unusual iron-sulfur cofactors to pump electrons into typically inert dinitrogen (N 2 ), providing protons along the way. Previous work has shown that sulfur atoms in the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoCo) are labile and suggests that replacement of one of the sulfurs by N 2 is integral to the mechanism of N 2 binding and reduction. Through the elimination of excess reducing agent during preparation, Kang et al. determined structures of Mo-nitrogenase in a resting conformation. Unexpectedly, they found that all three sulfurs at the outer edge of FeMoCo appear to be labile, with one subunit even having two of three sulfurs replaced by light, diatomic ligands. Biochemical and spectroscopic data indicate that the protein is active, holds tightly bound N 2 , and is in the expected oxidation state. These results may prompt a reassessment of the possible mechanisms of N 2 reduction and the role of dynamic belt ligands in FeMoCo. Science , this issue p. 1381"

The protein then delivers cholesterol to NPC1 for downstream cross-membrane transport. Various reports have linked NPC1 to the entry point of viruses. Ebola viral spike glycoprotein (GP) specifically binds to NPC1 after reaching LE/Ly, triggering downstream cellular infection (Carette et al., 2011Carette J.E. Raaben M. Wong A.C. Herbert A.S.

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is also found to rely on the NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking pathway (Tang et al., 2009Tang Y. Leao I.C. Coleman E.M. Broughton R.S. Hildreth J.E.K. Deficiency of niemann-pick type C-1 protein impairs release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and results in Gag accumulation in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 7982-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As such, structural elucidation of NPC1/NPC2-mediated lysosomal cholesterol transport will not only lay the grounds for NPC disease treatments but also clarify the intracellular trafficking of endogenous and exogenous cargos (Pfeffer, 2019Pfeffer S.R. NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1)-mediated cholesterol export from lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 1706-1709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NPC1 comprises 3 lumenal domains—the amino-terminal domain (NTD), domain C (also known as the middle lumenal domain [MLD]), and domain I (also known as the CTD)—and 13 transmembrane (TM) passes (Davies and Ioannou, 2000Davies J.P.

The crystal structure of NPC2 shows that the hydrocarbon tail of cholesterol inserts deep into the binding pocket, exposing only the hydroxyl group to the lysosomal lumen (Xu et al., 2007Xu S. Benoff B. Liou H.-L. Lobel P. Stock A.M. Structural basis of sterol binding by NPC2, a lysosomal protein deficient in Niemann-Pick type C2 disease.J. Biol.

In a sense, cholesterol is “solubilized” for handover to NPC1(NTD), which binds cholesterol from the hydroxyl group, a binding fashion complementary to that of NPC2 (Kwon et al., 2009Kwon H.J.

A “hydrophobic handoff” model has been proposed, in which NPC2 is likely to conjugate with NPC1(NTD) to relay the cholesterol (Kwon et al., 2009Kwon H.J. Abi-Mosleh L. Wang M.L. Deisenhofer J.

An elevated collision frequency of the two, however, must rely on other participants as the binding affinity was barely detectable (Gong et al., 2016Gong X. Qian H. Zhou X. Wu J. Wan T. Cao P.

Further downstream, how does the SSD interact with cholesterol? To address these questions, we carried out systematic structural characterizations of human NPC1 and the interactions between NPC1 and NPC2. Our results also unveil the molecular basis for the requirement of low pH during NPC1-mediated cholesterol egress. Mechanistic investigation requires accurate structures. Our previous cryo-EM structure of FL-NPC1 at pH 8.0 was determined to 4.4 Å resolution (Gong et al., 2016Gong X. Qian H. Zhou X. Wu J. Wan T. Cao P. Huang W. Zhao X. Wang X.

Although prominently featured in textbooks, the function of the Meissner corpuscle is unknown. Neubarth et al. generated adult mice without Meissner corpuscles and used them to show that these corpuscles alone mediate behavioral responses to, and perception of, gentle forces (see the Perspective by Marshall and Patapoutian). Each Meissner corpuscle is innervated by two molecularly distinct, yet physiologically similar, mechanosensory neurons. These two neuronal subtypes are developmentally interdependent and their endings are intertwined within the corpuscle. Both Meissner mechanosensory neuron subtypes are homotypically tiled, ensuring uniform and complete coverage of the skin, yet their receptive fields are overlapping and offset with respect to each other.

Forest loss leads to both positive and negative responses of populations and biodiversity, and the temporal lags in population and biodiversity change after forest loss can extend up to half a century.

Finding the combinations of spatial or temporal activity features (such as neuron identity or latency) that are consequential for perception remains challenging. We trained mice to recognize synthetic odors constructed from parametrically defined patterns of optogenetic activation, then measured perceptual changes during extensive and controlled perturbations across spatiotemporal dimensions. We modeled recognition as the matching of patterns to learned templates. The templates that best predicted recognition were sequences of spatially identified units, ordered by latencies relative to each other (with minimal effects of sniff). Within templates, individual units contributed additively, with larger contributions from earlier-activated units. Our synthetic approach reveals the fundamental logic of the olfactory code and provides a general framework for testing links between sensory activity and perception."

Using this device, we demonstrate that repeated activation of oxytocin neurons in male mice can have different effects on pro-social and agonistic behaviors, depending on the social context. Our findings support the social salience hypothesis of oxytocin and emphasize the importance of the environment in the study of social neuromodulators. Our wireless optogenetic device can be easily adapted for use in a variety of behavioral paradigms, which are normally hindered by tethered light delivery or a limited environment."

https://openalex.org/W3035209787,"Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3) is a zinc-dependent hydrolase involved in degrading oligopeptides with 4–12 amino acid residues. It has been associated with several pathophysiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, pain signaling, and cancer cell defense against oxidative stress. However, the physiological substrates and the cellular pathways that are potentially targeted by DPP3 to mediate these effects remain unknown. Here, we show that global DPP3 deficiency in mice (DPP3−/−) affects the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). LC–MS–based profiling of circulating angiotensin peptides revealed elevated levels of angiotensin II, III, IV, and 1–5 in DPP3−/− mice, whereas blood pressure, renin activity, and aldosterone levels remained unchanged. Activity assays using the purified enzyme confirmed that angiotensin peptides are substrates for DPP3. Aberrant angiotensin signaling was associated with substantially higher water intake and increased renal reactive oxygen species formation in the kidneys of DPP3−/− mice. The metabolic changes and altered angiotensin levels observed in male DPP3−/− mice were either absent or attenuated in female DPP3−/− mice, indicating sex-specific differences. Taken together, our observations suggest that DPP3 regulates the RAS pathway and water homeostasis by degrading circulating angiotensin peptides."

Pyroptosis occurs via two pathways: the canonical pathway, signaled by caspase-1, and the noncanonical pathway, regulated by mouse caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5. All inflammatory caspases activate the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D, but caspase-1 mostly activates the inflammatory cytokine precursors prointerleukin-18 and prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL18/pro-IL1β). Here, in vitro cleavage assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that caspase-11 prefers cleaving gasdermin D over the pro-ILs. However, we found that caspase-11 recognizes protein substrates through a mechanism that is different from that of most caspases. Results of kinetics analysis with synthetic fluorogenic peptides indicated that P1′–P4′, the C-terminal gasdermin D region adjacent to the cleavage site, influences gasdermin D recognition by caspase-11. Furthermore, introducing the gasdermin D P1′–P4′ region into pro-IL18 enhanced catalysis by caspase-11 to levels comparable with that of gasdermin D cleavage. Pro-IL1β cleavage was only moderately enhanced by similar substitutions.

The main objective of learning the specificity requirements of a caspase is to use this information to develop specific and selective chemical biology tools for their study in cellular biology and disease models. However, success is limited by the overlap in the preferred peptide sequences, which prevents the generation of selective reagents for individual caspases (7McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Overlapping cleavage motif selectivity of caspases: implications for analysis of apoptotic pathways.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15 (17975551): 322-33110.1038/sj.cdd.4402260Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cleavage sequences have also been explored, aiming to predict natural protein substrates; however, many endogenous substrates are cleaved at suboptimal sites (8Timmer J.C. Salvesen G.S.

Alternative substrate specificity mechanisms, like exosites, enzyme regions distant from the catalytic site that participate in substrate binding, are emerging as mechanisms explaining the discrepancies between consensus sequences and actual cleaved proteins by caspases (9Boucher D.

Investigating these mechanisms is important, because they may reveal novel targeting sites for caspase inhibition. Inflammatory caspases regulate pyroptosis, a form of regulated cell death central to the innate immune response and clearance of pathogens (12Man S.M. Karki R. Kanneganti T.D. Molecular mechanisms and functions of pyroptosis, inflammatory caspases and inflammasomes in infectious diseases.Immunol. Rev. 2017; 277 (28462526): 61-7510.1111/imr.12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Pyroptosis is divided into canonical and noncanonical pathways. Caspase-1 is involved in signaling canonical pyroptosis, whereas mouse caspase-11 and human caspase-4 and -5 regulate the noncanonical pathway. Caspase-1 is activated in protein complexes known as inflammasomes, which are assembled upon recognition of pathogen or damage-associated molecular patterns (13Broz P. Dixit V.M.

In contrast, lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria is the only known activator of the noncanonical pathway and is thought to directly induce the activation of caspases (15Kayagaki N.

The N-terminal gasdermin D domain oligomerizes in the plasma membrane, causing the distinguishing lytic event of pyroptotic cell death (20Ding J. Wang K. Liu W. She Y. Sun Q. Shi J. Sun H. Wang D.C.

A recognized function of gasdermin D is to allow the release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and -18 (pro-IL1β and pro-IL18) (22Evavold C.L. Ruan J. Tan Y. Xia S. Wu H. Kagan J.C.

Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the precursors of these cytokines (pro-IL1β and pro-IL18) are proteolytically activated by caspase-1 (15Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M.

Caspase-11 does not activate the interleukins directly, but caspase-1 is activated downstream of caspase-11 in the noncanonical pathway (15Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M. Vande Walle L. Louie S.

The detrimental effects of autoinflammatory diseases can be halted in part by anti-IL1 therapy, signifying the potent inflammatory nature of this cytokine (25Cavalli G. Dinarello C.A.

The development of inhibitors and probes to selectively target each inflammatory caspase would be beneficial to investigate their mechanisms in cell death signaling and disease and provide a path toward anti-inflammatory therapeutics. One of the main conundrums in the field is the discrepancy of the number of inflammatory caspases in different mammals and the substrates they cleave. Extensive substrate specificity analysis using peptide combinatorial libraries revealed that using traditional active-site-directed strategies is insufficient to selectively target individual inflammatory caspases (6Thornberry N.A.

In contrast, protein substrates can be readily distinguished by caspase-11, leading to the prediction that its specificity is mediated by exosite interactions (24Ramirez M.L.G. Poreba M. Snipas S.J. Groborz K. Drag M. Salvesen G.S. Extensive peptide and natural protein substrate screens reveal that mouse caspase-11 has much narrower substrate specificity than caspase-1.J. Biol.

Indeed, an interaction between gasdermin D and a region of caspase-11 may contribute to catalysis (11Wang K. Sun Q. Zhong X. Zeng M. Zeng H. Shi X. Li Z. Wang Y. Zhao Q. Shao F. Ding J. Structural mechanism for GSDMD targeting by autoprocessed caspases in pyroptosis.Cell. 2020; 180 (32109412): 941-95510.1016/j.cell.2020.02.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) but cannot explain the specificity differences between inflammatory caspases. Therefore, we hypothesize that there are other mechanisms besides the exosite that determine substrate specificity. By using recombinant proteins and peptide substrates, we describe the role of alternative substrate recognition in driving the specificity of inflammatory caspases. Caspase specificity is generally dictated by the S1–S4 pockets that interact with the P1–P4 region of substrates (Fig. 1) (3Poreba M. Strozyk A. Salvesen G.S. Drag M.

We postulated that extended substrate recognition elements account for the restricted specificity of caspase-11 and its human orthologues. The expression of full-length caspase-3 in Escherichia coli results in a fully functional enzyme (29Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemical characteristics of caspases-3, -6, -7, and -8.J. Biol.

We found that the expression of the CARD-deleted version of caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5 resulted in fully functional enzymes, as previously demonstrated for caspase-11 (24Ramirez M.L.G.

We hypothesized that these enzymes are not interchangeable. Biochemical analysis showed that caspase-4 and caspase-5 have very similar specificity in P1–P4 (6Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P.

However, analysis of the human protein substrates revealed a very different picture. Overall, gasdermin D was preferred to the prointerleukins by caspase-4 and caspase-5. However, whereas caspase-4 was more like caspase-1 in its cleavage of gasdermin D and pro-IL18, caspase-5 was more like caspase-11 (Fig. 3). However, caspase-4 does not cleave pro-IL1β, and caspase-5 cleaves it very poorly (Fig. 3). These data revealed that caspases signaling noncanonical pyroptosis prefer gasdermin D as a substrate. Based on the cleavage site sequence of the protein substrates, previous peptidyl substrate library screens have shown that P1–P4 specificity does not determine specificity for protein substrates in these caspases (caspase-4/-5/-11) (6Thornberry N.A.

Extended interactions at the active-site level beyond the P1–P4 sites are a possible mechanism for enhancing activity. An example of this is caspase-2, which has been demonstrated to cleave pentapeptides at rates 10–40 times higher than those of tetrapeptides (42Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. Substrate specificities of caspase family proteases.J. Biol.

Given our previous observations that such interactions occur outside the P1–P4 area and the faster processing of gasdermin D by caspase-11 compared with that of the pro-ILs, we hypothesized that interactions occur at positions outside but proximal to the P1–P4 sites. To investigate such potential interactions, we designed and synthesized extended internally quenched fluorescent (IQF) substrates containing different portions of the mouse gasdermin D sequence around the cleavage site within positions P7–P5′ (Table 1). Caspase-1 was far more efficient at cleaving these substrates than caspase-11 (Fig. 4). Like most caspases, caspase-1 is most influenced by P1–P4. In contrast, caspase-11 is more highly influenced by the prime-side amino acids P1′–P4′ (Fig. 4). These observations confirm that the prime side contains specificity determinants in substrate recognition by inflammatory caspases.Table 1Structures and mass spectrometry analysis of IQF substrates Open table in a new tab Figure 4Extended synthetic substrates revealed potential interactions with the prime side of gasdermin D.

Consequently, we predicted that introducing gasdermin D sequences from this region into pro-IL18 would make this a better substrate for caspase-11. The hypothesis was supported for caspase-11, where we observed a 40-fold increase in cleavage of the mutant containing P1′–P4′ substitution (Fig. 5). In contrast, we observed minimal enhancement in caspase-1 catalysis. We sought to pinpoint which particular subsite has the most influence on"

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Academic Search Premier, Web of Science, and Sociological Abstracts for empirical articles that investigated and quantified relationships between RFS and primary HIV prevention activities outlined by the United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services: condom use, HIV and STI testing, number of sexual partners, injection drug use treatment, medical male circumcision, and PrEP. We included articles in English language published between 2000 and 2020. We coded and analyzed studies based on a conceptual model. We then developed summary tables to describe the relation between RFS variables and the HIV prevention activities and any underlying mechanisms. We used CiteNetExplorer to analyze citation patterns. Results We identified 2881 unique manuscripts and reviewed 29. The earliest eligible study was published in 2001, 41% were from Africa and 48% were from the U.S. RFS measures included attendance at religious services or interventions in religious settings; religious and/or spirituality scales, and measures that represent the influence of religion on behaviors. Twelve studies included multiple RFS measures. Twenty-one studies examined RFS in association with condom use, ten with HIV testing, nine with number of sexual partners, and one with PrEP. Fourteen (48%) documented a positive or protective association between all RFS factors examined and one or more HIV prevention activities. Among studies reporting a positive association, beliefs and values related to sexuality was the most frequently observed mechanism. Among studies reporting negative associations, behavioral norms, social influence, and beliefs and values related to sexuality were observed equally. Studies infrequently cited each other. Conclusion More than half of the studies in this review reported a positive/protective association between RFS and HIV prevention activities, with condom use being the most frequently studied, and all having some protective association with HIV testing behaviors. Beliefs and values related to sexuality are possible mechanisms that could underpin RFS-related HIV prevention interventions. More studies are needed on PrEP and spirituality/subjective religiosity."

https://openalex.org/W3035766860,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) mediates cytosolic DNA-induced innate immune signaling via membrane trafficking. The global identification of proteins that spatiotemporally interact with STING will provide a better understanding of its trafficking mechanisms and of STING signaling pathways. Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) is a powerful technology to identify physiologically relevant protein-protein interactions in living cells. However, biotinylated peptides are rarely detected in the conventional BioID method, which uses streptavidin beads to pull down biotinylated proteins, because the biotin-streptavidin interaction is too strong. As a result, only nonbiotinylated peptides are identified, which cannot be distinguished from peptides of nonspecifically pull-downed proteins. Here, we developed a simple method to efficiently and specifically enrich biotinylated peptides using Tamavidin 2-REV, an engineered avidin-like protein with reversible biotin-binding capability. Using RAW264.7 macrophages stably expressing TurboID-fused STING, we identified and quantified >4,000 biotinylated peptides of STING-proximal proteins. Various endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins were biotinylated in unstimulated cells, and STING activation caused biotinylation of many proteins located in the Golgi and endosomes. These proteins included those known to interact with activated STING, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), several palmitoyl transferases, and p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1). Furthermore, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), an endolysosome-localized antiviral protein, bound to STING at the late activation stage. These dynamic interaction profiles will provide detailed insights into STING signaling; we propose that our approach using Tamavidin 2-REV would be useful for BioID-based and other biotinylation-based peptide identification methods."

Metabolic stress reduces β-cell sensitivity to GLP-1, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that Glp1r expression is heterogeneous among β-cells and that metabolic stress decreases the number of GLP-1R–positive β-cells. Here, analyses of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq sequencing (scRNASeq) data from mouse and human β-cells indicated that significant populations of β-cells do not express the Glp1r gene, supporting heterogeneous GLP-1R expression. To check these results, we used complementary approaches employing FACS coupled with quantitative RT-PCR, a validated GLP-1R antibody, and flow cytometry to quantify GLP-1R promoter activity, gene expression, and protein expression in mouse α-, β-, and δ-cells. Experiments with Glp1r reporter mice and a validated GLP-1R antibody indicated that >90% of the β-cells are GLP-1R positive, contradicting the findings with the scRNASeq data. α-cells did not express Glp1r mRNA and δ-cells expressed Glp1r mRNA but not protein. We also examined the expression patterns of GLP-1R in mouse models of metabolic stress. Multiparous female mice had significantly decreased β-cell Glp1r expression, but no reduction in GLP-1R protein levels or GLP-1R–mediated insulin secretion. These findings suggest caution in interpreting the results of scRNASeq for low-abundance transcripts such as the incretin receptors and indicate that GLP-1R is widely expressed in β-cells, absent in α-cells, and expressed at the mRNA, but not protein, level in δ-cells.

The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are secreted from the gastrointestinal tract following a meal and augment insulin secretion, an effect that is blunted in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (1Nauck M.

Agonists of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) have been useful therapeutics for people with T2D (2Drucker D.J.

However, it is not clear whether these effects are because of joint stimulation of β-cells expressing both incretin receptors, or if populations of β-cells have specific expression of one or the other incretin receptors. Heterogeneity of incretin receptor expression among β-cells has not yet been rigorously tested, but this possibility has significant implications for physiology and therapeutics.

However, to date the contribution of GLP-1R activity to abnormal β-cell function has been limited to the analysis of RNA expression, and it remains unclear if the levels of GLP-1R protein are reduced in dysglycemic states and, if so, whether this occurs in all β-cells. Although a validated GLP-1R antibody has recently been developed (9Biggs E.K. Liang L. Naylor J. Madalli S. Collier R. Coghlan M.P. Baker D.J. Hornigold D.C. Ravn P. Reimann F. Gribble F.M.

In this paper, we describe a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that GLP-1R expression is heterogeneous in β-cells. The work starts with analysis of human and mouse single-cell RNA-Seq data to document the expression of the incretin receptor genes in islets cells. These data suggested significant heterogeneity in incretin receptor expression, which we then expanded upon with studies measuring Glp1r RNA expression and GLP-1R protein presence on individual islet α-, β-, and δ-cells.

This reporter model is a constitutive reporter and GFP+ (Cre+) cells reflect those that express Glp1r promoter activity at any stage of development. Islet cells from Glp1r:mTmG mice were isolated, dispersed, and separated by FACS into GFP+ (Cre+) and tdTomato (Tom+, Cre−) populations (Fig. 2A). Quantification of the distinct cell populations demonstrated that 78% of islets cells were GFP+ and 20% were Tom+ (Fig. 2B). A small percentage (2%) of cells were GFP+/Tom+, but given their low abundance these were not analyzed further. Only GFP+ cells expressed Glp1r mRNA, validating the model (Fig. 2C). To identify the types of cells constituting GFP+ and Tom+ populations, expression of genes specific to α-, β-, and δ-cells were measured by qPCR and expressed relative to whole islet levels. Glucagon (Gcg), defining α-cells, was highly enriched in Tom+ cells and nearly absent in the GFP+ cells (Fig. 2D). Conversely, insulin II (Ins2) and somatostatin (Sst), markers of β- and δ-cells, respectively, were enriched in GFP+ cells and low/absent in Tom+ cells (Fig. 2, E and F). These findings suggest that Glp1r expression coincides with markers for β- and δ-cells, but not α-cells in mouse islets, which aligns with other reports (25DiGruccio M.R. Mawla A.M. Donaldson C.J. Noguchi G.M. Vaughan J. Cowing-Zitron C. van der Meulen T. Huising M.O. Comprehensive alpha, beta and delta cell transcriptomes reveal that ghrelin selectively activates delta cells and promotes somatostatin release from pancreatic islets.Mol. Metab. 2016; 5 (27408771): 449-45810.1016/j.molmet.2016.04.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ins2 expression was nearly undetectable in Tom+ cells, suggesting the number of potential Glp1r-negative β-cells in mouse islets is very low. Although it is possible that an Ins2 signal is diluted by the abundance of α-cells in the Tom+ population, the data from mouse scRNAseq dataset (22Tabula Muris Consortium Single-cell transcriptomics of 20 mouse organs creates a Tabula Muris.Nature. 2018; 562 (30283141): 367-37210.1038/s41586-018-0590-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) (Table 1) would suggest that ∼18% of β-cells are Glp1r negative. This percentage of cells should compose enough of the Tom+ population to produce an Ins2 signal, which was not the case here. This indicates that the number of Glp1r-negative β-cells is substantially lower than 18%, a result incompatible with the hypothesis of heterogeneous Glp1r expression in β-cells generated by the scRNAseq data. To support the results of the Glp1r:mTmG model, a complementary approach was used to assess Glp1r expression in WT islet cells. First, enriched populations of islet cells were separated by FACS (Fig. 3A) based on endogenous FADPH-based fluorescence and side scatter (26Pipeleers D.G. Pipeleers-Marichal M.A. A method for the purification of single A, B and D cells and for the isolation of coupled cells from isolated rat islets.Diabetologia. 1981; 20 (6114890): 654-66310.1007/BF00257436Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Van de Winkle M.

Using this approach, the distribution of cells collected from islets of 17 mice was 22% α-cells, 65% β-cells, and 13% δ-cells (Fig. 3B). These percentages align with those obtained by the Glp1r:mTmG model (Fig. 2B) as well as with previous studies estimating islet cell composition in fixed tissue (28Cabrera O. Berman D.M. Kenyon N.S. Ricordi C. Berggren P.-O. Caicedo A. The unique cytoarchitecture of human pancreatic islets has implications for islet cell function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The enriched populations of cells from 8 of the mice were validated with qPCR to determine expression of Gcg, Ins2, and Sst (Fig. 3, C–E). Gcg and Sst expression were virtually exclusive to the α- and δ-cell populations, respectively. Ins2 was most robustly expressed in β-cells. Because islet cells express relatively high levels of the genes for hormones that are not secreted (e.g. Ins2 in α- and δ-cells (25DiGruccio M.R. Mawla A.M. Donaldson C.J. Noguchi G.M. Vaughan J.

Expression of Sstr2 identified the α-cell population as highly enriched, as did the measures of Slc2a2 and Gal1r for β-cells (Fig. S1, A–C). Glp1r expression was highest in the enriched β-cell population, with lower, but detectable, measures in α- and δ-cells (Fig. 3F). All three endocrine populations have been reported to express the Glp1r at variable levels using a bulk RNA-Seq approach (28Cabrera O. Berman D.M. Kenyon N.S. Ricordi C. Berggren P.-O. Caicedo A. The unique cytoarchitecture of human pancreatic islets has implications for islet cell function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These findings align with those reports and with the robust expression of Glp1r in β- and δ-cells in the Glp1r:mTmG mice. However, the detectable expression of Glp1r in enriched α-cells of WT mice contrasts with the lack of promoter activity in α-cells from Glp1r:mTmG mice. The estimates of Glp1r expression patterns in β-cells assessed by scRNAseq datasets did not align with those produced by with qPCR in FACS-separated islet cells. This discrepancy may reflect methodological shortcomings of scRNAseq when targeting genes expressed at low abundance (29Mawla A.M. Huising M.O. Navigating the depths and avoiding the shallows of pancreatic islet cell transcriptomes.Diabetes. 2019; 68 (31221802): 1380-139310.2337/dbi18-0019Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To rectify the discordant findings and provide an important linkage between Glp1r transcription and translation, an assay to measure protein expression of GLP-1R on individual, live islet cells was developed using antibody Glp1R0017 (9Biggs E.K.

All experiments used the IgG-APC control to set gating parameters (GLP-1R− and GLP-1R+) and serve as an index of nonspecific binding. Dispersed islet cells were treated with GLP1R-APC or IgG-APC and staining determined in enriched β-cells from control and Glp1rβcell−/− mice. β-cells from WT mice had >90% GLP-1R+ staining, whereas staining in the cells from Glp1rβcell−/− mice was comparable to the IgG control (Fig. 4A). As a complementary approach, GLP1R-APC binding was also tested in Glp1r:mTmG mice to compare Glp1r promoter activity with protein expression. Over 90% of GFP+ cells stained GLP-1R+ and virtually all (>97%) of Tom+ cells did not stain with the antibody (GLP-1R−) (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W3035383474,"Background Organizational readiness for change is a key factor in success or failure of electronic health record (EHR) system implementations. Readiness is a multifaceted and multilevel abstract construct encompassing individual and organizational aspects, which makes it difficult to assess. Available tools for assessing readiness need to be tested in different contexts. Objective To identify and assess relevant variables that determine readiness to implement an EHR in oncology in a low-and-middle income setting. Methods At the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI), a 100-bed tertiary oncology center in Uganda,we conducted a cross-sectional survey using the Paré model. This model has 39 indicator variables (Likert-scale items) for measuring 9 latent variables that contribute to readiness. We analyzed data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). In addition, we collected comments that we analyzed by qualitative content analysis and sentiment analysis as a way of triangulating the Likert-scale survey responses. Results One hundred and forty-six clinical and non-clinical staff completed the survey, and 116 responses were included in the model. The measurement model showed good indicator reliability, discriminant validity, and internal consistency. Path coefficients for 6 of the 9 latent variables (i.e. vision clarity, change appropriateness, change efficacy, presence of an effective champion, organizational flexibility, and collective self-efficacy) were statistically significant at p < 0.05. The R2 for the outcome variable (organizational readiness) was 0.67. The sentiments were generally positive and correlated well with the survey scores (Pearson’s r = 0.73). Perceived benefits of an EHR included improved quality, security and accessibility of clinical data, improved care coordination, reduction of errors, and time and cost saving. Recommended considerations for successful implementation include sensitization, training, resolution of organizational conflicts and computer infrastructure. Conclusion Change management during EHR implementation in oncology in low- and middle- income setting should focus on attributes of the change and the change targets, including vision clarity, change appropriateness, change efficacy, presence of an effective champion, organizational flexibility, and collective self-efficacy. Particularly, issues of training, computer skills of staff, computer infrastructure, sensitization and strategic implementation need consideration."

NPCs have a limited lifespan and are depleted near the time of birth. Epigenetic factors are implicated in the maintenance of organ-restricted progenitors such as NPCs, but the chromatin-based mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, using a combination of gene targeting, chromatin profiling, and single-cell RNA analysis, we examined the role of the murine histone 3 Lys-27 (H3K27) methyltransferases EZH1 (enhancer of zeste 1) and EZH2 in NPC maintenance. We found that EZH2 expression correlates with NPC growth potential and that EZH2 is the dominant H3K27 methyltransferase in NPCs and epithelial descendants. Surprisingly, NPCs lacking H3K27 trimethylation maintained their progenitor state but cycled slowly, leading to a smaller NPC pool and formation of fewer nephrons. Unlike Ezh2 loss of function, dual inactivation of Ezh1 and Ezh2 triggered overexpression of the transcriptional repressor Hes-related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1 (Hey1), down-regulation of Six2, and unscheduled activation of Wnt4-driven differentiation, resulting in early termination of nephrogenesis and severe renal dysgenesis. Double-mutant NPCs also overexpressed the SIX family member Six1. However, in this context, SIX1 failed to maintain NPC stemness. At the chromatin level, EZH1 and EZH2 restricted accessibility to AP-1–binding motifs, and their absence promoted a regulatory landscape akin to differentiated and nonlineage cells.

NPC stemness is governed by a core set of transcription factors, e.g. SIX1/SIX2, OSR1, WT1, SALL1, EYA1, and PAX2, and secreted growth factors, e.g. FGF9, FGF20, and BMP7.

Profiling the accessible genome utilizing ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq in native mouse NPCs demonstrated dynamic age-related changes in chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity and suggested that the age-related decline in NPC stemness may reflect differential accessibility to developmental regulators (16Hilliard S.

Studies in which the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) member EED was genetically ablated in NPCs revealed that EED deficiency induced loss of H3K27me3 from NPCs and descendant renal epithelial cells and caused depletion of Six2+ progenitors accompanied by up-regulation of the differentiation gene Lhx1 (11). NPCEed−/− mice developed a nephron deficit as a result of the imbalance between NPC renewal and differentiation. However, EED does not possess methyltransferase activity and acts by reading H3K27me2/3 and recruiting the catalytic components of PRC2: Ezh1 and Ezh2 (Enhancer of zeste1 and 2). Accordingly, the present study was designed to delineate the specific component of PRC2 responsible for H3K27me3 deposition in NPCs and their individual contributions to NPC stemness and maintenance. Our studies reveal that although Ezh2 is the dominant (if not only) H3K27 trimethyltransferase in nephron progenitors and epithelial progeny, its role is limited to cell renewal. Although Ezh1 is dispensable, it cooperates with Ezh2 in restraining the differentiation program, maintenance of lineage identity, and control of chromatin accessibility.

We compared the developmental expression of PRC2 components in embryonic (E14.5 and E16.5) and neonatal (P2) Six2GFP+NPCs and found that the temporal expression of Ezh1, Ezh2, Suz12, and Eed is similar to that of Six2: high in younger NPCs and declining with time in more committed NPCs (Fig. 1A). Both Ezh1 and Ezh2 harbor a catalytic Set domain that methylates H3K27 moieties. However, their individual roles vary by age, tissue, and cell type (19Kouznetsova V.L. Tchekanov A. Li X. Yan X. Tsigelny I.F. Polycomb repressive 2 complex: molecular mechanisms of function.Protein Sci. 2019; 28 (31095801): 1387-139910.1002/pro.3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine the functional redundancy between Ezh1 and Ezh2 in NPCs, we crossed BAC-transgenic Six2GFP-Cre(TGC) and R26R:Ezh2fl/fl:Ezh1−/−(germline) mice to generate NPCEzh2−/− and compound Ezh1+/− NPCEzh2−/− and Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− mice and to allow permanent labeling of NPCEzh2−/− progenitors. In developing Six2TGC kidneys (control E15.5), nuclear H3K27me3 is enriched in NPCs and to a lesser extent in the rest of the nephrogenic zone (Fig. 1B). Unexpectedly, H3K27me3 expression was unaffected in Ezh1−/− kidneys (Fig. 1C). In comparison, NPCEzh2−/− kidneys showed a complete lack of H3K27me3 expression in NPCs and descendant nascent tubular epithelia, whereas H3K27me3 staining remained intact in the surrounding stroma and ureteric bud tips/collecting ducts (Fig. 1D). Co-staining of H3K27me3 and GFP (a surrogate marker of Six2Cre expression) clearly shows a complete absence of H3K27me3 in NPCEzh2−/− (Fig. 1E). In addition, co-staining of H3K27me3 with the R26R tdTomato reporter confirmed a lack of H3K27me3 in NPCEzh2−/− and descendant renal tubules (Fig. 1F), as compared with NPCEzh2+/− (Fig. 1G). Because H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are two mutually exclusive marks, we also demonstrate that inactivation of Ezh2, but not Ezh1, results in a net gain of H3K27ac (Fig. 1, H, I, H′, and I′). Of note, enhanced H3K27Ac was more pronounced in nascent epithelia than mesenchymal progenitors of NPCEzh2−/− kidneys (Fig. 1, H′ and I′). This may be related to higher abundance of histone deacetylases 1 and 2 in NPCs than nascent nephrons (10Liu H. Chen S. Yao X. Li Y. Chen C.H. Liu J. Saifudeen Z. El-Dahr S.S. Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 regulate the transcriptional programs of nephron progenitors and renal vesicles.Development. 2018; 145 (29712641): dev15361910.1242/dev.153619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, Ezh2 is the dominant (if not sole) H3K27 methyltransferase in NPCs and nascent nephrons during nephrogenesis. Histologic analysis and immunostaining for markers of NPCs, induced mesenchyme and proximal tubules in germline Ezh1−/− mice revealed normal nephrogenesis as compared with controls (Fig. S1). At E15.5, developing NPCEzh2−/− kidneys, on the other hand, had a thinner nephrogenic zone and exhibited a loss of Cited1 (a marker of the self-renewing NPCs) and a thinner Six2+ cap than NPCEzh2+/− kidneys (Fig. 2, A–D′). Moreover, NPCEzh2−/− kidneys had fewer nascent nephrons expressing Lhx1, Pax8, and Wn4 (Fig. 2, E–H′). FACS analysis of GFP+ cells revealed 30% reduction in the percentage of GFP+/total cells (Fig. 2I) and proliferating GFP+ cells in the Six2+ compartment of NPCEzh2−/− as compared with NPCEzh2+/− kidneys (Fig. 2J). Cell cycle analysis also showed that GFP+NPCEzh2−/− have longer G1–S and shorter S and G2–M phases (Fig. 2K). There was no significant difference in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3+) between the two groups (not shown). At 30 days of postnatal life, NPCEzh2−/− kidneys had ∼30% lower glomerular counts/section than NPCEzh2+/− kidneys (Fig. 2L). Thus, whereas inactivation of Ezh1 has no discernable effects on nephrogenesis, inactivation of Ezh2 impairs NPC proliferation and reduces the final nephron number. Although expression of Cited1 (a marker of self-renewing NPCs) was markedly down-regulated in NPCEzh2−/− kidneys, there was only a modest reduction (20–30%) in GFP+ cells and glomeruli. We do not have an explanation at present for the dissociation between Cited1 expression and the number of nephrons in NPCEzh2−/−. However, it is important to note that although Cited1 is an important marker of the uncommitted NPCs, its absence has no functional implications, and it does not mean that NPCs are not present. Indeed Six2-expressing cells are not completely missing, which may account for the number of nephrons still present in the Ezh2 mutants. It should be pointed out that NPCEzh2−/− mice survive into adulthood and are fertile. Previous studies have demonstrated that Ezh1 can mediate chromatin compaction in a H3K27me-independent manner (20Margueron R. Li G. Sarma K. Blais A. Zavadil J. Woodcock C.L. Dynlacht B.D. Reinberg D. Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32 (19026781): 503-51810.1016/j.molcel.2008.11.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This function may be masked by Ezh2. To uncover the redundancy between Ezh1 and Ezh2 in nephrogenesis, we compared NPCEzh2−/− kidneys with those of Ezh1+/− NPCEzh2−/− and Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− kidneys. Deletion of all four Ezh1/2 alleles caused early postnatal demise associated with severe kidney dysgenesis, poorly developed nephrogenic zone, and scattered cysts (Fig. 3, A–B″). These structural changes are accompanied by up-regulation of the Notch transcriptional repressor, Hey1 (Fig. 3, C–C″), and depletion of Six2+NPCs (Fig. 3, D–D″′). Six2 maintains NPC stemness partly via transcriptional repression of Wnt4 (6,8). Therefore, we examined the effects of Ezh1/2 inactivation on Wnt4 gene expression by in situ hybridization. P0 NPCEzh2−/− kidneys maintained the WT pattern of Wnt4 in pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles located beneath the ureteric bud branch (Fig. 3E). By contrast, P0 Ezh1+/− NPCEzh2−/− and Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− kidneys exhibited ectopic expression of Wnt4 in NPCs located dorsal to the ureteric bud branch tip (Fig. 3, E and E″). Similarly, the differentiation markers, Lef1 and Lhx1, are ectopically expressed in NPCs (Fig. 3, F–G″). Importantly, we determined that ectopic Wnt4 expression in Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− cells is not due to ectopic expression of its upstream activator, Wnt9b, which remains confined to the ureteric bud stalk as in control Six2TGC kidneys (Fig. S2). At E15.5 and E17.5, compared with NPCEzh2−/−, inactivation of all four Ezh1/2 alleles caused noticeable reductions in Six2+NPCs, nascent nephrons and cell proliferation (Figs. S3 and S4). Of note, ectopic expression of Lef1 in NPCs was apparent at E17.5 (Fig. S4, D–D″). Thus, the concerted action of Ezh1 and Ezh2 is required to restrain unscheduled activation of the differentiation program toward the end of nephrogenesis. To determine whether Ezh1/2 inactivation promotes cell autonomous NPC differentiation, we cultured Six2GFP+ NPCs from control Six2TGC and Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells in F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium–based KO medium that lacks renewal factors such as Fgf9 and thus favors differentiation. At 24 h of culture, staining for Six2 and E-cadherin revealed that Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells underwent a much more robust mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition than controls (Fig. S5). To gain a deeper insight into how Ezh1/2 inactivation affects NPC gene expression, Six2GFP+ NPCs from E16.5 Six2TGC (control), NPCEzh2−/−, Ezh1+/−NPCEzh2−/−, and Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− kidneys were profiled using 10× Chromium scRNA-seq (10× Genomics). Sorted cells (ranging in number from 6574 to 11,382 cells/group) were initially analyzed together using Seurat's version 3.0 data set integration approach (21Butler A. Hoffman P. Smibert P. Papalexi E. Satija R. Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 (29608179): 411-42010.1038/nbt.4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). Unbiased clustering using t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) revealed eight cell clusters (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6). Our NPC clustering data were in close agreement to those recently reported by Combes et al. (22Combes A.N. Phipson B. Lawlor K.T. Dorison A. Patrick R. Zappia L. Harvey R.P. Oshlack A. Little M.H. Single cell analysis of the developing mouse kidney provides deeper insight into marker gene expression and ligand-receptor crosstalk.Development. 2019; 146 (31118232): dev17867310.1242/dev.178673Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in Six2GFP+ from E14.5 Six2GCE mouse kidney. Cluster NPC0 had high expression of uncommitted progenitor genes such as Cited1; NPC1, 2, and 5 had high levels of cell cycle genes; NPC3 had high expression of early committed cells, whereas NPC6 had cells committed to differentiation (e.g. Wnt4, Tmem100); NPC4 cluster featured cells rich in Spry2 and Notch2. Spry2 is a negative regulator of FGF signaling that is important in NPC maintenance (23Barak H. Huh S.H. Chen S. Jeanpierre C. Martinovic J. Parisot M. Bole-Feysot C. Nitschké P. Salomon R. Antignac C. Ornitz D.M. Kopan R. FGF9 and FGF20 maintain the stemness of nephron progenitors in mice and man.Dev.

Notch signaling is also known to regulate NPC maintenance (24Chung E. Deacon P. Park J.S. Notch is required for the formation of all nephron segments and primes nephron progenitors for differentiation.Development. 2017; 144 (29113990): 4530-453910.1242/dev.156661Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A Spry2/Notch2-enriched cluster was previously described by Combes et al. (22Combes A.N. Phipson B. Lawlor K.T. Dorison A. Patrick R. Zappia L. Harvey R.P. Oshlack A. Little M.H. Single cell analysis of the developing mouse kidney provides deeper insight into marker gene expression and ligand-receptor crosstalk.Development. 2019; 146 (31118232): dev17867310.1242/dev.178673Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in E14.5 mouse NPCs and is thought to represent a transitional state between nephron progenitor and early nascent nephrons. Lastly, the NPC7 cluster represents nephron progenitor-stromal cluster. A previous scRNA-seq study has shown that individual NPCs exhibit stochastic expression of stroma markers (25Brunskill E.W. Park J.S. Chung E. Chen F. Magella B. Potter S.S. Single cell dissection of early kidney development: multilineage priming.Development. 2014; 141 (25053437): 3093-310110.1242/dev.110601Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The identity of these clusters can be further seen in the heat maps in Fig. 4 (B–D), which depict representative markers of each cluster. Fig. 4E depicts feature plots, generated using the feature plot function of Seurat 3.0, of the relative enrichment of differentiation markers (Ccnd1, Jag1, and Lhx1) (cluster 6) as compared with Six2. A heat map and volcano plots of representative markers of progenitor and differentiating cells in our scRNA-seq analysis are depicted in Fig. 5 (A and B) and show that deletion of one or two Ezh1 alleles on Ezh2-null background decreases progenitor gene expression and increases differentiation gene expression, indicating that Ezh1/2 inactivation reprograms the timing of NPC differentiation. A previous study in which the Polycomb member Eed was deleted in NPCs found persistent expression of Six2 mRNA in mutant nascent epithelial cells (11Zhang L. Ettou S. Khalid M. Taglienti M. Jain D. Jung Y.L. Seager C. Liu Y. Ng K.H. Park P.J. Kreidberg J.A. EED, a member of the polycomb group, is required for nephron differentiation and the maintenance of nephron progenitor cells.Development. 2018; 145 (29945864): dev15714910.1242/dev.157149Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, our scRNA analysis revealed a higher number of Six2-expressing cells in the NPCEzh2−/− group as compared with other genotypes (Fig. 5B). The biological significance of this finding is unknown at present because we do not observe a corresponding persistence of Six2 protein in mutant NPCs (Fig. 3, D–D″). The imbalance of progenitor and differentiation gene expression in Ezh1/2 double-mutant NPCs is further illustrated in the dot plots shown in Fig. 5 (C–E). In addition, consistent with the findings in Fig. 3 (C–C″), we confirmed up-regulation of Hey1 gene expression in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells (Fig. 5F), which may contribute to Six2 repression (26Fujimura S. Jiang Q. Kobayashi C. Nishinakamura R. Notch2 activation in the embryonic kidney depletes nephron progenitors.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21 (20299358): 803-81010.1681/ASN.2009040353Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Other interesting changes include activation of the immediate early genes and members of the AP-1 transcription factor family (c-fos, c-Jun, and JunB) and down-regulation of JunD in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− as compared with control NPCs (Fig. 5G), which could stimulate cell renewal or differentiation, depending on the composition of the AP-1 complex. Notably, the observed induction of AP-1 component expression in double-mutant NPCs occurs independently of upstream growth factor expression (Bmp7, Fgf9, and Fgf20) (Fig. 5A) previously shown to mediate AP-1 activation in NPCs (27Muthukrishnan S.D. Yang X. Friesel R. Oxburgh L. Concurrent BMP7 and FGF9 signalling governs AP-1 function to promote self-renewal of nephron progenitor cells.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26634297): 1002710.1038/ncomms10027Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further determine the effects of Ezh1/2 inactivation on timing of NPC differentiation, we used Monocle 2.0 to construct pseudo-time trajectories in control and mutant NPCs after selecting for cells enriched in the differentiation gene, Lhx1. In control Six2TGC NPCs, Lhx1-enriched cells are clustered toward the end of trajectory (Fig. 6A). In comparison, Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− NPCs exhibit two major clusters of Lhx1-expressing cells at both ends of the trajectory (Fig. 6B). We next examined whether reprograming of Ezh1/2-mutant NPCs is accompanied by reorganization of ATAC-accessible chromatin. We identified ∼73,000–98,000 peaks representing accessible “open” chromatin regions in the four groups of E16.5 GFP+ NPCs (Fig. 7A). We then focused on comparing Six2TGC and Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells, which show the most significant differences by principal component analysis (Fig. 7B). We next compared the accessible chromatin regions of Six2TGC and Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells using DiffBind R (RRID:SCR_012918). The affinity analysis is a quantitative approach to assess for differential chromatin access at consensus peaks. This method takes read densities computed over consensus peak regions and provides a statistical estimate of the difference in read concentration between the two conditions. Differential chromatin accessibility depicted in Fig. 7C is expressed as a log fold change of at least 2-fold and a p value of < 0.05 and reveals the relative gain of open chromatin regions in Six2TGC as compared with the gain in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/−. Direct comparison of ATAC-seq tracks revealed increased chromatin accessibility at promoter and en-hancer regions of Wnt4, Pax8, and Lhx1 in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells (Fig. 7D), concordant with increased gene expression (Fig. 5D). We also noted a loss of chromatin accessibility at a putative regulatory region upstream of Notch2 but a gain in open chromatin in Hey1 in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells (Fig. 7E), in support of gene expression changes (Fig. 5G). These findings suggest that Ezh1 and Ezh2 restrain chromatin accessibility in NPCs to prevent unscheduled activation of the differentiation program. We next used the Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment (HOMER) tool to identify putative DNA-binding motifs in open chromatin regions of E16.5 Six2TGC and Ezh1−/− NPCEzh2−/− cells. Six2TGC NPCs showed enrichment for the binding motifs of core transcription factors Six2, Hoxc9, Hoxd11, WT1, and TEAD (Fig. 7F). In comparison, open chromatin regions in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells displayed preferential access to binding motifs of the AP-1 transcription factor family (Fig. 7G). This finding is quite interesting because RNA profiling has shown enhanced expression of several members of the AP-1 family (Fig. 5G), raising the possibility that Ezh1 and Ezh2 link growth factor signaling to the AP-1–responsive epigenome. We next used the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to compare the cis-regulatory elements within the accessible chromatin regions. Gene Ontology biological terms predicted processes related to nephrogenesis, apoptosis, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in Six2TGC NPCs (Fig. 7H). In comparison, the accessible regulatory regions in Ezh1−/−NPCEzh2−/− cells predicted more differentiated functions such as regulation of cell shape and metabolic/energy functions (Fig. 7I). Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain embryonic lineage fidelity via repression of non–cell type–specific genes (28Deevy O. Bracken A.P. PRC2 functions in development and congenital disorders.Development. 2019; 146 (31575610): dev18135410.1242/dev.181354Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We asked whether this function is also important in organ-restricted progenitors such as NPCs. scRNA analysis revealed that nonlineage genes, many of which are PRC2-regulated genes such as Hoxd13, Esx, Six1, Foxa1, Tbx15, and Nkx genes, are i"

Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) has been reported to play diverse roles in different tissues during the development of metabolic disorders. We previously reported that SHP2 inhibition in macrophages results in increased cytokine production. Here, we investigated the association between SHP2 inhibition in macrophages and the development of metabolic diseases. Unexpectedly, we found that mice with a conditional SHP2 knockout in macrophages (cSHP2-KO) have ameliorated metabolic disorders. cSHP2-KO mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) gained less body weight and exhibited decreased hepatic steatosis, as well as improved glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity, compared with HFD-fed WT littermates. Further experiments revealed that SHP2 deficiency leads to hyperactivation of caspase-1 and subsequent elevation of interleukin 18 (IL-18) levels, both in vivo and in vitro. Of note, IL-18 neutralization and caspase-1 knockout reversed the amelioration of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance observed in the cSHP2-KO mice. Administration of two specific SHP2 inhibitors, SHP099 and Phps1, improved HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Our findings provide detailed insights into the role of macrophagic SHP2 in metabolic disorders. We conclude that pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 may represent a therapeutic strategy for the management of type 2 diabetes."

Previous biochemical studies have revealed that PLB interacts with a specific inhibitory site on SERCA, and low-resolution structural evidence suggests that PLB interacts with distinct alternative sites on SERCA. High-resolution details of the structural determinants of SERCA regulation have been elusive because of the dynamic nature of the regulatory complex. In this study, we used computational approaches to develop a structural model of SERCA–PLB interactions to gain a mechanistic understanding of PLB-mediated SERCA transport regulation. We combined steered molecular dynamics and membrane protein–protein docking experiments to achieve both a global search and all-atom force calculations to determine the relative affinities of PLB for candidate sites on SERCA. We modeled the binding of PLB to several SERCA conformations, representing different enzymatic states sampled during the calcium transport catalytic cycle. The results of the steered molecular dynamics and docking experiments indicated that the canonical PLB-binding site (comprising transmembrane helices M2, M4, and M9) is the preferred site. This preference was even more stringent for a superinhibitory PLB variant. Interestingly, PLB-binding specificity became more ambivalent for other SERCA conformers. These results provide evidence for polymorphic PLB interactions with novel sites on M3 and with the outside of the SERCA helix M9.

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) family of transporters is responsible for sequestering calcium into the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum, creating a reservoir for intracellular Ca2+ signaling. These transporters are important in all cell types and are tightly controlled, such that Ca2+ handling can rapidly adjust to changing physiological demands (1Primeau J.O. Armanious G.P. Fisher M.E.

Calcium transport is reduced under resting conditions in the unstimulated heart through an inhibitory interaction with a single-span transmembrane peptide, phospholamban (PLB), which decreases the affinity of SERCA for its substrate, Ca2+. The mechanism for this may be slowing the rate of the structural transition that occurs after binding of the first Ca ion (3Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R.

Thus, PLB regulation of SERCA provides an “adrenaline trigger” to increase Ca2+ transport and increase cardiac output during exercise. The importance of this regulatory mechanism is underscored by the association of disordered calcium handling and heart disease (9Zima A.V. Bovo E. Mazurek S.R. Rochira J.A. Li W. Terentyev D.

Calcium-dependent conformational changes in the SERCA–PLB complex are likely to include alterations in the canonical PLB-binding site on SERCA, a cleft composed of transmembrane helices M2, M6, and M9. Different SERCA crystal structures have captured various enzymatic states of SERCA (26Møller J.V. Olesen C. Winther A.M. Nissen P. The sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase: design of a perfect chemi-osmotic pump.Q. Rev.

Thus, structural transitions between SERCA conformers are expected to alter contacts with PLB, which may account for our previous observation that the affinity of PLB for SERCA is modestly reduced by calcium binding to SERCA (18Bidwell P. Blackwell D.J. Hou Z. Zima A.V. Robia S.L. Phospholamban binds with differential affinity to calcium pump conformers.J. Biol.

Alternatively, transitions between enzymatic states (Fig. 1b) may result in large-scale reorganization of the SERCA–PLB quaternary structure. In particular, we previously hypothesized that the PLB transmembrane domain could become displaced from the canonical PLB-binding cleft and translocate to a noninhibitory site on SERCA (18Bidwell P. Blackwell D.J. Hou Z. Zima A.V. Robia S.L. Phospholamban binds with differential affinity to calcium pump conformers.J. Biol.

One possible alternative PLB-binding site is suggested from comparison with a closely related P-type ATPase, the Na,K-ATPase (NKA). X-ray crystallography (27Ogawa H. Shinoda T. Cornelius F.

Another accessory binding site was suggested by electron crystallography of SERCA and PLB, which involves an interaction of PLB with transmembrane segment M3 of SERCA (Fig. 1a, red) (30Stokes D.L.

Like the canonical site, the putative novel sites undergo significant structural changes during the SERCA transport cycle (Fig. 1b). These previous studies suggest novel regulatory complex configurations, but higher resolution models are required to reveal the mechanistic significance of these alternative modes of PLB binding. Computational methods offer a promising route to such high-resolution information about protein–protein interactions, especially when paired with experimental data. By virtue of their native environment embedded in a lipid bilayer, membrane protein interactions are among the most difficult to measure, model, and simulate. However, the interaction of SERCA with PLB is an excellent membrane protein complex for evaluation by computational structural biology methods. X-ray crystallography has mapped out nearly every step in the SERCA transport cycle (Fig. 1b), revealing the different conformations of the intermediate enzymatic states (26Møller J.V. Olesen C. Winther A.M. Nissen P. The sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase: design of a perfect chemi-osmotic pump.Q. Rev.

Moreover, a structure that reveals key aspects of the SERCA–PLB complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1a, 4KYT) (12Akin B.L. Hurley T.D. Chen Z. Jones L.R. The structural basis for phospholamban inhibition of the calcium pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol.

This breakthrough was enabled by a mutant form of PLB that greatly increased its affinity and inhibitory potency. The degree to which this mutant recapitulates the regulatory complex structure of the WT protein is unknown. In addition, the crystal structure revealed an unexpected E1-like conformation of SERCA bound by PLB. How PLB may interact with other SERCA conformations is another unanswered question. This wealth of structural information about the SERCA regulatory complex represents an excellent foundation for analysis. However, the complexity of the system creates challenges in capturing a full structural description of the regulatory complex. This structure comprises more than 1,000 residues embedded in a lipid bilayer environment and samples numerous conformational states. Methods for modeling protein–protein interactions are well-established for soluble proteins (34Lensink M.F. Velankar S. Wodak S.J. Modeling protein–protein and protein–peptide complexes: CAPRI 6th edition.Proteins. 2017; 85 (27865038): 359-37710.1002/prot.25215Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); however, progress for membrane proteins has been delayed because of the paucity of known structures (35Hendrickson W.A. Atomic-level analysis of membrane–protein structure.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23 (27273628): 464-46710.1038/nsmb.3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and difficulty accounting for the lipid bilayer. Applicable methods include molecular dynamics (MD), which simulates the time-evolved behavior of a macromolecular system using Newton's equation of motion. Of the available computational techniques, molecular dynamics most accurately represents the lipid bilayer including atoms in each lipid molecule, but it is computationally expensive, even with enhanced sampling techniques. This limits the number of binding sites and modes of binding that can be evaluated. In contrast, protein docking aims to predict the best binding conformation between two macromolecular partners (36Salmaso V. Moro S. Bridging molecular docking to molecular dynamics in exploring ligand–protein recognition process: an overview.Front. Pharmacol. 2018; 9 (30186166): 92310.3389/fphar.2018.00923Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, a handful of protein–protein docking methods have been adapted to account for the membrane (37Alford R.F. Koehler Leman J. Weitzner B.D. Duran A.M. Tilley D.C. Elazar A. Gray J.J. An integrated framework advancing membrane protein modeling and design.PLoS Comput.

Although these methods are faster to compute and can examine both where and how macromolecular partners bind in an unbiased manner, many of the membrane-adapted methods are so far validated only on a small data set. When performed together, molecular dynamics and protein–protein docking can provide complementary information about ideal binding conformations. To benefit from their respective advantages and minimize their limitations, we used a computational approach that integrates both methods. For molecular dynamics, we chose to employ steered molecular dynamics (SMD) (40Izrailev S. Stepaniants S. Isralewitz B. Kosztin D. Lu H. Molnar F. Wriggers W. Schulten K. Steered molecular dynamics.in: Deuflhard P. Hermans J. Leimkuhler B. Mark A.E. Reich S. Skeel R.D. Computational Molecular Dynamics: Challenges, Methods, Ideas. Springer, Berlin1999: 39-65Crossref Google Scholar): a well-established technique for examining protein–protein interactions by inducing receptor–ligand unbinding on an accessible time scale (Fig. 1c, Pulling). Importantly, SMD offers the opportunity to quantify the unbinding force required to extract PLB bound to a candidate site in the context of an all-atom lipid bilayer, with peak force taken as an index of the affinity of PLB for that site. For molecular docking, we used RosettaMPDock: a tool that combines soluble Rosetta protein–protein docking (41Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Protein–protein docking with simultaneous optimization of rigid-body displacement and side-chain conformations.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331 (12875852): 281-29910.1016/S0022-2836(03)00670-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) with a membrane protein framework that accounts for the position, orientation, and physical chemistry of the lipid bilayer (37Alford R.F. Koehler Leman J. Weitzner B.D. Duran A.M. Tilley D.C. Elazar A. Gray J.J. An integrated framework advancing membrane protein modeling and design.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 (26325167): e100439810.1371/journal.pcbi.1004398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c, Docking). We applied these techniques to model the relative binding of PLB to three conformations of SERCA (Fig. 1a) that represent major intermediates in the calcium transport cycle (Fig. 1b). Together, these techniques suggest where and how PLB binds to the SERCA pump, providing insight into the structural determinants of the regulatory interaction of PLB with different enzymatic states of SERCA. To test whether PLB may bind to putative alternative sites, we performed steered molecular dynamics and protein–protein docking of PLB to different conformations of SERCA. These conformations are sampled as SERCA progresses through the catalytic cycle (Fig. 1b), binding calcium ions from the cytoplasm and transporting them into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we examined three key SERCA conformations (Fig. 1a): 1) the calcium-free E1-like state bound by PLB (represented by 4KYT); 2), the calcium-free E2 state (represented by 3AR4) (42Toyoshima C. Yonekura S. Tsueda J. Iwasawa S. Trinitrophenyl derivatives bind differently from parent adenine nucleotides to Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of Ca2+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21239683): 1833-183810.1073/pnas.1017659108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which is characterized by a more open PLB-binding groove compared with 4KYT; and 3) the calcium-bound E1 state (represented by 1SU4) (43Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 A resolution.Nature. 2000; 405 (10864315): 647-65510.1038/35015017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). The starting structure of the PLB TM domain was taken from the PLB–SERCA complex 4KYT. The cytoplasmic domain of PLB was not detected in this X-ray structure and was omitted from the SMD simulations. Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated that the transmembrane domain is sufficient for binding and inhibition of SERCA (44Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Phospholamban regulates the Ca2+-ATPase through intramembrane interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (8702967): 21726-2173110.1074/jbc.271.36.21726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To perform SMD simulations, the SERCA residue Cα atoms positions were first restrained by applying a spring force to each Cα atom, preventing significant deviations from the starting position. Pulling force was applied uniformly to Cα residues of PLB, with force directed away from the center of mass of the candidate site on the SERCA TM domain. Fig. 2a quantifies the force applied to PLB (versus time) for three repeated simulations of PLB interacting with the canonical cleft of 4KYT beginning with the original orientation of PLB in the crystal structure. As the simulation progressed, the number of interacting residues decreased until the interaction was broken. As pulling progressed, force increased to a maximum and then rapidly declined to a nonzero plateau. The peak force represents the point at which the PLB–SERCA complex ruptured and was quantified as an index of binding affinity. The plateau force was due to viscous drag of the lipid bilayer after the loss of the protein–protein contacts. For the equilibrated PLB–SERCA crystal structure (4KYT), we determined a peak force of 1,292 ± 69 kJ/mol/nm (error is standard deviation for n = 3). The simulation was then repeated for four different PLB orientations, rotating the helix around its long axis by 90°, 180°, and 270°. Simulations of alternative axial orientations showed ∼30% lower peak force (Table 1 and Fig. 2, b and c), which is consistent with the native orientation of PLB in the X-ray crystal structure being the most stable configuration. z-score analysis is given in Table S1.Table 1Summary of PLB interactions with different SERCA states, quantified by steered molecular dynamicsSERCA stateBinding locationMean rupture force0°90°180°270°kJ/mol/nmE1-like calcium-free (4KYT)M3546 ± 53526 ± 41485 ± 38550 ± 27M6/M91,292 ± 69982 ± 3838 ± 31914 ± 84M9686 ± 46731 ± 45688 ± 27616 ± 44E2 calcium-free (3AR4)M3544 ± 20640 ± 52698 ± 14572 ± 9M6/M9848 ± 29814 ± 22729 ± 40720 ± 94M9658 ± 40580 ± 87811 ± 12838 ± 108E1 calcium-bound (1SU4)M3606 ± 49655 ± 23629 ± 25601 ± 39M6/M9871 ± 25775 ± 97833 ± 81766 ± 15M9682 ± 32681 ± 55736 ± 88749 ± 60 Open table in a new tab We performed SMD experiments comparing PLB bound to the canonical M6/M9 site with PLB bound to alternative sites to M3 or to the outside of M9, with three repeated trajectories simulated for each orientation (Fig. S1). The average peak force associated with the alternative sites was reduced by ∼50% compared with the canonical site. Binding to M3 or the outside of M9 was modestly improved by axial rotation of the PLB transmembrane domain by 270° or 90°, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2, b and c), but rupture forces were still lower than those observed for various axial orientations of PLB at the canonical site. The data suggest that PLB binds best to the M6/M9 site in the E1-like conformation captured in the SERCA–PLB crystal structure. When bound to the canonical site, PLB interacts with side chains of SERCA helices M4, M6, and M9. In contrast, when docked to the outside of M9 in the manner of binding of FXYD proteins with M9 of the Na,K-ATPase (28Shinoda T. Ogawa H. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C.

Next, we measured the relative binding of PLB to different conformations of SERCA to test how PLB affinity might change as a result of SERCA structural transitions during the catalytic cycle. Repeated SMD simulations revealed that peak rupture force for PLB bound to the canonical binding site (Fig. 2, b and c, and Fig. S2) of the calcium-free E2 state (3AR4) structure was 34% lower than that observed for the E1-like state (4KYT). Interestingly, the rupture force for PLB bound to the hypothetical alternative site outside M9 in a 270° orientation (Fig. 2d) was slightly improved for E2 compared with the bindin"

Herein, using intact adult cardiomyocytes from mouse models expressing phospho-ablated (AAA) and phosphomimetic (DDD) cMyBP-C as well as controls, we found that cMyBP-C dephosphorylation is sufficient to reduce contractile parameters and calcium kinetics associated with prolonged decay time of the calcium transient and increased diastolic calcium levels. Isoproterenol stimulation reversed the depressive contractile and Ca2+-kinetic parameters. Moreover, caffeine-induced calcium release yielded no difference between AAA/DDD and controls in calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, sodium–calcium exchanger function and phosphorylation levels of calcium-handling proteins were significantly decreased in AAA hearts compared with controls. Stress conditions caused increases in both spontaneous aftercontractions in AAA cardiomyocytes and the incidence of arrhythmias in vivo compared with the controls. Treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil, a positive cardiac inotropic drug, rescued the contractile deficit in AAA cardiomyocytes, but not the calcium-handling abnormalities. These findings indicate a cascade effect whereby cMyBP-C dephosphorylation causes contractile defects, which then lead to calcium-cycling abnormalities, resulting in aftercontractions and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias under stress conditions.

Cardiac arrhythmias, a clinical hallmark of HF, lead to sudden cardiac death and contribute to the onset of HF. Ventricular arrhythmias, including tachycardia, premature contractions, and ventricular fibrillation, are major causes of sudden cardiac death in patients with HF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) by decreasing the efficiency of the whole organ (5Masarone D. Limongelli G. Rubino M. Valente F. Vastarella R. Ammendola E. Gravino R. Verrengia M. Salerno G. Pacileo G. Management of arrhythmias in heart failure.J. Cardiovasc. Dev. Dis. 2017; 4: 310.3390/jcdd4010003Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite the clear association between HF and arrhythmias, it has proven difficult to develop therapies that can treat both diseases without unacceptable side effects. An essential first step toward identifying novel therapeutic strategies lies in elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie abnormal Ca2+ handling in HF. Unraveling these molecular-level pathways could ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic regimens able to reduce both HF-induced arrhythmias and acute HF. The pathophysiological association between HF and arrhythmias strongly suggests an interplay between sarcomere mechanics and calcium cycling (5Masarone D. Limongelli G. Rubino M. Valente F. Vastarella R. Ammendola E. Gravino R. Verrengia M. Salerno G. Pacileo G. Management of arrhythmias in heart failure.J. Cardiovasc. Dev. Dis. 2017; 4: 310.3390/jcdd4010003Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Certainly, the absence of current therapies to treat the etiology of HF calls for greater understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the calcium-cycling defects caused by mechanical abnormalities of the sarcomere. Current treatment for HF aims to diminish neurohormonal activation along with fluid volume overload and hemodynamics, but the prognosis remains poor (6Bristow M.R. Gilbert E.M. Abraham W.T.

Whereas the necessity of cMyBP-C phosphorylation for proper cardiac function is well-established, it is unclear whether decreased cMyBP-C phosphorylation leads to altered calcium cycling, especially at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) level. In the present study, we hypothesized that mechanical defects caused by the dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C disrupt calcium homeostasis and possibly increase the incidence of arrhythmias under stress. To test this hypothesis, we used AAA, DDD, and NTG mouse models to assess the effects of cMyBP-C phosphorylation status on calcium homeostasis. Our studies showed that dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C not only reduces sarcomere contractility, but also impairs calcium homeostasis in isolated cardiomyocytes, along with impaired sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX) function and decreased phosphorylation of key SR calcium-handling proteins. Furthermore, this abnormal calcium cycling results in spontaneous ex vivo aftercontractions and in vivo arrhythmias under stress conditions. Here, we also pharmacologically demonstrate that a positive cardiac inotropic drug, omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), cannot reverse the altered calcium cycling associated with dephosphorylated cMyBP-C contractile defects. Moreover, although dephosphorylated cMyBP-C showed contractile defects as early as 6 weeks of age, no associated abnormalities in calcium homeostasis and no spontaneous aftercontractions were observed. Taken together, our study demonstrates the important role of cMyBP-C phosphorylation in regulating calcium homeostasis of cardiomyocytes and preventing arrhythmogenesis under stress conditions. In the present study, we used cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing cMyBP-C AAA to replace endogenous cMyBP-C at the level of ∼40%, which recapitulates the level of cMyBP-C dephosphorylation in HF and HCM (25Copeland O.

To validate the effects of cMyBP-C dephosphorylation on contraction at the cellular level, we first assessed the contractile mechanics in intact ventricular myocytes isolated from AAA, DDD, and NTG hearts. As expected, functional analysis of isolated cells indicated that the amplitude of basal cell contraction (fractional shortening) was significantly depressed in AAA (10.05 ± 0.29%, p < 0.0001) compared with DDD (12.05 ± 0.38%) and NTG (12.82 ± 0.37%) cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The rate of sarcomere contraction and relaxation in AAA cardiomyocytes was also slower compared with NTG and DDD cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1 (B, C, E, F, and G) and Table 1). However, β-adrenergic stimulation (isoproterenol (ISO); 100 nm) resulted in enhancement of contractile parameters in NTG, AAA, and DDD cardiomyocytes, and the maximally stimulated parameters were similar among the three groups (Fig. 1 (A–C) and Table 1). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C results in decreased sarcomere contractility (33Kumar M. Govindan S. Zhang M. Khairallah R.J. Martin J.L.

Kindlin proteins are a central cytoplasmic component of these networks, directly binding integrin cytoplasmic domains and mediating interactions with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. The physiological importance of kindlins is well established, but how the scaffolding functions of kindlins are regulated at the molecular level is still unclear. Here, using a combination of GFP nanotrap association assays, pulldown and integrin-binding assays, and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that full-length kindlins can oligomerize (self-associate) in mammalian cells, and we propose that this self-association inhibits integrin binding and kindlin localization to focal adhesions. We show that both kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 can self-associate and that kindlin-3 self-association is more robust. Using chimeric mapping, we demonstrate that the F2PH and F3 subdomains are important for kindlin self-association. Through comparative sequence analysis of kindlin-2 and kindlin-3, we identify kindlin-3 point mutations that decrease self-association and enhance integrin binding, affording mutant kindlin-3 the ability to localize to focal adhesions. Our results support the notion that kindlin self-association negatively regulates integrin binding.

It has recently been proposed that in addition to other protein–protein interactions, kindlins may also self-associate (form kindlin-kindlin interactions) (14Li H. Deng Y. Sun K. Yang H. Liu J.

However, whether this dimeric form is physiologically relevant remains unclear, especially because the reported spontaneous monomer-dimer transition in solution is unfavorable, occurring on the order of days in vitro (14Li H.

We identify domains important for mediating self-association and, through analysis of kindlin-3 mutants, present evidence suggesting that kindlin self-association impairs integrin binding and inhibits focal adhesion localization. Although the crystal structure of kindlin-2 lacking the PH domain and a portion of the F1 subdomain (kindlin-2ΔPHΔF1loop) suggested that kindlin-2ΔPHΔF1loop dimerizes (14Li H. Deng Y. Sun K. Yang H. Liu J. Wang M. Zhang Z. Lin J. Wu C. Wei Z. Yu C. Structural basis of kindlin-mediated integrin recognition and activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To test this, we employed a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay using GFP-nanotrap beads and coexpressed GFP-tagged and FLAG-tagged kindlins (22Kadry Y.A. Huet-Calderwood C. Simon B. Calderwood D.A. Kindlin-2 interacts with a highly conserved surface of ILK to regulate focal adhesion localization and cell spreading.J.

First, to assess the ability of kindlin-2 to self-associate, FLAG-kindlin-2 was coexpressed with either GFP-kindlin-2 or GFP (as a negative control) in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In parallel, kindlin-3 self-association was assessed by coexpressing FLAG-kindlin-3 with either GFP-kindlin-3 or GFP (as a negative control). Cells were lysed and incubated with GFP-nanotrap beads to purify the GFP-tagged protein, and the amount of associating FLAG-tagged protein was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Whereas negligible amounts of FLAG-kindlin-3 copurified with GFP, readily detectable levels of FLAG-kindlin-3 copurified with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, FLAG-kindlin-2 copurified with GFP-kindlin-2 but consistently less FLAG-kindlin-2 associated with GFP-kindlin-2 than in the case of kindlin-3 (Fig. 1, B and C). This suggests that both kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 can self-associate in mammalian cells but that kindlin-3 self-associates to a greater extent than kindlin-2 (Fig. 1, B and C). We note that while these experiments clearly show that kindlins can assemble into larger complexes, they cannot provide information on the stoichiometry of the complex or whether kindlin–kindlin interactions are direct. Kindlin-3 shares the same conserved domain architecture and 67% amino acid sequence similarity with kindlin-2 (20Harburger D.S. Bouaouina M. Calderwood D.A. Kindlin-1 and -2 directly bind the C-terminal region of β integrin cytoplasmic tails and exert integrin-specific activation effects.J. Biol.

Notably, despite their similarity, GFP-kindlin-3 could associate with FLAG-kindlin-3 but not with FLAG-kindlin-2 (Fig. 2, A and B). This allowed us to map the subdomains of kindlin-3 that are important for self-association by evaluating the ability of FLAG-kindlin chimeras to restore or disturb association with GFP-kindlin-3. Two sets of chimeric FLAG-kindlins were tested: loss-of-function chimeras consisting of a FLAG-kindlin-3 backbone with inserted subdomain(s) of kindlin-2 intended to disturb association with GFP-kindlin-3 and gain-of-function chimeras composed of a FLAG-kindlin-2 backbone with inserted subdomain(s) of kindlin-3 intended to restore association with GFP-kindlin-3. Chimeric kindlins were named using four characters to denote the F0, F1, F2PH, and F3 regions, respectively, with each number denoting the kindlin isoform from which each subdomain originates (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25086068): 4308-432110.1242/jcs.155879Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and chimeric kindlins were functionally characterized as previously described (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25086068): 4308-432110.1242/jcs.155879Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We first tested the ability of the FLAG-K2233 and FLAG-K3322 chimeras to associate with GFP-kindlin-3 to pinpoint whether the N- or C-terminal subdomains of kindlin-3 are most important for association with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 2C). In the GFP nanobody co-IP assay, FLAG-K3322 was severely impaired in association with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that replacement of the F2PH and F3 subdomains of kindlin-3 is detrimental to the ability of kindlin-3 to associate. In contrast, despite consistently expressing less well than FLAG-kindlin-3, when corrected for input material, FLAG-K2233 was enhanced in association with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 2, D and E). We note that these chimeric kindlins are likely to be correctly folded, as we have previously shown that they bind β1 integrin tails and ILK (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25086068): 4308-432110.1242/jcs.155879Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, K3322, which exhibits reduced association with kindlin-3, shows robust targeting to focal adhesions (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25086068): 4308-432110.1242/jcs.155879Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the C-terminal region of kindlin-3 (F2PH and F3 subdomains) is important for association of FLAG-kindlin-3 with GFP-kindlin-3: replacing this region with that from kindlin-2 (K3322) impairs the ability to associate with GFP-kindlin-3, whereas inserting this region into kindlin-2 (K2233) restores and enhances association. To determine which subdomain(s) in the C-terminal region of kindlin-3 are important for self-association, association between GFP-kindlin-3 and a series of FLAG-tagged loss-of-function chimeras was examined (Fig. 3, A and B). Four FLAG-tagged loss-of-function chimeras were tested: K3332, K3323, kindlin-3 with the F2 subdomain of kindlin-3 (K3 F2 swap), and kindlin-3 with the PH subdomain of kindlin-2 (K3 PH swap). The FLAG-K3332 chimera associated with GFP-kindlin-3; in contrast, FLAG-K3323 was severely impaired in association with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 3, A and B). We consider this unlikely to be because of misfolding, as K3323 can bind β1 integrins and ILK and targets to focal adhesions (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25086068): 4308-432110.1242/jcs.155879Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Swapping only the PH domain (K3 PH swap) also strongly impaired association with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 3, A and B). Like kindlin-3, the PH swap construct fails to target to focal adhesions, but when expressed as a GFP fusion protein it does not form aggregates, suggesting that it is not misfolded (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127 (25086068): 4308-432110.1242/jcs.155879Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the F2PH subdomain, and particularly the PH domain, is important for the ability of kindlin-3 to self-associate in mammalian cells, as replacement of the kindlin-3 F2PH with the F2PH of kindlin-2 cannot fully support self-association. Further support for the importance of the F2PH subdomain for kindlin-3 self-association was provided when we evaluated association between GFP-kindlin-3 and a series of FLAG-tagged gain-of-function chimeras (Fig. 3, C and D). We observed that FLAG-K2232 associated with GFP-kindlin-3; however, we note that this chimera only partially restored association (Fig. 3, C and D). Meanwhile, FLAG-K2223 did not associate with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 3, C and D). These chimeras bind β1 integrins and ILK, suggesting that they are correctly folded (23Huet-Calderwood C. Brahme N.N. Kumar N. Stiegler A.L. Raghavan S. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Differences in binding to the ILK complex determines kindlin isoform adhesion localization and integrin activation.J.

In addition, neither the FLAG K2 F2 swap nor PH swap chimeras associated with GFP-kindlin-3 (Fig. 3, C and D). Although the loss-of-f"

It is unknown how the crosslinking contributes to the mechanical properties of tendon or whether crosslinking changes in response to stretching or relaxation. Since their discovery, imine bonds within collagen have been recognized as being important in both crosslink formation and collagen structure. They are often described as acidic or thermally labile, but no evidence is available from direct measurements of crosslink levels whether these bonds contribute to the mechanical properties of collagen. Here, we used MS to analyze these imine bonds after reduction with sodium borohydride while under tension and found that their levels are altered in stretched tendon. We studied the changes in crosslink bonding in tail tendon from 11-week-old C57Bl/6 mice at 4% physical strain, at 10% strain, and at breaking point. The crosslinks hydroxy-lysino-norleucine (HLNL), dihydroxy-lysino-norleucine (DHLNL), and lysino-norleucine (LNL) in-creased or decreased depending on the specific crosslink and amount of mechanical strain. We also noted a decrease in glycated lysine residues in collagen, indicating that the imine formed between circulating glucose and lysine is also stress labile. We also carried out mechanical testing, including cyclic testing at 4% strain, stress relaxation tests, and stress-strain profiles taken at breaking point, both with and without sodium borohydride reduction. The results from both the MS studies and mechanical testing provide insights into the chemical changes during tendon stretching and directly link these chemical changes to functional collagen properties.

The results from both the MS studies and mechanical testing provide insights into the chemical changes during tendon stretching and directly link these chemical changes to functional collagen properties. In the field of collagen research there remains a lack of understanding of how the different crosslinks found in collagen contribute to function. The classes of collagen crosslinking are described as immature, mature and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (1Fratzl, P., (ed) (2008) Collagen: Structure and Mechanics. Springer, New York, NY.Google Scholar). The immature crosslinks are formed through the action of lysyl oxidase on lysine and hydroxylysine residues to generate aldehydes which then react with nearby lysine or hydroxylysine side chain amines to form imine crosslinks (2Eyre D.R. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. Advances in collagen cross-link analysis.Methods. 2008; 45 (18442706): 65-7410.1016/j.ymeth.2008.01.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These can then react further with another oxidized lysine to form mature crosslinks (the pyridinolines) (2Eyre D.R. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. Advances in collagen cross-link analysis.Methods. 2008; 45 (18442706): 65-7410.1016/j.ymeth.2008.01.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). AGE crosslinks are formed through the spontaneous reaction of circulating sugars with lysine, hydroxylysine, and arginine through chemical steps which have yet to be identified (1Fratzl, P., (ed) (2008) Collagen: Structure and Mechanics. Springer, New York, NY.Google Scholar). Although both the mature and AGE crosslinks are chemically stable, the situation for the immature imine crosslinks is uncertain. They are often described as acid labile or hydrothermally labile, but whether they hydrolyze under stress is less clear. It has been concluded previously through physical testing that the imines in tendon must be hydrolysable under stress (3Davison P.F. The contribution of labile crosslinks to the tensile behavior of tendons.Connect.

We aim to shed light on the status and reactivity of these bonds in the work presented here through the direct measurement of these crosslinks at different strains in 11-week C57Bl/6 mouse tail tendon. Increases in AGE crosslinks and mature crosslinks with age are generally considered to cause increases in tendon stiffness (1Fratzl, P., (ed) (2008) Collagen: Structure and Mechanics. Springer, New York, NY.Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the glycation of lysine residues within the collagen structure are also likely to contribute to collagen stiffening (7Stammers M. Ivanova I.M. Niewczas I.S. Segonds-Pichon A. Streeter M. Spiegel D.A. Clark J. Age-related changes in the physical properties, cross-linking, and glycation of collagen from mouse tail tendon.J. Biol.

The chemistry of glycated lysine is similar to that of the immature crosslinks in originating from the chemical reaction of a sugar aldehyde with an amine to form an imine. In the light of this similarity, we included analysis of glycated lysine in this study. To understand the role of reversibility of the imine bonds in the normal functioning of tendon, we use sodium borohydride reduction to convert the imines into bonds which cannot be broken. This preserves the number of crosslinks and glycated lysine residues as well as their position in the collagen structure. We then compare the results of mechanical testing of reduced samples where the chemical bonds cannot break under stress with the results from unreduced tendon where the crosslinks and glycation could break under stress to look for differences in the stress-strain (stress is force/cross-sectional area; strain is extension/initial length) profiles. For clarity in this paper we describe the immature bonds in terms of the reduced products that we actually measure by HPLC MS, dihydroxy-lysino-norleucine (DHLNL), hydroxy-lysino-norleucine (HLNL), and lysino-norleucine (LNL) (structures shown in Fig. S1). Imines in an aqueous system are expected to be in an equilibrium, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of sodium borohydride will reduce the imine and the aldehyde in this equilibrium to a secondary amine and alcohol, respectively, irreversibly fixing the crosslink equilibrium at that point. These reductions are the only reactions that will occur in tendon under the conditions used here. If collagen chemistry is changing under tension, then adding sodium borohydride to tendons should change the stress-strain profile seen because the crosslinking can no longer change. While the reduction of an imine to a secondary amine might in itself cause a change in the profile because of increased rotation about a single bond verses a double bond, this might be expected to decrease tendon stiffness. Increases in tendon stiffness and increases in permanent deformation on stretching would be signs of change corresponding to the conversion of a reversible bond into an irreversible one. Fresh tendon was stretched to 4% strain and back to zero in a tensile stress stage through four cycles with 15-min rests between each cycle. The process was then repeated with tendon which had been reduced with sodium borohydride for 1 h prior to testing. The unreduced tendon showed a large change in stress-strain profile between the first cycle and second cycle but then subsequent cycles showed very similar stress-strain plots, Fig. 2a. We found that this difference between the first test cycle and subsequent cycles is consistently observed. The toe and heel regions seen in cycles 2 onward are commonly referred to in the literature (8Fratzl P. Misof K. Zizak I. Rapp G. Amenitsch H. Bernstorff S. Fibrillar structure and mechanical properties of collagen.J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122 (9724612): 119-12210.1006/jsbi.1998.3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar); however, in our experience they are not seen clearly unless a pretest stretch is carried out first, a procedure that is commonly described to “condition” tendon before experimentation. Reduced tendon behaves quite differently on repeated testing to 4% strain (Fig. 2b). Repeated cycles show a continual plastic deformation between each testing cycle (a plastic deformation is a nonreversible change). This is shown by the recorded stress starting to increase at higher strains with each test cycle, indicating that the tendon length has increased slightly on each cycle because of deformation. The reduced tendon does not recover on each cycle repeat, whereas the tendon that had not been reduced shows an ability to largely recover from the second cycle onward. Tendons were preconditioned by stretching to 3% strain four times before experimentation. The tendon was then repeatedly extended to 3% strain and held for 120 s while the decrease in stress (stress relaxation) was monitored before returning to the initial length. Fig. 3, a and c, demonstrates the effect when sodium borohydride was added during the rest period after the first test cycle. It can be seen that the stress profile in the cycle after treatment is different to that before treatment. The stress drops during the 120 s period (because of structural relaxation processes) in both cases, but after reduction the stress does not drop as far during this period as that seen before treatment, although the initial stress on extension is similar. This shows that fixing the crosslinks by reduction so that they cannot break decreases the ability of tendon to relax when stretched. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, b and d, the sodium borohydride was added 60 s into the 120-s stress relaxation period. In this case it can again be seen that the profile in subsequent cycles is changed by the reduction step. The initial stress achieved after reduction is lower than that seen before reduction whereas the stress measured in the plateau phase is similar. This shows that the network of crosslinks has been fixed while the tendon is in an extended state and cannot recover the original structure. These two experiments show that the crosslink network is changing and can be chemically fixed by reduction at different points in the stress-relaxation profile. This implies that chemical change is occurring even after preconditioning stretches. Tendon, particularly from young animals, exhibits a plastic phase after a strain of 5% (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b shows a comparison of the break test profiles of unreduced and reduced tendons (without preconditioning). A loss of the plastic phase in the profile of the reduced tendon when compared with unreduced tendon is seen. It is also clear that a higher final stress is reached in the reduced tendon. This shows that the plastic deformation phase is lost when the crosslinks cannot break and also that higher stresses can be achieved when the crosslinks cannot break. To demonstrate that bonds break and form under stress, the change in crosslink levels at defined strains were measured. We chose to make measurements at 4% strain, 10% strain, and at breaking point (BP). These were chosen as representative points on a typical mouse tail tendon stress-strain profile as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The tendon was held at the defined strain for 10 min to maximize any chemical changes occurring. The initial experiment is shown in Fig. 5a where tendon was taken to a 4% strain, cut out of the equipment, and then reduced with sodium borohydride. In each case a sample of tendon was removed before stretching to act as the control with which to compare the crosslink level in the stretched tendon. This experiment did not show any convincing change in the mean for immature crosslinks, although the glycation of lysine was seen to decrease. The spread of data points around the mean was greater than we would have expected, which led us to question whether the rate of change was fast and whether we needed to trap the reaction in the stretched state. Further experiments were carried out where the tendon was reduced in situ while still under strain to fix the tendon chemistry present at that point. The previous experiment was repeated with this modification to the reduction procedure and the result can be seen in Fig. 5b. Clear changes can now be seen in all the analytes shown. The data in Fig. 5 are displayed as a percentage change; however, the DHLNL and LNL are found in tendon at very low levels. Fig. 6 shows the same data as in Fig. 5b but normalized to the average mol/mol collagen level for each analyte on the same scale so that the relative contributions of each crosslink type can be assessed. This figure is to emphasize that a seemingly large and significant percentage change in analyte level can represent quite a small absolute change relative to other analytes. Fig. 7, a–e, summarizes the data from the different stretching experiments grouped by analyte with the average starting level found in unstretched tendon shown. Each data point represents tendon from different animals. At 4% strain HLNL levels increase, although this increase only just reaches statistical significance. At 10% strain and BP, the HLNL levels show a clear decrease. Although the increases in DHLNL at 4% and at BP are small, they occur consistently. This is also true for LNL at all test strains. Lysine glycation drops at 4% strain and does not appear to decrease further with increasing strain. Fig. 7e shows the result for the crosslink histidine-hydroxymerodesmosine (HHMD), which is formed through the reaction of two aldehydes, one hydroxylysine and a histidine. Although there is debate (9Tanzer M.L. Housley T. Berube L. Fairweather R. Franzblau C. Gallop P.M. Structure of two histidine-containing cross- links from collagen.J. Biol.

A standard for this compound, which would allow quantification by MS, is not available and so the data have been expressed as a percentage change. Levels of HHMD have been reported to be as high as 0.89 mol/mol collagen by others (12Terajima M. Taga Y. Chen Y. Cabral W.A. Hou-Fu G. Srisawasdi S. Nagasawa M. Sumida N. Hattori S. Kurie J.M.

The results described above collectively led us to a hypothesis that there might be free aldehyde derived from lysine oxidation (allysine) in resting tendon and that the levels of allysine increase on stretching. To explore this idea, a sample of tendon was taken to 10% strain, reduced under tension, and compared with the unstretched control. The level of reduced allysine in this sample before stretching was found to be 89 ng/mg tendon and after stretching 235 ng/mg tendon (dry delipidated tendon weights). The levels of the aldehyde derived from hydroxylysine were too low to be detected. (These results are summarized further in Fig. S2.) Until the work described here, there was no proof that crosslinking within collagen can change in response to mechanical strain. We have demonstrated that crosslinking and glycation within tendon changes under strain. Both increases and decreases in the mean number of individual crosslinks were seen, which shows that both bond formation and bond breaking were occurring. The cyclic stress-strain profiles in Fig. 2a show that the first testing cycle is quite different to subsequent ones. The loss of glycation is a permanent change which occurs during this stretch phase, Fig. 7b. In the light of this, it would seem plausible that the loss of glycation contributes to the initial drop seen between the first and second cycles and that glycation has a role in the stiffening of tendon during the early stretching phase. In Fig. 2, a and b, it can be seen that reduction has a large impact on the profiles when tendon is stretched to 4% strain. The untreated tendon, after the first cycle, shows a remarkable reproducibility whereas the reduced tendon shows a marked deformation on each subsequent stretch cycle. This difference indicates that the ability for bonding to change in the unreduced tendon allows an adaptive change that largely prevents through stress relaxation (or mitigates through bond re-organization) the plastic deformation seen in reduced tendon. The stress-relaxation studies show that adaptive changes occur under tension to allow relaxation and recovery processes to occur. When tendon is reduced the adaptive changes are stopped and the tendon is chemically fixed with the bonding network at the point of reduction. The only known chemistry that is fixed in collagen using sodium borohydride is that around the imine bond equilibrium illustrated in Fig. 1, indicating that it is this reversible chemistry that is responsible for the adaptive change. Fig. 5b shows that a 4% strain can actually lead to an increase in the number of reversible crosslinks present in tendon under tension. This suggests a more ordered structure where crosslink-forming residues have been brought into proximity with each other, allowing crosslink formation to occur. This is in keeping with synchrotron X-ray scattering evidence, where it was suggested that strain created a more ordered structure and that the relaxation process was entropically driven (13Misof K. Rapp G. Fratzl P. A new molecular model for collagen elasticity based on synchrotron X-ray scattering evidence.Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (9138582): 1376-138110.1016/S0006-3495(97)78783-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These imine bond breaking and formation reactions are relatively fast, as shown by the experiment carried out by reduction of tendon in the relaxed state after stretching in Fig. 5a; however, the reaction rates in the equilibria are unknown. It is possible that the rate of bond hydrolysis is limiting, which may explain why higher stresses and an increased stiffness can be observed with faster rates of extension (an example is shown in Fig. S3). In the plastic phase, the collagen fibers are believed to slip against each other. This was described previously by others in studies based on X-ray diffraction studies (14Mosler E. Folkhard W. Knörzer E. Nemetschek-Gansler H. Nemetschek T. Koch M.H.J. Stress-induced molecular rearrangement in tendon collagen.J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182 (4009715): 589-59610.1016/0022-2836(85)90244-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Folkhard W. Mosler E. Geercken W. Knörzer E. Nemetschek-Gansler H. Nemetschek T. Koch M.H.J. Quantitative analysis of the molecular sliding mechanisms in native tendon collagen—time-resolved dynamic studies using synchrotron radiation.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1987; 9: 169-17510.1016/0141-8130(87)90047-XCrossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During this phase we find that there is a net decrease in HLNL bonds, and it would seem possible that this could be to allow an extension process to occur, for example in growth, or to reduce stress when over extension occurs. When the reversible bonds are fixed by reduction, the plastic phase can no longer occur and is lost from the profile, as seen in Fig. 4b. It can also be seen that higher stresses are then achieved because adaption to the stress cannot occur through bond breaking. One consistent feature seen in the 4% strain experiments is an increase in DHLNL of between 0.006 and 0.01 mol/mol collagen when compared with unstretched tendon. This might seem small, but a 0.6 to 1% increase in crosslinking on stretching might have an important functional role, particularly if combined with the changes seen in LNL and HLNL. The result requires a pool of the aldehyde derived from hydroxylysine to be present. To prove this by detection of this aldehyde in these experiments would require the development of more sensitive detection methods not currently available, but it is reasonable to think that it is present, otherwise the increase in DHLNL seen would not be possible. The increases seen in LNL on stretching at all strains tested may be a result of increased levels of aldehyde present in the tissue when stretched and the statistical chance of crosslink reforming with a lysine rather than a hydroxylysine. This increase in LNL could also be linked to structural changes involved in stretching during which the proximity of lysine or hydroxylysine to aldehyde changes. The data shown in Figs. 2a and 7b indicate that tendon is stiffer when lysine residues in the collagen structure are glycated. A mechanism by which stiffening from glycation occurs is most likely through the interactions of the sugar component of the glycated lysine residues with adjacent collagen molecules, for example through hydrogen bonding of the sugar hydroxyls with nearby groups. If this did not occur then there would be no reason for the glycated lysine to hydrolyze when the tendon is stretched. There has to be a mechanism by which the transfer of strain can take place to lengthen the sugar-lysine imine bond, thereby lowering the activation energy of the bond toward hydrolysis. This transfer of strain requires at least two fixed points either side of the imine bond. The effect of glycated lysine appears to be important in intrafibrillar interactions rather than interfibrillar interactions because hydrolysis occurs during the initial 4% stretch phase with no further loss in the plastic phase when interfibrillar interactions become important. The largest crosslink mol/mol collagen change is that seen for HLNL, ranging from an average increase of 0.1 mol/mol collagen under 4% strain conditions, to a decrease of 0.2 mol/mol collagen under 10% strain conditions. A schematic model is presented in Fig. 8 that shows five parallel crosslinked strands of six collagen molecules, each strand overlapping in a staggered formation. For clarity it is presented as a planar 2D structure, initially with a typical crosslink density of 45 crosslinks to 30 molecules of collagen (1.5 mol/mol collagen). It can be seen in Fig. 8a that at this level of crosslinking there is a crosslink gap in the matrix. Fig. 8b shows the potential impact of a decrease in crosslinking of 0.1 mol/mol collagen (3 crosslinks). It can be seen that this could greatly weaken the structure creating a fracture plane indicated by the yellow line. Fig. 8c shows that an increase of three bonds could clearly strengthen the structure by filling the crosslink gap and potentially forming crosslinks with adjacent collagen planes. Although the reality of the native collagen structure is far more complex and subtle than this 2D model, it illustrates the impact that changes on the scale that we have observed could have. The evidence presented here shows that tendon collagen undergoes chemical changes in crosslinking and glycation under strain that are important for correct function. By using reduction with sodium borohydride which fixes the crosslinks, it was demonstrated that the reversibility of crosslink and glycation chemistry is essential for the proper mechanical properties of tendon. The picture that has emerged is one of highly dynamic crosslinks, breaking and re-forming with every stretch. Changes in the levels of crosslinking and glycation would be expected to impact tendon function, with implications for aging, disease, and sport sciences. Animal experiments were performed according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, license PPL 70/8303 and approved by the Babraham Institute Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Body. After removal of the skin from isolated tails, tendon was drawn out of the tail under PBS pH 7.4 by grasping the tip and the base of the tail with forceps. Twisting the forceps holding the smaller vertebrae at the tail tip caused the ligaments holding the vertebral bones together to break, allowing the vertebral bones with attached tendons to be gently pulled out. For larger vertebral joints they were first weakened by inserting the tip of a scalpel between the joints taking care not to cut the tendons. Tendon was isolated sequentially one vertebral bone at a time, working up the tail from the tip to the base. Tendon fibers were detached from the tail vertebrae with a scalpel. Acid hydrolysis and sample analysis by HPLC-MS was carried out as described previously (6Svensson R.B. Mulder H. Kovanen V. Magnusson S.P. Fracture mechanics of collagen fibrils: Influence of natural cross-links.Biophys. J. 2013; 104 (23746520): 2476-248410.1016/j.bpj.2013.04.033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For this analysis, sodium borodeuteride was used because the background noise and isobaric background was much lower with the increase in mass. Tail tendon (wet weight 10 to 20 mg) was prepared and reduced as for the other experiments described here but with NaBD4 used as the reducing agent. Base hydrolysis was then carried out in 200 μl 2m NaOH at 100°C for 24 h. The sample was then allowed to cool and 600 μl of 1m HCl added and the sample made up to 8 ml with 50% acetonitrile in water. The sample was then split in half and 6-hydroxy-norleucine (0.5 eq based on dry weight) added to one half. Both samples were then loaded onto disposable 500 mg SCX ion exchange columns (Sigma, cat. no. 57018). Each column was then washed with 2 ml 50% acetonitrile, then the analytes eluted with a mixture of 1.5 ml 50 mm ammonium carbonate pH 7.5 added to 50% acetonitrile in water. The samples were then freeze dried, redissolved in 400 μl 50% acetonitrile, filtered through a 0.22-μm nylon filtration membrane and freeze dried again. The samples were then taken up in 30 μl 50% acetonitrile in water and 5 μl analyzed using the HLPC-MS method and parameters described previously (1Fratzl, P., (ed) (2008) Collagen: Structure and Mechanics. Springer, New York, NY.Google Scholar). The increase in nondeuterated signal area in the standard sample was used to work out the amount of deuterated analog in the sample to which no standard had been added for each sample pair. The samples were then expressed as ng/mg dry delipidated tendon and an approximate mol/mol collagen value calculated based on the dry delipidated tendon mass assuming 100% collagen content. The resulting mol/mol collagen values would therefore be expected to be slightly lower than the actual values. Physical testing was undertaken using a Microtest 200 N tensile stress stage (Deben UK Ltd) fitted with a 20 N load cell and a Petri-dish bath to allow immersion of the sample. With a distance of 14 mm between the jaws, individual processed fibers were clamped submerged in PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature, and preloaded to a force of 0.01 N. The diameter of each fiber was assessed along its length and the smallest dimension used to calculate stress. After the tendon had been loaded to 0.01 N and the diameter and length measured, the distance between the jaws was decreased by 0.05 mm. At this point the crimp pattern could be seen. After a 15-min rest, the tendon was taken to a 4% strain at a rate of 0.5 mm/min, held for 0.1 s, and then relaxed back to the cycle initial strain. The force was recorded every 0.5 s during the cycle. After a rest of 15 min the cycle was repeated. Four cycles were carried out on each tendon tested. Where tendon was reduced first, this was done by dissolving 8 mg NaBH4 in 10 μl 1 mm sodium hydroxide which was then added to 1 ml of PBS. This 1 ml solution was then added to the tendon in 4 ml PBS and left for 1 h with gentle agitation every 15 min. The reduced tendon was then washed twice in fresh PBS before testing. A single tendon fiber after preloading to 0.01 N, was preconditioned by holding at an extension of 3% for 60 s and then taken back to its original length to rest for 60 s, and repeated a further three times. During the stress relaxation experiment the fiber was repeatedly extended to 3% for 120 s and then back to its original length to rest for 120 s, recording the force every 0.5 s. NaBH4 (4 mg in 40 μl 1 mm NaOH added to 1 ml PBS) was added by exchanging with 1 ml of PBS from the bath (18 ml total) and mixed by pipetting. Tendon was prepared as described above and taken to breaking strain at a rate of 1 mm/min. The force was recorded every 0.5 s. Tail tendon was removed from male mice as described in the processing method, except the tendons were left attached to the tail vertebrae for ease of handling. With the jaws of the tensile stress stage set 18 mm apart, five to eight vertebral sections were mounted into the jaws, totaling 20-28 tendons. These were clamped in place across the tendon fibers removing the vertebral bones once clamped and submerged in PBS at room temperature. Excess was cut away and used as a control. At a rate of 0.2 mm/min the fibers were taken to breaking point, after which the tendon was excised from the jaws and both the control and the broken tendon were reduced as above in 200 μl PBS. This process was repeated twice for each mouse tail in order to produce enough material for analysis. The tendon was subjected to acid hydrolysis and analysis by MS as detailed above. For analysis at 4 and 10% strain, tail tendon was collected from mice as described above and clamped into the jaws of the tensile stress stage, submerged in PBS at room temperature, with the jaws of the tensile stress stage ∼18 mm apart and at an initial load of 0.01 N. Control material was collected by cutting away excess not held in the jaws. The jaws were extended to the defined strain at a rate of 0.1 mm/min and held at that strain for 10 min. The samples were reduced in situ under strain by exchange of 1 ml of PBS from the bath with 1 ml PBS containing NaBH4 (4 mg in 40 μl 1 mm NaOH added to 1 ml PBS) for 5 min in the bath, then excised from the jaws. Reduction was allowed to continue for a further 2 h in a tube. Samples collected were subject to acid hydrolysis for analysis as described above. For all stretching experiments, ratio paired Student t tests were used. For the other experiments, one-way analyses of variance were used when more than two groups were compared followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons tests. Significance was defined as p < 0.05 and p-values are reported on figures. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.

Previously, we obtained a mutant of Sinorhizobium fredii HH103, rkpA, that does not produce KPS, a homopolysaccharide of a pseudaminic acid derivative, but whose LPS electrophoretic profile was indistinguishable from that of the WT strain. We also previously demonstrated that the HH103 rkpLMNOPQ operon is responsible for 5-acetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-7-(3-hydroxybutyramido)-l-glycero-l-manno-nonulosonic acid [Pse5NAc7(3OHBu)] production and is involved in HH103 KPS and LPS biosynthesis and that an HH103 rkpM mutant cannot produce KPS and displays an altered LPS structure. Here, we analyzed the LPS structure of HH103 rkpA, focusing on the carbohydrate portion, and found that it contains a highly heterogeneous lipid A and a peculiar core oligosaccharide composed of an unusually high number of hexuronic acids containing β-configured Pse5NAc7(3OHBu). This pseudaminic acid derivative, in its α-configuration, was the only structural component of the S. fredii HH103 KPS and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported from any other rhizobial LPS. We also show that Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) is the complete or partial epitope for a mAb, NB6-228.22, that can recognize the HH103 LPS, but not those of most of the S. fredii strains tested here. We also show that the LPS from HH103 rkpM is identical to that of HH103 rkpA but devoid of any Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) residues.

Rhizobia are soil bacteria able to establish a symbiotic association with legumes in which a complex interchange of molecular signals between the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic partners takes place. This interchange of molecular signals culminates in the formation of specialized plant structures, called nodules, on the roots or stems of the plant host (1López-Baena F.J. Ruiz-Sainz J.E. Rodríguez-Carvajal M.A. Vinardell J.M. Bacterial molecular signals in the Sinorhizobium fredii-soybean symbiosis.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016; 17: 75510.3390/ijms17050755Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The molecular dialogue between the bacteria and the plant is initiated by flavonoids exuded by the legume root, which activate the transcription of bacterial nodulation genes. Some of these genes encode proteins involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of molecular signals called Nod factors. These bacterial signals mediate species specificity and induce the development of root nodules in the plant (1López-Baena F.J. Ruiz-Sainz J.E. Rodríguez-Carvajal M.A. Vinardell J.M.

In addition to Nod factors, different rhizobial surface polysaccharides (RSP) are commonly necessary for successful nodulation. Exopolysaccharides (EPS), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), capsular polysaccharides (KPS or K-antigen polysaccharides), and cyclic glucans (CG) are the main rhizobial polysaccharides involved in symbiosis. For each specific pair of rhizobium-legume symbionts, one or more RSP could act as signal molecules promoting bacterial infection and/or preventing plant defense reactions (4Krol E. Becker A.

HH103 rkpA failed to produce the poly-α-Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) KPS, but the other RSP did not show any detectable change. Even more importantly, S. fredii HH103 RifR mutants in genes located in the so-called rkp-3 region (such as rkpM, rkpP, or rkpQ) did not produce the α-Pse5NAc7(3OHBu) KPS as well, showed altered LPS electrophoretic profiles, and only induced the formation of soybean pseudonodules unable to fix nitrogen (17Margaret I.

LPS are the predominant constituents in the external leaflet of Gram-negative outer membrane and can be conceptually divided in three different structural regions: a glycolipid component called lipid A that is linked to a core oligosaccharide (core OS) that is attached to an outer polysaccharide, termed the O-chain (18Di Lorenzo F. De Castro C. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Silipo A. Molinaro A. Lipopolysaccharides as microbe-associated molecular patterns: a structural perspective.in: Jiménez-Barbero J. Javier Canada F. Martín-Santamaría S. Carbohydrates in Drug Design and Discovery. Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), London2015: 38-63Crossref Google Scholar). On the basis of the nature of the saccharide portion, an LPS can be classified as smooth, semirough, or rough: smooth-type LPS (S-LPS) contains all three abovementioned domains, whereas a semirough-type LPS (sR-LPS) has a subunit (complete or truncated) of the O-chain, and a rough-type LPS (R-LPS) does not express any O-chain moiety (18Di Lorenzo F.

HH103 rkpA was chosen because it does not produce KPS, which could interfere with LPS purification, and its LPS silver- and immune-staining profiles were equal to those of S. fredii HH103 RifR, indicating that the LPS structure of both strains should be highly similar or identical. In parallel, HH103 rkpM was investigated because it does not produce KPS as well, and its LPS silver-staining profile was shown to be only slightly altered with respect to S. fredii HH103 RifR. Structural investigation showed that HH103 rkpA possesses an LPS containing β-Pse5NAc7(3OHBu), which was never described before as a component of this polysaccharide in rhizobia. Interestingly, we also show that S. fredii HH103 rkpM produces an LPS devoid of such pseudaminic acid derivatives, and that this mutant is severely impaired in symbiosis with the HH103 host legume Macroptilium atropurpureum.

Relevant characteristics of these mutants are summarized in Table 1.

In this work, we have compared their LPS profiles in a single polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1A) to classify them according to the mobility of the silver-stained LPS bands. We hypothesized that any increase of the electrophoretic mobility of the LPS bands would be directly related to the size of the truncated LPS forms produced by each mutant. Therefore, mutants showing faster migrating LPS bands might correspond to mutants producing smaller truncated LPS core OS forms. WT S. fredii HH103 RifR and its rkpA mutant derivative were also included as controls, because this mutant does not produce KPS but its LPS shows the same electrophoretic profile of HH103 RifR (16Margaret-Oliver I.

https://openalex.org/W3034879705,"Being a typical ground-breeding bird of the agricultural landscape in Germany, the pheasant has experienced a strong and persistent population decline with a hitherto unexplained cause. Contributing factors to the ongoing negative trend, such as the effects of pesticides, diseases, predation, increase in traffic and reduced fallow periods, are currently being controversially discussed. In the present study, 62 free-ranging pheasant chicks were caught within a two-year period in three federal states of Germany; Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. The pheasant chicks were divided into three age groups to detect differences in their development and physical constitution. In addition, pathomorphological, parasitological, virological, bacteriological and toxicological investigations were performed. The younger chicks were emaciated, while the older chicks were of moderate to good nutritional status. However, the latter age group was limited to a maximum of three chicks per hen, while the youngest age class comprised up to ten chicks. The majority of chicks suffered from dermatitis of the periocular and caudal region of the head (57–94%) of unknown origin. In addition, intestinal enteritis (100%), pneumonia (26%), hepatitis (24%), perineuritis (6%), tracheitis (24%), muscle degeneration (1%) and myositis (1%) were found. In 78% of the cases, various Mycoplasma spp. were isolated. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) was not detected using an MG-specific PCR. Parasitic infections included Philopteridae (55%), Coccidia (48%), Heterakis/Ascaridia spp. (8%) and Syngamus trachea (13%). A total of 8% of the chicks were Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) positive using RT-PCR, 16% positive for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) using RT-PCR, and 2% positive for haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) using PCR. All samples tested for avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) or infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) were negative. The pool samples of the ten chicks were negative for all acid, alkaline-free and derivative substances, while two out of three samples tested were positive for the herbicide glyphosate. Pheasant chick deaths may often have been triggered by poor nutritional status, probably in association with inflammatory changes in various tissues and organs as well as bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Theses impacts may have played a major role in the decline in pheasant populations."
https://openalex.org/W3034298472,"PCR inhibitors are a formidable problem to the study of aged, degraded, and/or low copy number DNA. As a result, there is a need to find alternate methods that ameliorate the efficacy of PCR. In this study, we attempted to use genetic methods to identify the species of salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) remains recovered from archaeological sites along the Feather River located in northern California, United States. In the process of doing so, we compared the efficacy of a PCR enhancer cocktail called ""PEC-P"" and a reagent rich PCR recipe called ""rescue PCR"" over standard PCR. Across all treatments (full concentration and 1:10 dilute eluates subjected to standard PCR, PEC-P, and rescue PCR) species identification was possible for 74 of 93 archaeological fish specimens (79.6%). Overall, six of the 93 samples (6.5%) consistently yielded species identification across all treatments. The species of ten specimens (10.8%) were uniquely identified from amplicons produced with either PEC-P or rescue PCR or both. Notably, the species of seven samples (7.5%) were uniquely identified with standard PCR over the alternative treatments. Considering both full concentration and 1:10 dilute eluates (N = 186), standard PCR performed as well as PEC-P (p = 0.1451) and rescue (p = 0.6753). Yet, considering results from full concentration eluates alone (N = 93), PEC-P (60.2%) outperformed both standard PCR (44.1%; p = 0.0277) and rescue PCR (40.9%; p = 0.0046). Stochasticity observed in our study cautions us against choosing a ""best"" performing method of those explored here and suggests their respective potentials to improve success may be sample dependent. When working with samples compromised by PCR inhibitors, it is useful to have alternative methodologies for subduing the problem. Both PEC-P and rescue PCR represent useful alternative methods for the study of aged, degraded, and/or low copy number DNA samples compromised by PCR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3036152451,"The development of the dendritic arbor in pyramidal neurons is critical for neural circuit function. Here, we uncovered a pathway in which δ-catenin, a component of the cadherin–catenin cell adhesion complex, promotes coordination of growth among individual dendrites and engages the autophagy mechanism to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor. Using a rat primary neuron model, time-lapse imaging, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy, we found that apical and basolateral dendrites are coordinately sculpted during development. Loss or knockdown of δ-catenin uncoupled this coordination, leading to retraction of the apical dendrite without altering basolateral dendrite dynamics. Autophagy is a key cellular pathway that allows degradation of cellular components. We observed that the impairment of the dendritic arbor resulting from δ-catenin knockdown could be reversed by knockdown of autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), a component of the autophagy machinery. We propose that δ-catenin regulates the dendritic arbor by coordinating the dynamics of individual dendrites and that the autophagy mechanism may be leveraged by δ-catenin and other effectors to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor.

Our knowledge of the mechanisms that guide the formation and maintenance of individual dendrites and the overall dendritic architecture is far from complete.

For a developing neuron, it is critical that every single dendrite that originates in the cell body is correctly sculpted and generates an appropriate number of higher-order branches while maintaining overall arbor shape and connectivity (21Duman J.G.

Given this, it is likely that molecular mechanisms exist that allow for interdendritic communication that drive overall dendritic patterning in a coordinated manner. However, the identity of such mechanisms remains unclear. Determining the mechanisms that regulate coordinated growth of multiple dendrites within the same neuron has implications for our ability to understand the underpinnings of neural circuit wiring in the healthy and diseased brain.

CTNND2 encodes δ-catenin, a component of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex that binds to cadherin at its juxtamembrane region.

Little is known, however, about the role of autophagy in dendritic development in pyramidal neurons. Here, we provide evidence to demonstrate that δ-catenin promotes coordinated development of the apical and basolateral dendrites in primary neurons and engages the autophagy mechanism to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor. During development, the dendritic arbor is sculpted by extension and retraction of the individual dendritic arbors. We took advantage of a primary rat neuronal cell culture system (57Beaudoin 3rd, G.M. Lee S.H. Singh D. Yuan Y. Ng Y.G. Reichardt L.F. Arikkath J. Culturing pyramidal neurons from the early postnatal mouse hippocampus and cortex.Nat.

Rat primary hippocampal neurons were maintained in culture as described previously (57Beaudoin 3rd, G.M. Lee S.H. Singh D. Yuan Y. Ng Y.G. Reichardt L.F. Arikkath J.

Neurons were transfected with EGFP and imaged by live time lapse imaging at DIV 11, 14, and 19 to allow visualization of the dendritic tree (Fig. 1A).

We quantitated dendritic lengths of the primary and secondary dendrites separately as measures of dendritic extension. During the period between DIV 11 and DIV 14, both primary and secondary dendrites predominantly showed extension with little retraction (Fig. 1B). However, with advancing age, DIV 14–19, there was more of a balance between extension and retraction (Fig. 1C). Overall, during the time period between DIV 11 and 19, both primary and secondary dendrites had net extension (Fig. 1D) and similar levels of average extension (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that in this model system, DIV 11–14 represents a period of dynamic dendrite extension, whereas both extension and retraction are balanced at DIV 14–19, leading to overall dendrite extension. Further, primary and secondary dendrites show similar dynamics of extension and retraction, suggesting that they are coordinately sculpted. The δ-catenin-N-term mouse (also referred to as the δ-catenin knockout mouse (58Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Deletion of the neuron-specific protein δ-catenin leads to severe cognitive and synaptic dysfunction.Curr.

We have previously demonstrated that δ-catenin-N-term mice have reduced dendritic arbors (32Arikkath J. Israely I. Tao Y. Mei L. Liu X. Reichardt L.F. Erbin controls dendritic morphogenesis by regulating localization of δ-catenin.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 (18614673): 7047-705610.1523/JNEUROSCI.0451-08.2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We examined the length of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary dendrites in primary neurons from control (WT/WT) and mutant (δ-catenin-N-term/δ-catenin-N-term) mice at DIV 8 and DIV 16–17. These dendrites are all dendrites that originate in the cell body and were classified as primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary based on their lengths with the primary being the longest. These classifications only refer to the length of the main dendritic shaft and do not reflect dendritic branches that arise from the main shaft. At DIV 8, the length of the primary dendrites in mutant neurons was not significantly different from the control neurons. Surprisingly, the lengths of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary dendrites were all increased in the mutants compared with the control (Fig. 2, A and B). However, at DIV 16–17, this scenario was significantly different in that the length of the primary dendrite was significantly reduced in the mutant compared with the control, whereas none of the other dendrites showed any significant alterations in length (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the loss of δ-catenin leads to an uncoupling of the coordination between primary and secondary dendritic dynamics. The reduction in the dendritic arbor with loss or knockdown of δ-catenin could be mediated by either a reduction in the extension or an increase in the retraction of dendrites. To examine which of these mechanisms is responsible, we examined the development of the dendritic arbor in primary neurons expressing vector or a previously validated (32Arikkath J. Israely I. Tao Y. Mei L. Liu X. Reichardt L.F. Erbin controls dendritic morphogenesis by regulating localization of δ-catenin.J.

These studies were done in primary neurons from DIV 13 to DIV 17 with neurons imaged at DIV 13, 15, and 17. We examined the percentage of neurons with net extension or retraction of primary and secondary dendrites. Between DIV 13 and 15, the neurons expressing vector were balanced in terms of extension and retraction of primary dendrites (Fig. 3D). However, neurons expressing shRNA to δ-catenin had an increased level of retraction and reduced extension (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed at DIV 15–17 (Fig. 3E). Consolidation of DIV 13–17 (Fig. 3F) data indicated that in neurons expressing δ-catenin shRNA, the percentage of neurons retracting primary dendrites was higher than control, whereas the percentage demonstrating extension was lower than neurons expressing vector (Fig. 3F).

These compounds consist of a trehalose core bearing polyunsaturated fatty acyl substituents (called phleic acids) and a straight-chain fatty acid residue and share a common basic structure with trehalose-based glycolipids produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TPP production starts in the cytosol with the formation of a diacyltrehalose intermediate. An acyltransferase, called PE, subsequently catalyzes the transfer of phleic acids onto diacyltrehalose to form TPP, and an MmpL transporter promotes the export of TPP or its precursor across the plasma membrane.

Because the molecular mechanisms of glycolipid production are conserved among mycobacteria, these findings obtained with PE from M. smegmatis may offer clues to glycolipid formation in M. tuberculosis. Mycobacteria are endowed with an unusually thick lipid-rich cell envelope. This structure contains several families of trehalose-containing glycolipids that interact with mycolic acids attached to the arabinogalactan to form an atypical outer membrane called the mycomembrane (1Daffe M.

This group also includes species-specific glycolipids, such as di- and polyacyltrehaloses (DAT and PAT) and sulfolipids (SL), which are restricted to the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or lipooligosacharides that have been isolated from diverse fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria (1Daffe M.

Recently, we reported that trehalose polyphleates (TPP), a family of surface-exposed glycolipids originally described in Mycobacterium phlei, are widely distributed across mycobacterial species, including Mycobacterium smegmatis and the opportunistic pathogens Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium (3Asselineau C.

TPP consist of octoacylated trehalose bearing seven C36:5 and C40:6 polyunsaturated fatty acids called phleic acids and a C14–C19 fatty acid residue. They share a common basic structure with SL and PAT from M. tuberculosis (6Seeliger J. Moody D.B. Monstrous mycobacterial lipids.Cell Chem.

A recent study showed that TPP production in M. abscessus correlates with clump and cord formation, suggesting a potential role for these molecules in the virulence of this opportunistic human pathogen (7Llorens-Fons M. Perez-Trujillo M. Julian E. Brambilla C. Alcaide F. Byrd T.F. Luquin M.

Microbiol. 2017; 8 (28790995): 140210.3389/fmicb.2017.01402Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Formation and export of TPP involve at least four biosynthetic enzymes and an MmpL transporter, namely MmpL10, that are encoded by genes clustered at the TPP locus (5Burbaud S. Laval F. Lemassu A. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Chalut C. Trehalose polyphleates are produced by a glycolipid biosynthetic pathway conserved across phylogenetically distant mycobacteria.Cell Chem.

These proteins display sequence similarities with enzymes required for SL and PAT production, indicating that the TPP pathway can serve as an informative model to describe glycolipid production in M. tuberculosis. Biosynthesis of TPP begins in the cytoplasm with the formation of a 2,3-diacyltrehalose intermediate bearing a C14–C19 fatty acyl group and a phleic acyl substituent. The transacylase enzyme PE encoded by the MSMEG_0412 gene (previously referred to as MSMEI_0402), subsequently catalyzes transesterification of phleic acids between diacyltrehalose precursors to generate TPP. Finally, MmpL10 is involved in the translocation of TPP or/and of TPP precursors across the plasma membrane (5Burbaud S. Laval F. Lemassu A. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Chalut C.

Despite this knowledge, the late stages of the TPP biosynthetic pathway and the relationship between biosynthesis and transport of these compounds to the cell envelope remain elusive. The PE protein is predicted to be a membrane-anchored protein harboring a putative N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal α/β-serine hydrolase domain, consistent with its proposed role as an acyltransferase in TPP assembly (Fig. 1) (9Adindla S. Guruprasad L. Sequence analysis corresponding to the PPE and PE proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other genomes.J.

Interestingly, Chp1 and Chp2, two membrane-bound acyltransferases, respectively involved in SL and PAT production in M. tuberculosis, share overall domain organization with PE (Fig. 1). It has been proposed that these enzymes catalyze the last step of SL and PAT assembly by a mechanism that is tightly coupled to lipid transport across the plasma membrane, but the molecular details of this process are not fully understood, partly because the in vivo subcellular localization of their catalytic domains remains controversial. Seeliger et al. (11Seeliger J.C. Holsclaw C.M. Schelle M.W. Botyanszki Z. Gilmore S.A. Tully S.E. Niederweis M. Cravatt B.F. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R.

Likewise, the orientation of PE in the plasma membrane and thereby the subcellular location of its catalytic domain, is unknown, raising questions on the cell compartment in which the transacylation step takes place and on the identity of the compounds that are transported by MmpL10. The goal of this study was to shed light on the last step of TPP biosynthesis by investigating the topological organization and subcellular location of the PE protein. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches, we established that PE has a C-terminal periplasmic domain and found that proteolytic cleavage of PE is required for efficient formation of TPP. Based on these data, we present here a refined model of the TPP biosynthesis pathway. This work provides clues for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in DAT/PAT production in M. tuberculosis. In silico analysis using the SignalP software predicts that PE possesses a putative signal sequence with a AXA signal peptidase I cleavage motif (PE1-28, cleavage site between positions 28 and 29: AAA-DD, Fig. 1) (14Auclair S.M. Bhanu M.K. Kendall D.A.

To discriminate between these possibilities, we first investigated the topological organization of PE in M. smegmatis. Plasmids expressing PE fused at the C terminus with either the GFP or the alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) (Table S1) were introduced in the WT strain of M. smegmatis, and the GFP and PhoA activities were monitored to determine the subcellular localization of the reporter proteins. GFP exhibits fluorescence only when localized to the cytosolic compartment, whereas PhoA is only active inside the periplasmic space (15Wiker H.G. Wilson M.A. Schoolnik G.K. Extracytoplasmic proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis—mature secreted proteins often start with aspartic acid and proline.Microbiology. 2000; 146 (10878117): 1525-153310.1099/00221287-146-7-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Belardinelli J.M.

Expression of PE-GFP or PE-PhoA in an M. smegmatis pE knockout mutant (PMM229) restored TPP production, indicating that the fusion proteins are correctly folded and display proper subcellular localization in bacteria (Fig. S1). Additional M. smegmatis strains producing KatG1, a cytosolic protein, MmpL10, a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic C-terminal end, or MmpS4, a transmembrane protein with the C‐terminal end facing the periplasm, fused to the same topology reporter proteins were generated to serve as controls in the experiments (16Belardinelli J.M. Jackson M. Green fluorescent protein as a protein localization and topological reporter in mycobacteria.Tuberculosis. 2017; 105 (28610783): 13-1710.1016/j.tube.2017.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Deshayes C.

Bacteria producing PE-GFP displayed no increase in average fluorescence when compared with WT or control bacteria expressing MmpS4-GFP (Fig. 2A). Conversely, as expected, high fluorescence signals were detected for strains expressing KatG1-GFP or MmpL10-GFP. M. smegmatis strains producing the PhoA fusions were first assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity on LB agar plates containing the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP). Production of PE-PhoA resulted in blue colonies after incubation at 37 °C, indicative of PhoA activity (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the control strain expressing MmpS4-PhoA, whereas no color change was observed for strains expressing either KatG1-PhoA or MmpL10-PhoA. To confirm these data, the PhoA activity of fusion proteins was assessed on cells grown in LB using the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). Results obtained were consistent with those obtained on BCIP agar plates: bacteria that express PE-PhoA, as well as those producing MmpS4-PhoA, exhibited high levels of PhoA activity compared with the WT strain and control strains expressing KatG1-PhoA or MmpL10-PhoA (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these data indicated that the C-terminal domain of PE is exposed on the outside of the plasma membrane. In these studies, we also sought to confirm the topology of Chp1 and to resolve the contradictory research findings regarding the topological organization of Chp2, using M. smegmatis strains expressing each of these proteins fused to either the GFP or PhoA. Attempts to detect GFP fluorescence or PhoA activity in bacteria producing the Chp1 fusion proteins failed (data not shown). For Chp2, we observed a significant PhoA activity in cells expressing Chp2-PhoA on both solid and liquid media, but no increase in fluorescence in bacteria producing Chp2-GFP, compared with the WT or the negative control MmpS4-GFP (Fig. 2, A and B), thus establishing that like PE, the Chp2 protein has its C-terminal domain exposed to the periplasmic space. Our topology studies revealed that the C-terminal domain of PE is located outside of the cytoplasm. To examine whether PE remains attached to the plasma membrane or is released into the bacterial cell wall, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the subcellular fractions of M. smegmatis. The proteomes of four independent cultures of M. smegmatis were split in four subcellular fractions: plasma membrane, culture filtrate (secretome), mycomembrane-containing cell-wall (MMCW), and soluble proteins from cytosol and periplasm. Plasma membrane and MMCW were isolated from the cell lysates by differential ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, as described (18Chiaradia L. Lefebvre C. Parra J. Marcoux J. Burlet-Schiltz O. Etienne G. Tropis M. Daffé M. Dissecting the mycobacterial cell envelope and defining the composition of the native mycomembrane.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28993692): 1280710.1038/s41598-017-12718-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The homogeneity of both membrane fractions has been demonstrated previously, using biochemical markers: arabinose and galactose (arabinogalactan), glucosamine, muramic acid, and diaminopimelic acid (peptidoglycan) as markers of MMCW and NADH oxidase and ATP synthase as markers of the plasma membrane. Only traces of MMCW markers were detected in the plasma membrane fraction, and conversely, very little NADH oxidase activity (3.6% of that measured in the plasma membrane) and no ATP synthase was detected in the MMCW fraction (18Chiaradia L. Lefebvre C. Parra J. Marcoux J. Burlet-Schiltz O. Etienne G. Tropis M. Daffé M. Dissecting the mycobacterial cell envelope and defining the composition of the native mycomembrane.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28993692): 1280710.1038/s41598-017-12718-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After concentration on SDS-PAGE, proteins from each fraction were digested in gel using trypsin. Peptides were then extracted from the gel and analyzed in quadruplicate injections by nano-LC–MS/MS using an Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer. MS data were searched against the Uniprot M. smegmatis mc2155 database for protein identification, and the quantitative comparison of relative protein abundances was performed using MS1-based label-free quantification. This data set contains 3,510 proteins and their relative quantities in the different fractions. We first confirmed the presence of proteins of known subcellular localization in the different fractions and their clustering based on MS signal (see Fig. S2 and Table S2 for the list of marker proteins). The PE protein was not detected in the cytosol or in the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). It was detected with a very good sequence coverage in the MMCW (Fig. 3B). Although its signal was less intense, two specific peptides of PE were identified in the culture filtrate (see Fig. S3 for annotated spectra). Of note, the quantitative data relative to the subcellular specific proteomes generated in this study are available in Table S3. These data constitute an informative resource on the subcellular distribution of M. smegmatis proteins. As mentioned, PE possesses a putative signal sequence with a cleavage site. Therefore, we next examined whether the signal sequence is cleaved and whether the mature protein is exported to the MMCW using biochemical approaches. An HA-tagged PE protein (PE-HA) was expressed in the PMM229 mutant (ΔpE) of M. smegmatis for estimating its relative molecular weight in cells, based on SDS-PAGE migration and Western blotting analysis. Control strains producing either a mutated form of PE (PEΔCS-HA), in which a stretch of amino acids (Ala26–Asp29) surrounding the putative cleavage site has been deleted to interfere with signal peptide removal, or the predicted mature form of PE (mPE-HA, residues 29-383) were used to distinguish between cleaved and uncleaved forms of PE (Fig. 4A). Two protein bands that migrate at positions corresponding to mPE-HA and to the noncleavable PEΔCS-HA variant, respectively, were detected in the cell extract of M. smegmatis expressing PE-HA, indicating that the PE protein underwent partial cleavage in this strain (Fig. 4A). To further establish that PE contains a cleavable signal sequence, its N terminus region with or without the AAA motif and its local peptide environment was fused to the mature form of the Escherichia coli β-lactamase BlaTEM-1 (mBlaT, residues 24-286), generating fusion proteins PE1-25-mBlaT and PE1-30-mBlaT (Fig. 4B). BlaTEM-1 has been used before as a reporter for protein export with Sec and Tat substrates (19McCann J.R. McDonough J.A. Pavelka M.S. Braunstein M. β-Lactamase can function as a reporter of bacterial protein export during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of host cells.Microbiology. 2007; 153 (17906134): 3350-335910.1099/mic.0.2007/008516-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PE1-30-mBlaT and PE1-25-mBlaT were expressed in PMM299, a M. smegmatis mutant lacking the major β-lactamase BlaS (see Fig. S4), and bacteria were tested for susceptibility toward ampicillin using a disk diffusion assay and the broth dilution method for MIC determination. Production of PE1-30-mBlaT in PMM299 restored resistance to ampicillin beyond the WT level (more than 64-fold and 2-fold increases in MIC relative to the PMM299 mutant and the parent strain, respectively). In contrast, production of PE1-25-mBlaT conferred only moderate resistance to ampicillin on both solid and liquid media (2–4-fold increase in MIC compared with the PMM299 mutant) (Fig. 4B). To confirm that the difference we observed between the two proteins reflected a real difference in protein cleavage, we performed Western blotting analysis with an anti-BlaTEM-1 antibody on cell lysates prepared from PMM299 expressing either PE1-30-mBlaT or PE1-25-mBlaT. We found that the two proteins were produced in similar quantities in bacteria (Fig. 4C). In accordance with their calculated molecular weights (CMW), PE1-25-mBlaT (CMW 31.8 kDa) migrated as a single band protein with an apparent molecular mass slightly higher than that of the full-length β-lactamase BlaTEM-1 (CMW 31.6 kDa), confirming that the protein was not processed in PMM299 (Fig. 4C). By contrast, two bands of similar intensity were visible for PE1-30-mBlaT. Their migration on SDS-PAGE was consistent with the CMW of the full-length unprocessed form of the protein (32.3 kDa) and of the mature form of BlaTEM-1 with an additional DDKL amino acid sequence (DDKL-mBlaT, 29.4 kDa) (Fig. 4C). It can thus be concluded that PE1-25-mBlaT remains attached to the plasma membrane due to the lack of signal sequence cleavage, causing a moderate increase in antibiotic resistance, whereas PE1-30-mBlaT undergoes proteolytic processing, leading to mBlaT excretion in the cell envelope and high-level ampicillin resistance. Consistently, expression of BlaTEM-1 proteins with an altered cleavage signal sequence in E. coli confers intermediate-level resistance to ampicillin compared with the WT form of BlaTEM-1 (20Palzkill T.

Altogether, data obtained with the BlaTEM-1 reporter protein, in addition to those obtained with the HA-tagged fusion proteins, confirmed that PE is excreted in the periplasmic compartment or the MMCW of M. smegmatis following signal peptide cleavage. We finally explored whether formation of TPP in M. smegmatis depends on proteolytic cleavage of PE. Strain PMM229 (ΔpE) expressing either PE-HA or PEΔCS-HA (Fig. 4A), as well as the WT and the PMM229 mutant strains, were grown to mid-exponential phase. The cellular and surface-exposed lipid fractions were extracted from each strain and separated by TLC. As reported previously, disruption of pE impaired TPP production and resulted in accumulation of a relatively polar compound that corresponds to the diacyl trehalose precursor of TPP, in both the cellular and surface compartments (5Burbaud S. Laval F. Lemassu A. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Chalut C. Trehalose polyphleates are produced by a glycolipid biosynthetic pathway conserved across phylogenetically distant mycobacteria.Cell Chem.

In this complemented strain, TPP were found in the cellular and surface-exposed lipid fractions, and the intermediate product was undetectable in these lipid fractions. By contrast, PMM229 cells expressing the PEΔCS-HA protein were defective in TPP production and accumulated the precursor in the cellular and surface compartments. These data demonstrate that the PEΔCS-HA protein is unable to catalyze TPP formation, likely because the enzyme is anchored to the plasma membrane and has limited access to its substrate that is mainly located in the outer layers of the cell envelope. We cannot totally rule out that the small deletion present in PEΔCS-HA may affect protein stability. However, amino acid residues surrounding the signal peptidase cleavage motif are located away from the predicted serine hydrolase core domain of PE (residues 90–324) and are probably not required for the correct folding of this domain. Supporting this, it has been shown that the Ala30–Gly359 domain of Chp2, which starts 5 residues after the putative AXA cleavage motif (Fig. 1), displays acyltransferase activity in vitro (12Belardinelli J.M. Larrouy-Maumus G. Jones V. Sorio de Carvalho L.P. McNeil M.R. Jackson M. Biosynthesis and translocation of unsulfated acyltrehaloses in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

In a previous study, we proposed a model for the biosynthesis of TPP, but some steps of this biosynthetic pathway remain poorly characterized, including the one involving the acyltransferase PE (5Burbaud S. Laval F. Lemassu A. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Chalut C. Trehalose polyphleates are produced by a glycolipid biosynthetic pathway conserved across phylogenetically distant mycobacteria.Cell Chem.

Here, we shed new light on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the latter stages of TPP production in M. smegmatis. Based on a series of genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches, we established that (i) the C-terminal domain of PE, and therefore its catalytic domain, resides outside the plasma membrane, (ii) PE is cleaved and excreted in the MMCW, and (iii) proteolytic processing of PE is required for efficient production of TPP in bacteria. These data, in combination with our previous findings, allow us to propose an updated version of the TPP biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 6): the 2,3-diacyltrehalose precursor is synthetized through a series of cytoplasmic steps catalyzed by enzymes encoded by the TPP locus (FadD23, Pks, and PapA3) (5Burbaud S.

The intermediate molecule is then exported to the cell surface, where PE transacylates phleic acids between precursors to yield TPP. Several lines of evidence support this scenario. First, a mmpL10 mutant of M. smegmatis is completely devoid of TPP, indicating that the transacylase reaction depends on the translocation process and likely occurs after this step (5Burbaud S. Laval F. Lemassu A. Daffé M. Guilhot C. Chalut C. Trehalose polyphleates are produced by a glycolipid biosynthetic pathway conserved across phylogenetically distant mycobacteria.Cell Chem.

Second, accumulation of the intermediate product in the surface-exposed lipid fraction of the PMM229 (ΔpE) mutant indicates that this compound is translocated through the plasma membrane by MmpL10 and transferred to the cell surface. Third, we established that only the mature form of PE catalyzes TPP formation, supporting the notion that transacylation takes place in the cell envelope. Presumably, the full-length unpro"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the exosome is composed of a nine-subunit core (Exo9) that contains a heterohexameric ring formed by the subunits Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp43, Rrp45, Rrp46, and Mtr3, and a heterotrimeric “cap” formed by the subunits Rrp4, Rrp40, and Csl4. Although the structure of the exosome core is conserved from archaea to eukaryotes, it has no catalytic activity in the latter (3Januszyk K. Lima C.D. The eukaryotic RNA exosome.Curr. Opin. Struct.

In the canonical pre-rRNA maturation pathway, the RNA exosome complex is responsible for the degradation of the spacer sequence 5'-ETS after cleavage at A0, and for the 3'-5' end processing of 7S pre-rRNA to the mature 5.8S rRNA (Fig. S1A) (8Allmang C.

Mtr4 and the RNA exosome are essential for the ITS2 processing of 7S after cleavage at C2 (18), when the exosome subunit Rrp44 shortens 7S to the intermediate 5.8S + 30, which is then handed over to Rrp6 that trims it to 6S pre-rRNA, which gives rise to the mature 5.8S rRNA after further processing in the cytoplasm (19Fromm L.

We have recently identified the nuclear import mechanisms for Rrp6 and shown that this exclusively nuclear subunit has multiple transport pathways, being bound by the α-importin Srp1 and β-importins Kap95 and Sxm1 (12Gonzales-Zubiate F.A.

To gather more information on the transport of the exosome to the nucleus, we investigated the nuclear import pathway of the other exosome catalytically active subunit, Rrp44, and show here that importins Srp1 (α) and Kap95 (β), respectively, are responsible for this transport, which occurs independently of Rrp6. Furthermore, we show that the exosome complex is highly concentrated in the nucleus, and more specifically in the nucleolus, where pre-rRNA is transcribed and where the early processing reactions take place. One of the essential functions of the exosome in yeast is the processing of pre-rRNA in the nucleus, which underlines the relevance of uncovering the mechanism of nuclear import that allows this protein complex to enter the nucleus. We have previously shown that one of the exosome active subunits, Rrp6, is transported to the nucleus by the karyopherins Srp1/Kap95 or Sxm1 (12Gonzales-Zubiate F.A. Okuda E.K. Da Cunha J.P.C.

Rrp44 has five distinct structural domains: an endonuclease PinC N-terminal domain, two CSD cold shock domains, an essential exoribonuclease domain, RNB, and an RNA-binding domain S1 (6). Based on software analyses (see “Experimental procedures”), we identified the presence of three putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the amino acidic sequence of Rrp44 (named here NLS1, NLS2, and NLS3), each overlapping one of the functional domains, PinC, CSD2, and S1, respectively (Fig. 1).

To explore the importance of each of Rrp44 NLSs for its nuclear import, we constructed plasmids for episomal expression of mutant versions of Rrp44 (Fig. 1). Rrp44 variants were fused to GFP at the N terminus and expressed under control of the MET25 promoter, strongly induced in the absence of methionine. Analysis of the subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy shows that despite being considered a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein (5Dziembowski A. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Séraphin B.

Quantification of different phenotypes is shown in Fig. S3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the subcellular localization of Rrp44 deletion and point mutants showed a variety of phenotypes depending on the presence of any of the putative NLS described above. Rrp44 mutants containing NLS1 in their sequence localized exclusively to the nucleus (Rrp441-985, Rrp441-475, Rrp44R397A,R398T, Rrp44P187A,Y188A) or concentrated in the nucleus, but were also present in the cytoplasm (Rrp44Δ364-407, Rrp44(1-363)(408-985), and Rrp441-218) (Fig. 2). Mutant Rrp441-218 displayed two distinct phenotypes, some of the cells showed the protein concentrated in the nucleus, whereas others showed small cytoplasmic foci, which could correspond to degradation sites (Fig. 2B, Fig. S2). Despite the point mutations in PY-NLS, mutant Rrp44P187A,Y188A still concentrates in the nucleus, indicating that the remaining sequence suffices for importin recognition. Mutants lacking NLS1, although present in the nucleus, showed strong signals in the cytoplasm (Rrp44236-475, Rrp44475-1001). Mutant Rrp44236-475, which contains only NLS2, showed the same phenotype as GFP alone, whereas Rrp44475-1001 was present in cytoplasm, but concentrated in the nucleus in some cells (Fig. 2B). Mutants lacking NLS2, Rrp44Δ364-407, and Rrp44(1-363)(408-985) localized to the nucleus, which could suggest that NLS2 is not important for Rrp44 nuclear import. However, despite being concentrated in the nucleus, these mutants showed detectable signals in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), leading to the suggestion that in the absence of NLS2, Rrp44 is still transported to the nucleus but not very efficiently. Absence of the C-terminal NLS3, on the other hand, does not affect Rrp44 nuclear localization, because both mutants, Rrp441-985 and Rrp441-475, which lack NLS3, localized exclusively to the nucleus, and Rrp44(1-363)(408-985), which lacks NLS2 and NLS3, was concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Based on these results showing that deletion mutants containing NLS1 localize to the nucleus, whereas mutants lacking NLS1 are present in nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2, Fig. S3), we can conclude that the presence of NLS1 plus either NLS2 or NLS3 is sufficient for Rrp44 nuclear localization. Hence, NLS1 would be the most important signal for Rrp44 nuclear import. The expression of these deletion and point mutants of Rrp44 was analyzed by Western blotting of total cell extracts, which shows that most of the mutants are expressed at similar levels in yeast, and the protein bands detected have the expected molecular masses (Fig. 3). The ability of these mutants to complement growth of Δrrp44/GAL::RRP44 cells was tested by expressing the GFP-fused Rrp44 mutants in this conditional strain, growing on galactose or glucose media (expression or depletion of Rrp44, respectively). Toxicity of GFP-Rrp44 variants was evaluated with the expression of WT Rrp44 (galactose) in the presence or absence of methionine for lowering or increasing the expression of the variants, respectively. The results show that point mutants Rrp44R397A,R398T (NLS2 mutant) and Rrp44P187A,Y188A (NLS1 mutant), which localize to the nucleus, fully complement growth of Δrrp44/GAL::RRP44 on glucose, similar to GFP-Rrp44 (Fig. 4). The deletion mutant Rrp441-985, which lacks NLS3, but localizes to the nucleus, also complements growth. These results reinforce those presented above, that the Rrp44 mutants transported to the nucleus are functional. Confirming the results of protein localization, mutants Rrp44Δ364-407 and Rrp44(1-363)(408-985) partially complement growth of Δrrp44/GAL::RRP44 on glucose. Despite being transported to the nucleus, mutants with further deletions in Rrp44 sequence, resulted in nonfunctional proteins (Fig. 4). Interestingly, co-expression of GFP-Rrp44 at high levels (Gal) and functional Rrp44 mutants (-Met) led to slow growth, contrary to what was seen on glucose (Fig. 4). Addition of methionine to the medium alleviates this effect, increasing growth. These results suggest that high levels of Rrp44, combined with high levels of GFP-Rrp44, are deleterious to the cells. Mutant Rrp44364-1001, which showed dominant-negative effects, strongly inhibiting growth in all conditions, and displayed various localization phenotypes (Fig. 4 and data not shown), and mutant Rrp44Δ526-987, which was not detected by Western blotting, were therefore not further analyzed.Figure 4Analysis of growth of conditional strain Δrrp44/GAL::RRP44 expressing Rrp44 mutants. Conditional strain was transformed with plasmids containing the Rrp44 mutants under control of MET25 promoter, and incubated in galactose (expression of WT Rrp44) or glucose (expression of Rrp44 mutants) medium, in the presence or absence of methionine (lower and higher levels of the mutants, respectively). Mutants Rrp44Δ364-407 and Rrp44(1- 363)(408-985) partially complement growth in glucose, whereas Rrp441-985, Rrp44R397A,R398A, and Rrp44P187A,Y188A fully complement growth in glucose, although overexpression of the latter inhibits growth in galactose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These growth complementation results are consistent with the analysis of pre-rRNA processing on glucose, when GFP-tagged Rrp44 variants are expressed in the absence of WT Rrp44. As a control, rRNA processing was analyzed in the presence of WT Rrp44 (galactose). In the absence of Rrp44, 7S rRNA accumulates, without accumulation of detectable 5.8S + 30 species. In the absence of Rrp6, 7S processing by Rrp44 leads to strong accumulation of 5.8S + 30 rRNA (detected with both probes P1 and P2). Point mutants Rrp44P187A,Y188A and Rrp44R397A,R398T fully complement the depletion of WT Rrp44, visualized by the efficient processing of 7S pre-rRNA and formation of mature 5.8S rRNA (Fig. 5 and Fig. S9). Expression of the mutants Rrp441-218 (PIN domain), Rrp44236-475 (CSD1 + CSD2), or Rrp441-475 (PIN + CSD1 + CSD2) leads to processing defects, with accumulation of pre-rRNA 7S and consequent decreased levels of mature 5.8S rRNA. Interestingly, mutant Rrp441-475 accumulates at low level and intermediate very similar to 5.8S + 30, which is a characteristic of strains lacking Rrp6 (Fig. 5). Note that such rRNA species are better detected with P2, which hybridizes to the ITS2 region. In addition to 5.8S + 30, mutants Rrp44Δ364-407 and Rrp44(1-363)(408-985) also accumulate intermediates longer than 5.8S + 30 (Fig. 5). Mutant Rrp44475-1001 (RNB + S1 domains), on the other hand, shows lower levels of pre-rRNA 7S and mature 5.8S (Fig. 5). These results suggest that Rrp44475-1001 may not associate stably with the exosome core, decreasing the efficiency of 7S processing, but may be free to degrade RNAs, leading to the decreased levels of both precursor and mature rRNAs. An overview of the phenotypes of the Rrp44 mutants relative to WT is shown in Fig. S5. To better understand the nuclear import pathway of Rrp44 and identify the karyopherins involved in this process, GFP-Rrp44 was expressed in strains with mutated karyopherin genes, chosen based on the putative NLSs present in the Rrp44 sequence. Deletion mutants of the nonessential karyopherins Sxm1, Kap123, and Kap114 were transformed with a plasmid coding for GFP-Rrp44 and subcellular localization of this protein was analyzed by fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The results show that none of these karyopherins affects Rrp44 localization (Fig. S6 and data not shown). Lowering levels of Srp1 or Kap95 by incubating strains Δsrp1/GAL::SRP1 and Δkap95/GAL::KAP95 on glucose medium, on the other hand, strongly affects GFP-Rrp44 localization, leading to partial mislocalization of this protein to the cytoplasm, despite still being concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 6). These results indicate that Kap95 and Srp1 are the main karyopherins involved in nuclear import of Rrp44. Because Srp1 and Kap95 affected Rrp44 localization, physical interaction between these proteins was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation after expression of GFP-Rrp44 and protein A-tagged karyopherins in yeast. The results show that both A-Srp1 and A-Kap95 co-immunoprecipitate GFP-Rrp44 (Fig. 7A), confirming the interaction between these proteins and the involvement of Srp1 and Kap95 in the nuclear transport of Rrp44. Because the GFP tag alone was also detectable in the elution fractions, to exclude that interaction was due to GFP, an additional experiment was performed, in which extracts from yeast cells expressing GFP or GFP-Rrp44 were incubated with IgG-Sepharose without previous incubation with the karyopherins. After extensive washing, eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, which shows that GFP binds unspecifically the resin with much higher affinity than GFP-Rrp44 (Fig. S4B), accounting for the background binding detected in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7A). These results are in agreement with global protein interaction data that indicated protein complexes containing both Rrp44 and Srp1 (33Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L.

Mutated RAS proteins trigger antiapoptotic and cell-proliferative signals and lead to oncogenesis. However, RAS also induces apoptosis and senescence, which may contribute to the eradication of cells with RAS mutations. We previously reported that Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6) binds MDM2 and stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and that the active form of KRAS promotes the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2. We also reported that Unc-119 lipid-binding chaperone (UNC119A), a chaperone of myristoylated proteins, interacts with RASSF6 and regulates RASSF6-mediated apoptosis. In this study, using several human cancer cell lines, quantitative RT-PCR, RNAi-based gene silencing, and immunoprecipitation/-fluorescence and cell biology assays, we report that UNC119A interacts with the active form of KRAS and that the C-terminal modification of KRAS is required for this interaction. We also noted that the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119A, which binds the myristoylated peptides, is not involved in the interaction. We observed that UNC119A promotes the binding of KRAS to RASSF6, enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2, and induces apoptosis. Conversely, UNC119A silencing promoted soft-agar colony formation, migration, and invasiveness in KRAS-mutated cancer cells. We conclude that UNC119A promotes KRAS-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis via RASSF6 and may play a tumor-suppressive role in cells with KRAS mutations.

Arimoto-Matsuzaki K. Withanage K. Nakagawa K. Kurihara H. Kuroyanagi H. Hata Y. UNC119 is a binding partner of tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 6 and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by MDM2 and p53.Cancer Sci. 2018; 109 (29931788): 2767-278010.1111/cas.13706Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). RASSF6 has a Ras association (RA) domain, binds the GTP-bound form of RAS, and is involved in RAS-mediated apoptosis and senescence (23Allen N.P. Donninger H. Vos M.D. Eckfeld K. Hesson L. Gordon L. Birrer M.J. Latif F. Clark G.J. RASSF6 is a novel member of the RASSF family of tumor suppressors.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17404571): 6203-621110.1038/sj.onc.1210440Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). RASSF6 also has a coiled-coil motif, named the SARAH domain, and interacts with mammalian Ste20-like kinases, the core kinases of the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway (24Ikeda M. Kawata A. Nishikawa M. Tateishi Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakagawa K. Hirabayashi S. Bao Y. Hidaka S. Hirata Y. Hata Y. Hippo pathway-dependent and -independent roles of RASSF6.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2 (19797269): ra5910.1126/scisignal.2000300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we revealed that UNC119A promotes the binding of RASSF6 to MDM2, inhibits the MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, and functions as a tumor suppressor (22Iwasa H. Sarkar A. Shimizu T. Sawada T. Hossain S. Xu X. Maruyama J. Arimoto-Matsuzaki K. Withanage K. Nakagawa K. Kurihara H. Kuroyanagi H. Hata Y. UNC119 is a binding partner of tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 6 and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by MDM2 and p53.Cancer Sci. 2018; 109 (29931788): 2767-278010.1111/cas.13706Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the implication of RAS in the UNC119A-RASSF6-MDM2-p53 axis. We found that UNC119A binds KRAS in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Mutation in the C-terminal cysteine of KRAS abrogates the interaction; however, UNC119A with mutations in the hydrophobic pocket still binds KRAS, suggesting that farnesylated KRAS binds to UNC119A in a different manner than that of the myristoylated proteins. We also demonstrated that UNC119A enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2 via KRAS and promotes the KRAS-induced p53-mediated apoptosis. PDEδ, a KRAS-binding protein, has a hydrophobic pocket into which the farnesylated peptide is inserted. Although PDEδ and UNC119A have similar structures, the residues forming the hydrophobic pockets of PDEδ and UNC119A are only partially conserved. Accordingly, a previous study using fluorescent synthetic peptides revealed that UNC119A binds only the myristoylated peptides and does not interact with the prenylated peptides (25Mejuch T. van Hattum H. Triola G. Jaiswal M. Waldmann H. Specificity of lipoprotein chaperones for the characteristic lipidated structural motifs of their cognate lipoproteins.Chembiochem. 2015; 16 (26503308): 2460-246510.1002/cbic.201500355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, when we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-UNC119 antibody using the lysates of SW480 cells harboring KRASB G12V, KRAS was detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). To further characterize the interaction, we exogenously expressed various FLAG-UNC119 proteins and Myc-KRASB G12V in HEK293FT cells and immunoprecipitated Myc-KRASB G12V. UNC119Aa, UNC119Ab, and UNC119B coimmunoprecipitated with KRASB G12V (Fig. 1B). As the interaction with UNC119Aa was weaker than that with UNC119Ab, we focused on UNC119Ab. UNC119B, which was previously demonstrated not to bind RASSF6, interacted with KRASB G12V (22Iwasa H. Sarkar A. Shimizu T. Sawada T. Hossain S. Xu X. Maruyama J. Arimoto-Matsuzaki K. Withanage K. Nakagawa K. Kurihara H. Kuroyanagi H. Hata Y. UNC119 is a binding partner of tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 6 and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by MDM2 and p53.Cancer Sci. 2018; 109 (29931788): 2767-278010.1111/cas.13706Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that RASSF6 is involved in the interaction between KRASB G12V and UNC119A. Neither RASSF6 silencing nor RASSF6 coexpression had any effects on the interaction between UNC119Ab and KRASB G12V (Fig. S1A and B). Compared with the WT KRASA and KRASB, the active mutants, KRASA G12V and KRASB G12V, interacted with UNC119Ab more efficiently, but the negative mutant, KRASB S17N, did not (Fig. 1C). This is in stark contrast to PDEδ, which does not recognize the GTPase switch region and interacts with RAS, independent of the GTP/GDP-bound state (6Nancy V. Callebaut I. El Marjou A. de Gunzburg J. The delta subunit of retinal rod cGMP phosphodiesterase regulates the membrane association of Ras and Rap GTPases.J. Biol.

Biol. 2011; 7 (22002721): 942-94910.1038/nchembio.686Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Among RAS-related proteins, HRAS and NRAS also interacted with UNC119Ab, whereas RAP1B did not (Fig. 1D). To characterize the difference between KRASB and RAP1B, we prepared chimeric constructs (Fig. 2A). The chimeric proteins, KRASB G12V(1–63)/RAP1B(64–184), KRASB G12V(1–76)/RAP1B(77–184) and KRASB G12V(1–86)/RAP1B(87–184), could bind to UNC119Ab, whereas KRASB G12V(1–60)/RAP1B(61–184) did not (Fig. 2B). This result implies that the N-terminal region of KRASB covering 63 residues is involved in the interaction. In this regard, UNC119Ab is different from PDEδ, which binds only the C-terminal region of KRAS (28Dharmaiah S. Bindu L. Tran T.H. Gillette W.K. Frank P.H. Ghirlando R. Nissley D.V. Esposito D. McCormick F. Stephen A.G. Simanshu D.K. Structural basis of recognition of farnesylated and methylated KRAS4b by PDEδ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2016; 113 (27791178): E6766-E677510.1073/pnas.1615316113Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of KRASB undergoes farnesylation at Cys185, followed by the removal of 3 amino acids and carboxymethylation (29Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Marshall C.J. Methylation and proteolysis are essential for efficient membrane binding of prenylated p21K-ras(B).EMBO J. 1991; 10 (2001678): 641-64610.1002/j.1460-2075.1991.tb07992.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). KRASA is similarly modified but is additionally palmitoylated at Cys180 (30Kaplan J.B. Sass P.M. Post-translational processing of purified human K-ras in Xenopus oocytes.Cancer Commun. 1991; 3 (16296004): 383-38810.3727/095535491820873704Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As we expected that UNC119Ab would bind KRAS independently of the C-terminal modification, we examined the interaction of UNC119Ab with KRASB G12V C185S, which does not undergo farnesylation and subsequent modification (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, KRASB G12V C185S did not bind to UNC119Ab (Fig. 2C). Similarly, KRASA G12V C186S did not bind to UNC119Ab, whereas KRASA G12V C180S did (Fig. 2D). Moreover, atorvastatin, which suppresses farnesylation, attenuated the binding of KRAS G12V to UNC119Ab (Fig. 2E). Hence, the C-terminal modification of KRASB is required for the interaction with UNC119Ab. To exclude the possibility that UNC119Ab binds KRASB via PDEδ, we knocked down PDE6D and confirmed that the interaction between UNC119Ab and KRASB was not suppressed (Fig. S1C). We next analyzed the KRAS-binding region of UNC119Ab. UNC119A has 2 beta sheets composed of 9 beta strands (12Zhang H. Constantine R. Vorobiev S. Chen Y. Seetharaman J. Huang Y.J. Xiao R. Montelione G.T. Gerstner C.D. Davis M.W. Inana G. Whitby F.G. Jorgensen E.M. Hill C.P. Tong L. et al.UNC119 is required for G protein trafficking in sensory neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 (21642972): 874-88010.1038/nn.2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similar to KRAS, ARL3 interacts with UNC119A depending on the GTP-GDP state. A previous study suggested that the switch I region of ARL3 binds to Lys92 and Arg94, whereas the interswitch region and switch II region bind to the residues between Phe179 and Asp195, which cover the 7th beta strand. We mutated Lys92/Arg94 to alanine and Phe177/Phe179/Phe181 to aspartic acid in UNC119Ab (UNC119Ab K92/R94A and UNC119Ab F177/F179/F181D). The latter mutation decreased the interaction, whereas the former had no effect (Fig. 3A and B, arrow). We also mutated Tyr137/Tyr194/Phe196 to aspartic acid (UNC119Ab Y137/Y194/F196D). Although these residues are important in forming the hydrophobic pocket, the mutant could bind KRASB G12V (Fig. 3C). To exclude the possibility that these mutations have undesired consequences, we confirmed that there was no change in the stabilities of UNC119Ab F177/F179/F181D and UNC119Ab Y137/Y194/F198D and that these proteins interacted with RASSF6 as well as the WT of UNC119Ab (Fig. S2). UNC119A interacts with myristoylated tyrosine kinases, such as ABL1 and SRC. During this study, we found that UNC119Ab is tyrosine phosphorylated by ABL1 and SRC. UNC119Ab has 5 tyrosine residues. To determine which residue is phosphorylated, we prepared 5 mutants in which each tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine. We found that only UNC119Ab Y194F was not phosphorylated (Fig. S3A, arrow). We hypothesized that if the hydrophobic pocket is important for the interaction, phosphorylation of Tyr194 should attenuate the interaction. We coexpressed FLAG-tagged UNC119Ab and Myc-tagged KRASB G12V with N terminus-truncated ABL1b (ABL1b del N), which is more active than the full-length ABL1b, and performed immunoprecipitation analysis. ABL1b-del N did not weaken but rather strengthened the interaction (Fig. S3B, left). SRC similarly enhanced the interaction (Fig. S3B, right). The immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody confirmed that tyrosine-phosphorylated UNC119Ab coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. S3B, P-Tyr, arrows). The above findings support the notion that the C terminus of KRASB is involved in the interaction but binds to a region other than the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119Ab. Because of the observed requirement of the C-terminal modification of KRASB, we considered the possibility that the membrane anchoring of KRASB is a prerequisite for the interaction with UNC119Ab. To address this question, we fused the N-terminal sequence of PSD-95, which is palmitoylated, to KRASB G12V C185S (Palm-Myc-KRASB G12V C185S) (31Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. N-terminal palmitoylation of PSD-95 regulates association with cell membranes and interaction with K+ channel Kv1.4.Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-13410.1016/S0896-6273(00)80440-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We also prepared Myr-GFP-KRASB G12V C185S with the mouse Lck-derived myristoylation signal sequence at the N terminus. Both Palm-Myc-KRASB G12V C185S and Myr-GFP-KRASB G12V C185S were recovered in the membrane fraction, whereas Myc-KRASB G12V C185S was exclusively detected in the soluble fraction (Fig. S4, A and B). However, as shown by the immunofluorescence analysis, Myr-GFP-KRASB G12V C185S and Palm-Myc-KRASB G12V C185S were differentially distributed. The former was accumulated on the plasma membrane, whereas the latter was not (Fig. S4C). As shown in the immunoprecipitation analysis, UNC119Ab could bind Myr-GFP-KRASB G12V C185S but not Palm-Myc-KRASB G12V C185S (Fig. 4, A and B, arrow). Control myristoylated-GFP did not bind to UNC119Ab. Myristoylated-GFP-KRASB G12V C185S could bind to UNC119Ab Y137/Y194/F196D (Fig. 4C). Hence, the possibility that the myristoylated N terminus artificially fits into the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119Ab can be excluded. These findings suggest that the plasma membrane localization is important for the interaction between KRAS and UNC119Ab. As shown in Fig. S1, RASSF6 had no effect on the interaction between UNC119Ab and KRASB G12V. As a reverse experiment, we examined the effect of UNC119A silencing and UNC119Ab coexpression on the interaction between RASSF6 and KRASB G12V. UNC119A silencing attenuated the interaction (Fig. 5A, arrows), whereas UNC119Ab coexpression enhanced it (Fig. 5B, arrow). UNC119A silencing also abolished the interaction between KRASB WT and RASSF6 (Fig. S5A). UNC119Ab coexpression augmented the interaction between RASSF6 and KRASB WT (Fig. S5B). However, UNC119A silencing had no effect on the interaction between KRASB G12V and RAF1 (Fig. S5C). As shown in Fig. S3, ABL1 and SRC enhanced the binding of KRASB G12V to UNC119Ab. Consistent with this, KRASB G12V did not bind to UNC119Ab Y194F as efficiently as UNC119Ab (Fig. S6A). UNC119Ab Y194F did not enhance the interaction between RASSF6 and KRAS G12V as much as UNC119Ab, although UNC119Ab and UNC119Ab Y194F interacted with RASSF6 with similar affinity (Fig. S6B and C). This means that when KRASB does not bind to UNC119A, the interaction between KRASB and RASSF6 is compromised. We next tested the possibility that RASSF6 indirectly associates with KRAS via UNC119A. We depleted UNC119A in SW480 cells using CRISPR/Cas9. KRAS coimmunoprecipitated with RASSF6 from UNC119A-depleted cells, supporting the idea that although UNC119A enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and KRAS, RASSF6 can interact with KRAS independently of UNC119A (Fig. S7). We previously reported that UNC119A promotes the binding of RASSF6 to MDM2 (22Iwasa H. Sarkar A. Shimizu T. Sawada T. Hossain S. Xu X. Maruyama J. Arimoto-Matsuzaki K. Withanage K. Nakagawa K. Kurihara H. Kuroyanagi H. Hata Y. UNC119 is a binding partner of tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 6 and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by MDM2 and p53.Cancer Sci. 2018; 109 (29931788): 2767-278010.1111/cas.13706Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We also reported that the RA domain of RASSF6 binds to MDM2 and triggers apoptosis by stabilizing p53 (32Sarkar A. Iwasa H. Hossain S. Xu X. Sawada T. Shimizu T. Maruyama J. Arimoto-Matsuzaki K. Hata Y. Domain analysis of Ras-association domain family member 6 upon interaction with MDM2.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591 (28054709): 260-27210.1002/1873-3468.12551Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The binding of the RA domain to MDM2 is intramolecularly inhibited by the SARAH domain, and KRASB eliminates this inhibition (32Sarkar A. Iwasa H. Hossain S. Xu X. Sawada T. Shimizu T. Maruyama J. Arimoto-Matsuzaki K. Hata Y. Domain analysis of Ras-association domain family member 6 upon interaction with MDM2.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591 (28054709): 260-27210.1002/1873-3468.12551Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, we surmised that UNC119Ab promotes the binding of RASSF6 to MDM2 via KRAS. As expected, UNC119Ab failed to enhance RASSF6-MDM2 interaction under KRAS silencing in HEK293FT cells (Fig. 5C, white arrow). We also performed the same experiment in SW480 cells harboring KRASB G12V and obtained similar results (Fig. 5D). These findings imply that UNC119Ab promotes the binding of KRASB G12V to RASSF6, subsequently augmenting the binding of RASSF6 to MDM2. The nuclear export of MDM2 is required for the nuclear export of p53, as shown in HeLa cells (33Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the hdm2 oncoprotein regulates the levels of the p53 protein via a pathway used by the human immunodeficiency virus rev protein.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (9430646): 554-56410.1093/emboj/17.2.554Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In osteosarcoma SJSA, breast cancer MCF-7, and neuroblastoma cells, leptomycin B treatment or the masking of the nuclear export signal (NES) of p53 stabilized p53, indicating that p53 is not degraded unless it is exported to the cytoplasm (34Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Nuclear export is required for degradation of endogenous p53 by MDM2 and human papillomavirus E6.Mol. Cell.

Consistent with this, the NES mutant of MDM2, which cannot export p53 to the cytoplasm, could not induce p53 degradation (33Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J.

This implies that MDM2 export antagonizes p53 si"
