https://openalex.org/W2081951380,"THE results of present studies directed towards the solution of the ion chemistry of the ionospheric D-region have interesting implications for the lower atmosphere as well. A major ion product of air ionization is NO+, which is a “terminal” ion because of its low energy content. Reactions which produce NO+ are1 These reactions cause NO+ to be a dominant ion in the regions of the Earth's ionosphere where neutral NO is a minor constituent. The reaction is exothermic, and while known to be slow1, may still be of significance where N2 densities are very high. The N2+ produced in air rapidly produces O2+ by charge-transfer Finally, it is known2,3 that all of the atmospheric ions, N+, N2+, O+, O2+ and NO2+, charge transfer rapidly to NO to produce NO+. Thus a large fraction of the positive ions produced in an atmospheric ionization event, such as a lightning stroke, can be expected to lead to NO+ production."

https://openalex.org/W2027723442,"ON September 19–20 the Beerenberg volcano on Jan Mayen Island in the Norwegian Sea (71° N, 8°–9° W) became reactivated after being dormant for several hundred years, perhaps thousands of years. Reports by whalers at sea of activity on the southern slope of the volcano in 1732 and 1818 have been subject to doubt. But steam and carbon dioxide occur in fractures, and earthquakes are common."
https://openalex.org/W2023620403,"THE possibility of a relationship between the periods of the sunspot cycle and the periods of the rotation of the planets has been investigated by several authors1–5. Such an interaction could be mediated by non-linear processes of gravitational wave conversion of the type which may, for example, be responsible for the acceleration of the equator of the Sun6,7. On the face of things, the most likely relationship should be that between the sunspot cycle and the period of rotation of Jupiter, gravitationally the dominant planet, but non-linear may imply that cross modulation products representing the combined effects of two or more planets may be the most easily recognizable."
